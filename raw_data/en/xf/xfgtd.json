Related aspects include production opportunities and constraints as reflected in land resource access, tenure regimes, use and explo itation rights, input cost and availability , land use dynamics , management, rural prosperity and social justice. Boundary conditions discussed include the existing legal and informal land use controls and incentive s that shape land use dynamics in the Repu blic of Indonesia , and the policy effects on the distribution of associated benefits for and impacts on its people. Agricultural development is one of the most vital agendas of the new SBY administration. New RI policy priorities identified include food s ecurity, regional food self-sufficiency, improving agricultural productivity, strengthening intra -sectoral linkages, imp roving rural incomes, evaluation of subsidies, and fairness i n international trade . With the dominance of land -less and small -scale farm ing, agrarian reform is a critical element in addressing these policy objectives. This will require a focused and dedicated policy initiative that not only address es land access and security but also input and pricing policies that are effective in improvi ng the economic viability of small -scale farms . Price scenarios that benefit producers have to be combined with increases in productivity to improve rural incomes, post -harvest processing and marketing. In this process, the role and capacity of agricultura l extension in improving farm management by providing effective technical assistance, is also essential. To foster economically viable and environmentally sustainable national land polic ies, this document encourages the development of a long -term, transp arent, hierarchical, pro - active and enforceable land use planning framework . Its implementation is based on the cost-effective mobilization of natural assets and their sustainable production capacity to generate natural resource goods and services. This w ill require , foremost a consolidation , harmonization and refocusing of exi sting laws and re gulations to mobilize latent production opportunities and target land use (re) development and restrictions, including the use of effective land use controls, incentiv es and taxation. Such land use planning is the precondition to the establishment of a viable rural economic development program that seeks to optimize production opportunities, promote rural prosperity and reduces environmental impact s and risk. The Nati onal Land Agency (BPN) , in close cooperation with the National Development Planning Agency ( BAPPENAS ), is well-positioned to provide land policy leadership in this effort . Its Land Affairs programs address various aspects of ownership and use rights, confl icts management, land use dynamics and access. By incorporating a systematic Spatial Planning P rogram with input from , and in partnership with , other relevant government agencies (using the appropriate National Spatial Data Information Infrastructure) , aggregate economic sector preferences can be related to spatial priorities 13 at the national, provi ncial and local (regency) level. This will provide the essential elements of provincial and local land use plans that are designed to optimize land use benefits , given natural resource production opportunities and needs, while reducing resource degradation and protecting the envir onment . This specifically should include the prevention of further degradation of land and water resources to safeguard the well -being of future generations, and preserve the remaining biodiversity that not only make s Indonesia unique, but also provides enormous ecotourism and pharmaceutical potential. In Indonesia, Agrarian Reform is defined as Land Reform (LR) + Acces s Reform (AR). The first component deals with the aspects of land availability, tenure, title security and use rights, while the latte r addresses the factors affectin g land produ ctivity , input availability, cost and economic viability (net return s per hectare ). The economic viability relate s to land qualities - as defined in agro -ecological production capacity, combined with land suitability - when specific land use options are evaluated in term of input cost and product prices, denoting potential net returns. To make real a grarian reform a possibility, i t is recommended that a systematic land evaluation ( land suitability assessment using biophysical and socioeconomic land use criteria) be conducted to : (1) Facilitate the development of national -level, macro -sectoral priori ties and define a 10-year economic development plan that include s the formulation and clear articulation of sector and policy priorities (agriculture, forestry, tourism, fisheries, economic development, growth management, population control, housing, manu facturing, physical and service infrastructure, resource extraction , environment al management , etc.) and resulting spatial linkages with national land use zoning based on an objective assessment of regional comparative advantage s; (2) Formulate Provincia l Master Land Use Plans to further detail and spatially identify sectoral priorities and priority zones at the provincial level ; and finally (3) Develop Local or Regency Land Use Master Plans and Legal ly Enforceable Zoning Ordinances to clearly define development (type and intensity ), land conservation and preservation zones and priorities, while using land evaluatio n and sustainability criteria to translate dev elopment concepts into reality . Such hierarchical land use planning framew ork is mutually re inforcing by linking national priorities -- guided by well-defined resource asset s potential (e.g. agro -ecological and environmental suitability consideration s and economic land evaluation ) -- to provincial an d local land use priorities , spatially -defined . This formulation of provincial and regency plans should also include legally mandated government and public planning review s (with various stakeholder inputs and procedures ) and permitting process es (transparent and objective reviews of development, conce ssions and building permits) that ensure that provincia l and local land use plans reflect , reinforce and detail respectively , national and pro vincial priorities , at the level s of implementation. 14 Within this Spatial Planning framework, the following major Action R ecommendations (100 days, 1 - 5 year s) are sug gested : A formal integration of current inter -agency spatial planning functions (such as held by BPN, BAPPENAS , the Ministry if Public Works , the national mapping agency and the variou s natural resourc es ministries - such as agriculture, forestry and environment , within a multi -agency task force to prioritize , articulate and direct programmatic initiatives with the ultimate goal to formulate a 10-year National Spatial Economic Development P lan (100 days - 2 years, respectively ). This process would include a review and updating of existing regional spatial master plans (using up -to-date information) to ensure consistency with national priorities and adjacent regions. Accelerate the consolidation and res tructuring of land policy laws to harmonize and clarify sectoral, national, regional and local mandates and legal authorities for spa tial planning and responsibilities for developing 10-year national and 5- year Regional and Local Land Use Master Plans and their local implementation in the form legal ordinances , and consistent w ith regional and national plans (1-2 years ). This should include the clarification and promulgation of pertinent regulations and certification of land titles (e.g. hak mali k) and perm anent use rights to individuals and companies , ideally to be simplified and restructured into freehold and leasehold regimes. Accelerate land registration programs by institutional capacity development and reducing impediment s to registration , including the lowering (payment capacity consideration) or elimination of initial registration fees . This should include a streamlining of the land registration system and reduction of transaction cost in digital form and consolidation with tax re cords to assure fut ure tax assessment and enhance tax revenues that will more than off -set registration subsidies Consider the formalization of community land holdings (land security in adat communities) together with private land titles based on long -term security interest to help mobilize assets, capital and investments and latent productivity. Permit the formal conveyance of land titles that are long-term limited and renewable using objective and transparent selection criteria and procedures. Clarify Public Legal Authori ty to take private property for the public good (\"eminent domain\") while providing for transparent and impartial public review, appeal procedures and just compensation at fair market values as determined by independent arbitration. (1 year) Establish a mu lti-agency Land Asset Identification Task Force with the major responsibility to conduct a systematic, accurate and complete inven tory of available land for distribution in targeted (population need -based , see below ) areas. This inventory should include bi o-physical aspects of land quality and agricultural productivity ratings under irrigated and rain -fed conditions, and result 15 in the establishment of Regional L and Banks. Land availability and selection criteria will reflect the legally defined categories, such as idle, excess and absentee -land held by private a nd public entities, including the currently 7 million hectares already identified by BPN (1-2 years) Establish a multi -agency Land Access Mobilization Task Force with the major responsibility to mobi lize latent land productivity by ensuring secure access to land (title security and insurance) and the cost -effective availability of micro - capital and material inputs for small -scale landowners, technical assistance for farm management, cooperative ventu res, product and value -chain development. (1-2 years) Establish a multi -agency Needs Assessment Task Force with the major goal to identify priority recipient areas for land distribution based on clear legal beneficiary criteria and regional land bank avai lability. Ensure that criteria are well-articulated, understood and implemented in a n objective and transparent manner in regional land distribution programs. (1 year) Establishment a multi -agency Land Information System Task Force with the major goal to develop an integrated Spatial Information System that includes complete and current property and parcel tax records, and parcel survey data linked by ownership ID # to facilitate land valuation, taxation, collec tion, land management, property transactions and title registration. This system should be networked (with security protocols) with national, regional and local offices an d compatible with land cover/use and land evaluation data, including topography, soils, hydrology, climate and population data. (5 year) Establish a Land Tenure and Administration Task Force with the responsibility to define the most appropriate land tenure and use rights reg imes in non -traditional and adat communities with the goal to define and ensure long -term individual use rights, promote sustainable use and prevent land speculation and resource exploitation, while reducing environmental impacts and human risk. This should include a pilot program to identify the optimum regional parameters for homestead garden or \"Pekarangan\" systems representin g small household farming systems as supplemental income and nutrition sources based on land use that integrates of agro -forestry, live stock and fisheries (1 - 5 year) Establish a Land Conflict Management Task Force with the goal to review, reduce and mitigate land conflict s by improving management and resolution practices and recommend procedures to ensure public accountability , and the impartial and transparen t implementation of the rule of law . This should include evidentiary standard s for land and title identification and clear standards and rules for land claims (on-going) Expand existing cooperation in human resource and institutional capacity development such as currently existing with Swedish, Dutch, Australian and US 16 academic an d professional institutions related to land policy analysis and formulation, land information system design and management, and economic development planning though post -graduate training an short courses. (on -going) To attract foreign investments, consid er openly and selectively allowing and stimulating foreign property ownership, now frequently accomplished by the use of shell companies or nominees that result in higher transaction cost, uncert ainty and restrict investments. To reduce corruption and co llusion in land affairs, c larify and streamline all land allocation criteria and procedures for land distribution, certification, acquisition, and transformation (and rezoning) of interest in land by providing regulatory transparency, on -line public record s with land and tax information, and provide due process (fundamental principles of justice) for public review and appeal . 17 A CHALLENGING OPPORT UNITY With the advent of the newly inaugurated administration of the Republic of Indonesia in the fall of 2009, Land Policy and Economic Development enters into a new era of challenges and opportunities. Challenges are many. They include the traditional socio -economic, cultural and political challenges, but also the various needs for legisla tive and executive r eform. These challenges come with a n even greater set of opportunities; to mobilize the enormous and diverse natural assets of the nation and create a better quality of life for all, while recognizing environmental carrying capacity constraints, and thereb y ensuring a prosperous futur e for its citizens Therefore, t he overarchin g framework is the paradigm of sustainable development --integrating natural resources capital with economic and social capital, to define and select land use alternatives that are so cio-economically viable and acceptable, while preserving ecological integrity and product ivity. The overall goal of such a strategic planning initiative is to create solutions that are ecologically restorative and socially just, and that promo te a reliably prosperous society, long -term. The staff of the various key government agencies referred to in this document are instrumental in meeting these challenges : the formal responsibility, as envisioned in the tasks of talented professional s to achieve these go als with commitment and dedication within their institutional mandates; and the informal intergenerational responsibility, shared by many in Indonesian society , namely to fashion a sustainable and equi table future for its people.

It s primary goal is to encourage productive and sustainable land use s that enhance benefits and societal prosperity. As such, it encompasses various policy components. They include: Natural resources assessment to define the sustainable production capacity of the land resource base -- the complex of resources assets available for the production of food and cash crop s and the provision of other goods and services , based on the long- term agro -ecological capacity to sustain production opportunities . Land use planning and zoning to promote economic development -- the development of guidelines and regulations to allocate land resources to sustainable land uses that are socio -econom ically viable and environmentally acceptable ( and in harmony with the long -term agro -ecological production capacity) Land policy reform by restructuring land policies and laws to optimize tenure regimes and land rights to promote sustainable use , social eq uity and prosperity -- the utilization of the land resource base to promote the optimum allocation of human, capital and land resources to promote household and societal welfare Access reform to improve the conditions of land resource allocation in combin ation with fixed and variable capital inputs, transportation, processing and marketing infrastructure to maximize profitability. For national agencies , such as BPN and BAPPENAS to carry out this mandate in cooperating with sector partners such as the Mini stries of Agriculture and Forestry , a comprehensive and systematic program design is required together with a sustained and effective implementation capacity . This not only requires the institutional capacity to carry out suc h responsibilities but also monitoring and eva luation to assess program effectiveness and assure the timely attainment of goals and objectives using key performance indicators. 19 This report addresses the components listed above with respect to the strategic and programmatic initiatives. First, it introduces highly -relevant concepts, analytical procedures , guidelines and essential survey and information systems capabilities for land use planning, policy formulation and development planning. Then, it addresses specific agrarian reform issue s related to the mandates of BPN and partner institutions. As such, the report also includes: a) A review of existing RI policies affecting agrarian reform issues based on literature study, field research, and personal discussion s, in parti cular relevant nation al policies associated agricultural sector policies. It also suggests cross -institutional cooperation relate d to land policy. T he analysis provides a review of the major policies affecting land use and land use conflicts, while suggesting future poli cy directions ; b) A comparative perspective on land policy and land use planning with model regulatory framework s from other countries, such as the Netherlands and New Zealand , is provided . It is expected that these example may be used to help to ultimate ly structure a long -term regulatory framework that seeks to establish economically viable and environmentally acceptable land use at the national, regional and local level s; and c) Suggested strategic initiatives and actions to address key issues/ problems related to land policy and agrarian reform (with an executive summary). The research framework -- the context of land management and land use planning, includes the legal and economic development dimensions of relevant land policy issues and strategic ini tiatives, associated with an effective agrarian reform program. Emphasis is placed on program guidelines, operational characteristics and potential benefits of an outcome -oriented agrarian reform program, including the reduction or elimination of implement ation constraints. Case studies were completed by reviewing the most significant Agrarian reform projects recently conducted by BPN , such as on S outh Sulawesi, Lampung and locations on Java (Appendix H) using interviews with stakeholders and BPN staff gu ided by questions identified in Appendix I 20 The i mplied objectives of an agrarian reform program in the RI include: improved social wellbeing of the rural poor and disenfranchised - including improved income, employment, nutrition and social status reduced social inequity as manifested in improved land access, control and title security , use rights, income distribution, education opportunities, health care and other public services increasing productivity of idle or underutilized land formalization of owner ship and use rights through accelerated, transparent and cost-effective land certification reduction of legal ambiguity and duplicity through review, harmonization and consolidation of land laws, regulations, and associated implementation and institutional mandates reduction of land disputes and conflicts through effective, transparent and objective title certification and arbitration the mobilization of latent capital assets in land holdings through ownership formalization to stimulate capital access, productivity and regional economic development improved collateral leverage to reduce interest rate s on farm loans to secure operating capital and finance capital improvements increased land productivity for food and cash crops and related import - substitution opportunities including the benefits of potential value chains associated with small -scale, cooperative fruits and vegetable production increased tax revenues for rural infrastructural improvement resulting from improved productivity and land administrati on agro-ecological zoning , land suitability assessment and spatial planning to articulate economic development guidelines based on land evaluation improved spatial data management and analysis capacities to generate comprehensive, accurate, net -worked, se cure and timely information accelerated, long -term economic growth based on sustainable land management and conservation practices reduced social unrest , and 21 improved political stability improved administrative capacity and effectiveness of key agencies, such as BPN and BAPPENAS through human resource and infrastructural development, including integrated cadastral and Land Information Systems (LIS). 1.1 Scope and Objectives of this Report This land policy adviso ry note seeks to assist the BPN in develop ing policies, strategies and program proposal to (a) foster a proposed Agrarian R eform program; and (b) develop a suitable Land Info rmation System. The a ssistance provides advice on the following: a. Sharpening the land policy focus towards a more detail fo rmulation of approaches for implementing policies, strategies, impact and risk analyses, and develop a program proposal to strengthen agrarian reform and economic development ; b. Initiating pilot activities related to land policy implementation ; c. Planning and implem enting capacity building to strengthen NLA -RI institution al capabilities in above area s. Analytical elements include : a. Analysis of existing RI policies affecting agrarian reform issues, in particular national land policies, directly -related sector p olicies, and required cross -institutional cooperation; b. A review of current status and policies directions for the future; c. Assistance to BPN in for mulating a coherent and comprehensive guidelines and strategies for implementing the agrarian reform policy, i n line with BPN and o ther GOI's institution al mandates and principles, and in coordination with BPN management and senior officials and with outside stakeholders as identified and invited by BPN; d. Assistance to BPN to develop an operationa l proposal for a related BPN Strategic Plan and Land Information System (LIS) in particular on agrarian reform ( in line with broader LIS design). This task has to be linked to broader monitoring and evaluation (M&E) required for the agrarian reform and established li nkages in data -base management; e. Support to plan, implement and manage capacity building progr ams, in coordination with BPN , to strengthen technical capacity in related area s of expertise . The capacity building reflects policy analyses, exchange of experien ces and M&E. Outputs include: a. This analytical policy note based on a comprehensives review as indicated abov e. 22 b. Draft guidelines and strategies to support implementation o f an agrarian reform program, including aspect s of monito ring and management strate gies along with a list of suggested key activities/programs; c. Proposed capacit y building to develop a core team in NLA -RI capable of guiding agrarian reform efforts. 1.2 Development Planning and Quality of Life - Demand and Supply Considerations The prima ry goal of development planning is to improve the quality -of-life of human populations by means of a systematic evaluation, selection and implementation of sustainable development alternatives (the so -called Land Utilization Types of LUTs) that reflect bot h environmental constraints and opportunities. Here, sustainable development means the promotion of development po licies and plans with carefully -defined goals and objectives that aim to achieve a sustainable flow of goods and services that enhance human q uality -of-life. More precisely, sustainable development must ensure that public policies are based on the selection of development alternatives that are both ecologically and politically sustainable and socio -economically viable . As such, sustainable devel opment addresses the development and management of environmental resources to ensure or enhance the long -term productive capacity of the resource base with the goal to improve lon g-term societal wealth and individual quality -of-life. A primary challenge in this public policy formulation process is to balance the environme ntal capacity (production rates ) and the derived supply of natural resource goods and services with demographic demand and, thereby, ensuring that sustainable producti on capacitie s are not exceeded, and natural resources degradation is prevented. In a policy analysis context, determining supply means a systematic assessment of the resource production capacities by location and over time. This assessment must result in quantitative indica tors, which directly reflect expected resource production outputs (complex goods and services) using production scenarios based on the long-term production capacity and environmental quali ty of the natural resources. Demographic or societal demand needs t o reflect to the available supply of natural resource and its performance - its capacity to deliver good s and services, specifically the ability to affect 23 quality of life by creating a better place to live -- more capable, productive and efficient in meeti ng human needs. The notion of developing comprehensive policies that promote sustainable use of natural resources, maintain resource production capacity and prevent resource degradation was adopted by various UN conferences and supported by many internat ional development agencies. This is especially critically important to nations wit h lesser discretionary income to meet national demand with the import of essential food commodities or other natural resource products. For these nations, t his translates int o policies that prevent declining production capacity or reverse trends in environmental degradation, there by preventing spiraling effects of economic decline, as depicted be low (Figure 1.1) . On the demand side , concerns about population growth and its im pacts were not only expressed at the aggregate national levels but also in terms of population distribution and dispersion. High population growth concentrated in metropolitan areas has, in many nations, caused crises of food security and deteriorating con ditions in urban agglomerations where rapid population increases and service demands have outpaced even the most basic infrastructural needs, such as a safe drinking water supply, sewage disposal and treatment, and general education and health care facilit ies. Fundamentally, quality of life must reflect the continuum of basic human needs to health risks, environmental quality and resource amenities. A great number of factors affect natural resources production supply and demographic demand. Some of the ba sic factors are identified below (Figure 1.2). Because the natural endowment and its capacity to produce goods an services is limited -- especially when realistically considering environmental impacts and resource scarcity, nationally and globally, the fun damental need arises to address the notion of national and regional carrying capacities. The fundamental question s for the Republic of Indonesia is : which level of population growth can be sustained long -term without compromising long -term health, public r isk, and the environmental quality (water, air, watershed condition, biodiversity, etc.) on which those conditions depend ? Which near -term legacy will current generations leave behind? 24 Gradual change Cyclic change Lack of Balancing (National and Regional) Natural Resources Supply and Demand in Public Policy Figure 1.1 - Impacts of environmental stress and degradation on natural resource production capacity, social equity and security.

With the current population growth rate , distribution and concentrations , this is a serious question for the n ew RI administration to consider - and will form the basis for successful long-term public policies that realistically consider sustainable growth , societal prosperit y and social equity and justice . 1.3 Integrated Rural Development Planning and Sustai nable Land Policies Within the range of public policy concerns, environmental impacts are increasingly viewed as a fundamenta l trade -off to economic growth, especially in rapid industrializing nations, such as the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) ec onomies. Similar questions concerns arise in Indonesia. This perspective is not necessarily correct. The fundamental issue is not to restrict economic growth and thereby reduce environmental pollution, but to make inform ed public choices about the type of economic growth to promote, under which circumstances, at which locations, with what environmental controls , and which negative impacts to accept. In an agrarian reform program that seeks to restructure production efficiencies and improve rural welfare , this also means making informed choices about which land utilization type s (variation s of farming and cropping system) to select and matching sustainable land production capabilities with crop requirements . It means conducting land suitability studies th at consider both production capacities and economic viability using clearly defined input -output scenarios . This may include the con tinuum from small -scale, labor intensive, locally -adapted , \"farms \" with nutrient recycling in densely -populated areas domina ted by highly productive soils (providing marginal farming household s with calories , cash and nutritional value ) to large -scale cash crop plantation s with higher capital input s, including capital expenditures for mechanization 27 and processing, and located a t more distant locations from rura l communities, possibly on lesser -productive marginal soils. Such approach would require the demarcation and promotion of small -scale village agricultural zones and large -scale plantation zones in the context of regional d evelopment plans. The fundamental linkages outlined below (Figure 1.3) may be used to sch ematically outline these evaluation linkages as describe above , and in the context of sustainable policy analysis and regional planning . Figure 1.3 - Fundamental Linkages and Effects among Natural Resour ces, Quality of Life and Public Policies associated with the Use of Natural Resources The systematic evaluation of natural resource production opportunities and potential opportunities for creating rural prosperity , while considering environmental equality QUALITY OF LIFE: HUMAN DEMAND, CONSUMPTIVE USES AND IMPACTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY: PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS: QUALITY AND COSTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES PUBLIC POLICY: LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES 28 implications, are fundamental in this public policy analysis. An example of such debate can be found in the expanding and integrating European Community (EC) , where policy initiatives address agricultural management practices and environmental impacts, deterio rating water and air quality, restoration of ecosystem functions, and nature preservation. Although EC legislation has already achieved a considerable degree of harmonization, si gnificant differ ences remain among member states as to their economic ability and political willingness to create an effective environm ental policy agenda. R esolving s ocioeconomic dispar ities (especially between north ern and southern Europe) in rural reg ions, and addressing the viability of agricultural subsidies and impacts on environmental quality resulting from agricultural subsidies -- such as nutrients , heavy metals and pesticides -- are fundamental issues. These disparities are not unlike the sit uation in the R epublic of Indonesia (RI) . Higher- income regions are observing an agricul tural sector in transition. On a regional basis, the reduced GNP - share of the agricultural sector with a lower percentage of employment, environmental impact by plant ations, intensive farming systems and bio - industry, and a shift in soc ietal land use perspectives , require a review of land use policies. In addition, countries around the world are increasingly recognizing the critical importance of preserving natura l res ource assets and ecosystem functions; include their role in water supply and quality management, fisheries and eco -tourism. Such land use policy focus may be formulated into a strategic action program that sets \"sustainable\" land use goals and provides more universal access to land resources to increase productivity and address socio -economic disparities. . The action agenda may include policies and objectives that explicitly : improve human quality of life by meeting primary, secondary and tertiary need s provide equitable access to and availability of natural resources and their products and services prevent environmental damage an d resource degradation 29 promote sustainable development that addresses present needs without compromising future natural resou rce production capacity and ecosystem functions and bio diversity While in the RI the urgency to enhance quality -of-life is high for a large portion of the population , the principles to avoid lasting env ironmental damage are also urgent given the state of environmental quality in many urbanized area s, and increasingly so in area subject to intensive land use pressure s and surface mining. This urgency must be recognized in a pro -active land policy agenda that seeks to avoid environmental disaster , and reduc e environmental impacts and human health risk. Achieving these long -term objectives depends on th e sustainability of land use policies related to industry, energy, transport, agriculture and regional community and rural development. It should be stressed that success depends on two key principles: a) the integration of the environmental dim ension in all major land use policies and by establishing environmental protection targets to address causes of resource degradation and environmental deterioration, and b) a shared responsibili ty among the various government agencies, industries and public institutions and well -articulated and clearly -regulated mandates to gain commitments and agreed -upon policy measu res to be achieved, as defined by specific targets and spe cific progress indicators that can be monitored A sustainable land use strategy includes a wide range of policy instruments, including: legislation to set and enforce environmental standards , monitor performance and progress , specifically r elated to water and air quality, and human health risks economic incentives and regulations to increase productivity , and encourage the produc tion and use of economically viable and environmentally -friendly products and processes; development of an effective agricultura l research, education and information infrastructure ; and an adequately -funded and efficient rural extension service that addresses agricultural production technologies, community develop support, family health 30 and nutrition, financial assistance and farm budget analysis, and value chain development . A rural development s trategy should include the following target sectors: Agriculture (food and cash crops, processing and marketing), Industry (incl. small communal -based manufacturing and repair facilities) , Rural Electrification and Communication, Physical Infra -structure (roads, bridges, water supply and treatment), Services Infrastructure (education, health care, land tenure and financial services), and Tourism . Long -term target themes for rural developme nt should include: watershed and water resource management, waste and water quality management, climate change impacts, acidification and air quality, coastal zone m anagement, land resource conservation and , finally the preservation of critic al ecosystems and bio -diversity in the form of national parks and ecosystems reserves. Public r isk assessment and management should include comprehensive, 3-dimensional risk modeling, risk management (mitigation) and natural disaster emergency management, and address : a) flood protection and mitigation including risk assessment associated with the structural integrity of water containment structures (e.g. dams, dikes and flood gates) and potential impacts on downstream catchment areas with flooding and mud slide risk; b) volcanic and seismi c risk factors , including volcanic slope stability assessment , tsunamis early w arning systems and coastal zone risk analysis , and associated emergency management response schemes c) forest fire protection and community risk assessmen t, and d) health risk assessment associated with environmental impact and human exposure specifically related to water (untreated waste and pesticides) and air contamination . Policy instruments should include: a) comprehensive environmental information systems addressing the primary policy themes and key diagnostic, performance and monitoring indicators ; b) applied research and spatial analysis indicators ; c) sectoral and spatial 31 planning, d) realistic pricing that does not distort comparative advantage and seeks to encourage market -based approaches and reflect environmental externalities; e) public outreach, information and e ducation, f) human resource development; and g) carefully - structured financial support with targeted environmental incentives and production subsidies; and h) effective policy implementat ion and enforcement through focused and simplified legislation. The latter is especially important in the RI given the current state of agrarian sector legislation. 1.4 Rural Development Planning an d Sustainable Land Use: Indonesian Challenges It is outside the scope of the report to provide a detailed assessment of the environmental challenges associated with land use and economic development in Indonesia. However, with respect to Agrarian Reform, we also need to take stock of the basic challenges and trade -offs the GOI faces in guiding rural development, land use choices and environmental impacts -- and emphasize TWO BASIC FACTS: Many ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES AND SERVICES are UNIQUE a nd are VIRTUALLY IRREPLACEABLE - certainly in light of the time span of recent human evolution , settlements and impacts in the region. T his not only include s critical habitat and biodiversity loss but also impacts on critical sources of water supply and water and soil quality , agricultural and fisheries potential and other critical \"renewable\" resources OPPORTUNITIES TO PREVENT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE and disaster NOW are much MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN REMEDIATION AFTER THE FACT (if the practical and economic possibility exist s, at all) and do not only come at a much higher cost but at significantly greater PUBLIC RISK AND HEALTH consequence s. ACTING URGENTLY IS ESSENTIAL - especially in light of global warming causes and effects that will have dramatic consequ ences for coastal environments, coastal settlements and current land use, agricultural production potential, and water scarcity and quality. 32 These issues are especially urgent in Indonesia. Examples include: Rapid and uncontrolled development, such as on Kalimantan with new road construction into restricted forest areas , inducing further unplanned and uncontrolled growth Illegal logging practices throughout Indonesia affecting water availability and quality and critical wildlife habitat Conversion of high ly productive and critical farm land for non -agricultural use Conversion of important forest wildlife habitat in to plantations sometimes underutilized or later abandoned. Intrusion in the form of illegal logging, mining, forest squatting and hunting in national parks, such as Java's largest mountain park \"Mount Halimum Salka National Park in West Java. Rapid deterioration of water quality of interior lakes and some co astal areas as a result of over -fertilization (agricultural subsidies) , use of pesticides a nd discharge of untreated sewage (non e of Indonesian 's interior lake s contain any potable water any more) Lack of enforcement of reforestation provision s for forest concessionaires. Significant environmental impacts associated with legal and illegal minin g operation (water quality impacts associated with the discharge of toxic substances including heavy metals) Deforestation rates at as high as 2.8 million per year , between 1998 -2000 , and about 1.8 million hectares, more recently. At the interface of al t hese issues is the interaction between modern man and the environment, how public policy provides access to our renewable and non -renewable resources, which limitation are imposes on use rates and impacts and which legacy we wish to leave behind for future generations. The central role of PBN in this public policy debate is evident. 33 2. CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES, AND GUIDE LINES FOR LAND POLICY FORMU LATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING Any systematic attempt to address sustainable development planning should include baseline performance indicators and representative productivity indices. In rural areas, this means defining the productivity of the renewable land resource base and its derived uses, such as represented by the products and services from the agricultural, forestry, and tourism sectors, as well as outputs (ecological functions and derived social values) from natural ecosystems. Realistically, this should reflect both sustainable resource production capacity and economic feasibility. In rural sector planning , this may include the following assessment phases: 1. Assessment of basic agro -ecological production capacity on a cropping system or commodity -specific basis; 2. Assessment of sustainable productivity levels using adjustment for locally relevant production op portunities and input constraints (e.g. irrigation, fertilization, technology, capital); and the 3. Economic viability of production options (input costs and product prices). This relationship is further identified in figure 2.1 , below. An example of asse ssing basic productivity and its long -term sustainability in the form of relevant indicators can be provided in the form of crop productivity or farming systems analysis. For instance, in agro -ecological production capacity assessment, the genetic potentia l of crops grown under specific water supply (deficit) conditions is predicted. The agro-ecological parameters that primarily affect this biophysical production function are soil type (texture), climate (rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, solar radi ation, wind speed), and local topography (slope gradient and aspect or orientation ). This initial estimate of crop productivity does not assume limitations with regard to farm management practices -- nutrient deficits, salinity impacts or mulching -- or land degradation considerations. 34 Figure 2.1 - Relevant indicators, derived indices and linkages i n natural resource production capacity assessment. This basic relationship is identified by the crop yield response for mula as theoretically detailed in adapted comp uter-based crop yield mod els (such as the MSU -CRIES -YIELD model) reflecting soil moisture availability, such as: ya ETa (1 - ) = k y ( 1 - ) ym ETm where: ya = actual harvested crop yield AGROECOLOGICAL RESOURCE PRODUCTION CAPACITY INDICES SOIL RESOURCES Soil physical and chemical properties Topography CLIMATE RESOURCES Use-specific carrying capacity index (e.g. rangeland) Length of growing period Crop moisture availability Crop-specific productivity index Use-specific (farming system) suitability indices AQUATIC RESOURCES Irrigation potential Aquatic Ecosystem properties (biotic and abiotic) Water quality indices (organic and inorganic) Eutrophication index Wetland resources and productivity indices Aquifer vulnerability and recharge indices Surface and subsurface supply and cost PLANT RESOURCES Ecosystem classes and productivity indices Vegetation association and biomass productivity Biodiversity indices (species) Genetic resource indices (biomedical) WILDLIFE RESOURCES Ecosystem and carrying capacity indices Species, environment and human resource competition indices NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES Mineral Resource Oil an gas resources Strategic mineral index (for all, calculate self-sufficiency and economic supply index SOCIOECONOMIC NEED AND SUITABILITY INDICES Resource Status, Depletion Rates, Supplies (stock and flow resources) Projected Resource Quality, Physical and Economic Scarcity and Prices Mix of Resource Products and Services Political /Administrative District Impacts Natural Systems (e.g. ecosystem, agroecological zone, watershed) Impacts Planning districts - Integrated Impacts HUMAN-INDUCED LAND AND ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION IMPACTS AND INDICES LAND DEGRADATION IMPACTS Soil erosion (wind, water) and compaction Desertification index Salinization (Irrigation and saltwater intrusion) WATER RESOURCE IMPACTS (In)Organic pollution Use rates and water scarcity ECOSYSTEM QUALITY AND BIODIVERSITY Ecosystem productivity, diversity and stability 35 ym = maximum harvested crop yield ky = genetically determined yield response factor ETa = actual evapotranspiration ETm = maximum evapotranspiration The crop yield response factor is based on extensive field trials covering a variety of soils and growing conditions, and reflects high yielding varieties , well -adapted to local agro - ecological conditions. Assessment of sustainable natural resource productivity levels includes yield adj ustment for locally relevant production opportunities and input constraints (e.g. irrigation, fertilization, technology, and capital). In essence, this includes a compilation of : 1) Additional biophysical factors indirectly affecting crop moisture availabili ty, such as soil depth/texture, organic content, net irrigation application, rooting depth, water infiltration rate based on slope/textural classes, and crop nutrient availability; and 2) Socioeconomic conditions that effect the farm input level and long -term effectiveness of management practices (e.g., fertilizer and pesticide inputs, cropping intensity, labor or capital constraints, profit margins, land degradation), which effect sustainable productivity; and 3) Off-farm impacts such as environmental externalit ies resulting from soil erosion, fertilizer impacts, pesticide applications or general impacts on water quality and availability . This resource productivity assessment must be further expanded into a socioeconomic evaluation of needs and suitability. Here , need addresses the social demand resulting from expressed social expectations related to the quality of life and associated availability and price or goods and services, while suitability reflects the economic viability of production opportunities, such as lan d use types or farming systems under prevailing input costs and commodity price scenarios. The use of the comprehensive and relevant indicators, suggested above, must be incorporated into the larger decision -support framework for policy analysis and rural development planning. In essence, this transforms the reductionistic approach -- reducing problem solving to a segmentation of the problem by using descriptive 36 indicators -- to a holistic or systems approach. A holistic approach uses composite indic ators of social preferences and performance and can, therefore, ac commodate a variety of social assumptions, opinions, and group desires, accounting for public policy tradeoffs involving complex costs, benefits, and risk. A key requirement in this proce ss is that environmentally -referenced indicators , reflecting economic productivity opportunities and environmental impacts, by agro - ecological zones, watersheds or major ecosystems, must be directly related to political or administrative region s for the co mparative analysis of relevant socioeconomic impacts, and as the basis for strategic planning and implementation. As pointed out earl ier, this relationship (figure 2.2 ) among indicators is reflected in the hierarchy of planning and Figure 2.2 - Sustainable Environmental Management and Planning using Descriptive Suitability Indicators and Composite Indices of Social Preferences, Performance and Impact management an d may also be illustrated in the analytical sequence of sin gle issue resource management or comprehensive planning. The key challenge, then, is to define specific management objectives at each level that operationalize private and public SUSTAINABLE AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND CROP PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT (CROPPING SYSTEMS AND LIVESTOCK) SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM AND (TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC) BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING SUSTAINABLE SOIL MANAGEMENT (LAND DEGRADATION, SOIL MOISTURE AND NUTRIENT BALANCE) REDUCTIONISM HOLISM 37 development goals. This involves seeking complimentarity of socioeconomic and environmental goals that are specifically identified as indicators representing needs and opportunity, as well as measures of performance and impact. For example, in sustainable land management and policy formulation this involve s indicators that measure land degradation trends and quality, and denote intervention needs and development opportunities, representing various land use types as natural or managed production ecosystems. Fundamentally, resource use capacity is reflected in land quality indicator s representing a potential s ustainable use condition of landscape units on a comparative basis and may also expressed at the aggregate level at the local, regional or national scale s. Given a specific level of scale, land capacity or quality may include in dicators of nutrient and water balance, crop and forest yield trends, unrealized production potential (see below) based on certain land use type and management intensity, natural grassland (range) carrying capacity, land cover and biological diversity, and various indicators of environmental quality. 2.1 Focusing Land Policy and Development Initiatives : Applying the Concept of Unrealized Production Potential Comparative advantage, expressed as relative measure of productivity or economic performance, can be defined on an agro -ecological zone basis. An agro -ecological zone reflects a relatively homogeneous mapping unit -- based on soil characteristics (primarily soil texture or particle size reflecting soil moisture holding capacity), climate and topograph ic variables . This so -called Resource Production Unit (RPU) will provide a given level of crop productivity (output) based on its agro -ecologically de fined production capacity for specific cropping option s and its associated inputs. The theoretical maximum is based on local agro -ecological constraints. This maximum can be compared with the actual productivity level and the difference expressed as Unrealized Production Potential (UPP). Where the UPP is the largest (figure 2.3 ) the largest set of local produc tion constraints exist (e.g. input availability, cost, land access, technology, etc.) and the greatest opportunity exist to increase productivity in the context of an 38 agrarian reform program. This provides the spatial analytical framework for the prioritiz ation of integrat ed rural development and plann ing initiatives at the regional or national level. Figure 2.3 - The Concept of Unrealized Production Potential -- the Difference between Current Constrained Land Use Outputs ( Total Production of Goods and Services subject to Input and Performance Constraints) and the Theoretical Maximum (Unconstrained) Outputs . Were the Difference is the G reatest, the largest Constraint Condition s exists and the G reatest Potential exis ts to improve Productivity.

Beyond the traditional data quality standards of precision and accuracy, it is important to identify the MINIMUM information content necessary to meet decision -support objectives, at a given point in time. It may be argued that any redundant information constitutes inefficient use of human and capital resources. In the process of compiling information a distinction has to be made with regard to the sequence and ch aracteristics of basic data capture and analysis and the use and distribution of relevant information. This process sequenc e is illustrated below (figure 2.4). It is especially important to differentiate among the various information compilation steps, nam ely: The use of relevant, descriptive qual itative and quantitative diagnostic indicators in the problem identification ; Problem -oriented fact finding involving the use of primary and secondary data sets compiled in a spatially referenced information system (GIS), linked with analytical performance assessment models, such as agronomic productivity forecasting and socioec onomic impact assessment models ; The compilation of single indicators or composite prescriptive indices that identify potential solutions an d alternative problem solving approaches; and The selection of planning and implementation alternatives based on composite performance indices that reflect planning impacts, intended public policy consequences, and the aggregate impact on the quality of l ife over time, by location and the populations affected. The formulation of the latter two categories - involving the identification of potential solutions, the selection of preferr ed alternatives, and implementation strategies - must be 40 Figure 2.4 - Hierarchical information flow and use of basic data, indicators and indices in development planning and public policy formulation INDICES - performance Performance and Risk Assessment Monitoring Aggregate Impact Quality of life INDICATORS - prescriptive Intervention Opportunities Planning Guidelines Land Suitability Comparative Advantage Sustainability Carrying Capacity ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT APPROACHES AND IMPACTS ASSESSMENT MODELS (thematic examples) Crop Productivity Climate Change Air Quality Water Quality Biodiversity Urban Quality Soil Degradation Coastal Zone Management Wildlife Management COMPREHENSIVE DATA BASE COMPILATION Environmental Information System (GIS) Primary Data Capture Secondary Data Capture DECISION MAKING AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION Problem Indicators - thematic, quantitative and quantitative measures Need Indicators - measures of intervention need and opportunity pp 41 addressed effectively by the compiled information. To this end, consideration should be given to the formulation of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) that may be viewed as a network of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) linked to address specific applications by specific government agencies. The primary pur pose of a SDI is to provided improved access to spatial data (reflecting time, cost, quality, relevancy, and standardization issues) and support NSDI policy analysis needs on a economic sector or issue basis (e.g. environmental impact analysis, rural devel opment planning, transportation planning or agricultural or tourism sector analysis). This involves the identification of critical qualitative and quantitative indicators and derived indices, as viewed from the perspective of the various national or regio nal agencies with associated mandates in economic development and environmental protection. Composite indices designed to meet decision support requirements may reflect traditional economic measures of economic efficiency and also measures of public risk of the impact of human activities or development actions on the environment. Rather then viewing risk solely as a physical health factor, it is suggested that risk in policy formulation reflects the broader view of human well -being or quality of life. Mor e recently, the issue of social equity in involuntary environmental risk exposure has received increased attention. Elements that may be included into this assessment are water and air pollution, environmental disease vectors and their controls, occupation al health, food safety, and traffic safety. A modified risk equation can be used in this process to assess the composite indicator of environmental risk as: n Rn = rn x p n x vn - tn i=1 where r = is the expected value of the magnitude or degree of risk (expressed as social cost) p = the exposure probability (expressed as frequency or probability of occurrence (%) (this factor may be weighted for large impact areas where significant spa tial decay of impacts is anticipated) v = the vulnerability of the target population (e.g., age and weight factors) t = the potential risk reduction factor (e.g., prevention or mitigation policies) n = the number of risk variables involved 42 Risk ass essment must be viewed as a distinctly different component in public policy studies than risk management. The former is a scientific assessment of potential health risk that may result from development impacts on the environment, while the latter addresses concerted public policy efforts to reduce risk through education, regulation, and mitigation. Risk management uses the scientific results of risk assessment as expressed in comparative indices, while assessing the implications using economic, social and l egal considerations to formulate policy decisions and regulatory interventions. Environmental quality and public health risk are directly associ ated with the impacts of land use policy on quality of life and are receiving increased attention, world -wide. Land policy initiatives should not only address economic development but also deterio - rating air and water quality, restoration of ecosystems functions, and nature preservation needs. It is important to seek legislative agreement and support for these initiatives in the early stages of environmental degradation. We view this as critically important in Indonesia. Intervention scenarios will be much more cost efficient that retroactive mitigation efforts. This represents a critical opportunity for the RI t o address significant environmental concerns, particularly in land and water quality management The primary need exists to establish harmony among laws and regulations, and to develop the political willingness to create an effective environmental policy a genda for the 2010, and beyond. Environmental and land use policy should be primarily directed toward the prevent ion of water and air pollution and reflects proactive, comprehensive laws and regulation s regarding the impacts of land use (including defores tation and mining) on environmental quality . The challenge is to evolve an integrated systems approach to natural resource evaluation and impact assessment that fosters the development of a decision support system which is effective in making informed pu blic policy choices. Such a policy analysis sy stem, as outline below (figure 2.5 ) consists of three major functional components, comprising 43 diagnostic, prescriptive, and performance (monitoring) indicators and their derived resulting indices. It includes: A comprehensive Resource Evaluation System - to assess primary production capacities (agro -ecological productivity) A Land Use Evaluation System - the assess land suitabilities (economic viability and public risk variable s), and A Public Policy Analysis S ystem - to conduct macro socio -economic analysis Figure 2.5 - Major system linkages of resource assessment, land evaluation, economic development planning and land use policy formulation NATURAL RESOURCE SYSTEM Bio-physical diagnostic and prescriptive indicators: ecological resource base quality, production capacities and constraints LAND USE SYSTEM (viable) Land Use Types (LUTs) evaluated on the basis of resource capacity and socio-economic performance and prognostic indicators - development guidelines and strategies PUBLIC POLICY SYSTEM (EVALUATION OF QUALITY -OF-LIFE IMPACTS) AGGREGATE SOCIOECONOMIC PERFORMANCE MODELS AND SPATIAL INDICATORS LAND USE SELECTION BASED ON SOCIOECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY AND QU ALITY INDICATORS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH SELECTIVE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES, INCENTIVES, LAND USE PLANS AND CONTROLS SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTIVITY CONSTRAINTS: Agro-ecological, Technological, Socioeconomic, Institutional, Cultural, and Political. COMPARATIVE OPPORTUNITY INDICATORS (e.g. crop yields and economic return 44 Public interests largely ref lect the long -term environmental stewardship principle that includes public interests in resource conservation and environmental quality. Private interests largely reflect more short -term economic interests that are directly affected by ownership rights, l aws, and regulations. In this regard, the goal of public land use policy is to balance public an d private interest (reduce human risks, preserve environmental quality and stimulate economically viable production opportunities) by the formulation of multi -jurisdictional (e.g. national regional and local) , resource policy systems that include the institutional controls and capacity to: a) Identify the comparative advantage of resource use opportunities (e.g., resource endowment, use capacity and use efficienc ies) in the context of environmental constraints (e.g., carrying capacity and resource depletion rates) - the resource evaluation framework b) Evolve guidelines and decision -support system s to evaluate public and private sector benefits (e.g., benefit/cost, benefit/risk) of land use alternatives and associated environmental impacts - the policy analysis framework c) Development implementation and evaluation through effective development strategies, land use plans, laws and regulations, and performance monitor ing - the policy implementation framework In general, public development policy attempts to guide the identification and selection of \"best resource use\" options reflecting both public land use alternatives and the aggregate socioeconomic and environment al impacts of private land use choices. It aims to mobilize the production of goods and services as resource outputs to meet societal needs and to improve resource productivity, input, and management efficiency, while attempting to optimize product distrib ution and availability. In this context, natural resource assessment is a systematic process of fact finding, interpretation, and identification of development alternatives and associated impacts. This process is by nature holistic and multidisciplinary, r eflecting the best fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecosystems and the linkages among a complex set of biotic and abiotic factors. Sustainable development fundamentally reflects this understanding and, therefore, the perceived op portunities and environmental limits that provide guidelines for improved decision making, environmental management, and development planning. 45 This understanding is never absolute, lacking essential knowledge about complex ecological relationships, complic ated by spatial and temporal inaccuracies, affected by adaptive impacts and policy changes, and influenced by changing valuations of public benefits, costs and, risks. To effectively challenge this decision -making complexity, a systems approach to economi c development and envir onmental assessment is needed . The approach should be: 1) Issue -oriented to improve the RI ability to identify the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the problem(s), 2) Diagnostic in its analytical approach to identifying potenti al solutions that are sustainable and economically viable , and 3) Focus on problem solving by providing the minimum information needed to make informed decisions. 2.3 Land Evaluation and Suitability Assessment for Land Policy and Development Planning The critical analytical process that determines the comparative land suitabilities associated with different production options if referred to as Land Evaluation for Development Plannin g. Land evaluation is designed to : Identify inappropriate land use s that l ead to inefficient use or exploitation of natural resources resulting in the degradation or destruction of land resource s and undermine the long -term productive capacity of our natural resources based, and eventually lead to poverty and scarcity of product s and ecosystem services; identify the best land use alternatives for a given parcel of land given prevailing inputs, costs, technology and public preference , thereby seeking the long -term creation and preservation of prosperity develop rational land use p lanning and select appropriate and sustainable use s of natural and human resources on a parcel and administrative district basis 46 Land evaluation is the assessment of land p erformance for a specified land use - the land use objective or alternative - the so -called Land Utilization Type (LUT) subject to local constraints and input regimes Land evaluation reflects the notion that l and (and its use) varies in its bio-physical and socio -economic properties and that for each use a suitability determination can b e made and expressed in physical and/or economic terms. Basic suitability differences can be systematically evaluated based on agro -ecological properties. These suitabilities based on the variation of physical, economic and social variable s, and the perfor mance of the land for a give n land use can be predicted with a degree of certainty , given the variability of data and production assumptions. This suitability assessment for agricultural, forestry (or any other land use including industrial or tourism) p rovide a parcel -based and aggregate (political or administrative district -based) comparative framework that provide users and d ecision makers -- such as land use planners, state institutions, politicians and agricultural support services - with spatial inf ormation to make predictions and guide land use decisions and policy formulation. . 2.4 Land Information System Functio ns for Suitability Assessment, Land Policy Formulation and Development Planning The basic role of Land Information S ystem s (LIS) to sup port land suitability and impac t assessment is critical (Fig. 2.6 ). Increasingly, these spatial analytical functions are combined with mapping systems that can be use d to identify property ownership by parcel descriptions (cadastral maps) used to demarcate property boundaries, land use rights and land valuation for tax assessment. Significant improvements have been made in computer -assisted (automated digitizing) input, compatibility with satellite data input and rectification, spatial analytical and model ling software, and mapping output. 47 Figure 2.6 - Three major components of a Land Information System. These components consist of input devices, computer hardware and softwa re, and output subsystems. A Land Information System (LIS) is a uniquely adapte d system with (automated ) digitizer input, mapping output and dedicated spatial analytical and display capability, including cadastral information. 2.4.1 LIS Components and Analytical Capabilities A LIS consist of the capabilities if a Geographic Informati on System (GIS) with the cadastral mapping and relational data base components of a land registration and taxation system. Ideally, it should included protocols to link the GIS components with applied models, such crop yield and econometric or optimizing m odels. The real power of this combination is that aggregate analysis result s can be converted to spatially -referenced output. For instance, the output of an optimizing linear programming model that seeks to identity a specific crop mix to be produced in a certain province to meet food an export goals, can be translated into the ideal crop mix per agro -ecological zones for economic planning purposes. 48 Operationally, a GIS can be divided into five components: People, Data, Hardware, Software, and Procedures. All of these components need to be well-designed and operationally -integrated to serve a public function cost -effectively . They include: People The people are the component largely -determine operational efficiency. They include positions like GIS managers , database administrators, application specialists, systems analysts, and application programmers. They are responsible for maintenance of the geographic database and provide technical support. GIS staff need s to be educated in systems capacity and applic ations. BPN should develop a long -term systems development that includes a human resource development plan based on institutional priorities and resource availabilities. One suggested educational institution to meet BPN's need is ITC in the Netherlands tha t provides dedicated system and application training financed by Dutch technical assistance programs. Procedures Procedures include how the data will be archived and retrieve d, input into the system, networked, transformed, analyzed, and presented in a di fferent form . The analytical procedures reflect the information needs (from data to analysis to information). The ability of a GIS to perform these spatial functions cost -effectively and accurately to meet the institutional mandate determines it functiona lity. Hardware Hardware consists of the technical equipment needed to run a GIS including a computer system with enough power to run the software, enough memory to store large amounts of data, and input and output devices such as scanners, digitizers, GPS data loggers, media disks, and printers. Software There are many different GIS s oftware packages available. All systems must be capable of effective data input, storage, management, trans formation, analysis, and output. Dedicated systems functions such as found in an LIS will reflect additional capabilities, methods, system resources, and ease of use . Modern GIS systems permit the storage of 49 both graphical an d descriptive in a single database, known as the object -relational model. They also include pro tocols to develop mathematical equation s that guide a series of spatial analyses, such as useful in overlay and suitability analysis. Data One of the most time consuming and costly aspects of a GIS is database creation and maintenance. The inherent aspect of spatial data is that they most are dynamic and need frequent updating, such as is the case for cadastral records and land cover/use changes . Here temporal and spatial accuracy are critical both in the source and use of secondary and during input and c onversion. Institutional protocols in this regard should be carefully reviewed. In general terms, a GIS combines computer cartography with a database management system. The major components common to a GIS are three subsystems: (1) an input system that all ows for the collection of data to be used and analyzed for some purpose. This typically includes digitizing devices that permit the transformation of analog maps to digital form; (2) computer hardware and software systems that store s data, allow for data m anagement and analysis, and can be use d to display data manipulations on a computer monitor; and (3) an output system that generates hard copy maps, images, and other types of output. Historically, two major GIS systems evolved, raster (or cell -based) sys tems and polygon systems. The first type had the advantage of being directly compatible with satellite data and facilitated map overlay analysis at the compromise of spatial accuracy. The second being more capable of storing map data, initially compromised overlay and image analysis. Examples of the first type are SYMAP developed at Harvard in the 60s , the CRIES -GIS develop at MSU (70s and 80s) and ERDAS (80s) , initially developed at Georgia Tech. The evolution of polygon systems was accelerated by the deve lopment INTERGRAPH and ARC -INFO by ESRI, California , The latter has almost evolved to an international standard in GIS applications. Polygon systems are also typical for stand - alone, cadastral information systems. 50 Two basic data types are normally entere d int o a GIS. The first type consists of real world phenomena and features that are mapped. Usually, these data elements (attributes, such as soil or climate data) are stored points, lines, or polygons that are referenc ed geographically in a coordinate sys tem that is replicated in the data base. These mapped data are entered into the GIS by devices like scanners, digitizers, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), air photos, and satellite imagery. The associated attribute values (such as soil types with their ph ysical and chemical properties or census information ) are then referenced by these spatial identifier s (points, lines, or polygons mapped in the GIS ). These data sets can then be analyzed to determine spatial relation ships such as frequencies, co -occurrenc es or unique combination of attributes to identify unique spatial locations (e.g. land suitabilities - physical ly or economically). The geo -database is the common data storage and management framework for an LIS. It combines spatial data with a relational data base to create a central data repository for spatial data storage and management. It can be leveraged in desktop , server , or mobile environments and allows store of GIS data in the field and net -work ed locations, while providing central locatio n data access, management and security. A unique capability of the GIS component of a LIS is the ability to take secondary data, conduct analysis of uniquely interest to a specific region and to derive tertiary data that may be extremely helpful in certai n policy application. An example is provided in the 2 figures below. The first map indicates distribution of earthquake events and the second relative surface depth. These inputs can be used to develop input into a tsunami risk analysis model that seeks to ascertain relative risk by location as part of the development of an Emergency Management Program (EMP). 51 Figure 2.6.1 - Distribution of earthquake events that have occurred over the last century. (Source: PhysicalGeography.net) Figure 2.6.2 - Earth quake events organized according to depth and impact (yellow (shallow) = surface to 25 kilometers below the surface, red (intermediate) = 26 to 75 kilometers below the surface, and black (deep) = 76 to 660 kilometers below the surface). (Source: PhysicalGeo graphy.net) 52 2.4.2. Cadastral and LIS Information Examples of basic land use and cadastral maps date back many years, such as in th e example provided below (Fig. 2.7 ) - the city map of Ambon (1726) . Cadastral surveys document the boundaries of land ownership, by the production of documents, diagrams, sketches, plans (plats in USA), charts, and maps. Origina lly, they were originally used for land valuation and taxation. Rectified cadastral survey or topographic maps (representing a true orthographic projection of the land surface) can be used as a base map in Geographic/Land Information systems used to compil e other thematic map overlays, such as land use, soils, infrastructure, etc. The depiction of land ownership can be an important element in land evaluation or impact studies A cadastral map shows the boundaries and ownership of land parcels. Some cadastral maps show additional details, such as district names, parcel ID and tax numbers, Figure 2.7 - Land Use and General Parcel Map of Ambon (1726) (Souce: Van Keulen Atlas, Amsterdam) 53 certificate of title numbers, positions of existing structures, section a rea and/or lot numbers, street names, boundary dimensions and references to prior maps. An example of a modern cadastra l map is provided, below (Fig. 2.8 ). Cadastral maps should reveal the national grid, cadastral boundaries, parcel -identifiers, street ad dresses, buildings, house numbers, and geodetic control points. Parcel related attributes can be visualized on the cadastral map. Cadastral parcel data should be stored in one separate layer, buildings in a different overlay. Spatial data are represented in the database using geometric data types such as 'point', 'line' and 'box'. In addition to the use of these data types, some important capabilities could be build in such as topology and historic information. Furthermore, nation -wide unique identifiers should be all geographic objects, e.g. boundaries, topographic lines (buildings) and unified surveying and mapping attributes. The following data base system is utilized in the Dutch cadastre and may serve as an example of a modern system: \"Data tables incl ude boundary (cadastral boundaries), parcel (parcel identifiers), symbol (cartographic symbols), GCP (Geodetic Control Point), line (topographic lines) and text. The spatial extension of the objects in the table includes boundary, parcel and line and is in dicated with a minimal bounding rectangle of type ' box'. The box covers a boundary or a topographic line or a complete parcel. The box can be spatially indexed and is useful for efficient retrieval purposes based on rectangle selections. There is no need f or the geometric data type 'polygon', because the area features are stored topologically in the parcel table and boundary table using the so -called 'CHAIN -method'. The edges in boundary table contain references to other edges according to the winged edge s tructure, which are used to form the complete boundary chains. From this data structure polygons can be generated on demand. Currently, topology is only maintained for the cadastral data and is being introduced for the topographic data, based on demand. This approach allows calculations on correctness of topology after adjustment of the surveyed new boundaries to the cadastral data. Furthermore it opens the possibility to relate attributes to the boundaries between parcels, e.g. relation to the source docum ents of surveying, date of survey, names of persons locating the boundary, etc. If each parcel would be represented in the database by a closed polygon, it would be complicated to represent the basic object of cadastral surveying: one boundary between two neighbor parcels. Closed polygon representation would lead to double (or triple or even more) 54 storage of all co -ordinates (except the territorial boundary), which complicates the data management in a substantial way. Closed polygon representation can resul t in the introduction of gaps and overlaps between parcels, which has no relation to reality. One more reason for the boundary based approach is in the classification of boundaries: the administrative cadastral and political subdivision in sections (cadast ral zones), Figure 2.8 - Example of a Modern, Large -scale Cadastral Map municipalities and provinces is possible by classifying boundaries 'section a and a 'section - boundary' and a 'parcel -boundary'; etc. \" In term of dedicated spatial analysis software, the micro computer has revolutionized the field of land evaluation, as well as every othe r field of applied science. The possibility 55 exists to distribute highly detailed spatially -referenced data and conduct distributed analysis with in institutions and field offices at the district, local or project level. It is feasible to have a regional -level land information system , including remote sensing analysis capability , with PC-based hardware and software , together with centrally -shared data storage, digitizers, plotters, and laser color printers. At a more sophisticated level, national organization s and universities may use LIS and centralize automated data input and storage while providing powerful analytical workstations. Land Information Systems should include standard productivity operations such as report writing, area calculations, cross -tabulation and other statistical analysis on land records and parcels (reference the occurrence of 2 or more thematic variable s) and produce this output is tabular (spreadsheet) and graphic form (histograms and maps) . LIS capabilities should include data bas e operations based on address and parcel IDs, for updating land registration and taxation records , thematic overlays and proximity analysis, conditional queries, permit 3 -dimensional modeling and linkages with aggregate models (econometric, yield modeling, risk, simulation and impact models). The base reference coordinates should permit input of rectified ortho -photoquads and satellite image data. An image analysis capability to update land cover/use data and derive other thematic maps such as vegetation an d coastal zone dynamics is an important asset. The multi -purpose functionality of LIS makes it an ideal tool to support spatial planning and impact assessment. The land registry and cadastre equally serve s a multi purpose . It should provide and regist er information on legal transfer of title or use rights, the right of disposal of the seller, the agreement betwe en buyer and seller, title rights and restrictions (easements). The official public registry should reflect certified ownership rights and the deed should suffice to give substantial evidence of ownership. The registers and cadastral maps therefore guarantee in practice legal land tenure security, and security in the land market. The same is valid for securing loans by mortgages. Information on t axable persons, taxable objects , and taxable values, should be derived from the files of the National Land Agency, and on regular basis supplied to the municipalities as main source data for their land taxation. All local data should be stored centrally an d updated of a 56 regular basis for safekeeping. All land information from the files of the National Land Agency should be available for legitimate use by government bodies and be available for public inspection and retrieval at cost. Typically, p ublic regi sters are registers in which official (notarized) deeds are recorded as they are submitted. In the Civil Code (Roman -French law ) older real estate rights have priority over recent right s. The moment of recording can therefore be of crucial importance, e.g. by legal foreclosure and execution. Public registers by consequence are not easy a ccessible. The administering a gency may provide title extract s on request and at cost. The essential elements from the deed are the same as use d for input into the cadastral registers and maps, providing registers on name, parcel (both admin istrative description and map ), and street address. In essence , the cadastral registers and maps are auxiliary registers to provide access to the public registers. The public registers are kept in analogue format: books with paper deeds, and should be copied in microfiche and secured at a save location. Both cadastral registers and cadastral maps should be digitized for net -worked file sharing and security. Some specific recommendations for the RI include: a) the specific identification of individual ownership and land use rights on title certificates (deeds) based on a restructured and transparent system of land ownership rights; b) work toward the future use of digital records and the e lectronic submission of deed to the regency and central office; c) develop a full integration of a centralized land data base, including topographic base, cadastral map and legal/administrative data; including quality control (verification) and archiving; d) consider consolidation of regional data compilation at the provincial level to redue cost and facilitate networking and archival operations with the national office of BPN 2.4.3 Institutional Role of LIS/GI S in Inter -agency Collaboration and Public Po licy Support Above, a number of applied uses for GIS -supported spatial analysis are discussed, as they are throughout this report. Some of these major national support function s include the 57 ones outlined, below (fig. 2.9). If a truly integrated national d ata base infrastructure is envisioned , the principal users may include BPN, BAPPENAS , the National Mapping Agency, Ministries of Public Works, Agricul ture, Forestry, Environment and Tourism , and related agencies with responsibilities for public health and safety. It is suggested that an inter -agency task force be established to develop a National Spatial Data Information (NSDI) infrastructure with centralized data capture and archiving, universally accepted standards , networked data access, down and upload capacities based on unique needs (such as the cadastral information used by BPN). Figure 2.9 - National GIS -support functions and task force associated with the mandates of BPN, BAPPENAS , the National Mapping Agency, Ministries Public Works, Agricul ture, Forestry, Environment and Tourism, and agencies with responsibilities for public health and safety. This will not only create a cost -effective national spatial information system capacity but will also permit networked data base linkages with dedicate d abilities based on specific agency needs. 58 2.5 Integrated Survey Capacity for Mapping and Land Evaluation The most fundamental capacity is the ability to develop reliable topographic maps with geographic coordinates (Universal Transverse Mercator) that s erve as reference for the national cadastre and base maps for the development of analog thematic maps (land cover/use, soils, infrastructure, water resources, climate variables, etc.) depicting various land attributes used in land evaluation. Until recentl y, the basic tools used in planar surveying were a tape measure for determining shorter distances, a level for determine height or elevation differences, and a theodolite used to measure angles (horizontal and vertical), combined with triangulation . Starting from national primary, secondary and tertiary reference position s (benchmarks) with known location and elev ation, the distance and angles to the unknown point are measured and mapped . A more modern instrument is a theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM) data processor. Modern \"total\" stations are fully robotic, can e -mail point data to an office computer and connect to satellite positioning systems , such as a Global Positioning System (GPS). Though real -time differential GPS systems have increased the speed of surveying, they are still only horizontally accurate to about 20 mm and vertically accurate to about 30 -40 mm. However, GPS syst ems do not work well in areas with dense tree cover or construction obstacles. These \"total\" stations are used widely, along with other types of surveying instruments. One -person , robotic -guided total station allow s surveyors to gather precise and rapid measurements . A faster way to measure large areas with less detail without many visual obstacles is with a helicopter equipped with a laser scanner, combined with a differential GPS to determine the position and elevation of the helicopter. To increase preci sion, beacons are placed on the ground (about 20 km apart). This me thod reaches precisions tolerances of 5-40 cm, depending on flight height. Today's capacity makes it possible for a single su rveyor to accomplish in a day what used to take weeks with an entire team, and with a higher level of spatial accuracy . 59 2.6 Land Surveys for Integrated Data Base Development and Land Development Various land survey can be carried out to establish base reference maps and track real estate transaction and land development . These capabilities should be part of the various government agencies responsible for the development planning, implementation and monitoring and evalua tion. They also form the basis for building cadastral and tax records related to real estate property and transactions. They include: Topographic Survey : a survey that measures the elevation of points on a particular piece of land, and presents them as contour lines on a plot. The resulting topographic maps with spatial reference points, such as using the Universal Transverse Mercator (metric) projection, and surface features such as roads, waterways, built-up areas ( for detailed maps individual structures), forested and wetland areas, these map are the base reference map for Land Information Systems on which thematic information may be draped as several digital overlays in a digital data base, such as land cover/use. soils, hydrology, vegetation types, political/administrative boundaries, climate, ecosystems, population density, census tracks, etc. A comprehensive survey that incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey . In the US, such survey meeting American Congress on Surveying and Mapping standards is referred to as the ALTA/ACSM Survey and is often required to formalize real estate transactions. An a rchaeological survey used to accurately assess the spatial references points relationship of archaeologic al sites in a landscape or to accurately record finds on an archaeological site. In many nations these surveys are require if the presence of archaeological features is identified and prior to site development can be authorized Project or \"As -built\" Survey is a survey conducted several times during various stages of a construction project to verify, for local and state planning boards (USA ), that work authorized was completed to the specifications set on the Plot Plan or Site Plan . This usually entails a complete survey of the site to confirm that the structures, utilit ies, and roadways proposed are built in the proper 60 locations as authorized in the Plot Plan or Site Plan by local planning a uthorities. These surveys are usually done 2 -3 times during the building of a house; once after the foundation has been completed ; once after the walls are put up; and at the completion of construc tion. Boundary Survey : a survey to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description which typically involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the lines of the parcel, often in the form of iron rods, pipes , or concrete monuments in the ground, or nails set in concrete or asphalt. In the past, wooden posts, blazes in trees, piled stone corners or other types of monuments have also been used. A map or plat is then drafted from the field data to provide a represe ntation of the parcel surveyed. Construction surveying (otherwise \"lay -out\" or \"setting -out\") : the process of establishing and marking the position and detailed layout of new structures such as roads or buildings for subsequent construction. Surveying is regarded as a sub - discipline of civil engineering all over the world. All Degree and Diploma level Engineering institutions have detailed items of Surveying in the curriculum for undergraduate courses in the discipline of Civil Engineering . It is suggested that al relevant PBN staff meet these criteria. Deformation Survey : a public s afety survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. The three -dimensional positions of specific points on an object are determined, a period of time is allowed to pass, these positions are then re -measured and calculated, and a comparison between the two sets of positions is made. Such surveys are routinely conducted in areas subject to volcanic or seismic activity such as along fault zones, slopes or dams Engineering Surveys : those surveys associated with the engineering design (topographic, layout and as -built) often requiring geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice and precision . Erosion and Sediment Control Plan : a plan that is drawn in conjunction with a Subdivision Development Plan that denotes how up coming residential or commercial construction activities will effect the movement of stormwater and sediment across the con struction site and onto adjacent properties and how 61 developers must adjust grading and site preparation activities to limit the depos iting of more stormwater and sediment onto adjacent properties as a result of the construction project . Foundation Survey : a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foun dation was constructed in the location authorized in the Plot Plan , Site Plan , or Subdivision Plan . When the location of the finished foundation is checked and approved the building of the remainder of the structure can commence. This is different than the \"As-Built \" Survey, above, which is not to be done until all work or phases thereof are completed. Geological Survey : generic term for a survey conducted for the purpose of recording the geologically significant features of the area under investigation. In the past, in remote areas, there was often no base topographic map available, so the geologist also needed to be a competent surveyor t o produce a map of the terrain as a spatial refe rence for geological information . More recently, satellite imagery or aerial photograph y is used as a base, where no published map exists. Such a survey may also be highly specialist - for instance focusing primarily on hydro geological , geochemical or geomagnetic themes. Hydrographic Survey : a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the coastline and seabed for navigatio n (nautical charts ), engineering, or resource management purposes. Coastal zone mapping (navigation) and the monitoring of coastal dynamics and risk analysis (flood protection, tsunami early warning system, etc.) should be interrelated elements of governme nt mapping programs. Mortgage Survey or Physical Survey : a simple survey that generally determines land boundaries and building locations. Mortgage surveys are required by title companies an d lending institutions when they provide financing to show that there are no structures encroaching on the property and that the position of structures is generally within zoning and building code requirements. Some jurisdictions allow mortgage surveys to be done to a lesser st andard, however most modern minimum standards require the same standard of care for mortgage surveys as any other survey. 62 Plot Plan or Site Plan : a proposal plan for a construction site that include all existing and proposed conditions on a given site. The existing and proposed conditions always include structures, utilities, roadways, topography, a nd wetlands delineation and location if necessary. The plan might also, but not always, include hydrology, drainage flows, endangered species habitat, emergency management issues; multi -year flood plans (e.g. 50 or 100 year flood event to avoid building in flood prone areas) traffic patterns and capacities for emergency response planning. Soil survey , or soil mapping , is the process of determining the soil types or other properties of t he soil cover over a landscape, and mapping them for others to understand and use. A detailed soil survey list s the primary physical (texture or particle size) and chemical properties of soils to about a 2 meter depth. Hydrological survey is designed to ma p surface and subsurface phenomena associated with the presence of water such as water bodies, stream flows, aquifers and associated groundwater supplies and dynamics. Subdivision Plan : a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land. Boundary lines ar e drawn insid e the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads . The number and location of plats, or the newly created parcels, are usually discussed back and forth betwe en the developer and the surveyor until they are agreed upon. At this point monuments, usually in the form of square concrete blocks or iron rods or pins, are driven into the ground to mark the lot corners and curve ends, and the plat is recorded in the cadastre (USA, elsewhere) or land registry (UK). In some jurisdictions, the recording or filing of a subdivision pla t is highly regulated. The final map or plat becomes, in effect, a contract between the developer and the city or county, determining what can be built on the property and under what conditions. Always upon finally completion of a subdivision an As-Built P lan is required by the local government. This is done so that the roadway constructed therein will pass owner ship from the developer to local government by way of a contract called a Covenant . When this stage is completed the roadways w ill now be maintaine d, repaved and serviced by 63 local government . In the US, this is funded by local property taxes levied or a parcel basis. Tape Survey : this type of survey is the most basic and inexpensive type of land survey. Popular in the middle part of the 20th century , tape surveys while being accurate for distance lack substantially in their accuracy of measuring angle and bearing. Considering that a survey is the documentation of one -half (1/2) distances and one -half (1/2) bearings this type of survey is no longer ac cepted amongst local, state, or federal regulatory committees for any substantial construction work. However for determining the extent of propert y boundaries this type of survey is the least expensive, least time consuming and least invasive, while being nowhere close to accurate for the standards that are practiced by professional land surveyors. Wetlands Delineation & Location Survey : a survey that is completed when construction work is to be done on or near a site containing defined wetlands. Building permits should avoid construction in wetland areas and preserve the critical wetland functions such as flood protection, water quality protection by reducing sedimentation and chemical recycling, preservation of ecosystem functions such as fish spawning an d wildlife habitat, etc. Depending o n local, regional, or national regulations , wetlands are usually classified on the basis temporary inundation and boundaries are determi ned by observing the soil type (organic matter) , vegetation type, erosion patterns o r scour marks, hydrology, and morphology. A survey is done to drawn reference boundaries to ensure construction outside wetland habitat. 2.7 Guidelines and Regulatory Frameworks for Land Use Policy an d Planning To offer an example of a hierarchical plan ning system with integration of National, Regional and Local Planning, the example of the Netherlands and New Zealand are introduced. 64 2.7.1 Planning in the Netherlands Planning policy in the Netherlands may be viewed as more proactive than Michigan's - combating land use pressures and conflicts, and managing economic growth and environmental impacts associated with intensive land use patterns and a capital - and technology -intensive agricultural sector associated with relatively high nutrient and pesticide loadings. Dutch land use intensities, both agricultural and industrial, is high - especially in the west, and environmental impacts and land scarcity are historically reflected in land use planning and policy. During the early part of the 1900s, one cou ld characterize Dutch land use policy as reactive and agricultural sector -oriented, and more proactive and comprehensive since the 1950s. This approach received considerable international acclaim as a viable and resourceful approach to land use planning an d economic development. As part of this regulatory framework, policy mandates and planning instruments have been developed to direct urban development and control sprawl. These demonstrate a significant political commitment, leadership and institutional ca pability to effectively address growth management pressures. The Netherlands is considered a decentralized unitary state. The national government and national parliament legally determine the decision -making authority of its 12 provinces and 496 municipali ties. Table 1 provides an overview of the governmental levels. In Europe, a decentralized unity state means that government powers are divided among various entities with right and duties specified in the constitution. These entities should pursue policies consistent with those promulgated by higher government units. 65 Table 2.1 - Governmental organization of the Netherlands This division of administrative responsibilities - national, regional (provincial) and local (municipal districts with surrounding rural areas) - delegates a high degree of authority to the regional and municipal levels within the framework of a hierarchical planning system . In many respects, this system may be compared to the U.S. system of state, county and local admini stration - however, with in the Netherlands the municipal level representing a combination of major and minor municipalities and their surrounding rural townships. Current political discussions take place to replace the appointed major with an elected posi tion. Comparatively speaking, the European Union may increasingly be viewed as the fourth or federal layer, with the obligation to translate directives of the European Union into national legislation. This hierarchical planning system is administrativel y enforced by the allocation of national tax revenues, directly and indirectly via the European Union. The Dutch government contributes on balance about 3 billion Euros of national tax revenues to the European Union to support development assistance to oth er EU nations or for other aspects of European policy implementation, such as agricultural subsidies. This is, on a per capita basis, the highest of all member states. In 2005, both the Netherlands and Great Britain are trying to negotiate a substantial re vision of this net capital contribution to the E.U. The E.U. also provides funds to implement specific directives such as agricultural policies and the revitalization of nature preserves or ecosystem networks. Institutions 66 responsible for implementing l and use planning in the Netherlands are the national government, the provinces and the municipalities. Table 2 .2 summarizes the main policy institutions at each level. Table 2 .2 - Land Use Policy Institutions of the Netherlands National Planning At the national level, the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) issues the principal national guidelines on spatial policy and development. It encourages other tiers of government and private parties (such as nature conservation an d management organizations) to cooperate at the early stage of new land -use projects. The overall goal is to examine economic development options and, in collaboration with provincial and municipal governments, to draw up long -term development plan. The Spatial Planning Act provides the legal framework for planning in the Netherlands. The municipalities (jurisdictions that include surrounding rural areas) are responsible for planning at the local level. The municipal councils draw up detailed land -use plans , which have to be approved by the provincial authorities. The provincial authorities draw up regional land use plans, primarily sectoral development plans that are coordinated national and, increasingly, internationally. 67 This general framework is further defined in the outline of institutional responsibilities provide below (Fig. 2 .10). Adherence to national strategic plans is ensured by the States General1 by exercising the right of approval . The minister is advised by the following institutions: The Gov ernmental Commission of Planning \u2014 the highest level commission for coordinating the planning policies of the national government. The Ministerial Council (VROM) \u2014 an independent council that advises the national government and represents many outside cons tituencies. The National Spatial Planning Agency \u2014 assists the minister of VROM in developing spatial planning policy. National land use planning is promulgated by a national plan composed of major spatial planning decisions of four types: National plann ing policy document (\"nota ruimtelijke ordening\") \u2014 a document (revised every 10 years) that articulates spatial policy directives for provincial and municipal governments on a sectoral basis, including aspects of the types and location of housing, urban d evelopment, nature and landscape preservation, water management and infrastructural development. National structure plan \u2014 a spatial outline of national land use policy, such as regional urban growth, environmental preservation or industrial development directives. Structure scheme \u2014 a national structure plan for a single policy sector. Particular projects of national importance In the latest and Fifth National Policy Document , land use development guidelines are formulated through 2020, with additional pe rspectives for the period up to 2030. Topics include needs for residential develop ment, including the mix of private and social housing, preferred locations for residential development and urbanization, nature and landscape development and preservation, wa tershed management and the spatial requirements to accommodate economic growth. It is a legally binding document that 1 The State General (Parliament) consists of 2 policy chambers: the Second Chamber of Parliament with 150 memb ers, directly elected for 4 years; and the Senate, elected by members of the provincial authorities. 68 outlines regional development guidelines to be refined by provincial and municipal government land use plans. Figure 2 .10 - Institution al mandates for spatial planning in the Netherlands. National spatial policy is presented in structural outline plans (with general locational preferences) and national policy documents. These documents contain the main principles of the spatial policy, further reinforced and detailed in spatial allocation plans at the provincial and municipal levels. Each key decision specifies its duration and is 69 (mostly) directive or legally binding. Projects of national importance can be legally binding, such as those associated with the development or augmentation of major infrastructural facilities or networks. To assure cooperation among various jurisdictions or levels of government in the implementation of key decisions, the national government may issue: Directive s on what a province should include in its regional plans and what a municipality should include in its allocation plan (a specific land use designation plan). Orders that regional plans or allocation plans be revised. In addition, these directives and ord ers may but need not be based on key spatial planning decisions. This division of administrative responsibilities - national, regional (provincial) and local (municipal district, including surrounding rural area) - delegates a high degree of authority to the regional and municipal levels within the framework of a hierarchical planning system. Institutions responsible for implementing land use planning in the Netherlands are the national government, the provinces and the municipalities. Provincial Plannin g Provincial land use planning responsibilities include: The detailing of relevant aspects of national land use planning policy at the provincial level \u2014 in the form of provincial (or regional ) plans . The implementation of provincial planning policy. The s upervising of spatial planning policy implementation by the municipalities within the province \u2014 in the form of local structure plans and land use destination (in fact detailed land allocation ) plans . The provincial governmental powers are divided constit utionally among: The crown's commissioner. The provincial council, which promulgates spatial policy. 70 The provincial executive, which prepares and develops policy through plans and memoranda. The provincial executive is assisted by the provincial spatial planning agency. The provincial planning committee is advisory to the provincial executive and coordinates departmental actions and policies. It also plays a key role in the vertical coordination and detailing of national and local land use planning. To th is end, the provincial (regional) council develops a regional plan \u2014 enabled by the Spatial Planning Act \u2014 that is revised every 10 years. It identifies desired future development in the province and, although not directly legally binding for citizens or l ocal jurisdictions, identifies generally desired future developments at the municipal level, to be subsequently detailed in local structure plans and local land use destination plans (see below). The provincial executive has the authority to approve local land use plans on the basis of their compatibility with the regional plan. To enforce compliance, the province may issue specific orders and directives to municipalities. Local Planning Provinces or regions are subdivided into municipalities (\"gemeentes\") , which include a municipal seat in the major town and minor towns or villages with their surrounding rural areas (Fig. 2.1 1). They possess similar authority, but their autonomy is subordinate to provincial and national land use policies. Figure 2.11 - Local planning unit \u2014 Includes major municipality with minor towns or villages and surrounding rural areas (this could be compared to a major incorporated U.S. city and its surrounding townships or county). 71 The Spatial Planning Act mandates that municipa lities prepare and implement local land use policy and plans. They may also implement special national and provincial land use policies on the basis of funded mandates. Policies are typically further detailed at the local level by means of structure plans and destination (land allocation) plans (see below). For implementation of national planning objectives at the regional and local levels, provincial and municipal government funding largely originates from national government sources in the form of general or specific grants based on the number of inhabitants. Funding allocations to the provinces and municipalities reflect the nature and magnitude of development priorities as identified in the national plan . Therefore, this funding provides a significant la nd use control mechanism at the local level. National revenue is largely raised through national income and sales taxes. Taxation at the provincial and municipal level is very limited. This is an important difference between the Netherlands and the United States because it eliminates the major incentive for local governments to pursue development solely for the purpose of expanding the local tax base. In the Netherlands, local taxes include a limited form of real estate tax (the major source) and a levy for municipal services such as water and energy (natural gas) consumption, and sewage and solid waste services. Local tax revenue amounts to about 16 percent of local funding (Fig. 2.12). Figure 2.12 - Municipal income sources (1999). (Source: European Uni on, Committee of the Regions) Major capital improvements may be financed by bond issues. Municipal councils may determine local property tax rates subject to national government -imposed limits. Non - profits such as church organizations and agricultural lan d are exempt from property tax. 72 Special taxing authority is provided to local water boards, which may proportionally assess beneficiaries for drainage services and flood protection. Very little tax revenue comes from provincial levies. The local administr ative powers are constitutionally divided among the appointed mayor (discussions on changing this to an elected position are currently taking place), the municipal executive and the elected municipal council. The municipal council is principally charged wi th the approval and implementation of local land use planning policy. The mayor and executive branch (principally the Department of Public Works and City Development) are responsible for the preparation of plans and supporting memoranda. The major local pl anning implementation tools are the structure plan, the allocation plan, the urban renewal plan and the living conditions ordinance , the latter for use in urban areas. The Structure (\"Structuur\") Plan The structure plan outlines the future structural deve lopment of the municipality with its rural hinterland and is to be revised every 10 years. It is comparable to the master or comprehensive plans of Michigan townships, but it is more detailed in defining the desired planning objectives and general location s of major land uses. It also outlines the direction and limitations of urban expansion into the surrounding rural area. Sometimes it reflects interjurisdictional plans if jointly prepared and approved by an adjacent municipality \u2014 the so -called intermunic ipal structure plan. The function of the plan is to determine prospective spatial and socioeconomic development, and to serve as a reference for the formulation of municipal planning policy by merging national and regional land use policies with local pref erences. The Spatial Planning Act gives the municipal council the right, but not the obligation, to adopt a structure plan. It is not legally binding but may have legal and potentially financial consequences for certain actions, such as the identification of areas for urban renewal, land acquisition, expropriation and urban expansion. It is also the basis for the approval of the land allocation plan by the provincial government. 73 The Land Allocation (\"Bestemmings\") Plan The allocation plan is a legally bin ding document, much like the zoning and wetland preservation ordinances used in Michigan. The Spatial Planning Act mandates that each municipality establish an allocation plan subject to revision every 10 years for the territory outside the built -up areas. For urbanized areas, the development of an allocation plan is optional. The allocation plan effectively designates specific land use for a 10 -year time span, demarcating urban growth and service boundaries and the detailed location, specific land use and density of residential, institutional, recreational and industrial land development. All building permits are issued in compliance with the allocation plan . Subject to reviews and approvals, exemptions may be granted with cause, analogous with the zoning v ariances in Michigan. However, exemptions are rarely granted and are subject to extensive approval proceedings. Allocation plans are generally quite detailed in their designation of land uses, including detailed maps with the specific type, the land use mi x and the height of development permitted for a given location. Local jurisdictions have some latitude in determining the specific land use plan details, including use regulations. The Urban Renewal Plan This plan has the same legal status as the allocati on plan and addresses the revitalization of urban areas. It is mandated by the Town and Village Renewal Act and is implementation -oriented, whereas the allocation plan is prescriptive in nature. Living Conditions Ordinance This urban development tool is a lso mandated by the Town and Village Renewal Act . It is a proactive ordinance designed to prevent urban deterioration specifically associated with living and working conditions, or aesthetics. With this ordinance, intervention takes place more quickly and permits a municipality to influence urban revitalization more effectively than would be case in an allocation plan or an urban renewal plan . This ordinance may specify use rules to prevent or reverse deterioration of residential or commercial buildings. It is designed to enforce standards rather than improve conditions. 74 Growth Management and Open Space Preservation The structure and allocation plans reflect national and regional growth priorities in aggregate land use categories (space allocated, housing u nits, commercial and industrial acreage, etc.). The implied hard growth boundaries for a designated time period encourage concentrated development patterns of compact urban agglomerations. The planning instruments outlined above are instrumental and effec tive in directing and controlling growth. First, they focus on the development of the \"compact city model\": the creation of mixed land uses (living, working, education, recreation and public services) reachable by various modes of public transportation, a constant revitalization of the central city including its housing and retailing sectors, and the promotion of walkable communities enhanced by easy access to schools and recreational facilities. Second, the local government is an active participant in the development process, buying land and controlling infrastructural development and defining access to basic services such as water, sewer and utilities. This amounts to precisely defined growth boundaries over time, prevents significant land speculation, and directs and controls residential development in green space as necessary to accommodate urban expansion where it is most suitable or desirable. The notion of development rights held by private landowners is therefore limited by the growth zones identified in local allocation plans and modified for future time periods, as necessary, to serve the public interest and development priorities. Both planning practices and fiscal policies reinforce long -term planning at the national, regional and local levels whil e effectively preserving open space. 2.7.2 Planning in New Zealand More than 90 percent of New Zealanders are urban dwellers even though the country's economy is reliant on exporting primary products to distant global markets. A majority of the populatio n lives in and around the five metropolitan regions: Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. The drivers of urban growth in New Zealand are much the same as in Indonesia even though the scale of the problem is relatively much smaller. Con temporary urban growth trends through out New Zealand reflect long 75 standing cultural preferences for low density living in peri -urban settings dependent on easy access to private transport. These forces have encouraged population dispersal, which, if not m anaged well, could become sprawl. The growth pressures in New Zealand cities, as elsewhere, are focused on the suburban and fringe locations while a number of the inner city areas are in relative decline in terms of population and economic activity. Metrop olitan Auckland, a large part of the North Island north of Taupo and Christchurch in the South Island face many of the same pressures and potential problems as urban areas in many industrialized nations. With a population of just over a million, Auckland is a relatively small metropolis by global standards. However, its population is distributed over a large land area equivalent to that of European and Asian cities with populations two to three times that of Auckland. Until recently, the metropolitan form and function of Auckland had evolved since the 1870s in an incremental ad hoc fashion. Overlapping , fragmented local government jurisdiction was considered a major constraint on effective governance. The cumulative impact of shortsighted decisions has beco me manifest during the last decade. Auckland has suffered a series of serious crises that have been attributed to an overburdened and aging water, transport and power infrastructure. Local government authorities within Auckland embarked on a strategic met ropolitan growth management initiative about a decade ago that has the potential to significantly enhance the institutional capacity for regional governance. A number of other provincial metropolitan cities in New Zealand, including Christchurch and Tauran ga, have also recently embarked on strategic planning initiatives that have been motivated by the apparent success of Auckland. The new Local Government Act, enacted in 2002, envisages elected local government authorities in New Zealand taking a lead role to formulate and implement strategies for sustainable development in collaboration with other stakeholders. The following section will review the significance of the Auckland initiative from a wider perspective of collaborative planning. Lessons from aro und the world suggest that 76 sticking to an agreed vision over the longer term is crucial to achieving community objectives for promoting urban sustainability. In Auckland, New Zealand's largest metropolitan city, the region's councils have finally decided t o work together, in co - operation with central government and other stakeholders, to implement the growth strategy and meet regional needs. They have been compelled to do this in response to the growth crisis facing the metropolitan community. The Instituti onal Framework Most of the responsibility for urban growth management in New Zealand is devolved to elected regional and city and district councils. Central government has refrained from taking a strong proactive role to provide policy direction in this sp here. Thus, New Zealand does not have a national urban growth strategy or a national land use strategy. The apparent rationale for this policy stance on the part of successive central governments has been that the land use regulation function is deemed pri marily a local government responsibility, arguably a reflection of the ideological importance attached to private property ownership in New Zealand. This situation may bear a distant resemblance to the \"home rule\" ideology in some states in the US . However , in contrast to the more voluntary and sometimes limited pro-active planning role of local government in the US , in New Zealand elected urban territorial local authority jurisdictions have been required by the Parliament since the 1950s to undertake land use planning and regulation under the town and country planning legislation. However, developing capability for planning at a metropolitan regional level has proved more problematic. In the metropolitan regions of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and D unedin, fragmented local government, parochialism and fiscal competition for growth amongst contiguous authorities have constrained regional cooperation in the past. Two particular objectives of the wide ranging local government reforms under the Local Government Act 1988 were to amalgamate small territorial jurisdictions into larger units to provide economies of scale and stronger capability for governance at the local level and at the regional level to amalgamate special purpose ad hoc jurisdictions such as river 77 catchment (watershed) boards with overlapping jurisdictions into elected regional authorities. The principal legislative instrument for urban planning in New Zealand is the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA)2, which has several positive attribut es as an environmental planning statute. It provides a statutory framework for a holistic and integrated approach to environmental planning and management based on ecological and democratic principles. It replaces a large number of formerly separate and so metimes inconsistent overlapping environmental statutes to provide a relatively integrated focus on natural resources and the built environment. The purpose of the Act is defined in terms of the principle of sustainability. The Act recognizes that govern ment has an important role in environmental planning and defines a hierarchical, three -tier planning framework. This hierarchy is based on the assumption that decisions should be made as close as possible to the level of community of interest where the eff ects and benefits accrue. Within this hierarchy, regional councils have a pivotal role in integrated resource management while the role of city and district councils is focused more explicitly on land use planning. While there have been difficulties in securing cooperation between the local and regional government tiers in some metropolitan communities such as Christchurch, local government authorities in Auckland have been relatively more successful in developing a collaborative approach to address issues of urban growth management, as discussed in the next section. The more recently enacted Local Government Act of 2002 significantly widens the political mandate of local government (territorial and regional councils) in New Zealand to empower it to promot e the objective of sustainable development encompassing social, economic, cultural and environmental well -being of communities. A key instrument to achieve this objective will be the preparation and implementation of Long Term Council Community Plans (LTCC Ps), based on wide ranging community consultation and input 2 The Resource Management Act 1991 combined the Town and Country Planning Act; 1977 with several other environmental statutes. 78 by stakeholder groups. The LTCCPs are expected to become the key strategic planning and public accountability document for all council activities. With specific reference to urban growth managemen t, the LTCCPs are expected to provide the long term policy direction for regional policy statements and district plans prepared under the RMA. How well these two planning statutes will succeed in working together to address problems of urban growth managem ent in New Zealand communities' remains to be seen. The Auckland Experience 3 Burdened by a historical legacy of lack of political leadership and poor planning, Auckland has recently manifested a stronger political commitment to address issues of urban gr owth management within the metropolitan region. Urban growth pressures and associated congestion and pressures on services are most severe in Auckland compared to elsewhere in New Zealand: The Auckland region is home to almost 1.2 million people and has gr own by 90,000 people (8.4 percent) since 1996. The region has 30 percent of New Zealand's population of 3.8 million. 54 percent of population growth over the last two decades was due to natural increase and the balance due to domestic and international mi gration. 32 percent of New Zealand's workforce is in the Auckland Region. The region is projected to reach 2 million people by 2050 (an average increase of 20,000 people per year). Much of the region's infrastructure needs upgrading to meet increasing dem and and higher environmental standards. Over $2 billion needs to be spent in the next 25 years on water supply, drainage and transport alone. Car use is growing by around 4 percent per year. The Auckland Regional Council was established following local g overnment reforms in 1988. Its predecessors had not proved particularly effective in addressing issues of 3 The following review is based on information obtained from the website for the Auckland Regional Growth Forum ( www.growthforum.govt.nz ) and interviews with two senior staff members of the Auckland Regional Council. 79 growth management on account of local parochialism and pressures from vested development interests. The Regional Council's urban growth strategy is fo r regional urban containment matched by urban intensification policies at the local authority level. This strategy has been developed during the last ten years and is being implemented through a two -pronged approach. The first is via the Regional Policy St atement prepared in 1994 within the statutory context of the RMA. The second is a non -statutory collaborative strategic planning initiative which commenced in 1997 to bring together the technical and political interests of the Auckland Regional Council and the constituent local authorities and other public and private sector stakeholders. This initiative is known as the Auckland Regional Growth Forum. The Regional Policy Statement The Metropolitan Urban Limits (MULs) is a technique used in the operative Auckland Regional Policy Statement to define the boundary between the urban area and the rural part of the region. The notion of controlling the outward spread of Auckland through an urban growth boundary type mechanism has been a policy in Auckland regiona l planning documents for nearly 50 years. The reasons for doing this have changed over time. Originally, the primary objective was to sequence growth so that infrastructure could be provided more efficiently and to protect highly productive agricultural la nd. More recently, the main objectives of the MULs have been broadened to protect sensitive rural and coastal environments from peripheral growth and to achieve containment and intensification of the urban area. The method by which the metropolitan urban l imits have been determined and implemented in Auckland has also changed over time. Earlier, under former town and country planning legislation, the determination and implementation of the MULs was left primarily in the hands of the individual territorial l ocal authorities (TLAs), which was not very effective. Under the RMA, the location of MULs has been defined in the Regional Policy Statement (RPS) by the Auckland Regional Council. The RMA stipulates that district plans must not be inconsistent with region al policy statements. Thus, the MULs within the RPS have a controlling effect on land development policies of individual 80 territorial local authorities. For this reason, the role of the Auckland Regional Council to determine urban growth limits was initiall y contested by some territorial local authorities but subsequently affirmed by the Courts. The Auckland Regional Growth Forum (ARGF) The Auckland Regional Growth Forum (ARGF), established in 1996, is a cooperative partnership between the Auckland Regional Council, the region's territorial local authorities and other stakeholder groups to further develop and implement the strategy for managing the effects of growth in the Auckland region as set out in the Regional Policy Statement. The ARGF was established to examine the options and alternatives for future growth and to manage its effects on the environment, infrastructure and local communities. Faced with a rapidly growing population, a demand for 300,000 more dwellings by 2050 and huge infrastructure costs , the councils were compelled to work more closely to resolve urban growth issues, a significant political departure from the situation hitherto. The Auckland Regional Growth Forum has 10 political members (mayors and councilors), three from the Auckland R egional Council and one each from the seven territorial local authorities. A \"Steering Group\" comprised of senior officers from the same authorities, plus the Ministry for the Environment, provides overall technical direction. The Auckland Regional Growth Forum is a standing committee of the Auckland Regional Council. It is funded by the Auckland Regional Council through the regional land rate. Other participating councils also fund the time of their elected representatives and staff to support the Growth F orum. A 1998 amendment to the Local Government Act 1974 formalized the existence and role of the Growth Forum and established Infrastructure Auckland to make grants for land, passenger transport and storm water infrastructure projects in the region. The Re gional Growth Forum has developed a Regional Growth Strategy looking ahead to the year 2050 , which is now in the process of being implemented (Figure 2 .13). 81 The need for such a strategy reflects the councils' desires to work more collaboratively to resol ve urban growth issues. The Auckland Regional Growth Strategy is a product of over three years' planning involving technical investigations, political workshops and extensive consultation with public and private sector organizations in the region, as well as the general public and central government agencies. It builds on a draft strategy published in 1998 and takes account of comments to that document. The Regional Growth Strategy emphasizes an integrated approach to the long -term management of the Aucklan d region. The strategy brings together a wide range of important policy directions for the region, encompassing a partnership approach between Growth Forum members and close consultation with their stakeholders and communities. The Auckland Regional Growt h Strategy was formally adopted in November 1999. It provides a vision for what Auckland could look like in 2050 with a po pulation of 2 million (Figure 2.14 ). It promotes quality compact urban environments and identifies, among other things: Areas in the r egion where urban development should not occur; Opportunities for peripheral urban development and intensification in the future; Appropriate locations for further employment growth; and The implications for transport and other regional infrastructure. Chapter 2 of the Growth Strategy provides a list of the values that the regional community has said they want to protect and enhance over the next 50 years. These desired regional outcomes include improving air and water quality, protecting the coastal envir onment, habitat and heritage, and ensuring employment and housing choice and business opportunity. Chapter 3 of the Growth Strategy outlines how these outcomes will be achieved and what will be important for successful implementation of the strategy. 82 Figure 2.13 - The ARGS Development Process (Source: Regional Growth Forum 1999). 83 The key outcome areas relate to: social infrastructure housing choice and affordability amenity and design business and employment opportunities transport regional transpo rt needs servicing employment areas transport needs of rural and coastal towns and suburban areas transport needs of intensive urban areas environment physical infrastructure. Implementation Process When the region's councils signed the Memorandum of Understanding in November 1999, they affirmed their support for and commitment to the implementation of the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy. The process for implementing the Growth Strategy has five themes: partnerships and relationships; the need for alignment of policy and funding; long term vision and identified short term actions; wide and adaptable range of implementation mechanisms; and a process to keep the vision alive. Keeping the vision alive is a key role of the Regional Growth Forum. It is also responsible for coordinating the implementation of the strategy, as well as its monitoring and review. 84 Figure 2.14 - The growth concept: 2050. (Source ARGF 1999) 85 Growth Forum partners (the ARC and the territorial local authorities) are developing a strong advocacy role. They are principally responsibl e for ongoing participation and for aligning their own policy and funding to support the strategy. The ARC is also responsible for the Regional Land Transport Strategy, environmental management, regional plans and purchasing passenger transport services fr om public transport operators. The territorial local authorities are responsible for local land use planning and infrastructure provision. Implementing the sector agreements involves participatory community processes and a close working relationship with i nfrastructure providers, land owners and the development industry. A range of policy mechanisms is being used to implement the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy, as shown in Figure 2.15 . Figure 2 .15 - Policy mechanisms to implement the regional growth s trategy (Source: ARGF, 1999) 86 It is expected that policy approaches and tools will inevitably evolve and change over time and around the region through an adaptive learning process. Some of the key drivers of the implementation process are as follows: Trans lating vision into action The key planning approach is to provide more detail about the timing, sequencing and form of growth and associated infrastructure through Sector Agreements (discussed below). This process seeks to bring the broad vision of the Reg ional Growth Strategy down to action and to fine tune what the strategy means on the ground. Aligning policy and funding The region's councils are committed under the Memorandum of Understanding to align their own corporate policy and funding priorities an d processes to support the strategy. This means that councils have agreed to initiate changes, within three years, to regional and district plans under the Resource Management Act 1991, to ensure consistency with the Regional Growth Strategy, and to implem ent the endorsed sector agreements. They have also agreed that by no later than 2003/4 financial year their individual strategic, long term financial and asset management plans and funding policies will clearly identify and support the implementation of th e Regional Growth Strategy. Sector Agreements give more of the detail A sector agreement identifies capacities for growth in each of the regional sectors and the timing and sequencing of the release of that capacity to 2021. It also identifies the provisi on of associated infrastructure, when statutory processes to release will commence and how these processes will be funded. Sector agreements have now been developed and endorsed for all parts of the region. The Southern Sector Agreement (covering sequencin g, timing and capacity for urban development for Manukau City, Papakura and Franklin Districts) was endorsed by the Growth Forum in March 2001. Consequently, the councils have notified changes to 87 district and regional plans to adjust the metropolitan urban limits (MUL) and to incorporate new greenfield areas in Flatbush and Takanini. Planning is also underway for more intensive nodal development focused initially on Papakura Central, the Glenora and Spartan Roads of Takanini, Pukekhoe Central, Papatoetoe/Hu nters Corner, Manukau City Centre and Manurewa. The sector will accommodate a further 106,000 population in the next 20 years, and 275,000 population over 50 years through greenfield, nodal and infill development. The southern sector councils are now worki ng on a rural sector agreement in order to understand more clearly the capacity and demand for rural growth and its implications, both in the rural areas and on the take -up of urban development opportunities. The Central Sector Agreement was endorsed by th e Growth Forum in September 2001. The central sector, which falls entirely within Auckland City, will accommodate up to a further 94,000 people by 2021. Priority areas for growth include the Central Area and Western and Eastern Strategic Growth management Areas (SGMAs) identified in the Liveable Communities 2050 Strategy. This includes centres such as Avondale, Panmure, Glen Innes and Newmarket, as well as new development areas such as Sylvia Park. A joint North -West Sector Agreement (covering North Shore a nd Waitakere Cities and Rodney District) was endorsed by the Growth Forum in September 2001. The North - West Sector Agreement will add population capacities of 76,000 to North Shore City, 74,000 to Waitakere City and 71,000 to Rodney District, by 2021. In W aitakere, the council is working through more detailed planning matters associated with intensification within the existing urban area, the sequencing of development and MUL changes for the future growth areas in the northern part of the city, as well as r esolving outstanding District Plan appeals. Getting the transport network right A doubling of the population will have major impacts on the transport system - major transport improvements are needed. These will have significant community and environmental implications. 88 An effective transport system is a key component of the Growth Strategy. The strategy sees a shift in land use patterns to focus growth in more intensive mixed use centers associated with access to the northern, western and southern passenger transit corridors, as well as the main arterial roads. The growth strategy recognizes that transport requirements and priorities for employment and residential areas (rural, suburban and intensive) will differ. The concentration of more people in an urba n area gives more opportunities for better passenger transport - more choice of routes and higher frequencies. Passenger transport investment can also be a catalyst for achieving urban intensification. Significant improvements will be needed to support the mixed use more intensive centers and corridors. Careful design will be essential to maintain and improve liveability in these areas and to manage the conflicting needs of pedestrians, cyclists, buses, cars and passenger transit systems. Future roading inv estment will also be needed to maintain accessibility on the region's arterial network and to the port and airport. The Regional Land Transport Strategy is the key mechanism to develop the transport system. Released in 1999, it is currently under review. T he region's Passenger Transport Action Plan identifies passenger transport investment required to help achieve transport and growth objectives. Cost sharing arrangements Much of the Auckland region's infrastructure is already under pressure and needs upgrading to meet increasing demand and higher environmental standards: wastewater and storm water treatment, water supply, transport, energy, refuse disposal, as well as providing for education, health, community services and open space. Over $7 billion needs to be spent in the next 25 years on water supply, drainage and transport alone. While a mixture of land tax and user charges will continue to meet the bulk of those costs, development levies and other funding mechanisms are expected to feature more promin ently (e.g. congestion pricing). Other funding bodies such as Infrastructure Auckland (transport and stormwater), the government's road funding agency 89 (Transfund), and service delivery companies such as Watercare and private companies, such as Telecom, wil l also be important in the mix. The coordination of this investment is crucial. Monitorin g A monitoring program has been developed with a threefold focus: measuring growth in the region, measuring the effects of that growth on valued aspects of the region, and measuring the implementation efforts of the Forum partners (ARGF, undated). A crucial part of the Regional Growth Strategy is the concept that the document will change as circumstances change. Such changes might include central government policy refor ms or significant market shifts. Like wise, periodic monitoring may indicate that strategy outcomes are not being achieved over time. Some key indicators being monitored are: is the Growth Strategy promoting strong supportive communities, a high quality li ving and natural environment and good accessibility? Are more people living in intensive mixed use areas? Do they like it? Are they traveling less for work and leisure and have travel choices improved? Can new and expanding businesses find suitable premise s or land, in the right locations and with the appropriate infrastructure? Are the beaches any cleaner? Are people happy with local parks, shops, health, recreational and education facilities? How do they rate Auckland as a place to live? The Growth Strate gy is also subject to an annual audit of performance . This focuses on whether each of the Growth Forum partners (the region's councils) are pulling their weight in terms of their own responsibilities for implementing and supporting the Growth Strategy. Cer tain commitments are outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding and in the sector agreements, endorsed by all councils. The results of the monitoring program are used to assess whether or not the outcomes of the strategy are being met and whether changes to implementation methods or the policy itself are needed when the strategy is reviewed. The strategy looks out 50 years and the achievement of some of the desired regional outcomes will only be measurable in that longer term. The Growth Strategy will be reviewed every five years. The first major 90 review will be in 2004/5, when there will be an opportunity for wide public and stakeholder input to complement research and monitoring data. Conclusions on New Zealand's Planning In contrast to the other metropo litan cities in New Zealand, Auckland has manifestly been more successful in crafting workable institutional arrangements for developing and implementing a strategy for addressing wide ranging and inter -related concerns related to Auckland's urban form and structure sustainability framework. These issues have been recently addressed in Auckland through a process of public dialogue and research in the context of the preparation of the Auckland Regional Policy Statement and the parallel Urban Growth Forum. The Forum considered strategic growth issues for the next 50 years. More significantly, this Forum brought the councils together and, as an important milestone, led to the signing by both Mayors and Chief Executives in November 1999 of a joint Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Central government has played a key role in encouraging collaborative planning. That memorandum also identified the urban growth related issues to be covered by all councils and service agencies in three Sector Agreements covering the whole region. This work was undertaken during 2000/2001and included a program for staging of the development, management of the urban limits and provision of utility services. Sector Agreements have been prepared by the local councils in consultation with the regional council, service providers, central government agencies, land owners and the private sector. Each Sector Agreement also defines a means of monitoring the programme to ensure it meets the targets of the Regional Growth Strategy. After the si gning of the Urban Growth Forum's MoU, the Sector Agreements were adopted within the second three year electoral term of the councils. Thus, the whole of this non -statutory exercise that binds the political and technical arms of the city/district councils together with the regional council took only six years and was free from major Environment Court (and High Court) actions, in significant contrast to the experience with the Regional Policy Statement during the mid -1990s. It could be argued that such a 91 public information and consultation process is essential for all of the five metropolitan regions in New Zealand. It provides leadership and guidance on sustainable development and lays the groundwork for managing cumulative effects of urban growth and change within the context of the RMA. However, on account of contextual differences, it would be unrealistic to expect that the Auckland growth management model can be read across elsewhere in New Zealand or, indeed, overseas. Inevitably, tensions continue to surface in the negotiations amongst the different Auckland stakeholders during the course of implementing the growth strategy. What the Auckland case study clearly demonstrates, nevertheless, is that in a plural land owning democracy such as New Zealand or Michigan, an urban metropolitan region cannot be planned by a single regional authority alone. Cooperation, mutual respect and collaboration must be achieved between district and regional councils as planning authorities, other statutory and community sta keholder groups and central government. An agreement or Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), outside the statutory RMA process, as emerged from the Auckland Regional Growth Forum, can be an effective political catalyst and a foundation for a statutory region al plan. The MoU was necessary to the development of an agreed Regional Growth Strategy and management of the Metropolitan Urban Limits (MUL). The outcomes of these consultative processes can then be embedded in the more explicit statutory provisions of th e Regional Policy Statement (RPS) for a regional settlement strategy and in the more detailed district plan provisions for land use regulation by territorial local authorities. The relationship between the LTCCPs, required to be completed by all local aut horities by 2006 under the provisions of the new Local Government Act 2002, and the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy still remains to be clarified. It is likely that the Regional Growth Strategy will sit under the umbrella of the LTCCP for the Auckland re gion as may the reviewed Regional Land Transport Strategy and possibly other regional strategies for affordable housing, open space, the coast and for recreation. 92 2.8 Guidelines and Indicators for Monitoring and Evaluation The principal goals of monito ring and evaluation is to ensure that (clearly defined) program or project objectives are reached by means of monitoring and evaluation at intermediate and final stages of implementation. Resulting feedback is used to make the necessary implementation adju stments , assuming that it is still realistic to achieve basic goals and related objectives. Goals and objectives should be well -articulated and expressed in qualitative or (ideally) in quantitative terms: objective target indicators that can be measured an d evaluated. Base line studies are part of this process. They help to diagnose issues and problems and, therefore can be used to express the current state or problems in terms of diagnostic indicators. As such, b ase line studies or resource inventories r epresent the first phase of economic d evelopment planning and project feasibility studies. The inventory identifies the status of principal components of the four ecosystem components -- soil, water, plants and wildlife, as well as non -renewable resources such as minerals, but also identifies current land cover/use patterns and trends . Most base line studies define the bio -physical parameters of the resource base and, therefore, may be used to derive composite biological productive indices. Examples include wetland ecosystem productivity or the agricultural productivity of certain agro -ecological zones. For instance, a comparative crop productivity index may be derived, using a combination of soil types (e.g., textural classes), climate parameters (soil wa ter balance) and topography (impacts on surface recharge and evapotranspiration) to depict relative production (moisture) constraints by agro -ecological zones or administrative district. In the case of food security concerns, this provides an example of a diagnostic (problem) index, which may be used to identify the comparative advantage of alternative locations to meet national or regional food production needs. Similarly, current use intensity and trends may be used to identify potential conflicts, now a nd in the future, where existing carrying capacity may be exceeded or where harvest/depletion rates exceed reproductive capacity. 93 Such diagnostic demand analysis framework, including some relevant diagnostic indicators, is suggested to systematically ide ntify needs, opportunities and targets in the form of biophysical and socioeconomic indicators. Performance and monitoring indicators are primarily intended to evaluate the degree of success (or failure) in reaching development objectives, measured in th e form of specific standards or p olicy targets. Below, several examples are introduced which attempt to illustrate the use of composite indicators in this regard. It is important to realize that development of these indicators is not an objective in itself , rather the intent is to design effective measures that can be used to evaluate program or project performance and adjust policies and their implementation. The following grouping of major policy target areas is suggested with a focus on relevant measures with respect to: a) the status and quality of the resource base - emphasizing supply -side policy issues or supply indicators, b) the resource capacity, use rates and trends - emphasizing demand -side policy issues or demand indicators, c) natural and human -manag ed ecosystems , their relative exposure and vulnerability to human intervention and use - emphasizing life support indicators, and d) land use policy and quality of life impacts - with an specific emphasis on human exposure and risk - emphasizing impact indic ators. The following examples of aggregate target indicators that can be measured and monitored are provided : Resource Capacity and Quality . Here various composite indicators may be used to define the productive status (supply, availability and qualit y) of renewable and non - renewable resource, including soils, minerals, air and water. For instance, the following composite environmental indicators may be used to describe air, water or soil quality: a) Climate change - including single concentration ind icators for CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O b) Ozone depletion - including CFC -11 and - 12 emissions 94 c) Acidification of the environment - SOx, NOx, NH 3 emissions and concentrations d) Eutrophication of the Environment - N, P concentrations in water and soil e) Dispe rsion of toxic substances - including heavy metals and known carcinogens f) Dispersion of toxic substances Indicator - pathways and dispersal rates effecting risk, g) Generation and disposal of solid waste, and h) Composite pollution indicator - the latt er a composite of 6 indicators each measured in units of environmental pressure equivalents, including environmental change, acidification, eutrophication, toxic dispersion, waste disposal and disturbance. Resource Depletion . This composite indicator can be formulated for countries and regions, measuring the ratio of resource depletion and the gross capital formulation. It illustrates how human activities based on natural resources production or extraction can be sustained. This includes typical examples o f mineral and fossil fuel extraction and also those of renewable resources (the supporting resource base), including managed ecosystems such as agriculture, fisheries and forests, and groundwater systems. Examples include water resource use/demand and qual ity, forest biomass regeneration, reforestation and harvest rates, aquatic resources including fishery stocks and harvest rates, soils resources and degradation rates. The ratio with capital formation illustrates the value of the decline of the resource st ocks (or capital) relative to the value of investments in human -made capital. This ratio identifies sustainable use policies as those creating new fixed assets equal or of greater value than those depleted by resource use. Ecosystem Protection and Vulnerab ility. This composite indicator is designed to represent the degree of protection that essential and critical ecosytems are accorded through national environmental policies, laws and regulations. It may reflect the type, degree and areal extent of ecosys tem protection and the vulnerabilities of ecosystems and the composing species. Biodiversity, as a measure expressing the number of species per area unit, can be used as an effective indicator in this process. However , policies should not focus simply on t his single performance indicator but rather attempt to measure integral ecosystem characteristics, including their functional 95 capacities, connectivity and fragmentation (critical size). Vulnerability must address the degree of protection through buffer zo nes and other management practices, which may threaten the long -term viability of ecosystems. Human quality of life conditions . This include the basic notion of primary needs (food, shelter and clothing and related measures of employment and income), the secondary needs such as more discretionary measures as education, health care and environmental risk factors (e.g. water quality and sanitation), and the tertiary needs or wants, such as access to recreational opportunity, other community services and other aspects of environmental / ecosystem quality.

While maintaining the importance of GDP for measuring living standards, the supporters of this approach argue that the level of people's welfare should also be measured by two other parameters: longevity and knowledge. Longevity is measured by life expectancy at birth, while knowledge is measured by a combination of the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary an d tertiary gross enrollment ratio in education . This alternative measurement is a breakthrough since it combines the need for short -term policy (economic growth) and long -term policy (higher social investment in education and healthcare). In Indonesia, e conomic growth can (and has been) achieved in a relatively short period, such as with the discovery of new oil fields or new investment in the mining sector , and the exploitation of its natural resources . Achievement s in education, nutrition and the health care however, require a long-term continuous policy commitment and social spending that may take decades to deliver the expected outcome. The HDI has been quite useful in measuring relative progress in the improvement of people's welfare and compare it wi th other countries. Tracing back its HDI trough the 1980s, Indonesia's HDI has been consistently at the bottom half of the ASEAN list, together with Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. However, f rom 2000 to 2008, Indonesia's HDI grew from 0.671 to 0.726, with most of the growth reached between 2000 and 2004 (0.714 in 2004). Income disparity however continues to increase . 98 In the HDI only income and gross enrolment are somewhat responsive to short term policy changes. For that reason, it is important to exam ine changes over time. The human development index trends tell an important story in that respect. Between 1980 and 2007 Indonesia's HDI rose by 1.26% annually from 0.522 to 0.734 today. The 5 columns below summarize the relative world ranking of Indonesi a by composite HDI, Life Expectancy, L iteracy, Combined Education al Enrollment and GDP4.

Given the small scale, subsistence agriculture of areas considered for priorit y agrarian reform initiatives, it is essential to look at crop diversification and expansion opportunities for small scale producers that could meet domestic needs. It is well -know that large amount of products are imported to meet domestic dema nd, such as from China. In this context, the potential role of small -scale producers, aided by potential cooperative input, harvesting, processing, and marketing arrangements should be investigated. Small scale producers could focus specifically on fruits and veget ables, grown on existing or new homesteads as part of a land distribution scheme, or could cultivate larger areas held as communal land and given land use rights on substantial hectares to cultivate. The 4 For a complete l isting of measures included in Indonesia's 2009 world rank of 111 see: http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/da ta_sheets/cty_ds_IDN.htmlhttp://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data _sheets/cty_ds_IDN.html 99 question is which agricultural products should be co nsidered in such agrarian reform scheme , based on domestic need reflected in the import trends of fruits and vegetables ? This question may be answered by the following paragraphs and table s, in a summary compiled by Morelink Asia Pacific ( Personal Communi cation received August 2008 ). Indonesian fruit imports continue to expand , reaching 463,000 tons (US$412.8 million) in 2007, an increase of 18% on the previous year. Over the last 13 years, Indonesian fruit imports have increased by an average annual growt h rate of 41% (in volume), up from 72,600 tones (US$59.7 million) in 19945. The main fruits imported in 2007 were temperate fruits comprising apples (145,301 tons), pears (94,518 tons), mandarins (89,125 tons), grapes (27,395 tons) and oranges (23,567 tons ). These five fruits comprised 82% of the volume of Indonesia's fruit imports in year 2007. Most of the growth over the last thirteen years in volume of imported fruit has occurred with pears (up 1,207%), mandarins (up 907%), grapes (up 472%) and apples (up 362%). Imports of tropical fruits (mainly durian and longan from Thailand) have been increasing also and comprised about 17% of fruit imports in 2007. Table 2.4 summarized these trends Table 2.4 - Indonesia Fruit Imports (in tons) Product 1994 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 109 2 5 2.6 2.1 Cherries 20 100 58 41 65.6 20.6 Peaches 32 152 162 108 126.9 70.8 Plums 133 210 208 215 185.8 199.5 629 626 17.6 Mango 8 348 689 869 966.3 1088.2 Lemon 127 95 286 562 636.0 785.4 5 Morelink Asia Pacific (August 2008) 100 Grapefruit 150 64 352 350 657.3 302.1 Water melon 140 39 148 668 441.8 921.2 Other melon 0 142 656 171 207.3 111.0 Other berries 1 749 98 23 15.2 33.0 Durian 432 3,099 11,087 of Statistics Indonesia) Similarly, Indonesian vegeta ble imports increased by an average of 65% per year since 1994 to reach 505,000 tonnes (US$193 million) in 2007, up from 54,000 tonnes in 1994 (US$33 million). The main vegetables imported in 2007 were garlic (341,102 tonnes), shallots (107,649 tons), onio ns (25,448 tonnes) and carrots (20,433 tonnes). These four vegetables comprised 98% of the volume of Indonesia's vegetable imports in year 2004. (Table 2.5) The major suppliers of the four main imported vegetables are as follows: Garlic - China (99%) Shallots - Thailand (76%), Philippines (11%) Onions - New Zealand (40%), Netherlands (33%), India (12%), China (8%) Carrots - China (91%) Table 2.5 - Trends in Indonesia Vegetable Imports over a 13 -year Period Total of Indonesia's Imports of Selected Fresh Vegetables, by Volume, 1994 - 2007 (Tons) Commodity Descripton 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2006 2007 Potatoes, Fresh or Chilled Seed 866.0 1,209.7 362.9 : Morelink Asia Pacific (August 2008) Source : The Indonesian Bureau of Statistics (BPS) To ascertain the domestic production response, the following tables are useful (Table 2.6 and 2.7). Indonesia produced 16.6 million tons of fruit in 2007 up from 7.2 million tons in 1998; an increase of 15% per year over the last nine years. The main fruits produced in 2007 were bananas (5.5 million tons), orange (2.6 million tons), pineapple (2.2 milion tons) and mango (1.8 million tons). The biggest growth over the last nine years has been with orange, pineapple and mango. Table 2.6 - Fruits Production in Indonesia, 1998 - 2007, (tons) Table.

Bangka Belitung, Bant en, Gorontalo & North Maluku There are 31 provinces in Indonesia that produce over 20 types of vegetables . However , 85% of all vegetables are grown on the islands of Java and Sumatra. The major vegetable producing provinces are: West (36%), Centra l 2%) and North Sumatra (10%); these four provinces account for over 70% of all vegetable production. As can be observed from the data, there exist considerable opportunity to expand production and meet domestic demand for fruits and vegetable, especially on Java and Sumatra. It is recomm ended that a systematic analysis will be conducted to explore production opportunities for the most promising crops, and use these data to identify cropping systems that may be most beneficial in a dvancing local agrarian reform programs. As such, these crop mixes may also become be part of agro -forestry systems that are suitable for homestead gardens, the focus of the next section of this report. 104 2.10 Defining Prototype Homestead Agro -forestry S ystems and Potential Land Utilization Systems in Pilot Agrarian Reform Schemes . As indicated earlier, the primary objective of land evaluation is to determine the suitability of land use alternatives given prevailing agro -ecological conditions. In the context of potential large land distribution schemes, the question is how to define Land Utilization Types (LUTs ) that reflect the most promising farming system or agro -forestry mix that could represent a series of best land use alternatives and derived hous ehold production systems . Such LUTs would ideally be the focus of agrarian reform pilot schemes based on well -defined tenures and land rights arrangements based on private or communal property rights or a mix, thereof, and potential cooperative arrangemen ts on input, harvesting, processing, packages and transportation within the new or existing community development program. A recent evaluation of homestead agro -forestry systems on Java indicated that small househ olds cultivating as little as 120 -1000 squ are meters may already benefit for such land use arrangements, even if the primary source of income is outside the hou sehold6. A survey of very small scale homestead farming systems in three Javanese provinces was conducted to analyze the potential benefi cial effects on household's quality of life. Aspects included: (1) diet and nutrition, (2) income, (3) level of goods and material assets, (4) family status, (5) credit access, and (6) the role of women in managing production and marketing. The survey en compassed sites on West , Central and East Java, representing a wide range of agro -ecological, 6 watersheds, elevation, socio -cultural conditions and stages of development. The plot sizes evaluated ranged from < 120 m2 with no other agricultural land (OAL ) to 120 -400 m2 with < 1,000 m2 OAL. The average household plot size was about 240 m2 (with open space of at least 140 m2) and OAL of 500 m2. Around 5.7% of the sample villages were, by national standards, considered to be at an advanced 6 Arifin et al., 2009. IPB. 105 development state , with 82.9% at medium state, and the rest least developed. On the average, very small homestead plots contributed little to household diet in terms of reduced food expenses (9.9%). Nutritional benefits are primarily in the form of vitamin A and C - 2.4% a nd 23.6% of recommended dietary allowance (RDA), respectively and only 1.9% of either carbohydrates or protein. These small plots contributed around 11% to household income, about 80% derived from animal products i.e. chicken, eggs, fish and meat. As expec ted, plot size and value of household assets appear closely correlated and increase based on access to other agricultural land. About 55% of the households feel that social status will decline as a result of loss of access to land and their ability to use small scale homestead plots. The need for credit access is especially critical for the smallest lot owners. Women play the most important role in plot maintenance and plant -, animal - and fish production, while also managing family expenses for food, cloth es, child health care and education. It appears that their role is less significant in managing family debt, the purchase of agricultural inputs or other family expenditures. Overall, homestead gardens also perform an important social function. They help e stablish family and territorial identity, and provide for neighborhood cohesion and beneficial communal interaction. It is suggested that an agrarian reform program that includes the distribution of land to land -less people and small -scale homestead farms is carried out in relation to the prevailing agro -ecological conditions and associated land carrying capacity and productivity ratings. Overall, such initiative should be within the framework of a sustainable community development project and a well -define d regional economic development strategy. A minimum household plot size should be defined to accommodate an acceptable, future standard of living. This may be accomplished uniquely at the individual household level or in combination with large scale commun al garden systems with shared titles, individual plots and with associated benefits of economies of scale by reducing costs of capital -, material - and mechanized inputs, and harvesting, processing and marketing. Experience indicates that there is signif icant benefit in integrating diverse production system, such as food and cash crops, animal and fish production, especially in a closed - loop nutrient recycling system in combination with organic farming. Coupling 106 PEKARANGAN: Human, Organism, Vegetation, Animal Pekarangan as: Self-propagating function Self-nourishing Self governing Self-fulfilling function Domain of pekarangan Typology of Sustainable pekarangan Family Status Wealth Assets Income Diet PEKARANGAN: Human Activities, Spatial Management, Land Use Access Land / Credit Control Production & Marketing Process Landscape: Watershed Habitat: Elevation Boundary of attributes agricultural with non -farm activities, incl uding value -added enterprises, would provide for increased economic stability and potentially, higher household revenues. In this approach, credit access and the role of adaptive species selection, cooperative input acquisition, processing and marketing s hould be considered together with access to effective rural extension services. Research findings also show that some pekarangan owners have access to additional land cultivated to support household needs, and that this may be an important factor in land use intensification and the provision of sustainable income levels. The sustainability of pekarangan depends, in part on the land use interface between biophysical (agro -ecological) regions and socio -economic -cultural domains. Ideally, they represent an in terconnected micro system that is self -propagating, self - nourishing, self governing and self -fulfilling (Figure 2.15) . Figure 2.15 - Structural and functional elements of Pekarangan (Arifin et al, 2009) 107 Hence, micro landownersh ip and land use structures (e.g. land cover/use mix, land access and security, and transformation) define the basic structure, current and future functionality of pekarangan , including their ability to supplement household needs. Macro -agroecological (clim ate, soil, topography and watershed) parameters in combination with socioeconomic attributes at the community and regional level, such as employment opportunities, wage rates, credit access, input availability and cost, production efficiency and marketing, are other important determinants. Socio -economically, we may distinguish four basic functions of pekarangan . First, subsistence production , such as a complement to staple crops, producing mainly fruits, vegetables, spices, and many non -food products. Aside from crops, the system includes animal production, with high nutritional value in terms of protein, minerals, and vitamins, also contribute to food security in times or seasons of scarcity. Second, \"commercial\" production for supplemental income , particularly in regions with good market access and a well - functioning market. This includes perennial crops, such as fruit trees, cacao, and coffee. It may also include vegetables, ornamental pants and derived ornamental products, such as dried flower arr angements. Earlier research on Java indicated that this portion of income from pekarangan varied from 1 - 7 % (Arifin, Chozin, Sarma, and Sakamoto, 2006). Third, the socio -culture functions . These include varies service functions such as providing for t he exchange of pekarangan products and planting material, its role as status symbol and its aesthetic and other service functions, such as the children play yard, a place for neighbors to socialize , its magical value and as a location for religious ceremon ies. For instance, Hindu Balinese families need their pekarangan as a place for ceremonial sacrifices . 108 Forth, pekarangan fulfill ecological and environmental functions . Its multi -layered vegetation structure resembles a natural forest and offer s a habita t for a diverse community of wild plants and animals . The integrated production systems of plants, livestock and fishponds provides for an efficient use of organic fertilizer and helps to recycle nutrients and reduces runoff and water contamination. S ometimes this is done especially effectively, such as the construction of poultry pens over a fish pond, providing for effective nutrient recycling and reducing potential water contamination by nitrates and phosphates (Figure 2.16) Figure 2.16 - Poult ry pens situated over fish ponds - efficient nutrient recycling in small - scale, subsistence, agro -forestry systems, (Schultink, 2006) 109 The relative contributions of these homestead agro -forestry system can be significant. Even the smallest homestead plots show beneficial effects. In the table (2.8) below Table 2.8 - Total and per square meter income originated from homestead plot (Arafin et al, 2009). G1 -G4 represent different size categories by various agro -ecological zone s. Source of income in pekarangan 26,075 10,651 23,405 21,172 22,288 One of the key issues in agrarian reform - and the (re)distribution of land or the certification of (informal) ownership - is the latent use of \"dead assets\" tied up in unregistered land titles. This prevents or limits the use of land or homesteads as collateral in farm loans and in practice results in excessive interest charges. In Indonesia, it is not uncommon for farmers to pay interest charges of 10% per month or 30 -40% per year on small farm loans that provide badly needed operating capital or are used for capital improvements . As can be seen below (Table 2.9 ), informal credit access is the prevalent condition for all homestead properties, across agro -ecological zones, resulting in excessive interest charges and a major constraint in mobilizing latent productivity. Strong consideration should be made to combine any pilot or future land distribution scheme with the provision of micro -credit while using land or land use rights as a form of collateral. To provide clear incentives for land -less people or small land holders to become part of such scheme, very beneficial farm loan terms should be considered and the process should be very clear, transparent and objectives. Actual distribution of loan s 110 should take place by official or lending institution representatives outside the immediate area to reduce potential conflict of interest and minimizes the chance for corruption.

INDONESIAN LAND POLICY CONTEXT Indonesia's land use context and issues a re diverse and reflected in it its land policy challenges and needs. The most intensive land use is found on Java and Bali. Of the more than 231 million people (2009) living on about 190 million hectares, the highest population densities and land intensiti es are found on Java (more than 134 people per km2) and Bali, both with almost 89% of developed land. The least developed is Papua with about 97% of undeveloped land. The major land use categories are summarized below with land use ide ntities by major regi ons (Fig. 3.1 ) Figure 1 - Major Land Use Categories (BPN, 2009) Figure 3.1 - Land Use Distribution and Regional Land Use Intensity (BPN, 2009) FIGURES OF AREA 112 The percentage of forest land includes, according to various sources, recent ly deforeste d areas, degraded forest and scrub forest. These sources suggest that about 55% is a more realistic estimate. Sawah land, the system providing the basic food source, is also declining. Below an example (Fig. 3.2) of 2 provinces on Kalimantan , a decline primarily caused by expanding mining operations . Figure 3.2 - Declining Sawah Areas on Kalimantan The research framework associated with an Agrarian Reform program addresses prevalent land issues, policies, including land laws and the various aspect s of land and capital access and control , such as use rights, te nure regime, title security and its implementation. In Appendix E , the work schedule is provided. Research is being conducted at various institutions in Jakarta (primarily BPN), the US and field locations focusing on relevant cases and benefits of land distribution / agrarian reform initiatives. The primary field focus is on recent land distribution initiatives by the current BPN administration, 113 potentially including Lampung province, Sumatra, Eas t Java, Sulawesi, and Central Kalimantan. Indonesia's land policy context includes a number of critical issues , such as a high percentage (more than 85%) a small landholders, high poverty and unemployment rates , widening income disparities, a low percenta ge of formalized land ownership (estimated at around 42 % by BPN in 2009) -- indicating that the land is not mapped, certified, and ownership is not verified and legal rights are not registered, a high percentage of idle or underutilized land (estimated at more than 7 .3 million hectares - although one source provides an estimate of as much as 11 million hectares - with a total opportunity cost estimated by BPN in excess of $600 billion/year7), forged land ownership certificates, a high number of l and disp utes/conf licts (almost 7500 cases involving almost 608 ,000 hectares in 2007) , a challenging legal framework, a lack of comprehensive spat ial planning and implementation, and a rapid land transformation, especially into plantations for the production of export commodities. From a land management perspective, o f special concern is the informal economy associated with the low percentage of certified property titles (out of about 85 million parcels) and associated title and use rights insecurity ( Table s 3.1 and 3.2). Table 3.1 - Progress of Issuance of Certificates in Indonesia (BPN, 2002 . Academic paper) No. Fiscal Year Total number of Certificates Total Sporadic Systematic Adjudication Prona \"Taking Land Policy and Administration in Indonesia to the next Stage and NLA' s Strategic Plan\". Presentation Washington. D.C. This phenomenon results in high real estate transaction cost (both in terms of the number of required transactions, lack of procedural transparency, time and real costs), loss of potential tax revenues, and a poor investment climate - specifically low credit mobilization using real estate collateral and high intere st rates associated with land and real estate investments, and the short -term financing of material inputs, especially in small land holdings. In concert, this constitutes a major opportunity cost and dramatically reduces potential economic growth and soci etal prosperity. The unfortunate reality is that few smallholders can afford the time and the lump sum payments necessary to obtain land titling and registration services. Current large -scale titling and registration projects are unlikely to reach the ma jority of smallholders in the 30-50 years. Moreover, the majority of certification projects focus only on land titling and registering, without providing the information or means to use certificates as collateral for (formal) farm loans. This greatly limit s their potential effectiveness in agrarian reform programs. As a result, the vast majority of Indonesia's small farmers obtain necessary production credit and input s through informal arrangements at unfavorable terms. Credit and inputs are obtained from local tr aders or neighbors , often i n exchange for product sales agreement s. Informal arrangements carry much higher interest rates (e.g. 10% per month) than commercial bank loans and limit the farmers' options for inputs and choices of suppliers and purcha sers, limiting effectiv e bargaining power . Informal lenders also do not provide the range of financial s ervices available from banks, nor have the interest in providing loans for long-term, capital investments. These credit restrictions limit the farmers' ability to respond to technical advice to increase crop productio n and expand or diversity operations. The inability to obtain formal credit greatly undermines the 115 production capacity of Indonesia's farmers and the vitality and growth of the agricultural sector. BPN target and achieved realization in 2000 is listed below (Table 2) and varies notably and understandably for various regions8. Table 3.2 - Target and Realization of Land Certification in Major Regions (BPN, 2002). The 2009 target is estimated a t 85 million parcels with about 1 million added per year.

Ciamis Regency: 62,93 hectares, 556 beneficiaries 8 Table 2 shows that the estimated total number of land parcels (2002) to be certified, as about 61 million, with about a 37 % success rate. The greatest percentage of land parcels already certified is found in Maluku (84%) and Kalimantan (79.2%). The difference in regional success rate reflects the smaller number of parcels in need of certification and is more or less directly proportional to population density and level of development. 9 Data for 2007 -08 provided by BPN. 116 3.

Establishment of Management Board of National Land Reform (Public Service Agency) The following land registration schemes and funding sources were involved in 2007 (Table 3.3) Table 3.3 - Land Registration Schemes and Funding Source in 2007 Nr SCHEME SEGMENT TARGET 2007 (PARCELS) 1 Public Fund (National/Regional Budget) Low-income community 1.073.400 2 Private Fund (SMS/Self-funded Mass Registration) Self-sufficient community 2.116.365 3 Special Programs Government programs: small-scale business, transmigration, state- assets registration etc. 38.030 Total 3.227.795 In 2007, about 37 million people (about 17 % of the population) live d below the poverty line. (BPS), 66 percent of which lived in rural areas , with 56 perc ent employed in the agricultural sector. The u nemployment rate was estimated at 9.75 % and underemployment at around 28% or involved about 30 million people. New job creation clearly failed to keep up with population growth and population densities continu e to increase, especially in urban areas. Income disparity, as measured by t he Gini coefficient , has steadily increased from 0.31 in 1999 to 0.33 i n 2002 and 0.36 in 2005, indicating a widening income gap between the 117 poor and the non -poor. In terms of a gricultural l and ownership distribution, the disparity is much worse on Java with around 0.6. (Internal Communication BPN, 2009). Unequal wealth distribution is further exacerbated by the continued fragmentation of household agricultural land and issuance of land use rights to large companies already owning ten or even hundred thousand hectares of land . Farm households with less than 0.5 ha of land are approximately 56. 5 percent of the total, or around 25 million households. Access to available land has b een reduced by land speculation that manifests itself by absentee land ownership , under -utilization and non-productive l and use. A bandoned land is estimated at 7.3 million hectares (some BPN sources indicate it may be as high a s 11 million hectares) , resul ting in very signi ficant opportunity costs, posing an unacceptable burden on the poor with no ac cess to or adequate land to cultivate. Another problem is the growing number of land disputes and conflicts. In 2007, the number of significant land disputes and conflicts reached 7491 cases covering almost 608 thousand hectares of land. High p overty and unemployment rates are persistent and growing . While the Indonesian economy has shown strong and consistent growth and expanded by 4 -5 % in the last few years, and is recognized as the fastest expanding economy in the last 3 month in South - East Asia (Bloomberg, 2009) , this growth failed to trickle down to the poor and unemployed , especially in rural areas. Here, the fundamental problems include lacking infras tructure and access to land by small farmers and the landless, lack of sufficient land for effective material and capital inputs, including access to extension and other public services. The land access issue is further complicated by uncertainty of landow nership. Lack of title security or (long -term) certified use rights prevents use of the land as collateral for loans, resulting in no - or limite d access to badly needed (micro) capital . To survive, many small land owners or tenants are required to pay exor bitant interest rates - as high as in the 30 -40% range per year or 5 -10%, on a monthly basis, further reducing family income potential and the opportunity for the rural poor to generat e a reasonable quality of life. 118 All these issue s combined require a lon g-term, well -defined, well -resourced and well - executed Agrarian Reform Strategy. This will require that the National Land Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (NLA -RI) provides effective leadership in the implementation of this strategy, in coordination wit h other relevant public agencies, such as the National Development Planning Agency ( BAPPENAS ). Execution should be based on up -to-date information , combined with the effective institutional capacity to deliver relevant land tenure and administration servic es, such as efficient ownership title transfers and registration, certification of well-defined land rights, improved access to land, increased land productivity, and assistance in rural ec onomic development programs supplemented by rural extension service s. 3.1 Land Policy and BPN 's Mandate BPN with its head office in Jakarta and has about 25,000 employees distributed over 33 Provincial Offices and 420 Municipality/Regency Land Offices.

In November, 2006, the President announced the intention to allocate 8.15 million hectares of land to the poor. Subsequently, this amount was expanded to 9.25 million hectares in May, 2007 . It is not clear to which extent this Decree constitutes a potential controversy with respect to the mandate provided to Kabupatens (regions or regencies) (Law No. 32/2004 and Presidential Decree No. 34/2003) granting authority over \"land matters\" and the identification of the regional authority in land administratio n as \"designation of land redistribution subject and object, and compensation of maximum for maximum excess and absentee lands . As of May 2009, no large scale land distr ibution had taken place, although some smaller successful schemes were implemented over the last few years. 121 Although the Indonesian land reform made some progress during 1960 - 1965, the activity did not result in the redistribution of much agricultural land and did not affect many agricultural families, either on Java or off -Java. In summa ry, since 1965 , agrarian reform activity has been rather limited. As identified by Prosterman and Mitchell (2002)10 BPN data show that, during the period 1960 -2000, the Government of Indonesia redistributed 850,128 ha under the land reform program.11 Of th at amount, 339,227 hectares was on Java.12 As Table 3 .4 (below) shows, this represents only 3% of cropland in Indonesia and only 6% of cropland in Java as of Table 3.4 Cropland distributed in Indonesian land reform (Source Prosterman and Mitchell, 2002) Cropland redistributed Total cropland in use Redistributed land as % of total cropland in use and Land Tenure, March 2000; and FAOSTAT. the 1960' s. They conclude that by any standard, the land reform program in Indonesia has affected a very small percentage of cropland.14 The Indonesian land reform program has redistributed land to 1,292,851 families, including 816,849 families on Java. The average recipient received 0.66 ha throughout Indonesia and 0.42 ha on Java. Based on 1963 population data, \"farming\" households (which does not include agricultural laborer households), primarily benefitted from the 10 Footnotes 10 -16 adapted from Prosterman and Mitchell, 2002. Concept for Land Reform on Java. RDI. 11 As cited by Prosterman and Mitchell, 2002, the total amount acquired was 1,470,690 ha, which means that only 58% of the land acquired was ever distributed. 12 BPN Directorate of Land Reform and Land Tenure, March 2000. 13 Based on FAO data, this total included 18,000,000 ha of arable land and 8,000,000 ha of permanent cropland. The comparable FAO figures for 1998 are 17,000,000 ha of ara ble land and 13,000,000 ha of permanent cropland. 14 Presently no data are available to differentiate between the percentage of cropland that was sawah (rice paddies) and the percentage of cropland that was tegalan (dry -land cultivation) 122 land reform program. It affected approximately 11% of farming families in Indonesia and approximately 10% of farming families on Java15 (Table 3.5 ). Table 3.5. Families receiving Land in Indonesian Land Reform (from Prosterman and Mitchell) Families receiving land Total farming families in 1963 (excluding laborer families) Families receiving land as % of farming families Estimated total agricultural families (including laborer families) Families receiving land as % of estimated total agricultural families Directorate of Land Reform and Land Tenure, March 2000. Assuming the same ratio of 46 laborer households to 100 farming households in Indonesia in the 1960s (46:100 on Java) , the per centage of \"agr icultural households\" (farmer plus agricultural laborer households) that received land in Indonesia was 7% and on Java 6%, respectively. These percentages represent a very small proportion of the rural families that were landless or land -poor in the 1960's. The results of the land reform substantially, did not reach the most vulnerable group, namely seasonal agricultural laborer families . Such families were the lowest priority of the eight priority categories of recipients described in Artic le 8 of Government Regulation No. 224 of 1961 \"On Implementation of Redistribution of Land and Compensation.\" Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they constitute only a very small percentage of the agricultural laborers household's estimate to have received land in the Indonesian land reform program.16 BPN's clients and partners are found i n central and local government; in the private sector (notar ies, land valuation specialists, real estate brokers, banks , farmer 's 15 Almost all land reform in Indonesia occurred prior to 1965. According to data of the National Statistics Bureau [BPS], in 1963 there were roughly 12,236,000 farming households in Indonesia (excluding East Timor, Maluku and Irian Jaya), of which approximately 7,935,000 f arming households were on Java (\"farming\" households are those that control some cropland). BPS 1993 Agricultural Statistics (as of March 18, 2002 as quoted by Prosterman and Mitchell). 16 Estimate reflects 2002 ratios of agricultural laborer households to farming households, both for Indonesia and for Java alone. The estimate includes about 5 million of these households on Java. 123 organizations and other commercia l interests) and amongst the general public, includ ing NGOs. Major partners at the centra l level are Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS (Nation al Development Planning Agency), State Ministry for Environmental A ffair, Taxation Office , Ministry of Public Works , etc. Local branch offices of BPN cooperate with Local Government Agencies such as the Regional Planning and Development Agency, and Public Works Office . Land tenures and titles are managed by the National Land Agency (BPN), which reports directly to the President. BPN manages all grants, extensions, renewals of titles as well as the land registration system, and accept s the resource use titles controlled by other Ministries. BPN has land offices in all provinces and districts with approximately 25,000 relatively lowly compensated civil servant employees. Many land offices are well equipped; others need new buildings and facilities. It administrative revisions of staff and functions to local government reflect the Autonomy Law 22/1999. About 80 million parc els ar e on the fiscal (tax) cadastre, whereas only 20 million are on the legal cadastre (public land register). In terms of land mass, about 1% -3% of the land is privately owned (hak milik). 3.2 Recent BPN Institutional Policy Initiatives In 2006, the policy focus of BPN reflected the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 10/2006 , with a mandate for land policy formulation at the national, regional and sectoral levels. Furthermore, Law No.17/200 7 on Long Term Development Planning Mandates that the BPN implement s efficient and ef fective land management; enforces land rights using democratic, transparant and justice princ iples; reforms land reform regulations to improve the occupation, right s, and land use; develops taxation (dis) insentive s according to size of area, location, and landuse; improves land access and land rights for the poor; improve s land law through inventarisation and enhanchement of land regulation s with adat (customary) law taken into consideration; improve land conflict resolution thro ugh administration, justice, alternative dispute resolution; and human resource development. Current land policy is reformulated by BPN on the basis of four main principles : 124 1. Improvement of welfare; 2. Distributive Justice; 3. Fostering a just and p eaceful sustainable society; and 4. Creation of social harmony (resolved land conflicts and disputes) . With these principles, 11 policy objectives were formulated. They include: a. Public Trust building; b. Improvement of land services and land registration; c. Improvement of people land rights ; d. Resolutio n of land problems in areas affected by natural disasters and ethnic conflicts; e. Systematic h andling and settlement of land lawsuits, disputes and conflicts ; f. Development of National Land Management Information S ystem and land document security system; g. Addressing corruption, collusion, nepotism and improvement of people participation and empowerment; h. Establishment of large scale land use and ownership mapping; i. Consistent i mplementation of all land laws and regulat ions; j. Streng thening the BPN ; k. Developme nt and reform land laws and policies (agrarian reform). The cooperation between BPN and W orld Bank should therefore emphasize these policy objectives , with particular emphasis on: a. Development and reform of land poli tics, laws and policies (agrarian reform) b. Improvement of land rights ; c. Improvement of land services and land registration; d. Systematic processing and settling of land law suits, disputes and conflicts ; e. Development of a National Land Information System capa city including a land mapping, spatial analysis, land information and management infrastructure, together with a secure land cadastral documentation and certification system; f. Establishment of a large -scale land tenure and land ownership database; g. Consiste nt, transparent and objective i mplementation of all land l aws and regulations ; h. Strengthening the organizational capacity of the National Land Agency . This reprt seeks to address some of the critical problem facing Indonesia 's Agrarian Reform and focus the land policy mandate of BPN in cooperation with the World Bank. 125 4. FRAMING THE LAND POLICY AND AGRARIAN REFORM DEBATE Land policy initiatives should be framed within the broader rubric of economic development planning and address the primary goal of im proving societal prosperity, while using natural resource sustainably -- guarantee the long -term flow of benefits for future generations while maintaining or restoring the productive capacity of our natural resources, considering economic viability , enviro nmental impacts and public risks. The primary goal of land policy formulation is the mobilization of land assets (natural resources) through the efficient use of human and capital inputs to create a sustainable and reliably prosperous society. This contex t may be frame d as illustrated below (figure 4.1). Figure 4 .1 - Land Policy Analysis and Formulation through Land Laws, Regulations , Planning and Economic Incentives SUSTAINBLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (mobilization of natural, human and capital assets) Land Information and Cadastral Systems (Spatial Analytical and Infrastructural Capacity Resource Inventories and Land Evaluation (Land Suitability and Environmental Risk Assessment) Land Use Planning (National, Sectoral, Regional and Local Plans) Land Tenure and Administration Institutions 126 Economic development and land tenure - property rights in land or real estate , defined legally or customary - are two interrelated con cepts in land policy . Access to land resources , and secure propert y and use rights, is a precondition if not the foundation for successful economic development and the cre ation of prosperous societies. The United Nations , in its formulation of the Millennium Development Goals ( Mugs ), stresses the importance of land use issues in addressing developme nt challenges and achieving sustainable development goals, emphasizing poverty all eviation, environmental protection, and social justice . The core challenge in land policy is to provide access to land and formalize an certify land ownership to develop more equitable land distribution , provide collateral to leverage capital investments and mobilize latent productivity for food and cash crops , and other sustainable land uses. The formalization of property ownership or use rights through the provision of land certificates or titles has three primary effects17. They include: The security eff ect - removing disincentives for investment in land and capital equipment such as machinery The collateral effect - increased security provides for the use of real estate as collateral for short - and long -term credit as working capital or long -term investm ent, significantly lower ing the interest rates and increasing potential net return per hectare The transaction cost effect - the formalization of property rights helps to improve a functioning land market and reduces the transformation costs of real estate , thereby promoting the most productive and economically viable use In addition to these direct effect s associated with land parcels, the indirect effects include the formalization of credit and land transaction s and increase produc tivity that helps to generate potential tax revenues not realized in the underground economy. 17 Feder and Feeny, 1991. Land Tenure and Property Rights: Theory and Implications for Development Policy. World Bank Research O bserver. Vol. 5 No.1. pp 135 -153 127 The formulation of land use rights is based on legal principles that seek to provide incentives and controls for land investments through laws and land use regulations, and informal pr inciples of economics , land conservation or sustainable use. As such, it is a government's responsibility to articulate property rights -- determine the scope of these rights and associated obligations, and provide the regulatory framework to promote its successful implementation. Private property rights, although the fundamental element of prosperous societies, should be viewed in the broader context of public policies that stimulate economic growth and provide societal benefits. As such, private property rights must also be viewed as exclusive and not absolute rights, given the complexity of public and other private interests , such as environmental impacts and long -term, sustainable use. In Indonesia, as in other developing countries, special land policy challenges are evident. They include: Real Estate Title Certification, Leveraging Investment, Equitable Taxation and Revenue Generation As in many d eveloping countries, a large amount of \"dead capital\" exists -- assets in real estate (urban and rural la nd an d buildings) that can not be used to the fullest extent because clear ownership title is not certified . In Indonesia, i t is estimated that about 85 million land parcels ex its (with an additional creation of about 1 million per year) and with less than 40% with certified ownership or use rights . This effectively prevents using certified ownership as loan collateral and make s long-term capital investments difficult due to the uncertainty about the time period to recover investment or profits . These condi tions also make it difficult to trace and validate these assets, pose equitable taxation challenges , use multiple transactions to obtain surplus value, and pose high transactional cost due to misunderstandings, faulty recollections and conflicting interpre tations of agreements. As pointed out by Hernando de Soto18 these \"dead assets\" reflect high proportions of real estate assets in developing countries , almost 60% of city dwellers and 67% of rural residents in the Philippines , 53 - 81%, respectively in Peru , 68-97% in Haiti and 68 -97 % in Egypt. 18 Hernando de Soto. 2000. The Mystery of Capital . 128 Lack of legal property descriptions poses not only limitations on the provision of credit, but also on easements, accountability, tax revenue , enforcement, service delivery, infrastructural improvement and urban re vitalization. Legal property descriptions and certification provide s the tool to create surplus value over and above its physical assets by providing economic development opportunity and prosperity. Some surveys indicate that without such legal protection, the cost of working and conducting a business is expensive. De Soto's work in Peru (2000) cites an extra cost of 10 -15% of annual income to be paid in the form of bribes and commissions to authorities. The lack of collateral to obtain loans for small farm ers in Indonesia forces them t o pay excessive interest rates (30 -40% annual rates or 10% monthly rates are not uncommon)19. Without formal ownership and transaction records, equitable taxation is difficult and total tax revenues are reduced. Owner ship and Use Rights Clarity, Security, and resulting Land Conflicts Indonesian land use conditions, in urban and rural areas alike, are characterized by weak or not existing guarantees that clearly define ownership, tenure regimes or use rights. This in turn, incr eases the perceived and real conflicts and disputes associates with these rights. Sources of conflicts include disputes between the stat e, investors and local people. Of specific concern are: a) disputes between plantation interest based on Right of Exploi tation (HGU) - still valid or expired - and occupation of the land by local people; b) between Adat Communities with Ulayat rights and Forest Concession Rights (HPH) given to those areas, c) mining interests and (de)forested areas, d) overlapping border of land rights - such as ownership (\"eigendom\") rights and ex Adat land rights (girik); e) disputes on compensation for land transactions; f) dispute on the status of land between village authorities and other government unit as result of implementation of L aw No. 5 / 1979; g) private land designations by 19 Personal Communication with BPN and BAPPENAS staff and consultants. May 2009. 129 Colonial Land Law and now controlled by government institutions; and h) disputes associated with the courts judgment that is difficult or impossible to enforce.20 Conflicting Legal and Regulatory Framework and its Implementation The overlapping and sometimes conflicting role of administrative jurisdicti ons associated with the development, articulation and implementation of land use rights, land use plans, and associated laws and regulations. This includes the associate mandates - real or perceived - by relevant government institutions, such as BPN, BAPPENAS , and the Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry, Mining and the Environment. Therefore a top priority should be to commission a thorough and systemic legal review to compile all pertinent land use laws and regulations (with clear definition and consistent use of terms, such as land, agrarian and natural resources) and consolidate these in a legal framework of internally consistent and mutual reinforcing laws and regulations pertinent at the nati onal, regional and local levels, and across the various economic sectors, including agriculture, forestry and mining. Such review should also include the circumstances under which the state can exercise eminent domain and either takes property for the public good with just compensation or uses \"right -of-way\" to install utilities, such as water -, electric -, fiber optic - or sewer lines. This should be reinforced by clear institutional mandates on its implementation and legal enforcement. Such c larity , transparency and objective implementation will assist in reducing land conflicts and promote the more rapids resolution of conflicting claims. Social Justice and Inequity in Land Access and Benefit Distribution The inability of poor people to benefit from access to land, its productive use and benefits creates a perpetual system of social injustice . A democratic and economically efficient society should encourage productive ownership and investments. T his includes minimi zing absentee landownership and speculative non - or underutilization, 20 BAPPENAS. 2008. The National Land Policy Framework. 130 the equitable distribution of land access, use rights, and promotion of productive use and the realization of associated employment and income opportunities. In Indonesia, there is clear evidence of an increasing gap in ownership distribution - concentration of land ownership and use rights in the hands of a smaller percentage of the population - and income disparity that is inherently associated with historically - defined land access limi tations that are socially unacceptable. One example includes Java with a high percentage of land -less people and extreme small landholdings. Here, almost 7 million families do not control land through ownership of lease. More than 7 million families contro l less than 0.5 hectares (BPS, 1993). In combination, this was about 83% of the 17.3 million households on Java, a figure that has likely significantly increased in 2009. BAPPENAS (2008) cites the 1993 census data, indicating that 69% of the agricultural land tenure in rural areas is controlled by 16% of the rural households, while 31% of agricultural land is controlled by small farmers or the landless (via use rights /hak garap ). The landless that cultivate land as tena nt are sometimes required to pay up to 50% of crop yield as \"rent for the use of the land, reducing household income by the same amount. A fundamental policy challenge will be to decide if a further marginalization of the poor or underprivileged, as a result of these conditions , is acceptable .21 Smallholder Land Certification and Access to Credit It is well understood that lack of property certificates affects credit access, especially access to formal credit from lending institutions. This is as critic production constraint because farmers need capital at the b eginning of the growing season, and most farmers rely on informal systems of credit for capital and inputs, which carry high interest rates and sometimes involve selling crops in advance and pledging land under unfavorable if not explo itative terms22. Farmers with certificates u nders tand that the land provide s with the means to lower the interest rates paid for capital needs and inputs. Farmers with little or no socialization on access to finance believe bank procedures are overly compli cated and they do not have a good understanding of how 21 BAPPANAS. 2008. The National Land Pol icy Framework 22 Nielsen R and A. Safik. Smallholder Land Certification and Access to Credit in Indonesia . RDI, 2007 131 land certifi cates can be used as collateral. Farmers do not wish to put up their land as collateral, but farmers who are better informed about access to finance and government assistance to farmer groups believe that as a group to avoid loan defaults23. Certification programs are of interest to farmers if at low cost in within a certain time period (e.g. 5 years) especially if combined with improved access to credit. Concerns about Privatization Privati zation has often resulted in the poorest being excluded from primary rights such as land access and use rights, and secondary rights such as access to water, forest products or communal grazing rights. Privatization and land titling, unless very carefully handled in deliberately transparent and objectives ways without significant financial thresholds (title, registration costs and other administrative burden) has often benefited the local elites . Land registration and titling programs must be well - resourced and administered to provide easy access, accuracy, equity and reduce land disputes . Potential benefits of land titling can be offset by market failure for inputs and labor . Land titling, especially in rural areas, should ensure continued access to formal credit at competitive rates (potential government intervention to assure capital access) . Over time, in areas with customary laws and communal rights and where land becomes increasingly scarce, tenure regimes have historically \"modernized\" and evolved into private property regimes. 23 Ibid, 2007 132 5. AGRARIAN REFORM IN INDONESIA As a nation of about 235 million people - culturally and geographically highly diverse, it also depicts a great variety in land use patterns, population densities and land ownership. In additio n, various tenure regimes and legal systems dominate different parts of the country. The principles of diversity are embraced in its Constitution of 1945 and emphasize the management and use of its natural resources for the common good. Law No.5/1960 on Basic Agrarian Law stipulates the rights of the people over its land, water, territory and all natural resources contained therein. It is the State's duty to realize public welfare for all people and protect their land rights. The realization of this charg e is a great challenge in a rapidly developing nation with great land use diversity and intensity reflected in various land use pressures, formal and customary legal systems, conflicting sectoral interests, and environmental impacts . These conditions also translate into concerns about environmental quality, public risk associated with environmental pollution, sustainable land use, and the long -term productive capacity of the natural resource base. In recognition of this challenge, the GOI ratified MPR Stip ulation (Tap MPR) No. IX/2001 on Agrarian Reform and Natural Resource s Management, articulating guiding principles for agrarian reform and sustainable resource utilization. It calls for land reform that is fair by giving attention to land ownership for the people and the collection of systematic data on land through inventory taking and registration of control, ownership and exploitation of land. The National Land Policy Framework 4 -point action plans to implement MPR Stipulation No. IX/2001 to increase acc ess to land: Empower poor people to use and own neglected land Provide o pportunities for people to use and own land through redistribution, land consolidation, etc Increase c ontrol of neglected and not optimally used land Create information access to gover nment land program 133 The promulgation of Law No. 22/1999 (as revise Law No.32/2004) directs that land policies support the realistic and responsible autonomy of regional governments. It outlines, in essence, the same 4 basic principles as identified by BPN (above) : 1. Manage l and to create of social welfare; 2. Promote social equity in land access, use, tenure and ownership 3. Promote of sustainability 4. Foster social harmony 5.1 Land Use and Ownership Roughly 20 million hectares, or nearly 10 percent of Indonesia's total land area, were cultivated in the 1980s, with an additional 40 million hectares of potentially cultivatable land, primarily in Sumatra and Kalimantan. This percentage increased to about 11%, with about 7 % in permanent cultivation in 2 00524. The GOI claims that Indonesia has about 120 million acres of rainforest (or about 60 percent of its land area)25, making it the world's third largest forested country after Brazil and the D.R. Congo. Other sources, based on multiples studies, suggest that natural forest coverage may be around 50% (1997).26 In spite of the dwindling forest coverage the Forestry Ministry still exercises control over about 70 percent of the land .27 Evidence suggests continued and rapid deforestation. Most of the changes ar e caused by logging (especially since the 70s), transmigration (especially in the 80s), spontaneous settlements, and the rapid expansion of estate crops. With an estimated loss of up to 20 million ha of forest over the past decade (or about 10% of the tota l land area or about 20% of the remaining forest ), deforestation in Indonesia has come to the forefront of global environmental concerns. From a land policy perspective, Indonesia is not only one of the most important areas of tropical forests worldwide, but forests provide a multitude of benefits to traditional villages, inclu ding the provision of many products and services, including as food and energy sources. Logging benefits are only a limited public benefit. Forests are also critically important in 24 CIA World Factbook (2005) 25 Jakarta Post ( May 23, 2009), quoting GOI sources 26 Pagiola. S. 2000.

These forests are also of global importance because of their biodiversity - with it largely untapped potential for ecotourism - and the ir carbon sequestration. Despite the benefits they provide, Indonesia's forests have been under considerable threat in past decades, and the extent of forest cover has continued to decline considerably28. One of the most significant impact s on forest land has been conversion to large scale palm oil plantations, increasingly a source of public debate. The 1999 forestry law stipulat es that all forested land is controlled by the state. No private or community land ownership or land righ ts are granted in forest areas, only forest concessions. It is estimated that forty to sixty millio n people live in \"forest areas. The law allows local communities and indigenous people to \"manage the forest and gather forest products \", but the state retai ns full \"ownership \". Government control of most \"forest land\" (estimated or about 70% of the land , which including degraded scrub and brush land that by current estimates is about 20% of the land) is exerci sed by the Ministry of Forestry, mostly irrespecti ve of its current vegetation status . Ther efore, 70% percent of Indonesian land is held under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Forestry and Estate Crops under the Forestry Law No. 41/1999. Resource tenures are managed by sectoral ministries rather than the B PN. . BPN only becomes involved in forest land areas when forest land is converted to \"land tenure\". Smallholder cultivation of both fo od and estate crops dominates the remaining, non - urban, landscape , accounting for about 87 percent of total land under cu ltivat ion; large plantations account for the remaining 13 per cent. The pattern of land use and landholding reflects the distinctive ecosystems of Java and the Outer Islands, and the profound impact of colonial cultivations. Java and Bali were the center s of intensive rice cultivation on sawah or flooded cropland. This cultivation demanded rich volcanic soils and a fairly low gradient to permit water control, and supported a dens e sedentary population. Increasingly, more farming activities are concentr ated on smaller parcels (Table 5 .1). 28 Pagiola. S. 2000. Land Use Change in Indonesia. Environmental Department, World Bank. 135 Table 5.1.

Around 70% of the rural households have land holdings of less than 0.5 Ha, wherein most (43% of the rural households) belong to the homeless and farmers with land holdin gs of less than 0.1 Ha. (Table 5.2 ). Here, 43% of rural households of the \"land poor\" (homeless and farmers with land holdings of less than 0.1 Ha ) only hold 13% of agricultural land, while 16% of the rural households \"land rich\" (farmers with land holdings of greater than 1 Ha) hold almost 70% of the total of agricultural land. Within the same period (1973 -1993) the inequity has also increased in agricultura l land ownership/hol dings among the regions. The 1993 Agricultural Census shows that land ownership/holdings per farm family in Java is around 0.41 Ha and outside Java is 1.2 Ha. This trend in increasing land inequity continues due to an increased concen tration of population in Java. Such trend may be deemed soci0economically unacceptable but also has the potential to create political unrest and security problems. 136 Table 5.2 .

In this process forest plots are cleared, harvested for a few seasons until natural nutrients are exhausted, and then return to the slow process of forest regeneration. The far lower productivity of this system than sawah can only support low populati on densities. Over time, swidden farmers have in some areas adapted to commercia l tree crops such as rubber, coffee and especially palm oil . The recent expansion of palm oil plantations in this century has raised increasing concern about the rapid forest c onversion and its associated impacts on traditional, low risk (agro -forestry) cropping systems in many villagers, now depending on mono -cultivations with a higher risk of crop failure. The impact of co lonial agricultural practices i n the late nineteenth century has been characterized as agricultural \"involution\" --a reduction to former size --centered in areas of sugar cultivation, primarily in Central and East Java. Here, the dense population supplied seasonal labor for sugar production and was still able t o grow sufficient rice. The village economy provided an equitable if marginal subsistence for all villagers through such labor -intensive techniques as double cropping, improved terracing, careful weeding, and harvesting . At the end of the 20th century, t his rice-based economy was able to absorb the rapidly growing population in part, assisted by the Green Revolution with superior varieties, improved inputs and pest control. On the Outer Islands , the plantation economy was far less intrusive, coe xisting as a n enclave among small -scale , swidden cultivators. 137 There, large expanses of land still remain uncultivated, but increasing cultivation is limited by the natural characte ristics of the tropical forest and soil fertility. In the early 1960s, the need to incre ase agricultural output was tackled with highly visible yet ultimately ineffective land reform. The land reform was part of a larger and more successful effort to modernize the colonial legal system of landownership. Under the Dutch, a dual system of land laws permitted non- Indonesians to register and obtain title for lands on the basis of Wes tern civil law principles, whereas Indonesian ownership was governed by adat (custom ary) law, based on unwritten village practices. The dual system was intended to pr otect farmers' land ownership and use rights. H owever, the more flexible, communal -based adat system also permitted the Dutch to rent communal village lands for sugar cultivation by contracting only with the village head (penghula ). In 1960 , the proportion of settled land still recognized only under the adat system, with no formal survey or title, was estimated at 95 percent. The Basic Agrarian Law (BAL) , enacted in 1960, constituted a comprehensive legal effort to modernize Indonesian landownership. The l aw sought to decertify land policies enacted by the Dutch Colonia l Government, primarily replacing the Agrarische Wet of 1870 . The Dutch law, sought to certify indigenous ownership rights over cultivated land with the option to enter into lease agreement s with European investors promoting development of sugar, tobacco, rubber and coffee estates. Uncultivated land could be given in erfpacht (hereditary lease right) by the state - a 75-year land lease. The Basic Agrarian Law recognized previous ownership ri ghts under both adat and Western systems, but provided a new certification process under which land was to be surveyed, mapped, and registered. All unclaimed land reverted to government ownership. Land certification, however, was not compulsory and registr ation progress ed very slowly. The law also set limits on the size of landownership, depending on the population density of the region and the type of land. In areas with over 400 people per square kilometer, rice field ownership was limited to a maximum of five hectares and a minimum of two hectares. A bsentee ownership was forbidden. 138 In practice , this maximum field size or absentee ownership limitation may be difficult to enforce. Field rese arch conducted in 200229, indicated the practice by absentee owners to isolate themselves from these requirements. Illegal r esidency cards were being obtained to certify residency in the jurisdiction of the land parcels and land titles are transferred to direct family members or relatives. In this specific case, the BPN r epresentative also believed that the legislature of the kabupaten (regency) has the authority to change village boundaries and that such would be endorsed by the bupati . (head of the Kabupatan ). In this case, uncertainty existed about how such boundary cha nge would be formally communicated and registered at the central BPN office. Also, b y the standards of sawah cultivation, a wealthy landholder p ossessed three to five hectares. The maximum of five hectares left very little surplus land available for distri bution and o nly a small amount of land was redistributed before Suharto's New Order shifted the emphasis of agricultural policy away from land reform towards increased productivity per hectare. The agricultural census of 1983 showed that about 44 percent o f all farm households were either landless or operated holdings too small to meet more than subsistence requirements. At that time, t he average landholding on Java was 0.66 hectares, and ranged from about 1.5 to 3 hectares in other p arts of the country. By the 1980s, the New Order , undoubtedly aided by the Green Revolution , had achieved undisputed succe ss in expanding rice production. In fact, for a period of time in the late 20th century , it changed Indonesia from a rice importer to a rice exporting nation . However, the distribut ion of benefits did not equally benefit the poor. Observers suggested that only already prosperous farmers benefited from the new techn ology. B y the late 1980s, sufficient evidence had been gathered to show that the benefits from increased rice production, together with growing employment opportunities outside agriculture, had reached even the landl ess or near landless population, although a widening income gap became evident in subsequent years. As a provisional legal framework for a modern state, the 1945 constitution also addressed the use of natural resources for the public good. It expresses the revolutionary 29 Mitchell, R. 2002. Rural Development International. Field No tes from Karawang Kabupaten 139 expectations about social and economic justice. Article 33 states that the economy shall be organized cooperatively, that important branches of production affecting the lives of most people shall be controll ed by the state, and that the \" state shall control natural resources for exploitation for the general welfare of the people \" 5.2 Land Rights RI land rights associated with the pluralistic legal system and formally recognized and registrable interests are consequently rather diverse, inconsistent and constrain investment and planned development. However, t he State controls virtually all land. While supporters of the BAL c laim that such control is less invasive than eminent domain or complete state ownership, it can be argues that it is overly restrictive . Compared to other nations, p rivate land law is undeveloped and private land rights are severely limited. By comparison, in the US a large number of (separable) rights are associated with private property rights (Fig 5.1) Figure 5 .1 - The (US) \"Bundle of Private Property Rights Principle \" - Exclusive but not Absolute . - USE (subject to public regulatory restrictions such as police powers, eminent domain - public taking and just compensation clause, condemnation) - LEASE - MORTGAGE - SUBDIVIDE (zoning regulations) - DEED RESTRICTION (e.g. conservation and other easements, covenant, development rights) - SALE OR BEQUEST - WATER (riparian, prior appropriation or other) - MINERAL (includes oil and gas) - DEVELOPMENT (restrictive covenants and police powers: zoning and other ordinances, environmental nuisance, building codes, and development guidelines) - LIENS (taxes and other) 140 The most significant public right here is the Right of Eminent Domain or the right to expropriate private for the public, at fair compensation as man dated by the US constitution. T he constitutional hurdle remains high for property owners. First, owners are not automatically entitled to the most prof itable use of their land. Local zoning, nuisance or wetland ordinances restricting the type and nature of development are examples of use limitations. Second, diminutions of value caused by government regulations are uniformly tolerated. Third, virtually a ll public interests to be served by environmental laws are legitimate in the eyes of the constitution. Last, such laws are usually found to substantially advance the public interest. A listing of land rights is included below (Ta ble 5.2 ). It should be not ed that, in addition, the Basic Agrarian Law also creates rights to use airspace and water, and the cultiva tion and harvesting of fishery resources . Excluded are oil, gas and mineral rights. As currently formulated, the system of land rights is predominantl y time -limited and incompatible with the modern investment climate and dynamic land markets that require long -term title security to recoup long -term investments in agriculture, commerce and industry. Feared land speculation , associated with unlimited land use rights, can be avoided by simply limiting developing rights through proactive , well -articulated and objectively -enforced land use plans. Similarly, other restrictions can be enacted by zoning laws and still promote a sound investment climate, while p reserving public and community interests. This bundle of (limited) land rights concept - permitting a clear definition of specific use rights and their limitations - is a widely and successfully employed legal principle in many industrialized nations to he lp regulate urban expansion and direct economic development and land use. One fundamental challenge is to clearly define and administer land use rights associated with customary or Adat rights as defined in the Basic Agrarian Law. Although rights are conve yed to the Adat community (\"rechtsgemeenschap\"), it is unclear how these rights 141 Table 5.3 - Indonesian Private and Community Land Ownership and Use Rights PERPETUAL RIGHTS Hak Milik \"Ownership \" - the right to own the land. Hereditary right for Indonesi ans through conversion regulations, government grants or Adat (customary) law.

Under Agrarian Law community titles are subject to state interests and, therefore not considered \"land rights\". Consequently, \"community land\" is for the taking by administrative authority without compensation MODERN RIGHTS Hak atas satuan rumah susun Hak tanggungan Ownership of strata (e.g. apartments) Land as secure collateral for mortgages 30 This right is not formally recognized or written in the Basic Agrarian Law 142 specifically convey to its inhabitants. In practice, individual rights are neglected and many people are marginalized to the benefit of domestic or foreign investors31. This results in conflicts between th e Adat community or some of its people and the investors in cash crop plantations, forest plantations or lumbering operations, and government if it involves clearcutting for transmigration projects. Of special note is Regulation of State Minister for Agrar ian Affairs/Chairman of the National Land Agency No 5 / 1999 that provides guidelines for resolving these conflicts by delegating authority to local governments. This is largely an unfunded mandate because local authorities do not have the knowledge or the required capital of human resources to conduct the necessary research. Criteria for the identification of Adat communities include: a) the implicit recognition and implementation of individual use rights by the community; b) the geographic identification of a location where the individual or community lives and provides for its daily needs; and c) an informal understanding of the guiding land tenure, management, use and principles by the community.32 It is argued that overlapping administrative rules perta ining to the recognition of Adat communities and their rights should be addressed by means of clarification and harmonizing the vertical and sectoral integration (such as for forestry and mining) of pertinent laws and regulations. It is further recommended that Adat communities are spatially identified to permit the certification of land rights, provide title and tenure security as a means of improving prosperity, preserve cultural identify and promote social equity and justice. It can be argued that the Ba sic Agrarian Law 5/1960 (BAL), needs fundamental reform. The BAL is \"based on adat (customary) law\", - principles that reflect a sedentary, traditional, immobile agrarian society. It does not provide the necessary flexibility to develop a coherent national land law that seeks to promote responsible investment and economic development. Under the BAL, land is controlled by the State to achieve \"prosperity of the Indonesian people, Indonesian socialism, and adat philosophy\". The 31 BAPPENAS, 2008. Adat Land Tenure , Final Report. Land management and Policy Development Project. 32 Ibid. 2008 143 presumptions are that State c ontrol is essential and prov ides for a better mechanism to control land rights and allocate capital inputs than well-functioning landmarket s, and that total private or corporate ownership (as it may be restricted by the proper land use plans, laws, regulat ions and enforcement) leads to exploitation and waste. The multi - institutional control of land rights as exercised directly or indirectly by various GOI agencies is currently viewed as discretionary, replete with confusing and contradictory mandates and re gulations, with a high transaction cost and low, if any, accountability 5.3 The Judiciary and Land Disputes The Indonesian legal system is extraordi narily complex, the newly -independent state having inherited three sources of law: customary or adat law, t raditionally the basis for resolving interpersonal disputes in the traditional village environment; Islamic law (sharia, or, in Indonesian, syariah ), often applied to disputes between Muslims; and Dutch colonial law. Adat courts were abolished in 1951, alt hough customary means of dispute resolution are still used . The return to the 1945 constitution in 1959 meant that Dutch laws remained in force except as subsequently altered or found to be inconsistent with the constitution. In the 1990s t he government continued to review its legacy of Dutch civil and commercial laws in an effort to codify them in Indonesian terms. The types of national law recognized include, in addition to the Constitution, various decrees, statutes and regulations promulgated by the pre sident , and other implementing regulations such as ministerial regulat ions and instructions. T he executive branch has considerable discretion in determining what is \"law\". With respect to the administration of justice, Article 24 of the C onstitution state s that judicial power shall be vested in the Supreme Court and subordinate courts established by law, and that the organization and competence of courts shall be established by law33. While d uring the Sukarno administration, the justice system became a tool of the 33 William H. Frederick and Robert L. W orden, editors. Indonesia: A Country Study . Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993. 144 revolution, and any pretense of an independent judiciary was abandoned, one of the goals of the New Order was to restore the rule of law. A major step in that direction was the enactment of the Basic Law on the Judiciary Number 14 of 1970, which d efined the independent status of the Supreme Court and emphasized noninterference in judicial matters by persons outside the judiciary. Theoretically, the Supreme Court stands coequal with the executive and legislative branches. The president, vice presiden t, and justices of the Supreme Court are nominated by th e legislature and appointed by the president. The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction in disputes between courts of the different court systems and between courts located in different regions. It can annul decisions of high courts on points of law, not fact. On request , it can give advisory opinions to the government and guidance to lower courts. It is not part of a system of checks and balances, however, since it does not have the power of judici al review of the constitutio nality of laws passed by parliament . Its jurisdiction is limited to whether or not implementing administrat ive regulations conforms to law . Moreover, the Supreme Court has no control over the integrity of the lower courts, which are under the supervision of the Department of Justice. Below the Supreme Court four different court systems can be distinguished34: First, there are courts of general civil and criminal jurisdiction. District courts are th e courts of first instance, wher eas the High C ourts are appellate courts. Despite protestations of independence, the lower courts have shown reluctan ce to challenge the government, particularly in political cases . In the view of some observers, these courts routinely allowed egregious br eaches of fundamental civil rights. There are al so regular allegations of corruption in the lower court system in both civil and criminal cases. Second, are the State Administrative Courts (peridilan tat usaha Negara). The administration of the first two jurisdictions courts is under the Supreme Court and supervised by the Judicial Commission . 34 Budiardjo et al., 1997. Law Reform in Indonesia - Diagnostic Assessment of Legal Development in Indonesia. Volume I. 145 Third, there are the military courts (peradilan militer), which have jurisdiction over members of armed forces or persons declared to be of a similar status. These c ourts are supervised by the Department of Defense and Security. Fourth , there are religious (Islamic) courts (peradilan agama) , under the Department of Religious Affairs, which exist to resolve specific kinds of disputes between Muslims in matters of marri age, divorce, inheritance, and gifts. These courts base their decision on Islamic law. To be legally enforceable, however, the religious court's decisions must be approved by a corresponding secular district court. The Directorate of Religious Justice within the Department of Religious Affairs has ultimate appellate jurisdiction. One of the persistent tensions between Islam and the state arises from Muslim efforts to expand the jurisdiction and autonomy of the S haria courts. 5.4 Local Government Governm ent administration is carried out through a hierarchical level of administrative subunits. Indonesia is made up of 33 provincial -level units (propinsi ), including five special regions ( ) as Aceh, Papua, and al city region ( daerah khusus ibukota ), Jakarta. The provinces are districts or regencies and city (kabupaten /kota ), and below that into subdistricts (kecamatan forty municipalities or city governments ( have equal administ rative status as a kabupaten . At the lowest tier of the administrative hierarchy is the village ( desa and kelurahan ). In this evolving structure, Indonesia had currently about 349 districts, 3,625 sub -districts (kecamatan) , 91 cities, and 66,979 villages /kelurahan . Since independence , the nation has been centrally governed from Jakarta in a system in which the lines of authority, budget, and personnel appointment s. In these matters, regional and local governments enjoy little autonomy. Their role is largel y administrative: implementing policies, rules, and regulations. The political goal is to maintain the command framework of the unitary state, even at compromising developmental efficiency. Governments below the national level, therefore, serve 146 essentially as subordinate administrative units through which the functional activities of Jakarta -based departments and agencies are delegated. In the early 1990s, there was neither real power sharing nor upward political communication through representative feedb ack. Real feedback occurred through bureaucratic channels or informal lines of communication. Elected people's regional representative councils (DPRD) at the provincial and district levels had been restored in 1966, after operating as appointive bodies dur ing the period of Guided Democracy.35 However, the DPRDs' participation in the early 1990s governing was extremely circumscribed because the councils lacked control over the use of resources and official appointments. Even though 1974 legislation gave provi ncial DPRDs some voice in selecting their governors --DPRDs could recommend appointments from a list of potential candidates submitted by the minister of home affairs --provincial governors were still appointed by the president. District heads were designate d by the Department of Home Affairs. The structure of provincial -level and local government in Indonesia is best understood in terms of the overriding goals of national political integration and political stability. At the governmental level, integration means control by the central government, a policy that was in part conditioned by historical experience. At independence , Indonesia consisted of the short -lived federal Republic of United States of Indonesia (RUSI, 1949 -50). According to some, t he RUSI was viewed as a Dutch plot to deny authority over the entire country to the triumphant Indonesian nationalists. Regional rebellions in the la te 1950s confirmed the government's view that Indonesia's cultural and ethnic diversity required tight central control to mai ntain the national integrity . Political stability was equated with centralization and instability with decentralization. Civil control was maintained through a hierarchy of the army's territorial commands, each level of which paralleled a political subdivision --from the highest regional command levels down to noncommissioned officers stationed in the desa for \"village guidance.\" Lateral coordination of civilian administration, police, justice, and military affairs was provided at each provincial, dis trict, and sub -district level by a Regional Security Council 35 Ibid. A Country Study 147 (Muspida). The local Muspida was chaired by the regional army commander and did not include the speaker of the local DPRD. Added to the political requirement for centralization in the early 1990 s was the economic reality of the unequal distribution of natural resources endowment a nd the mismatch of population density to resources. The least populated parts of the country , such as Papua, were the richest in primary resources. This brought the issu e of social equity in the main stream of the policy debate - ensuring that wealth produced by resource exploitation be fairly shared by all Indonesians. This goal meant that, in addition to Jakarta's political control of the national administrative system, the central government also exercised control over local r evenues and finances. The absence of an independent funding base limited autonomy for provincial and local governments. About 80 percent of total public expenditure s in the provinces was disbursed from the national budget controlled by departments and agencies headquartered in Jakarta. Of the 20 percent administered by the provinces, about half came from Inpres (Presidential Instruction) grants for infrastructure and other developmental purposes. B eginning in 1969, the Inpres grant programs at provincial, district, and village levels channeled about 20 percent of the development budget to small -scale projects for local development, with an emphasis on roads, irrigation, schools, and public health. O nly about 10 percent of regional government revenue was derived from local taxes and fees. Whereas once the central government's transfer of wealth from resource -rich provinces to people -rich provinces had been a source of political irritation for the bet ter-endowed regions, in the 5 -year economic development plan ( Repelita V - FY 1989 -93), the lag in development investment beyond the Java -Sumatra western core was perceived as troubling. Suharto's 1992 New Year's message to the nation explicitly addressed this problem: \"We are also aware,\" he said, \"of the fact that there is a wide gap in the progress achieved by each region in our country, especially between the western and eastern part of the country.\" In looking to future policy, he added that there woul d be stepped -up efforts to provide autonomy and decentralization. Such steps, however, would require strengthening the capacity of sub -national units financially and administratively, as well 148 as strengthening local participation in the setting of national goals and policies. To some government leaders in the early 1990s, making concessions to economic and cultural claims for autonomy would endanger national unity. Conflicting interests of politics and administration pre sented special problems in the S pecial Region s such as Aceh, Irian Jaya and Timor. Of special note is the allocation of land parcels at the Desa (village) level to provide local revenue s for public administration . The so -called \"village inventory\" land (tanah kas desa) is allocated to provide for operating cost, while the \"Tanah Bengkok\" land is designed to provide funds for village administrative staff salaries. A profile of various villages located in an administrative district is provided, below (Tab le 5.3 ).

LAND POLICY GUIDELINES FOR INDONESIAN AGRARIAN REFO RM AND RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Fundamentally, agrarian reform means a deliberate strategy to reduce rural poverty and provide equitable access to common property resources, and clearly recognize these rights and associated economic opportunities, ther eby further contributing to sustainable development and improve rural well -being. This requires a multi -disciplinary and multi - sectoral approach to land policy formulation, including facilitating legislation, effective land administration, equitable distri bution of land rights and comprehens ive rural development planning. Strategic development planning is implemented by effective policies that are based on a well-defined regulatory framework and supporting incentives. In the context of agrarian reform, la nd policies should develop strategies to improve land productivity while, at the same time, preserve the long -term productive capacity of land . A number of key strategies and incentives should be considered: Provide secure access to and rights to us e land productively. Ownership and control enhance the productive capacity of land and develops a stewardship and conservation ethic. In contrast, s harecroppers, tenants and squatters pursue short -term gain s that lead to exploitation. Tools in this process are property boundary verification and land registration, creation of an effective land market, and effective dispute prev ention and resolution by impartial Review and Arbitration B oards. Develop local land use planning and agricultural zoning . Encourage preser vation of highly productive agricultural land and concentrate labor intensive production on the most productive soils, and close to communities and existing infrastructure. Encourage land consolidation and concentration of small -scale production to create economies of scale and value chain opportunities. Create biodiversity reserves and avoid encroachment of critical habitat by creating exclusion zones that can be enforced. Concentrate large scale production that is less labor intensive away from community centers. 151 Provide economic incentives that help lower input cost and improve commodity prices. Tools include cooperative procurement of material and capital inputs, processing and market development, and import substitution. For critical food commodities, temporary price supports should be co nsidered, and preferred over input supports (such as fertilizer subsidies) that create production inefficiency and environmental pollution. Provide access to inputs and services. Tools include credit and extension servi ces, establishment of farmers organizations, mechanization, developing infrastructure (roads, irrigation, markets, storage, community services), and creating sustainable community services. Improve farming techniques. Tools include farming technique s that encourage cultivation practices that conserve soil, water, nutrients, energy, and pesticide inputs by strip - or contour cropping, intercropping, minimum tillage, integrated pest management, grassed waterways to direct runoff , etc. Encourage community and land owner participation. Tools include the participation of land owners in conservation practices, demonstration sites , community gardens and extension services. Eliminate long-term incentives and price supports that discourage conservation and efficient production and cause environmental contamination. Tools include the removal of subsidies for fertilizers and pesticides that increase pollution and increase the resistance of pests. This is a real concern in Indonesia. Instead, encourage integrated pest m anagement and biological controls. 6.1 Challenges in Indonesian Land Reform Historically, increasing rural prosperity through land redistribution in accordance with Government Regulation (PP) No.224 Year 1961 regarding the Implementation of Land Redistr ibution and Compensation has been difficult. Major challenges include the gap in land use control s, land availability and conflicts , ineffective or irrelevant regulations , lack 152 of comprehensive field data on land-reform, and reje ction of compensation by land owners whose lands are subject to the land -reform provision. Gap in Land Use Control s As pointed out by internal BPN research (Background Paper ARP) , field experience indicates gaps in the control of agricultural land ownership . This gap has widened d ue to macro economic policies that stressed growth and increased productivity. Data indicate that 43% of \"land poor\" rural households (land less and farmers with the control less than 0.1 ha) only control 13% of the total agricultural land, while 16% of th e \"land rich\" rural households (f armers with the control more than 1 ha) control almost 70% of the total agricultural land37. Agrarian policies have not focus ed on the restructuring of small -scale rural production a ssets but rather on increasing large -scale agricultural output . As a result, small -scale production was marginalized and w eak tenant farmers or farm workers, and poor farmers became poorer. This situation was exacerbated by the transformation of productive farmland to residential and industrial u se, urban infrast ructure and other non -agricultural land uses , increasing peri -urban land prices To address this issue, a systematic farmland preservation program is needed that protects the most productive farmland - in most cases sawah, and develops effe ctive land use plans and controls that a re consistent with and reinforce existing laws an d regulations. Limited Land Availability and Conflicts PBN staff indicates that since 1970, one a limited number parcels has been directly acquired pursuant to PP 224 of 1961. The main land sources available for redistribution by the State pursuant to article 1 sub -article d of PP 224 of 1961 includes land with expired, terminated or cancelled Right of Cultivation (HGU), and forest lands for which control had been tran sferred to the state and others. The availability and acquisition mechanism of this land must be clarified. This ambiguity has also resulted in an increased number of land conflicts between \"small\" farmers that need essential land , the non - 37 Central Statistics Bureau, 1993 Agricultural Census . 153 agricultural sec tor, and plantation s with HGU rights, intruded by community members that start cultivations , whether or not abandoned or which HGUs rights expired. Unrealistic Legal Provisions BPN staff indicates that some of these issues had been anticipated by the pro mulgation of direct and indirect laws and regulations on land -reform, namely Law No.1 Year 1958 regarding the Abolition of Private Lands, Law No.2 Year 1960 regarding Profit Sharing, Law No. 5 Year 1960 reg arding Basic Agrarian Law (UUPA), Government Regul ation in Lieu of Law No. 56 Year 1960 regarding the Determination of Agricultural Lands, Government Regulation Number 224 Year 1961 regarding the Implementation of Land Redistribution and Compensation, Government Regulation No. 41 Year 1964 regarding Amend ments and Supplements to PP 224 Year 1961, Government Regulation No.4 Year 1977 regarding Ownership of Absentee Agricultural Lands for former Civil Servants, and other laws and regulations. T he implementation of such laws and regulations was compromised fo r various reasons. The l and-reform program during the period of 1961 - 1965 may be considered as a \"failure\" because its provisions were not realistic, while the administrative and financial conditions at the time we re not conducive to successful implement ation, I n part, this was the result of an in creasing rivalry between co mmunist and anticommunist political forces, where the communists used the land reform program to obtain political goals .38 Unavailability of Comprehensive Land -reform Data During the New Order Administration , the constraint was the Government's lack of political will and commitment (KPA, 2002) to implement land reform and lack of d ata and information on land reform either related to objects (land) or subjects (people) of land reform. Ba sed on BPN data (source Central Statistic Bureau), during the period of 1961 -2002, 1,770,444 Ha became the objects of land reform. Out of that amount, 884,954 38 to 1,374,214 households. T herefore, there are still 885,490 ha available for land -reform from that period. However, there is no definite information as to the location and bo undaries of such remaining land , particularly on land acquired in the 1960s. In 2009, BPN estimated that about 7 million hectares are available for distri bution from various sources. Refusal of Compensation by Owners One of the most significant problem s encountered in the implementation of land redistribution is refusal by landowners , whose land is subject to land -reform provision s, to accept the amo unt o f compensation offered . They demand comp ensation in accordance with prevailing land market price s. BPN staff cites absentee land case of 51,400 m2 in size in Kuta Bumi Village, Pasar Kemis District in Tangerang regency, similar cases. The princip le of \"fair compensation\" should accompany \"public takings \" for land distribution and arbitration is suggested in the form of a Board of Review and Arbitration to minimize conflicts and court challenges. Care should be taken that such boards are staffed (appointed membership, representing all stakeholders) in such a manor that its actions are objective, transparent, avoid conflicts of interest and potential corruption. It is also critical that land acquisition programs are adequately funded to offer fair compensation. In Indonesia , it is clear that a transparent, restructured and complementary legal framework must be combined with an effective institutional framework to ensure effective implementation of agrarian reform. A successful effort will need strong political support and \"ownership\" by stakeholders. 6.2 General Guidelines for Indonesian Land Reform It is suggested that a participatory approach is used to seek \"buy in\" from the major stakeholders and to build social and political momentum in favor of reform to overcome 155 potential opposition. Suggested operational principles , strategies and actions for such agrarian reform program are to: Create a national land use planning and agrarian reform task force. The primary task is to consolidate RI expertis e and articulate clear goals associated with food production, rural development, the forestry sector, wildlife and ecosystem preservation, tourism, public works - all within the aim of developing a comprehensive, 10 -year national plan that provides the fra mework for regional , provincial and local land use plans. Raise public awareness of the issues and poten tial solutions. A targeted public outreach campaign that addresses the issues of idle and underutilized land, potential for increased productivity, marg inalized rural populations, social equity and the government's commitment to regional economic development and community planning . The Central Theme in this public message it the need to increase productivity and welfare, while conserving natural resources , combating environmental degradation and restoring environmental quality . Local communities, industry and mining are not only part of the problem, they are part of the solution and an active part nership should evolve. Develop strong political and social support , if not consensus. A systematic effort to work with other government agencies, under the umbrella of the outreach effort, above, to work with national, provincial and local authorities to seek support for the well -articulated goals and objectives o f the program and, specifically, seek multi -institutional participation in its implementation Create a sustained commitment from the President's office and the legislature with funding based on a well -defined implementation process with clear timelines an d goals. This should include the monitoring and evaluation criteria, such as discussed in Chapter 2. Formulate and enact enabling legislation to provide institutional and political - administrative district mandates associated with agrarian reform that are well- defined, transparent and strongly endorsed. This should include enforcement through social and legal sanctions. 156 Structure a dialogue with stakeholders . After a regional agro -ecological assessment and land evaluation process - including evaluation of f arming systems alternatives (see Chapter 2) , the pilot areas for innovative land distributi on schemes should be i dentified, together with the preferred characteristics of the Land Utilization Types ( LUTs) (such as plot size, household parameters, croppin g or agro -forestry system, etc). This permits the identifications of target group and broader stakeholders to invite for a dialogue that can be used to define the broader parameters of the agrarian reform program and the community develop components Focus and strengthen the capacity of BPN . A systematic effort should be undertaking to take stock of all internal capabilities and capacities, structure a n internal task force to lead the agrarian reform initiative . Oversight can be provided by the Management Bo ard of National Agrarian Reform . Indentify essential program need s and conduct a GAP analysis (steps to reach desired state) to prioritize investments by BPN to meet human and capacity needs and structure a institutional capacity development p rogram to lea d this effort Develop pilot schemes to test land use alternative and land distribution program options. Programs should reflect agro -ecological potential , community needs and preferences. Experience suggests that successful land reform has some indirect e ffects by i mproving the governance system. That is, creating better arbitration mechanisms, guarantying the ability by the poor to exercise their rights, creating institutional accountability and installing checks and balance s. The implied goal is to syste matically address social equity concerns. As part of process , it is the obligation of the State and donor organizations in agrarian reform programs to follow the international human rights standards, beyond the \"right to food\" pledge. This includes the bas ic rights by people affected, including the obligations to Respect, Protect and Fulfill . The obligation to Respect indicates that \"support to land reform should in no case result in further deprivation for women and poor people from access to and control over land, 157 nor in the dispossession or eviction of ethnic minorities or tribal an indigenous people from the territory they traditionally occupy \"39 The obligation to Protect refers to the notion that economic and social trends tend to weaken the security of vulnerable groups and the reby emphasizing the requirement to protect their customary rights against encroachment of the elite who tend to use f ormal legal arguments to make and rationalize their land claims. The obligation to Fulfill encompasses the not ion of meeting human welfare needs - the provision of food and basic needs - to those una ble to provide for themselves as a result of a marginalized existence or from natural disasters or other causes. As such , policies should be adop ted to assure that the se needs are met. This issue has of course a more fundamental origin, namely the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 25 par 1 , to which the RI is a signatory, which states that: ...Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for t he health and well -being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livel ihood in circumstances beyond his control.. [ the Bahasa Indonesia version of kekuasa annya\" ...] A number of basic premises are offered to address the needs and realities of private land use in rural areas for agrarian reform. First, small land holdings provide the opportunity to a large number of households to have access to income opportun ities, thereby addressing a major policy objective - social equity. Second, small and medium sized farm s tend to be much more efficient in using (abundant) labor as input, thereby increasing the productive capacity of land as a scarce resource - increasin g resource production efficienc y. Third, as a development strategy, the strengthening of the small - 39 European Union. 2004. EU Land Policy Guidelines: Guidelines for the sup port to land policy design and land policy reform in developing countries. 158 farm sector reduces per unit input cost, increases outputs and the associated opportunities along the value chain - increasing associated employment and inco me opportunities . Forth, left to its own, the current process of liberalization of imports and the increasing expansion and dominance of export commodities will result in the land concentration at the exclusion and deprivation of vulnerable households. Therefore agrarian reform is effective in preserving the viability of small farming systems . As pointed out in the introduction, a m agrarian reform program is a deliberate, long -term strategic initiative that seeks to restructure and revitalize the agricultu ral sector , with well-defined objectives, priorities , and constraints. It should involve the folloing major phases: Phase I - Natural resources assessment to define the sustainable production capacity of the land resource base . This involves a systematic assessment of the agro - ecological conditions in the potential target (object) area -- the complex of resources assets available for the production of food and cash crops and the provision of other goods and services, based on the long-term agro -ecological capacity to sustain production opportunities . This process involved the identification and evaluation of potential farming / agro -forestry systems options that represent potential land utilization types (LUTs) that could be evaluated as small scale farm ho lding s an tested as prototypes in a pilot scheme (including land tenure and land use rights options). This land evaluation process, as identified in Chapter 2, involves the careful matching of land use requirements with land capabilities and develops an economic suitability map using prevailing cropping mix, input costs and product prices . This process will result in the selection of the best land use options for an agrarian reform program and estimate the socio -economic benefits on a household and aggregat e basis. The land use types can be spatially allocated based on agro -ecological zones variable and community development needs and opportunities, and translated in a comprehensive (local or regional) land use plan , in the following phase. 159 Phase II - Land use planning and zoning to promote economic development -- the development of guidelines and regulations to allocate land resources to sustainable land uses that are socio -economically viable and environmentally acceptable (and in harmony with the long -term agro -ecological production capacity) This is the actual refinement of Phase I implementation , including the clarification of institutional planning and implementation mandates at the local, regency and provincial level. Phase III - Land policy reform by restructuring land policies and laws to optimize tenure regimes and land rights to promote sustainable use , social equity and prosperity -- the utilization of the land resource base to promote the optimum allocation of human, capital and land resources to promote household and societal welfare . The process of restructuring and consolidation of relevant laws and regulations is currently taking place under auspices of ADB funding in cooperation with BPN. Recommendations associated with this effort should cla rify and facilitate operational agrarian and access reform, optimizing production opportunities for smallholders and landless agricultural workers. Phase IV - Access reform to improve the conditions of land resource allocation in combination with fixed a nd variable capital inputs, transportation, processing and marketing infrastructure to maximize profitability. Access reform should be based on improving the input availability (while lowering unit cost) of a parcel basis, and the associated commodity valu e chain and unit product prices, to increase net returns in a household basis. This process is consistent with the summary as identified by BPN below (Fig. 6.1). Care should be taken that inventory phase include s both up -to-date land cover/use maps and the identification agro -ecological zones to permit land evaluation and the optimal land allocation for a given planning horizon. It is strongly suggested to evaluate land use alternatives in pilot project before larger land redistribution schemes are enacte d. The process should be well -articulated, based on sound and transparent legal principles, reflect regional needs and production opportunities (using principles of environmental 160 sustainability and economic viability), involve careful land policy formulati on and land use planning, and adequate public funding support as part of an agrarian reform program that is viewed as a national priority Figure 6.1 - General outline of Proposed Agrarian Reform Process as defined by BPN (2009). 6.3 Structur ing Agrarian Reform Three basic models are considered by BPN linking the land (Object) with the r ecipients (Subjects) (figure 6.2 ): Model I - moves \"land to the people\" by making most land available in target areas by the purchase or expropriation of the land or use rights. Available Land BeneficiariesModel IIIModel IIModel ILand reform ObjectDETERMINE OBJECTOPTIMAL LAND UTILIZATIONACCESS REFORMSTAKE HOLDERSINVENTORY OF LAND HOLDING, OWNERSHIP, USE AND UTILIZATION State Controlled LandDISTRIBUTION 161 In all 3 models, land sources include \"idle or underutilized\" land, \"excess\" land, the maximum parcel size of depending upon the area under consideration, state -owned land (administered by various Ministries, including Forestry, Agric ulture or Defense), and land acquired by purchase on a voluntary basis. Figure 6.2 - Structural Models for Agrarian Reform Model II - moves most people to land in target areas , like the transmigration programs in the past. This option is fraught with potential problems. First of all, the relative cost is high on a per person/hectare basis in resettlement schemes. S econd , ModelsModel I(O ? S) 162 failed because the quality of land was not suitable for the type of land use envisioned. Third, unless people are moved over a relatively short dista nce, many socio -cultural communal issues may arise, not at least the ethnic and language difference s that hamper adaption. A significant factor in the failure of past transmi gration projects was also the lack of c omprehensive government support, specifically the availability of an adequate physical and service infrastructure - a prerequisite for successful community development. Model III - is a hybrid , making more land avail able to the landless and small farmer s in the target areas and communities where they live, and moving some people from outside the area to the existing target communities involved in agrarian reform. This appear s an attractive option in some cases becau se it builds on the existing community infrastruc ture and socio -cultural setting, while still permitting the expansion and allows for the adaptation of new citizens. In combination, it is likely to be the most flexible in adapting to local needs and prefer ences, while at the same time, permitting for a cost -efficient expansion of the physical and service infrastructure of existing communities. Such model could be crafted to provide communal ownership to newly allocated land while accommodating expansion opp ortunities for existing marginal farmers and land use right on newly available parcels to the new inhabitant. A careful community and extension support system should be designed and implemented (with adequate funding) to facilitate this adaption process by new arrivals and help ensure success. 6.4 Selecting Beneficiaries The various criteria for selecting are identified in the schematic, below (Fi g. 6.3) . These criteria are already defined by law, but care should be taken to ensure that these c riteria are clearly communicated to all stakeholders, are understood and (mostly) accepted to increase to likelihood of establishing successful programs, as measured by signi ficant socio -economic benefits and minimal land disputes. 163 Figure 6.3 - Eligibility Criteria for Land Distribution (Source: or farmwor-kers Other criteria 164 6.5 Procuring Land for Distribution Below, (Figure 6.4 ) various means are identified for land reform acquisition for subsequent distribution to smallholders and the land le ss (mechanism to integrate Object [land] to subjects [beneficiaries]). Some land will come from private sources, other from public land currently under control by various ministries. The various means (M1-M6) include: Figure 6.4 - Land Acquisition and Tenure Arrangements for Agrarian Reform and Distribution (BPN). to ModelsM1Land release and acquisitionObligation of landholder to provide landDirect exchange of landExchange of land to overcome land conflictsLand acquisition from state-revenueM2M3M4M5 M7Indirect exchange of land and overcome land conflictsDirect acceptance Joint companyThrough joint companyNotes:- M = mechanism, V = variant - Mechanism, system and variant may be developed further according to the characteristics of subjects, objects and localities - Joint company: government, beneficiaries, sister-companyObjects and subjects of Agrarian Reform is integrated at the same locationSubjects to objects approachM6Model I(O ? S)P1 P2 P3 165 M1 - Acquisition of land by public purchase . Presumably, this refer predominantly to the acquisition of ownership rights and the remainder to \"use rights\" , where time -limited rights are involved. It should be clarified if these intended acquisitions are based on a voluntary exchange or on the basis of eminent domain, such as in the form of a legally enforceable government purchase order, with fair compensation to be paid using prevailing land market prices. This needs further clarification and may require the role of a local B oard of Review and Arbitration to minimize land conflicts and potential court cases M2 - Land release and acquisition . Presumably this re fers to land currently administered and release d by the various ministries, such as Forestry and Agriculture. If this is the case, it should be clarified if a public exchange of funds also takes place or if this simply involves a public transaction where l and is provide d to BPN (and a local land bank ) and for subsequent distribution . M3 - Obligation of landholder to provide land . Presumably this refers to absentee ownership, idle, underutilized or excess land using applicable legal ownership standards that make this land available for agrarian reform as part of exercising eminent domain. It should be clarified is fair compensation would be involved or a public \"taking\" without compensation. Here it would be important to clarify the specific l aws and regulati ons associated with this \"obligation\" and communicate these widely to the local jurisdictions affected. This should also be combined with legal notices communicated b y certified mail or signed hand -delivery to the property owners affected M4 - Direct excha nge of Land . In many cases , differences in either the size of or the quality of land exchanged would call for arbitration if the exchange is not based on mutually accepted reciprocity. This may call for some arbitration mechanism and the role by a n imparti al Board of Review 166 and Arbitration with the authority to define enforceable terms of exchange, including financial compensation. M5 - Exchange of Land to Overcome Land Conflicts . In these cases a specific conflict exists based on different interpretations of property boundaries or use rights and associated benefits. Again, here the role of an impartial Board of Review a nd Arbitration should be established , with the authority to define enforceable terms of exchange, and to reduce the number of court challeng es. M6 - Indirect Exchange of Land to Overcome Land Conflicts. Presumably this refers to exchange of other land (or parcels) not directly associated with the land dispute. The same role of an impartial Board of Review and Arbitration is called for. 6.5 Land Tenure and Administration Alternatives As identified above (Fig. 6.4) , BPN envisions a number of alternative tenure arrangements that will govern ownership and use rights. The alternatives listed as V1 - V8, reflect primarily the mechanism of the tran sfer of the land title (P1 -P3 - direct transfer or via an intermediary step), and the final titles recipient s (individual, com munity or private corporation). Based on BPN documentation, three beneficiary land tenure/right categories are envisioned: Indivi dual land right s - land right controlled by individual ownership with unrestricted land use . Benefi ciaries manage the land supported by farmer s training to enhance production capacity, input (seed) assistance and access to capital and markets. Farmers may form a cooperative to jointly manage land, cooperate with state-owned ent erprises or regional government -owned enterprises in the form of shareholders. Beneficiaries - individually or through a cooperative \u2014 may make land management contract s with any busin ess or government entity. Collective land right s - collective control of land right s or joint ownership is intended to prevent fragmentation of land into separate individual ownership parcels . The land may be managed by a cooperative or business entity whi le 167 beneficiaries may work there . Business es have the obligation to develop a plantation company and manage it and beneficiaries may work at the p lantation company either in off -farm activities of on -farm activities. Beneficiaries - collectively or through a cooperative - may make management contract s with any business entity or government to manage the land. Beneficiaries may wo rk at the business entity in on -farm activities, off -farm activities or management. Business entity or cooperative control of land r ight. Control of land right is managed in the name of cooperative or business entity. Beneficiaries are shareholder s and may still be employed at the cooperative or business. Beneficiaries basically manage land by them selves with assistance to enhance production capacity, prov iding seeds and access to capital and market facilities. Beneficiaries -collectiv ely or through cooperative \u2014may enter into management contract s with any business entity or government to manage land. Generally, c ommunity land ownership is an option when combined with long -term individual use rights (households) for clearly demarcated parcels. The advantage is that it prevents land sale and speculation. The disadvantage of this option is that it tends to discourage long -term capital inve stments and is also more likely to discourage soil and water conservation practices with the potential for land degradation. Cooperatives, if not managed properly, can be a mix blessing, providing opportunities for collusion and corruption . In general term s, complete certified private ownership combined with full right s has the highest likelihood to leverage inputs, conserve resources and increase productivity. In addition, land \"ownership\" is viewed as an important element is attaining social status in the community. To prevent land speculation associated with this land tenure option, clear title restriction s should be placed on the property, such as preventing the sale within a certain (e.g. 30 year) period, and only permit use for the same land use type unless a specific variance is provide by a planning authority and clearly reflected in the long -term development plan. It is essential to have this guarantee in place in the form of local land use plan to preserve agricultural land, promote the \"compact c ommunity model\" - associated with the efficient delivery of services as successfully practiced in towns and 168 villages in some European countries, and improve the community infrastructure while reducing per capita cost of service delivery. 6.6 Land Availabl e for Distribution Land to b e distributed or redistributed shall primarily be agricultural land. It includes land in excess of the regional maximum limit, absentee lands, but also \"other state lands\" (as intended in Article 1 sub -article d of PP 224/1961). It is essential to provide updated land inventories of these potentially available land categories for the target areas under consideration. The fundamental justice principle in agrarian reform that land be cultivated by the owner s and benefits are more evenly distributed (Article 10 of UUPA) has, according to BPN research40, increased the number of new absentee owners. The notion of absentee land , has become increasingly controversial in light of advancement in communication and transpor tation technologie s. Consideration should be given to replace the in -district residential qualification with a distance qualification . In other words, it lack rationale to disqualify land owner s that live , for instance 5 km from their land but in a different regency, while not disqualifying those who live for instance, 50 km away , but in the same regency. This distance criterion should also be adapted to various parts of the country because of the significant differences in regency size between Java and other provinces. It would advisable to revise the national law to reflect this change, and indicate that absentee land ownership is determined, in part on a distance function as defined by regency land use plans, rat her than use a standard criterion , country -wide . (Note: RI Law excludes this distance requirement for land owners living \"very close\" or with \"the ability to cultivate efficiently\". This requirement is open to arbitrary interpretation and will be a source of land disputes). The definition of \"absentee\" shall also b e revised with respect to the \"proof of residency \" requirement. It should no longer be based merely o n the identity card (KTP) issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, easily obtained or falsified, but it should be based on the 40 Parlindungan, 1982; Sumardjono, 1990, 2001; BPN Research and Development, 1991 169 primary residency location an d time ( .e.g. more than 50% of the 365 days per year) of the certificate holder. For ex ample, if someone spends 185 days in a year in a certain place, this should be considered their residence. Also, no household should be able to claim more then one princ ipal residence for their agricultural land holdings . As example, the State of West Bengal , India, has the following provisions concerning absentee landownership: a. The relevant person spends most of his time living in the area concerned, b. The main income mus t be earned from the agricultural land concerned, c. The distance between the relevant person's residence and land may not be more than 8 km. d. The land has not been abandoned for more than 3 years, The first 3 provisions reinforce the principles of justice an d self -cultivation. The last requirement could be complied with by contracting cultivation with another party and may, therefore, not be relevant. Based on existing laws, the maximum land amount to be distributed to increase farm sizes to 1 or 0.5 hectar e is based on the population density. L and that can be used for land reform include s the following: a. Excess land (private ownership over the maximum limit that varies from 5-20 hectares , depending upon population density and cultivation type - for sawah 5-15 hectares or for unirrigated or dryland cultivations 6 -20 hectares ) (note: private corporate land ownership is not permitted in Indones ia, but corporations may receive use concessions (cultivation - \"erfpact\" for agricultural use) or permits (for logging and mining). b. Absentee Land (see discussion, above) c. Former sovereign (\" Prince dom\") land d. Land with Rights of Cultivation (HGU or \"Erfpacht\") , which ha ve expired and are not extended (typically plantation land) e. Lands under the Rights of Cultivatio n which are not cultivated in accordance with t he allotment and purpose of rights granted 170 f. Lands under the Rights of Cultivation which are not cultiv ated and which have used by the people for more than 10 (ten) g. Land with total area larger than the a rea recorded in the relevant Rights of Cultivation. (e.g recorded total may 100 hectares, whereas the actual parcel may be 150 hectares. Consequently, 50 hectares would be potentially available land distribution) h. Lands under the Rights of Cultivation, v oluntarily handed over by their right holders. i. Former village salary lands and other lands of the like set forth in the conversion provisions of article VI of the UUPA j. Former gogolan lands, gories reflect use rights or \"erfpacht\" provided to local citizens under the Dutch administration) and the like mentioned in the Conversion provisions of article VII paragraph (3) of the UUPA k. Communal lands, the rights of which have been waived by the c ustomary law communities. l. Forest lands released by the forestry parties in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. k. Communal lands, the rights of which have been released by the customary law communities. m. Naturally emerging lands n. Lands other than the lands mentioned above, which will be further confirmed by the Head of the National Land Agency The lands complying with the provisions in i tem d through n shall also become subject to land reform following the stipulation or confirmatio n under the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations. This implies that land defined under d through n will potentially be subject to land reform with further stipulation or confirmation by BPN under the provisions of the applicable laws and regul ations. 171 The village salary (tanah bengkok) identified under i), above c an be considered a local revenue source ( from rent or products sold ) and is used to pay compensation to local officials. This land can also be a significant source for land reform .41 Such land may constitute 10% or more of the cropland in Central and East Java, (or about 300,000 ha ). Here, tanah bengkok probably exists in a very large majority of villages , and such land is usually of good quality and located near the village. A complete inventory of tanah bengkok, cross -reference by administrative district and agro -ecological zone would greatly assist in developing agrarian reform opportunities and priorities . Compensation for the acquisition of this local land could be in the form of additional national government support equal to the amount of local revenue lost and designated as salaries for local officials. Payment could be in the form o f annual government compensation or in a lump sum deposited in a trust account and in the amount adequate to generate equivalent annual income based on the average interest rate over the last 10 years. Existing lease holders should receive special consideration in terms of land distribution or compensation for discontinuation of the lease arrangement. Former vill age salary land can be used for land reform if the status of the village has changed from village to sub -district as part of land transformation or redistricting Gogolan land, particularly the temporary ones, pekulen , sanggan and the like (land for which use rights - or \"erfpacht\" was provided to local officials under the Dutch administration) , can be use s if landowners transfer their right s to the state . This land can then be redistributed to former holders of gogol , pekulen and sanggan . One land category identified is \"naturally emerging land\". This presumably, refers to land formed by sedimentation in flood plains and coastal wetlands and becomes become state land. While unsuitable for rural residential use, this land may be made productive using reclamation techniques, including dikes and flood gates. Sources indicate that this flood plain land is quite extensive and becomes subject to land disputes. It would very 41 See E. Rajagukguk, supra note, at pp. 271 -72. 172 important to inventory land and evaluate its potential best land use, especial ly because coastal wetlands are critical habitat for fish spawning and other ecosystem functions. If it is decided which areas are suitable for cultivation, this lands can be subject to distribution using the standard criteria. Another land category is \"lands which can be further confirmed by the Head of the National Land Agency \". This is a vague category and that makes land subject to acquisition by the Government or the Regional Government through the following processes: a. Acquisition of Lands for public purposes, b. Regular trading, c. Barter, and d. Revocation of rights To avoid controversy and potential land disputes, it would be advisable to clarify under which circumstanced a \"public taking\", as described under a) or d) would be justified and permitted, and w hat compensatory arrangement should be made (e.g. land exchange, financial compensation, etc.) BPN documentation suggest s the following on the parcel size of land to be redistributed , depending upon the size of the land available and the number of qualif ied beneficiaries, a minimum parcel size for dry lands as 200 m2, whereas for farms is 0.1 (1000 m2) Ha. The argument is: ...\"The 200 m2 minimum limit for dry lands is based on the thought that the received lands can be used as residence and yard for agricul ture business purposes in the context of increasing household revenues. The 1000 m2 or 0.1 Ha minimum limit is based on the thought that the width of majority farmland possessions in Java has been below 2500 m2 (0.25 Ha), while there are a large number of communities having no land (43% rural households)... \" And ....\" If a landreform object is a plantation land with still productive plants, it shall not be divided in its redistribution, instead, it shall be distributed for collective possession: on behalf of jo int ownership or in the name of a cooperative, where the 173 beneficiaries of land redistributions can form a cooperative to organize such plantation (DAR, 1988). Similar is the condition for fish farm ..\" 6.7 Prototyping Land Utilization for Agrarian Reform To reach as many poor household s as possible (about 5 million households on Java) and by taking into account the limited availability of lands for landreform , particularly on Java. Prosterman and Mitchel l42 suggest the land parcel size to be redistributed, as 300m2 for use as a residence ( small house) and yard (\"small plot\" or pekarangan - homestead garden plot - see also Chapter 2.6 ). The yard can be cultivated with plants that may significant ly contribute to nutrition, income, and social status of poor households in rural areas . Yard s that are intensively cultivated may contribute as much as 25% of the total household income (Mitchell, Prosterman and Safik, 2004). As discussed in Chapter 2.6, an integration of fruit trees, vegetables, livestock and fish fa rming has tremendous potential to maximize household benefits on very small plots. It is suggested to set up pilot s chemes whereby innovative agro -forestry options, together with livestock and fish farming are introduced at various parcel size s, to systema tically evaluate potential household benefits. The se pilot schemes should reflect the diverse agro -ecological settings and opportunities, and local societal needs and preferences. Potential of Pekarangan as Land Utilization Concept Prosterman and Michell elaborated on the concept of land reform on Java and specifically the potential role of pekarangan . They analyzed cropland figures and pekarangan (home - and-garden land ),43 referencing 5,132,000 ha of pekarangan in Indonesia, of which 1,736,000 ha are on Jav a.44 42 Prosterman, Roy and Mitchell, Robert (2002) Kons ep Land reform di Jawa . Paper of Seminar \"Rethinking Land Reform in Indonesia,\" Jakarta, May 2002. 43 As indicated, the figures in sub -section (a) do not include land of agricultural estates, which occupy 16,543,000 ha in Indonesia, including only 620,000 ha on Java. 44 Statistical Yearbook of Indonesia 2000, Table 5.1.1. 174 The relative distributi on of pekarangan is identified below (Table 6.1) Thus, for Indonesia as a whole, 40.28% of households have less than 100 m2 of pekarangan, 25.24% have 100 - 200 m2, 11.72% have 200 - 300 m2 and 22.76% have 300 m2 or more.45 It shows the distribution for the four provinces of Java. Table 6.1 Size distribution of pekarangan land in agricultural provinces of Java (percentages of households that have pekarangan in the size groups shown) (from Prosterman and Mitchell, 2002) < 100 m2 100 < 200 m2 200 < 300 m2 > 300 m2 West ts Changes in West Java, Indonesia,\" doctoral dissertation for the Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Japan, March 1998, at Appendix Table 2 (citing 1995 Housing and Settlement Statistics, Indon esian Statistics Center Bureau, 1996). They suggest that a poverty alleviation program for landless agricultural laborers as part of an agrarian reform scheme could : ...(1) purchase small amounts of sawah or tegalan located adjacent to the existing pekar angan land in each Javanese village; (2) rezone (tegalan) divide the sawah (tegalan) into small plots; and (4) distribute the new pekarangan plots to the poorest families in the village ... and distribute it in 200m2 parcels. Using existing cropland, Prosterman and Michell also suggest that it would be practically impossible to distribute an average of 0.25 ha to just 50% of the 14,340,00 0 to farmer households who hold less than 0.5 ha of cropland or agricultural laborer households who hold no cropland. T his would require 1,792,000 ha (0.25 ha x 7,170,000 families). 45 Hadi Susilo Arifin, \"Study on the Vegetation of Pekarangan and Its Changes in West Java, Indonesia,\" doctoral dissertation for the Graduate School of Natural Science and Technol ogy, Okayama University, Japan, March 1998, at Appendix Table 2 (citing 1995 Housing and Settlement Statistics, Indonesian Statistics Center Bureau, 1996). 175 However, with only 5,135,000 ha of cropland on all of Java, such redistribution would require the government to redistribute 35% of all cropland on Java. They propose that a program of poverty alleviation , targeting the most vulnerable part of the population , could provide basic pekarangan to the poorest agricultural households on Java using sawah (or tegalan) converted land to pekarangan and redistributes 0.03 ha (300 m2) of pekarangan to the poorest 5 million households in rural Java. They cite that research has shown that pekarangan produces 44% of total food calories, 32% of total proteins and 65% of fuel consumed by rural households.46 If the land is i nstead used for intensive production of grain, research has found that irrigated plots as large as 400 m2 can yield enough paddy rice to provide 40 - 60% of the basic yearly nutritional requirements for a family of four persons.47 As such, they expec t that the distribution of pekarangan plots to the landless could produce enormous economic and social benefits, with modest land requirements . If 0.03 ha would be provided to 5 million households, it would only require 150,000 ha of land, or only 3% of Java's cr opland. As example, they list the conversion of sawah to pekarangan with the Government pay ing an average of Rp. 100 million (US $ 10,000) per ha for sawah .48 The acquisition of 150,000 ha would cost approximately Rp. 15 trillion (US $ 1.5 billion). If th e Government implemented such a program over 5 years, the annual cost for the land would be Rp. 3 trillion (US $ 300 million). Under this plan, the cost of land per family benefited would be approximately Rp. 3 million (US $ 300 ), which is about 1/10th of per family , and lower than the cost of the transmigration program. In addition, this scheme would require conversion of only 3% of the total cropland (exclusive of agricultural estates) on Java. 46 Soemarwoto, supra note; Leslie Brownrigg, \"Home Gardening in International Development: What the Literature Shows, Including an Annotated Bibliography and Inventories of International Organizations Involved in Home Gardening Projects\" (League for International Food Education, 1985) 47 William Thiesenhusen, Tim Hanstad, Robert Mitchell and Erman Rajaguk guk, \"Land Tenure Issues in Indonesia\" (report for USAID, 1997) at 38 n. 66. 48 Based on BPN estimates and results of RDI April 2000 fieldwork in East and Central Java, the equivalent of $10,000 per ha is a reasonable price for sawah. 176 The following implementation principles (and reference notes in section 6.6 ) are provided by Prosterman and Mitchell49: First, the land reform should give top priority to the poorest households, which are likely to be the seasonal agricultural laborer households that work for various farmers and have no permanent em ployment. In the earlier land reform, Article 8 of PP 224 of 1961 placed this class of agricultural family at the bottom of the priority list. Second, the land should be distributed in small plots in order to benefit the maximum number of agricultural fam ilies. If the land reform described here were conducted on Java, it would potentially affect 75% of agricultural laborer families on Java. Third, the Government should pay market value for the sawah (or tegalan) acquired for conversion into pekarangan. T he land reform program to date has attempted to acquire land by paying less than market value, which has generated vigorous opposition to the reform. Fourth, the Government must ensure that there is adequate financing for the land reform. To date, the Sta te has not provided adequate financing for land reform, and the Government has paid for only a portion of the land acquired for redistribution.50 Fifth, as part of program monitoring and administration, the Government must ensure that it redistributes all land that it acquires.51 Sixth, the Government should not focus on excess land and absentee land, but should instead purchase land near the village. If necessary, the law can be amended to define the land reform as a \"public purpose\" so that the Governmen t can acquire the sawah (or tegalan) by compulsion under the laws related to acquisition of land for public purposes. Because the new pekarangan should be located close to the existing village, the Government should acquire the sawah (tegalan) near the vi llage. For this reason, it is not necessary to acquire such land only from excess owners or absentee owners. The Government should acquire the land located near the village, regardless of the identity of the owner or the size of the owner's total landhol ding. (The authors if this report, however, suggest keeping a locally -adapted and maximum size limitations in effect to avoid the risk of land fragmentation and loss of associated economies -of-scale. It would be advisable to define a maximum holding size ( excess land threshold) per household to meet the unique needs of targets communities and reflect the variety in land use 49 Excerpts and subsequ ent notes in this section from Prosterman, Mitchell and Safik, 2004, Land Policy Challenges in Indonesia: Final Project Report on the Land Law Initiative. RDI. 50 Although the 134,558 ha for which the Government paid is only 9% of the 1,470,690 ha acquired for redistribution in Indonesia (according to data of BPN Directorate of Land Arrangement and Land Tenure, March 2000), it is not clear how much of the total was acquired from landowners (as opposed to state land, former land of princes, etc.). 51 Of the 1, 470,690 ha the Government acquired in the 1960's, it apparently distributed only 850,000 ha, which is 58% of the total acquired. It is not clear how that undistributed land is being used today. Perhaps the Government has granted it to plantation companies under HGU, or perhaps state enterprises use the land. 177 population densities among provinces an d regencies . The currently maxima defining \"excess land\" may be too broad to reflect this differ ences ) Seventh, the land reform program should be focused on Java because that is where the poorest agricultural households are most heavily concentrated. As noted above, if the land reform program distributed pekarangan plots to 5 million agricultural f amilies in Java, it could benefit three -quarters of Javanese agricultural laborer families .52 Five million families would represent approximately six times the 816,000 households on Java that benefited from the previous land reform . (underlining by the auth ors of this report) Eighth, the land reform program must be streamlined to avoid unnecessary processes and approvals. In the earlier land reform program, there were at least 15 institutions that had to approve applications to receive land, which indicates an enormously wasteful process.53 Ninth, the land reform program must be carefully monitored through independent sample surveys and Rapid Rural Appraisal interviews54 to ensure that it meets the program's specific goals. In this kind of program, and to t he extent that any donor agency provides financing, it is entirely possible to use the funding only as the program actually achieves results. According to this approach, the financing should be released on a \"progress payments\" basis as monitoring confirm s that the program has achieved each increment of progress in distributing land to families who are in the intended beneficiary group.55 52 This assumes that all, or almost all, of the beneficiaries are agricultural laborer families. 53 E. Rajagukguk, supra note, at page 94. 54 In Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) interviews, rural interviewees are not responding to a questionnaire, but actively participate in a semi -structured interview. The researchers use a checklist of issues as a basis for questions, not necessarily addressing all questions in each interview and sometimes departing from the basic questions to pursue interesting, unexpected, or new information. 55 The Government could perhaps consider a second approach for distributing new pekarangan land, which would be a \"universal\" distribution of additional pekarangan land to rural familie s. Under this approach, the Government would distribute new pekarangan plots averaging perhaps 200 m2 to all, or nearly all, rural households on Java. Such an approach would take into account several additional factors that might make it a viable alterna tive to the program just described: (1) This approach would eliminate the necessity of ensuring that an approach targeted to a smaller number of families -- for example, the \"5 million\" suggested above -- actually reached the poorest households and that th e benefits were not diverted or \"intercepted\" by families who were wealthier or more powerful. (2) This approach would take into account the fact that pekarangan can provide unique nutritional and ecological functions even for households that are somewhat better off, but that most of the essential open area of even medium -sized pekarangan plots has been lost in recent years due to widespread fragmentation through inheritance. Such fragmentation leads to building multiple houses on what had been a single pa rcel of pekarangan. See Hadi Susilo Arifin, supra note 45, at p. 85. (3)Virtually by definition, such a program would reach all of the rural poor on Java. If the Government were to distribute pekarangan to all 1 7.3 million agricultural households on Java, the program would require 346,000 ha (200 m2 x 17,300,000 families). This would represent about 6.7% of the cropland on Java. While this would require more land and would be more expensive than the 178 6.8 Procedures for Land Acquisition It is essential to identify the type of land (land qualities and potential) in the context of regional and local (population) needs and program goals and objectives. This requires: (a) an inventory and evaluation of land available, including the agro -ecological zone properties, a general assessment of land capability, followed by a ( socio -economic) suitability assessment using the land utilization types under consideration ; (b) potential obligatory public reporting (distribution of public notices and public meetings defining the land eligibility criteria as locally relevant, with com pensation schemes and timelines); and (c) engaging landowners to seek voluntary cooperation and compliance of all parties involved, including individual s, corporation, customary law communities, regional government s, and relevant agencies and ministries i n the forestry, agricultural sector and mining sector. Inventories should be conducted for broad target areas (selected based on socio -economic and cultural/political considerations) and include, topography, soils (agro -ecology), hydrology, current land cover/use and cadastral and land registration data converted to digital form, as relevant for the program to be c onducted , and may be referenced by Village/Sub -district Committee -level. If such map sources are unavailable, detailed parcel sketch should be made to show the relative position of each land parcel. A land evaluation framework with objective analytical protocols (including exclusionary and suitability criteria) should be developed and implemented, resulting in a decision -support system for progr am implementation. These activities are not covered under existing government regulations (e.g. No. 224/1961) and will require dedicated BPN and cooperating agency funding and staff training. Draft Government Regulation s include the provision of obligato ry reporting by landowners , and should be finalized into law. F ailure to comply can be verified by the alternati ve described in sub -section (a), it is possible that such increased costs would be outweighed by the popular support for a universal distribution. Such a program would require approximately Rp. 34.6 trillion (US $ 3.46 billion) for purchase of land, or ab out Rp. 7 trillion a year if the Government carried out the program over 5 years. Cost of land per family benefited would be about Rp. 2 million (US $200). 179 spatial information collected and should be enforced at the risk of significant penalty. The provision for data collecting and its associated need and pr otocols should be included in the law and reflected into institutional mandates and funding. The Draft Government Regulation that includes provision s concerning \"voluntary landreform\"; the opportunity for farm land owners (individual or corporate), customar y law communities, regional governments, and relevant agencies such as in the Forestry sector make land available for agrarian reform to BPN or the Regency/Municipal Committee , should also be included in Government Regulation No. 224/1961 or other laws an regulations. 6.9 Some Final Issues A successful agrarian reform project require s a solid political and financial commitment. First of all it will require that the needs and potential socio -economic benefits are clearly articulated and conveyed to the leg islature, media and the public, at large. Final agreement and decisions needs to be reached on program goal and objectives, priority targets (populations and geographic regions), timeline s, institutional mandates and resource allocations. Key program elem ents that need additional and specific articulation , a well-structured legal framework and implementation steps and timelines include: Formulation of o verall mandates, financing and program budget allocation at the National agency, Regional and Local leve ls Identification of goals and priorities associated with agrarian reform initiatives an beneficiaries by province and regency Monitoring and evaluation procedures Prioritization and identification of potential land types and qualities to be acquired for agrarian reform Identification of the process, funding sources (potential cost -sharing with recipient and administrative districts) and allocations, and mechanism s for acquiring land for distribution Objective and transparent land distribution, registratio n and certification protocols, including specific tenure and land rights (and sales restriction) associated with individual land parcels Objective and transparent o versight (Agrarian Reform Committee and Review and A rbitration Board , and administrative pro tocols and appeals ) Mobilization of cost efficient inputs, including micro credit, and value -added linkages (role of farmers cooperation, community and marketing organizations) 180 Addressing i mplied land use planning and economic development Defining g eograph ic priorities over time - and incremental funding scenarios Restruct ured, focused and transparent legal framework of applicable laws and regulations Identification of relevant socioeconomic, cultural and political constraints Identification of relevant so cioeconomic, cultural and political constraints ================================ 181 APPENDICES 182 APPENDIX A BPN CORE COUNTERPART GROUP - AGRARIAN REFORM/LAND POLICY Firmansyah Director of Directorate for Spatial, Parcel, and Boundary Determination Budi Mulyanto Director of the Thematic Mapping Directorate Hermani Noor Head of Bureau of Finance and Budget Gunanegara Head of Legal Center and Human Relation s 183 APPENDIX B Asian Development Bank Meeting - 18 May 2009 Name Institution Phone number email Attendees BPN Needs Assessment M eeting, 19 May 2009 Name Title and Institution Bambang Eko HN Land Registration and Land Rights Deputy Firmansyah Director of the Determination of Spatial and Land Border Directorate Budi Mulyanto Director of the Thematic map Directorate Hermani Noor Head of Bureau of Finance and Budget Gunanegara Head of Legal Center and Human Relation Ruslan Director of Policy and P rogram Stipulation Control Sukesi S.

The visits included interviews with BPN staff, local officials and beneficiaries of the land certification programs . The purpose of these visits was to identify the relative success of programs and identify potential improvements for future initiatives. Major observation s and recommendations include: A need to e stablish clear records and map s on existing and potentia l land available for distribution and certification Agrarian reform has largely been a certification of land distributed in the 1960s, occupied s ubsequently, and somewhat limited in scope and impact New and systematic agrarian reform initiative s are needed , combined with comprehensive access reform Consider designing a program based on systematic and transparent guidelines for the identification and prioritization of available land for distribution and clearly articulated selection criteria for beneficiari es Consider (temporary ) sales restrictions on recently certified real estate properties to prevent or reduce land speculation Access reform should include formalized procedures and focused technical assistance related to micro -financing, input procurement, farm management , processing and marketing Technical assistance should be considered to help organize effective farmer's cooperatives with subsidies including start -up capital for micro loans, cultivation and value -chain development Niche markets for cotta ge industries should be explored and developed Homestead gardens ( Pekarangan ) should be explored as integrated and supplemental farming systems, including agro -forestry, livestock and fish ponds to provide additional income and nutritional benefits to marginal farmers 198 Combine tax records and parcel descriptions ( land survey) into one data base to facilitate property valuation, tax collection, land certification and land market transactions. 199 The Agrarian Reform Program in Bogor Regency Bogor regency is one of the regencies within Java Province. The t otal area of Bogor regency is 2.301,95 Sq Km , consist ing of 40 sub districts (kecamatan), and 427 villages (desa/kelurahan). According to the Bogor Demography Office , in 2008 the population of the Bogor regency was 4,215,436 million people , consisting of 2,163,853 males and 2,051,583 females with a population density is 2,388.93/sq km.

Figure K-1: Map of Bogor Regency The land use distribution in the Bogor Regency is as follows: 1. Mixed gar den (kebun campuran) : 84,766 Hectares 2. Rice field (sawah) : 55.348 Hectares 200 3. Dryland (tegalan) : 26,673 Hectares 4. Forest (hutan) : 45,355 Hectares 5. Housing/settlement : 20,843 Hectares 6. Plantation : 17,521 Hectares 7. Dry rice field (tadah hujan) : 10,547 Hectares 8. Similar types of forest land : 10,225 Hectares 9. Other : 1,000 Hectares Implementation of Agrarian Reform Program The Bogor Regency Land Office in cooperation with the Regional G overnment of Bogor Regency conducted an agrarian reform p rogram in Jasinga Sub District (kecamatan) in 2007. The program distributed 2,426 Hectares of HGU land to local farmer s, private comp anies , the Regional Government of Bogor Regency, village administration , research and development sites managed by BPN, and former plantation laborer s. All land distributed has been registered and certified . The t otal land certificates issued for the distribution are 7,000 parcels - divided among 5,900 farmers or land user/cultivator s - and 93 land parcels to others (see above ). The land distributed to the farmer s of Jasinga was expired HGU land that was formerly owned by a private plantation company, PT. PP Jasinga. The total area of HGU land was 2,426.9279 Hectares , covering 10 villages of the Jasinga sub from the ex HGU land to the capital city of Bogor Regency is about 57 km or a 2 -hour drive. Main use of HGU land was as a, s till productive, rubber plantation . Other commodities include palm oil, mixed garden vegetables , dryland crops , dryland ric e field (sawah tadah hujan). A small part is used for housing. Jasinga Plantation w as founded in 1923 with the cultivation of land as tanah partikelir (private land) , in the same y ear converted to Erfpacht right (heriditary use right) and Eigendom nding No. and 3214 in total 201 area of 3,326.05 Hectares that was initially managed by N.V. Cult uur Maat schappij Djasinga and finally managed by the company, Fa. Watie & Co, whose office was in Jakarta. Afterwhile, PT PP London Sumatera controlled the HGU land while the cultivation and utilization of land managed by the PT. PP Jasinga that was estab lished under Notary deed of Mr. R. Kardiman No. 57 dated March 29, 1962 , approved by Minister of Justice No. JA 5/114/2 dated September 27, 1962. The HGU use right of the plantation expired in 1978. PT PP Jasinga changed its name into PT Jasinga Estate a nd proposed an extention of the HGU land rights and received extension approval under the the Stipulation Letter No. 57/HGU/DA/1978 , terminating in in 1998 , with the total area of land of 2,426.90 Hectares. This was at the same time when the Indonesian fin ancial crisis affected the Indonesian economy , and followed by an abdication of the Soeharto Presidency on May 21, 1998. At that time, t he situation was politically and econ omically unstable. Especially , as reflected in mass riot ing in several cities thro ughout the country around May 15, 1998. Indonesia seemed to be in a power vaccum in the transition period between the fall of the Soeharto adminstration and the new Presidency of Habibie that had yet to settle in on a new administration. In many provinces , the end of the Soeharto administartion was welcomed and followed by the occupation and \"reclaiming \" of many plantation s by farmer s who had been waiting for decades to take back what they considered \"family land\", illegall y occupied by plantation companie s, government or other legal entities . According to the former head of Setu village, the process of agrarian refo rm in Jasinga took several years. It was started by the heads and people from ten villages whose territory was part of the plantation area . It mobilized a people movement that sought to occupy and reclaim land taken many years ago. The process started with group meetings and discussions. L etters with requests were send to the Regent of the Bogor R egency, indicating that an association of peo ple and farmer s from ten villages of the Jasinga sub district asked for the distribution of HGU land owned by PT. PP Jas inga to the people who had occupied the HGU land since it HGU right 202 expired in 1998. A response to the first letters to the Regent was n ot received. Subsequent requests finally were approved by the Regent, especially after the Bogor Land Office decided to implement an agrarian reform program. The former head of Setu Village indicated that the approval process was far from easy. While the p etitioners were waiting a response from the regent, they organized a mass rally at the office of the Bogor regency to exert political pressure and seek public awareness and involvement. . The group also met many times with the management of PT. PP Jasinga . Those meeting s were very productive and resulted in the two parties reaching agreements, as follow s: 1. Agreement between PT. PP Jasinga, represented by Mr. Boch R. Sersan si and the head of Koleang village (Mr. Sadeli represented the people of ten villages ) to release 86 Hectares of HGU land to be redistributed to land user s (penggarap) from Koleang village. 2. MOU between PT. PP Jasinga and representative s of ten villages in the Jasinga sub district about cooperation to utilize part of HGU land managed by PT. PP Jasinga. 3. Based o f a land survey of state land of ex HGU land o f PT. PP Jasinga by the West Java Land Office in 2001, 419.3185 Hectares of the HGU land was to be redistributed to people of ten villages of Jasinga sub district. 4. Written approval by the Director PT. PP Jasinga dated January 28, 2002, representated by Drs. HE Syukur Alwan , for the cultivation of ex HGU land of PT. PP Jasinga by people of the ten villages with a total area of 537.6777 Hectares. 5. Written approval on January 4, 2003 to release land rights by PT. PP Jasinga and provide 1.5 hectares of ex HGU land for a Setu village market. 6. Written approval by Mr. H. Tb. Adjenar Arifin, SE on behalf of PT. PP Jasinga dated January 29, 2003, indicating that the area of ex HGU land would be extende d to 1,350.4147 Hectares, permitting people to cultivate 537.67777 Hectares, and agreeing in principle to transfer land ownership to the people. 7. Minutes of meetings dated May 12 and 18, 2005 stating that PT. PP Jasinga in principle did not object to the oc cupation and utilization by people of 419.3185 Hectares and 537.6777 hectares , respectively. The agreements reached are summarized in the following table : 203 Table K-1.

Previously Banten was part of West Java Province. Banten was officially separated to West Java Province in October 4, 2000 when the House of Representative approved the promulgation of Law No. 23/2000 Concerning the Forming of Banten Province. The t otal area of Pandeglang regency is 274,690 Hectares or about 31.24 percent of Banten Province . It consists of 35 sub district s (kecamatan) and 335 villages (desa/kelurahan). The t otal population of Pandeglang regency is 1,139,000 people with 328,224 household s consisting of 577,244 of males and 547,253 females. The p opulation density of Pandeglang is 415 people per sq km.

The number of land parcels registered during the period of 1963 - 2008 , is approximately 19.25 percent of the area. In the same period, about 104.710 Hectares or 38.12 percent of state land and 206 former adat land had not been registered.

The source of land is originally from the land reform program in 1960s. As such, most land that has been certified was already occupied by the beneficiaries and their families or had been transferred to other s. This evidence can be found in the records of the Pandeglang Land Office that desc ribes generally the size and location of existing or potential land. Existing maps are limited in their usefulness for the identification of land parcels. The table below lists the total area of existing and potential land for agrarian reform . Table K-3. List of Size and Location of the Existing and Potential Agrarian Reform Land in Pandeglang 2008 No. Site/Location Total Area (Hectares) The Pandeglang Land Office ( Kantor Pertanahan Pandeglang) has been actively implementing agra rian reform (land redistribution and certification) since the program was initially announced by The National Land Agency (BPN) in the end of 2006. In 2007, the Land Office had completed several l and redistribution programs in the Cibaliung Sub district. Total beneficiaries of the land redistribution progra m were 583 people. The land ca me from the land reform program in the 1960s, with parcels already occupied for mor e than 40 years and finally registered under the land redistribution program. 209 The Pandeglang Land Office has been continuing to implement the agrarian reform program in 2008 by increasing the number of parcels and beneficiaries of the program. The following table lists the location (village and sub district/kecamatan), total area, beneficiaries and total number of land parcel s distributed. Table K-4.

After a successful land distribution program in 2008, the Pandeglang land office will conduct another land redistribution program fo r 2009. The program will involve five villages that can be seen in \"orange color\" the table below. The five villages where the site of agrarian reform program are as follow s: 1. Cibungur : 240 land parcels 2. Sidamukti : 160 land parcels 3. Citeureup : 200 land pa rcels 4. Waringin Jaya : 200 land parcels 5. Suka Mulya : 50 land parcels 210 Source : Pandeglang Land Office, 2009 Figures K-3 and K-4. Location of Agrari an Reform Program in Pandeglang, 2008 (top) and 2009 . 211 Types of Land in Agrarian Reform The existing regul ation on land reform, Government Regulation No. 226 Year 1961 , determines several types of land for distribution. The five types of land are : absentee land, excess land, \"partikelir\" land (private land), ex prince ly land (tanah bekas swapraja), and other s tate's land. Under this regulation, the Pandeg lang land office has identified the land subject to l and reform (certification) and distributed since th e land reform program in 1960s, by examining any existing record s in the Land office. After this, land su rveys are conduct ed and parcels with measurements are recorded in the office. Further verification includes description of location, boundary, existing use, adjacent land, etc. At the sam e time, the office also verifies the legal status of the land title a nd the existence of previous title transfers and potential claims. After all necessary verification, the land is registered and a certificate of ownership is issued. This program, in fact, by its certification process, legalizes the land distribution (refo rm) and associated land ownership carried out in the 1960s. Existing Use and Size of Distributed Land One of the agrarian reform objectives is to increase the productivity of the agriculture sector. Currently, the production orientation of the agrarian r eform program is still relevant and must be reemphasized further to attain its major goals. Furthermore, the agrarian reform program should define and implement the detail arrangements of a land reform program including the source of land and its beneficia ries. The National Land Agency has added important goals for the agrarian reform program, including the alleviation poverty and reducing unemployment in Indonesia. These additional objectives will change the design (land sources and qualifying beneficiarie s) of the future programs. The current implementation of agrarian reform in Pandeglang does not provide a clear definition of the qualifications of the recipients and the desired utilization of land. Findings also indicate that the primary type of land s elected for distribution and certification varied in the absence of a clear definition by the Land Office. Many 212 beneficiaries are not really farmers. They may represent various professions and sectors and still can be certified as land owners. As example, the land certified includes various land uses in 2008: 1. Housing 2. Wetland (sawah/rice field) 3. Garden (kebun) 4. Pekarangan (Home garden) 5. Farming 6. Dry land. Parcel sizes distributed are quite variable. The maximum size is about 2 hectares and the minimum size is b etween 100 sq m - 200 sq m. The number of land parcel distributed and registered for each family or person under the agrarian reform program various from 1-2. One is typical. Access Reform After land distribution and registration, access to financial and technical assistance needs to be provided. Without such assistance there is doubt that recipients can utilize the land to effectively improve their livelihood, long -term. In that case, they are likely sell the land to others and use the money for consumpt ive rather than productive purposes. The National Land Agency anticipated the lack of financial and technical capacity and enco uraged some ministries and private companies or bank s to assist land reform recipients to utilize their land more productively. To address this need, the Pandeglang land office also coordinates with the Regional Government of Pandeglang Regency and related institutions, ministries such as the office of agriculture, office of cooperative and banking industries to help the benefic iaries of agrarian reform. This includes the facilitation of agreement s and cooperation between the beneficiaries and any financial and technical assistance sources . The Pandeglang land office in cooperation with the regional government of Pandeglang had be en working on a national program on plantation, agriculture, forestry and fisheries , 213 since 2008. The program is financed b y the central government and seeks to revitalize existing programs . related to plantation s, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Vario us decrees are passed for this purpose: a) Decree of the Regent of Pandeglang Regency No. 522/KEP.22 -HUK/2008 Concerning the forming of an Advisory Team on Plantation Development, involving the head of the Pandeglang land office as member , b) Decree of the Regent of Pandeglang Regency No. 522/KEP.24 -HUK/2008 Concerning Authority Delegation to the Head of Plantation and Forestry Office of Pandeglang to Determine Farmer recipients for Assistance of the Revitalization Program , and c) Decree of Head of Plantati on and Forestry Office No. 525/246/HUTBUN/2008 Concerning the Forming of Technical Team on Plantation Development in Pandeglang , that includes the head of the Land Office as team member . This opportunity was used by the Head of Land Office to combine the revitalization program with the agrarian reform program . The revitalization program provides financial assistance (soft loan s) in an amount of IDR 20 Millions to participan ts who own about 1 Hectare of land and qualify for other requirements as determined by the revitalization te am. Since one of the requirements includes a land certific ate it gives the Pandeglang land office an opportunity to connect the revitalization program with agrarian reform . Two villages were selected to be part of the revitalizati on program and the agrarian reform program. Those vi llages are Tarumanegara and Sinarjaya village of the Cigeulis Sub District (kecamatan). 214 The Agrarian Reform Program in South Lampung Regency South Lampung regency is located in southern p art of Lampung province. The regency has total area of about 340,583 Hectares or 10.32 percent of total area of Lampung province. It consists of 24 sub districts (kecamatan) and 387 villages (desa/kelurahan). The largest kecamatan is Padang Cermin sub -district with a total area of 42,731 Hectares or 12.55 percent of total area of South Lampung Regency, while Way Sulan sub -district is the smallest kecamatan with 4,932 Hectares. According to the Lampung Land Office (2006), the population in South Lampung was 1,230,784 people with 280,710 households that consist of 638,542 males and 592,242 females. The population density of Lampung in 2006 was 3.61 people/hectares. In 2008, the work force in South Lampung was 577,191 people with 54,859 unemployed, while in 2007, the number of people below the poverty line in South Lampung was 371,800 (26.94 %). In 2007, the largest percentage of land in South Lampung was in agriculture, especially the use as mixed garden which covered 29.59 percent of total area of the regenc y. The second largest use of land was as dry land (tegalan) or 17.74 percent, followed by 16.38 percent of wet land (sawah/rice field) , 13.10 percent of settlement/housing, 10.49 percent of plantation, 8.67 percent of forest, 2.77 percent of other uses an d 0.98 percent of fishpond or lake. Generally, Lampung land and forest area are predominantly occupied by individual land owners with 70.97 percent of total area of the regency, followed by 5.14 of HGU land, 0.72 percent of Security and Defense Ministry' s land (Hankam), and 0.51 percent of HGB. The rest is considered state land - with 11.73 percent of protection forest, 10.08 percent of permanent production forest, and 0.85 percent of natural protection forest. In 2008, South Lampung was divided into 2 r egencies: South Lampung Regency and Pesawaran Regency. Since the Pesawaran Regency Land Office has not been established 215 until the end of 2008, all activities of Pesawaran Land Office was still managed under South Lampung Land Office. Implementation of A grarian Reform Program South Lampung Regency has many potential land sources for agrarian reform. According to data collected in 2007, there are 25,563 hectares of potential land originating from the conversion of forest land. The regency also includes la nd from the land reform program in 1960s. Currently, only 9,360 hectares are available for formal distribution although the land is currently occupied. In 2007, South Lampung Regency Land Office redistributed (certified) 4,984 land parcels divided into 1 761 land parcels to people in Pesawaran Indah village and 3223 land parcels in Wates Way Ratai village.The majority of these people are farmers who till the land and control on the average 0.3052 hectare in Pesawaran Indah and 0.5718 hectare in Wates Way R atai. The main commodities are coconut, cocoa, and coffee. In 2008, South Lampung continued the certification even though some villages that previously were located inside South Lampung became territory of new Pesawaran Regency. The following table summar izes this program (Table K -5): Table K -5.

The principal two land uses are cash cropp ing (commodities such as coffee, cocoa, coconut, etc.) and second, as pekarangan (home garden). Access Reform To follow up the land distribution (certification) program, the South Lampung Land Office helped organize and coordinate an access reform for be neficiaries by inviting stakeholders in land affairs in Lampung such as the Regional Government of South Lampung Regency and other institutions/agencies to assist in the following activities: 1. Institutional Access: The land office encouraged farmer in the area of agrarian reform program to form informal farmer groups and associations. This resulted in the establishment of 2 farmer group in South Lampung in 2007 2. Access to Farming Business: Farmers or group of farmer were assisted by the University of Lampun g and PT Garuda Food Putra Putri Jaya to develop and improve their technical capacity in farming system manament. 3. Access to Technology: This was facilitated by inviting several stakeholders like the Agricultural Technology Assessment Agency (BPTP), Univers ity of Lampung and the Research Center for Cocoa from Jember, East Java. 4. Access to Capital: The Land office invited several banks, like the Bank of Indonesia, Niaga Bank, , Syariah BNI Bank and Syariah Mandiri Bank to meet farmers. 5. Access to Markets: The L and Office encourages land owners to cooperate with PT. Sinar Laju Abadi, PT GGLC and PT. Garuda Food Putra Putri Jaya. 217 Figure 5. Map of South Lampung Regency (Source: Lampung Province Land Office, 2009) The Agrarian Reform Program in Central Lampung Central Lampung is one of the regencies in Lampung Province with a strategic regional location and possibly the highest economic potential given its position between the inland region and the city in South Sumatra Island. Total area of Central Lampung is 4789.82 sq km that consist of 28 sub districts (kecamatan) and 293 villages (desa/kampong/kelurahan). The people of Central Lampung can be divided into indigenous people (Kebuain Abung Siwo Migo and Pubian communities) and migrants from many areas of In donesia. The 218 majority of Lampung's people came from Java Island. According to the Lampung Land Office (2008), the population in Central Lampung was 1,160,221 people, consisting of 593,746 males and 566,475 females. The population density of Central Lampun g in 2008 was 242 people/sq km. In 2008, work force in Central Lampung was 540,678 people with 27,795 people unemployed with 263,000 people (22.06 %) below the poverty line. Impl ementation of Agrarian Reform Central Lampung Regency has also many potentia l land sources. According to BPN data collected in 2007, there were 15,347 potential hectares originating from forest conversion. The regency has also land from the land reform program in 1960s. Currently, only 1,384 hectares are available for distributi on (certification) although the land is occupied. In 2007, Central Lampung Regency Land Office redistributed 1316 land parcels divided into 800 land parcels for people in Sidorejo village and 516 land parcels in Sidodadi village.In 2008, the Central La mpung Regency distributed agrarian reform object in several villages as follows : No. Village Beneficiaries Number of Certificates Number of Pekarangan Number of Farm Size (sq m) 1 SIDODADI 75 78 3 74 197,021 2 SIDOREJO 97 97 26 74 257,250 Source: Lamp ung Province Land Office, 2009. The majority of people in Sidorejo cultivate corn on their dry land, together with cocoa, rubber, and palm oil, while Sidodadi villages produce commodities such as cocoa, coffee, palm oil, cocoa, etc. Access Reform The Cen tral Lampung Land Office helped organize access by inviting stakeholders in land affairs in Lampung such as Regional Government of Central Lampung, the University of Lampung, the State -Owned Plantation Company (PTPN) VII, ASPINDO Lampung, PT Great Giant P ineapple Co (GGPC), PT Garuda Food Putra Putri Jaya, the 219 Agricultural Technology Assessment Agency (BPTP), Syariah BNI Bank, and Syariah Mandiri Bank. Land Certification of Land Distributed in Jasinga Sub District (Kecamatan) The land use associated with the land distributed and registered to people or institution s in the ten villages of Jasinga, are as follows: 1. Housing 2. Plan for housing 3. Mixed garden (kebun) 4. Bamboo garden 5. Rubber plantation 6. Cassava 7. Rice field (wet land/sawah) 8. Settlement 9. School 10. Public health service 11. Cooperative 12. Village administrative office 13. Sport field (foot ball) 14. Mosque 15. Official teacher housing facility 16. Agriculture 17. Cemetery 18. Public security station 19. Village land inventory 20. Badminton Sport field 21. Dryland agriculture (tegalan) 220 22. Religious center 23. Ham let plan Parcel size of land distributed Parcel sizes distributed in Jasinga varied a lot. For individua ls, the maximum of land size is around 1 Hectares or less . If the recipient is an institution or government entity , the parcel size is much bigger. Acc ording to former head of Setu village, the size of individual parcels received under the agrarian reform program depend s on how much ex HGU land was occupied by each person . This typically means that someone with greater financial assets and ability to man age land receives a larger plot of land. Resolution of land dispute s Consensus building on land distribution between PT PP Jasinga and people of the ten villages were not easy. Each party argued their position on controlling and utilizing the ex HGU la nd. PT PP Jasinga was in strong and document ed position to legally control the land with the the oppo rtunity to extend the HGU land rights. On the other hand, people of the ten villages had occupied and cultivated the HGU land for years while they argues that PT PP Jasinga actua lly managed only parts of the HGU land and did not cultivate all the land. Under the agrarian reform program, the National Land Agency was a mediator between the two parties and sought to reach a \"win-win solution\" of this problem. Finally , and after a long, difficult deliberation between both parties, PT PP Jasinga and the people of the ten villages reached agreement as follows: 1. Consensus dated May 1, 1998 to manage part of ex HGU land by applying a polyculture (tumpang sari) p lanting system on 419 Hectares. 2. Consensus dated May 17, 2000 between PT PP Jasinga and Head of Koleang Villa ge stated PT PP Jasinga releasing 86 Hectares of ex HGU land. 3. Statement letter s dated January 28, 2002; January 4, 2003; and January 29, 2003 that allow ed people of the ten villages to cultivate land and provide 1.5 Hectares of land for a village market in Setu village. 221 4. The three agreements above were improved and completed with statement letter of PT PP Jasinga dated January 15, 2007 releasing 1,038.2734 Hectares and providing for land cultivation in the ten villages of Jasinga sub district; 100 Hectares for the Regional Government of Bogor regency and 30.1565 hectares for an agrarian reform research site of the National Land A gency. Access Reform To ad dress the problem of access reform, the Bogor Land Office coordinated help to beneficiaries for financial and technical assistance with the Regional Government of Bogor R egency . The nation was expressed that farmer s and people who receive land must be proa ctive and actively looking for opportunities for financial assistance . In addition, farmers are also encou raged to establish farmers groups. After land distribution , small farmer groups have emerged in Jasinga , including the farmer g roup \"Binangkit\" of Village Curug, the farmer group \"Pol village, and \"hara pan maju\" in Pangradin village and other villages. 222 The Agrarian Reform Program in Blitar Regency Blitar Regency consist of a mountainous region including the Kelud and Butak mountains, and hilly terrain in the southern part of the regency. It also includes some flat and coastal land. According to the Statistic Office, the total area of the regency is 158,879 Hectares. Administr atively, Blitar Regency is divided into 22 ecamatan ) and 248 villages ( Desa/Kelurahan ). 21 sub district had been established a long time ago but the Selopuro sub district was established in 1999, previously a part of Wlingi sub districts ( 7 villages) and Talun sub district (1 village ). The 2000 population was 1,064,643 people, increasing in 2004 to 1,111,957 and in 2005 to 1,295,601, consisting of 657,012 males and 638,589 females. The population density in 2005 was 815 people/sq km. Land Use in Blitar Land use in Blitar Regency is dominated by agricultural with around 59 percent of total area of the regency or 97, 340 Hectares. It consists of 35,442 Hectares of sawah (wet land/rice field) , dry land (t egalan ) 53,259 Hectares, and mixed gardens 8,659 Hectares . After President Suharto stepped down in 1998, many farmers and people of Blitar regency \"reclaimed\" and occupied plantation and forest land, converting it into new dry land agriculture. Housing generally developed near the capital of sub district (kecamatan). Total area of housing in Blitar is 30, 912 Hectares or 18,9 % percent . Plantation land is 12.74 percent or 20,747 Hectares . Because the land is fertile, many plantations developed in this regency. Currently there are 22 big plantation companies mostly located in the northern part of the Brantas river watershed. In 1999, 16 plantation companies faced land conflict s with local people. Among of them, only 5 plantation issues were totally resolved. . The total area of forest is 12.74 percent or 20,747 Hectares . One of the main activities of Blitar's people is animal husbandry for beef or milk. The area is a main supplier of meat and milk for East Java Province. 223 According the BPN, 634,551 land parcels out of total area of 162,8 80 Hectares are subject to building and land tax (PBB). But only 183,393 land parcels ( 28.02 %) that have been registered and recorded in the Blitar land Office, with 471,198 land parcels or 71.98 % yet to be registered. Implementation o f Agrarian reform Program The Blitar Regency Land Office has carried out the agrarian reform program for a long time. In 2007, land distribution was conducted in 5 sub -districts that covered 5 villages. The table below describes the distribution of land a t that time. Table K -6.

Map of Blitar R egency 226 The Agrarian Reform Program in Kolaka Regency of South East Sulawesi The Kol aka regency is located in south -east Sulawesi and occupies and area from the north to the south of South East Sulawesi province. Kolaka regency has 6.918.38 sq km of total land a rea and 15.000 sq km of sea. It consists of 20 sub -districts (kecama tan) and 213 villages. In 1990, the population of Kolaka regen cy was 239.731 with a significantly increase over ten years to 323.329 people in 2000. In 2005. the Kolaka regency was divided into two regencies: Kolaka regency and Kolaka regency. In 2008. The population of Kolaka regency was 281.450 people of 71. 246 household with 0.9% of population growth rate , and consisting of 139.939 males and 141 .511 females. Sector employment is 72.945 people in agriculture, 11.674 in m anufacturing and 29.446 in the service sector. Land use in Kolaka is summarized below: Table K -8.

The increasing in the area of sawah from 2007 to 2008 was very small, with in 2007, 17,613 Hectares and 18,161 Hectares in 2008. 227 Food cr ops produced in Kolaka regency are rice, corn, cassava, sweet potato es, soybean s, etc, while plantation commodities include coconut, coffee, cashew s, pepper, cocoa, clove s, ugarcane , tobacco, etc. Only six of these are commonly planted by private farmers, namely coconut, coffee, pepper, clove, cashew nut, cocoa and sago. Most of the land area is state forest consisting of five types of forest: regular production forest, limited production forest, protection forest, forest tourism, and production conversion forest. In 2007 , the total area of forest was 517,775 H ectares, increased in 2 008 to 621,027 Hectares. The following figure is the map of Kolaka regency. Figure K -7. Map of Kolaka Regency (Source: South East Sulawesi Land Office, 2009) In the period of 2000 -2008, the number of Stipulation Letter (SK) of land rights significan tly increased . The SK is the evidence of formal ownership and required for peop le to register land. The SK is issued by the land office to grant new land right s for people or legal entities on original state land. In 2000, only 354 people or any legal enti ty 228 who own s Building Use Right (HGB) with total area 18,065 sq m. Ownership right is only owned by 2,608 people with a total area 8,259,161 sq m. In 2008 n o person or institution received HGB and the number of SK issued were 5,155 or 38,662,500 sq m. New Approach to Agrarian Reform Program in South East Sulawesi Most land distributed originates from the land reform program in 1960s. Generally, the land was redistributed a long time ago but had not yet been yet registered. Land registration and title certi fication provides access to financial resources and technical assistance. The South East Sulawesi Land Office primarily relies on the distribution of HGU land to people and provide businesses opportunities as a cooperative venture. The goal is to distribu te land to people, provide financial and technical access to manage their land, and for businesses to assure a safe production environment with available of certified land that can safely be cultivated. The cooperation with business provide also access mar kets The South East in 2007 when Mr. Doddy Imron Cholid was head of the office. He in itiated cooperation between the office and PT. Dam ai Jaya Lestari (DJL) of Kendari by establishing agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between BPN and PT. Damai Jaya Lestari. The agreement was signed by Mr. Doddy as representative of South East Sulawesi Land Office and Mr. Sudarjo Soemitro who represented PT. Damai Jaya Lestari. The agreement stated the both parties agree d to cooperate in a land certification program for the following ten villages in two sub -districts (kecamatan) of Kolaka regency : 1. ub district (kecamatan) 2. Tondowolio Village of Tanggetada Sub district 3. Oneha Village of Tanggetada Sub district 4. Lamoiko Village of Tanggetada Sub district 229 5. Puundaipa Village of Tanggetada Sub district 6. Polenga Village of Watubangga Sub district 7. Polinggona Vi llage of Watubangga Sub district 8. Plasma Jaya Village of Watubangga Sub district 9. Kukutio Village of Watubangga Sub district 10. Langgosipi Village of Watubangga Sub district There are program aspects included: 1. PT. Damai Jaya Lestari (DJL) as first party tasks BPN to arrange and conduct a land certification program to develop palm a oil plantation. 2. The number of land parcel to be certificated or registered is 2900 parcels. The cost needed to register land pa rcel is IDR 534,000 for each land parcel, with a to tal cost of IDR 1,548,600,000.00 to be paid by PT. Damai Jaya Lestari. This is provided in the form of a farm loan. The 2900 land parcels registered will be di stributed to the people of ten villages The average size of land parcel is 1 Hectares . The ag reement provides a direct co operation between a private plantation company and farmers who need help in financial assistance in the productive management of their land. The cooperation is based on thousand of contracts between PT DJL and beneficiaries of a grarian r eform program in Kolaka regency, while providing individual security and protection. The following are operational aspects of the contract or partnership agreement between PT DJL and the people of Kolaka : 1. Mr. Soedarjo Sumitro, director of PT DJ L represented PT DJL to sign any contract related to agrarian reform program in South East Sulawesi. 2. The contract period between PT DJL is twice the productive planting time or 50 years. 230 3. PT DJL will receive product s from the land contracted. 4. PT DJL provide s working capital working to start the cultivating palm oil . 5. Total amount of working capital working provided for each of 1 Hectare s land parcel is IDR 24 Million, and considered a farm loan. 6. The c ost of land certification is IDR 540 Thousands , provided a s farm loan. 7. The a dministration cost and acquiring letter of ownership evidence cost are IDR 460 thousands and also considered a farm loan. 8. A sharecropping agreement that states that PT DJL will receive 60 percent of total production of land area contrac ted, while the land owner will receive 40 percent of total production of the contracted land. 9. The land owner pays the debt (working capital, cost of land certification and administration cost) in an amount of 30 percent of production of the 40 percent the contracted land areas monthly. 10. The land certificate will be kept by PT DJL during the period of loan contract. 11. PT DJL will return the land certificate after all debt is paid by the land owner. Challenges During the fieldwork, interesting facts emerged . In one case, t he original owner already transferred land to other people. So the partnership contract to utilize land was made between PT DJL and the second land owner s. Interesting ly, the second owner s were not local people, but people from other islan ds. Staff of PT DJL indicated that similar vents occurred and that many of the current land owners were not local people anymore. This issue needs to be investigated further. If a large number curre nt land owners are not local, this means that the agrarian r eform program may not achieve its main objective , namely to improve the long -term prosperity of local people and achieve social justice for marginalized people. 231 GROUP INTERVIEW ON ACCESS REFORM TOPIC : LAND CERTIFICATION AND ACCESS REFORM PLACE : 3, 2009 TIME : 12:30 PM - CLOSING (NOTES AND COMMENTS (C) BY SAIFUL HIKAM, Ph.D , DEPARTMENT OF CROP LAMPU NG, EDITED BY G.SCH ULTINK AND BASED ON QUESTIONS TO THE FARMERS GROUP ASSEMBLED, CONSISTING OF ABOUT 30 PEOPLE) 1. Question : How easy is it to get access to credits from formal or informal institution s after issuance of land certificates? Answer (given by Mr. Suprapto from Wates village): I have 1 hectare (ha) of rice field and 2 ha of cacao plan tation certified . I borrowed money from the BRI bank of IDR50millions with an interest rate of 22.5% per annum. Yes, the certificates were accepted by t he bank as the collateral for the credit. Comment : I think Mr. Suprapto took the bank credit of a multipurpose kind. Once given, the bank lets the borrower decide how the money is used. The multipurpose credit is commonly considered a consumptive o ne, the interest rate is (much) higher than the credit for invest ment. Usually, the interest for the multipurpose credit is 16 % per annum as compared to 6% for the investment credit. For agricultural activity, it becomes impossible for a single farmer t o get the credit from the bank. The agriculture credit named KKP ( Kredit Ketahanan Pangan , food resiliency credit), must be taken in group of 500 - 1,000 ha per unit. This KKP credit needs an avalis (guarantor) that is required to ensure that farmers cultivate the land profitably. Should farmer (s) be unable to pay back the loan, the avalis must take over the credit (s). For that, the avalis will charge the farmers as high as 40 % of the credit amount. Whether there is a legal regulation or contract con cerning the avalis is not clear. The avalis is required by the bank since the fiscal year 1997/98. 2. Q: Comments on sales of crops? A: Sales are through middlemen. Price of cacao fluctuates from IDR 10,000 - 20,000 per kg and depends on the quality of the cacao seeds. 232 The middlemen are not fair in weighing and determining water content of the produce . Best price is obtained with a w ater content at 10 %. C: The p rice of plantation products depends on international market prices. This is true for coffee, cacao, cassava, rubber, and palm oil. It is a common practice that the end traders are in Bandar Lampung, the capital city; and ther e are 2 - 3 middlemen involved . The trading between a farmer and a middleman is often tarnished by the practice of unfair weighing and measuring of water content. It is really hard, though, to achieved and maintain a 10 % water content at the farm level due to the lack of proper drying and storing facilities. This is worsened by the relative humidity in the tropics that is always higher than 86 %. In the U.S. , for example, a water content of 15.5 % is considered sufficient in its climate of 49 % humidity. The University of Lampung (Unila) team tried hard (and continues to) to persuade varies parties (farmers, traders, and the local government) to use 13 % w.c. or process the cocoa seeds into cocoa -butter. In addition, some farmers m ay have borrowed funds from the middlemen as part of a sales contract. While the commodity price follows the prevailing market price at time of the sale, high loan interest s may become a burden for farmers. 3. Q: Is there community interest in other cro ps or livestock ? A: The m ain crops in the area are rice and cacao, but we grow coffee, coconut, and chili pepper s but these of minor importan ce. Especially for chili-pepper, efforts to enlarge the acreage are hampered by limited land availability. We are interested in raising cattle . C: In the 2007 - 08 project, th e BPN and the Unila team invited Dr. Gunawan ( a veterinary doctor and the super visor for cattle raising of the Great Giant Livestock Com pany with about 20,000 units per year ). The GGLC was the avalis for cattle raising in Kabupaten Lampung Tengah, another project site of the BPN), asking him if the GGLC could help farmers in Wates with the cattle raising. We were informed that it might be difficult for the farmers to raise cattle of Australian origin , as did the GGLC . It was also difficulty f or the GGLC to supervise to provide advice given the 150 km distance. We were advised that the Wates farmers would be bett er off with raising local stock , but it was next to impossible to find avalis as responsible as the GGLC. Perhaps the BPN may support the farmers in raising goats instead after an intensive study on farmer competency and cli mate suitability. 4. Q: Any comment on the program from a 0.5 ha farmer present here? A: My name is Muhart oyo from Wates . I was born here and inherited my land from my father. W e still cannot make use of the pods of the cacao fruit. The pods are considered and treated as waste , though we are already taught by the Unila team to make animal feeds out of the pods. We understand quite well how to produce the feed but we do not have 233 the animals to be fed. Perhaps the BPN is willing to loan u s some capital to make this a possibility? C: To proc ess feed out of cacao pods needs a tool to chop -off the pods which are tough . Since the farmers did not have the animals yet, I raised a question whether they could produce and market the f eed. A big no was the answ er. This is a good exam ple how we, the Unila team, have failed to introduce opportunities to the farmer community. I think the 2007 - 08 program was mostly focusing on the idea of self - sufficiency . 5. Q: Could the farmers unify to obtain credit ? A: (No definite answers) C: (see Comment on Q #1) 6. Q: Was there any farmer coop in the past? Do you have any interest in establishing a farmer coop? A: There was no farmer coop in the past, but yes we like to have one. (Hikam tried to remind the farmers of the KUD ( Koperasi Unit Desa ; village -unit cooperation). We had had a KUD established in 1981 to help marketing cloves. Since the KUD did not involve the community, the response to the KUD was (very) low. The KUD management and marketing systems were not transparent. Currently, some farmer's coops exist but the joint capital is very small, , less than IDR50millions (about $5000 per coop ). The main activity of the coops is save -and-loan. If there is any possibility that the Government will support us with capital, we would be very happy. With that support, we would be able to help marketing the cacao directly, cutting out the middlemen. In addition, to buy the production of 2 ha of cacao the coop will n eed some IDR25millions per year ($2500). C: Coop s at the agriculture grass -root is a rather 'tricky' business because the bargaining power is never on the farmer side for exported produce such as cacao or coffee (they have Robusta rather than Arabica)57. The price is mostly stable until the word suffers severe frost in South America - and the pric e goes up quickly , but that is a rare occurrence and only for a short duration. Recently, Indonesia is criticized by international NGOs for 'destroying' forest areas for those crops. In 2008, a NGO claimed, o n the internet, that 50 % of Lampung coffee is produced by converting for est areas. Such claim results in anxiety 57 Schultink: Two basic coffees are grown: Arabica and Robusta. High quality blends consist of 100% Arabica beans. Lower quality, cheaper blends may have some pr oportion of Robusta beans, or they may consist entirely of Robusta. Arabica beans produce a superior taste, more flavorful and complex than Robusta. Robusta coffee trees produce their first crops within about two to three years after planting. Arabica tree s require about four to five years to produce fruit (sometimes with a better quality under shade). Farmers sometimes grow the faster growing variety to take advantage of upswings in the price of coffee. Robusta coffee can grow under a wider variety of envi ronmental conditions than Arabica. It is more tolerant to lower temperatures and, consequently grows well in a wider range of altitudes. Second, roasters buy the Robusta beans because they are generally cheaper than Arabica . 234 among exporters and affect pricing policy , resulting in lower prices. I have talked with a concerned coffee -exporting company head - quartered in Switzerland , and asked if the company is willing to comply with the Fair -trade and the Rain -Forest Alliances. Membership in these NGOs results in additional costs to the company and to teach their contracted coffee -farmers . During our dinner discussion last night, I learned that NESTLE is the long -time buyer for coffee produced in Way Kanan area, one of the areas with BPN certification programs in Lampung. Perhaps in the future the strategies of land certification (that means no more farming on forest land) together with complying with environmental issues under the supervision of buying companies will reduce such criticism and price will farm producers. 7. Q: Is it possible to have a loan coop run by the farmers? A: It would face problems with availab le human resources due to low education level the farmers have and the government regulation on banking. C: (no comment) 8. Q: On technical assistance by the Government, what is needed and provided? A: We need assistances in (1) processing of cacao seeds to improve quality, (2) processing cacao pods for feed, and (3) low interest loans. C: Especially in processing, it is a rather 'easy' task to do since what needed is only a simple fermentation process (I believe that the Unila team has taught it). However, the process is time consuming and requires cleanlines s from the start: separating from the pulp, plenty of clean fresh -water to wash the pulp residue off the seed surface, a covered drying platform that is fly -free - all these aseptic condi tions seem beyond the farmer 's ability. In addition, cacao harvest is done every other day or once in every three days. This is a rather short harvest interval, plus the need for instant cash makes it impossible to ferment the seeds. The alternative is to provide the farmers as group (s) the skills and facilities to produce cacao butter (see C for Q#2). 9. Q: What other crops as options? A: We have coconut, coffee (Robusta), banana, and chili-pepper but of minor importance. Actually we started with cu ltivating coffee and replaced it with cacao in 1990s. The reasons for the replacement are (1) better price, (2) harvest every week, not like coffee which harvest twice a year, and (3) lower management cost. C: There is a potenti al danger in the way Wates ' farmers plant cacao trees - too dense! Average density is 800 trees per ha (instead of 600 as recommended) some even have 1,200 trees/ha - no direct sunlight ever rea ches the soil surface anymore. This makes soil fungi grow easily and uncontrollably and infect the trees and the fruits (this is happening now). When the trees grow older and bigger, they wi ll 235 compete for soil nutrients. The Unila team has yet to learn how to tell the farmers about these risks because right now the short-term revenues outwei ghs the long-term risk. ( We also figure that it will be more difficult to take out excess trees when they are much bigger than they are now ). 10. Q: I would like to hear from someone else among you. Mr. Teguh Warsito from Wates village responded to t he invitation. 11. Q: How large is your land? A: 0.25 ha. Tha t is because I am a new comer. I move d to this village in 1995. I consider myself lucky to be able to buy that piece of land since even in that time land was becoming scarce here. 12. Q: What do you cultivate? A: Corn. 13. Q: What is the purpose of cultivating corn? A: To fulfill my family needs. It is not sufficient, though, but I have other businesses. My land produces 1.25 metric tons per ha at the selling price of max of IRD2,500 per kg. C: I do believe that Mr. Warsito has opportunities to plant horticulture crops like chili-pepper, but he sees better opportunities outside agriculture. 14. Q: What do you think about receiving credit from a bank? A: I farm with my own money, but in w ould like to ask for a loan from middleman on a yarnen (bayar -panen ; paid with harvest) basis. C: Mr. Warsito is an example of C for Q#2 15. Q: Are you still interested in getting the credit from the bank? A: You bet! 16. Q: Why didn't you apply fo r the credit? A: The procedure is too complicated and the interest rate is too high. I do not have any collateral for the credit. 17. Q: Do you think th at you need assistance from the Government services? A: Not really, since I Pertanian Menengah Atas . Literally translated: High in Ag. Sci - Vocational School in Agriculture) C: Mr. Warsito's education level is the basic level required from a field extension service. 18. Q: So, you know all you need about agricul ture? A: In my opinion knowledge should come together with financial support. 19. Q: Anyone else would respond? Mr. Kustama from Way Urang village volunteered. 20. Q: Do you have any experience to share from what we have discussed so far? A: We have experiences on running a coop. The Kabupaten Gove rnment, Lampung Selatan, before it separated into a new kabupaten, Pesawaran, support ed our coop in excess of IRD12millions. Nowadays, 236 we have increase d our capital to IRD25millions ($2500) . Our c oop plans to buy cacao from farmer s, but has difficulty because we do not have competent management. C: Perhaps this case has to be considered carefully since in my opinion the coop would easily slip to become a middle -trader, for better or for worse. The Unila tea m advised such coop to help market the produce and for the farmer members to collect the cacao produce and trust the coop to market it. The coop would receive 25 % of the profit. 21. Q: In the case a coop member borrow smoney from your coop, what is the interest rate? A: Very low. A 2 % interest per month (others responded their disagreement since it means 24 % interest per annum, even higher than the BRI bank of 22.5 % interest per annum). Some of you may think that the interest rate is (too) high, however, all the interests receivable are reinvested to increase the coop capital. C: It is a common practice that a coop would charge a 1 % interest per month for a payback duration of 10 months. Another 'weakness' of the coop, I would say, is the max am ount one can borro w is IRD5millions - too small amount by today 's standard s, but hard to payback. The coop usually regulates the payback in term of equal monthly installment s. This amount is prohibitively high. 22. Q: Any other remarks or suggestions? A: (from Mr. Dwi Warsito from Gunung Rejo village). It is best for the Government to support poor households in term s of agriculture inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides . In my village, there are 150 households altogether; among them are 100 household s that have been classified as poor by the Government. And 50 households do not have land - they work as sharecroppers. 237 GROUP INTERVIEW ON ACCESS REFORM TOPIC : LAND CERTIFIC ATION AND ACCESS REFORM AUGUST 4, 2009 TIME : 12:00 PM - CLOSING (NOTES AND COMMENTS (C) BY SAIFUL HIKAM, Ph.D, DEPARTMENT OF CROP SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF LAMPUNG, BANDAR LAMPUNG, EDITED BY G.SCH ULTINK AND BASED ON QUESTIONS TO THE FARMERS GROUP ASSEMBLED, CONSISTING OF ABOUT 25 PEOPLE) 1. Question : After your lands were certifiied, how easy was it to obtain credit? What did you do to get the credit ? Did you experience any difficulties to get the credit ? What do you think about the interest rates? Answer (given by Mr. Suratno from Sidorejo, the head of Gapoktan (Gabungan Kelompok Tani; Farmer Group Unification): I w ould like to tell you my experience in tilling the land. We practiced a no -till in planting corn. We used herbicide and applied manure. The kernels we harvested were solely for feed that we sold to Japfa Comfeed (JC), a feed manufacturer. No-till was m ore profitable than tilled planting. My Gapoktan was loaned credits for the corn planting from BSM (Bank Syariah Mandiri; a bank regulated (supposedly) in accordance to Islamic laws (= syariah )). The JC introduced us to the BSM and was willing to be our avalis (guarantor) for the credits, for that we were grateful. No, the JC did not charge us any fee for being our avalis . We only had to sell the corn to the JC with the price at harvest time. Yes, the business between the bank and us was without a go -between. We received our money directly from the bank and paid back the credit also by ourselves . 2. Q (asked by Mr. Syarif, the head of BPN office in Kabupaten Tanggamus ). In 2007 - 08 he was the head of BPN office in Kabupaten Lampung Tengah where this p roject was situated) : Please tell us your experience with the other bank. A: In 2007 , we were introduced to the certification and access programs. We met with a consolidated team of the BPN and the Unila (University of Lampung). We started a program of cattle fattening. We were introduced to a bank BNI -syariah and the GGLC (Great Giant Livestock Company). The GGLC was our avalis and took care of the bank credits. We received 4 stock-bulls of local Brahman, feed and feed -concentrates, vaccines and other medicines, and supervision for involved member s; all for four months. Members involved had to build pens, plant grasses, and prepar e in-family 238 laborers. Caring for the cattle required we obtained a 0.9 kg daily weight gain per bull. The GGLC was the p rimary buyer . However, we could sell to other parties that offered a better price than the price we and the GGLC had agreed on. We paid our debt to the GGLC and kept the difference. Total credit per member was IDR50millions . After 4 month, we profited about IDR4millions. (about $100/month). But now we can go directly to the bank. We buy sto ck-bulls from the GGLC, prepare the feed ourselves , following practices taught by the GGLC and the Unila team. W e already have grasses (green feed) but not the concen trate we buy from Santory (another cattle -feeding company, situated closer than the GGLC to the village, as discarded concentrate ). Santory keeps the concentrate in pen -feeder s only for 24 hours, then it is discarded. We sun -dry the concentrate before gi ven to our cattle . (This practice is confirmed by Mr. Narsih, another Gapoktan leader) We also have a new agreement with the BSM bank . The bank gives us credits for a 5 -year duration, in which we are entitled to a 3-year grace period - in the first 3 year we pay only interest, at a rate of 0.9 % per month C: For better or for worse, we witness changes. As background, from the start in 2007 the BPN (Mr. Sitanggang, former Head of Kanwil Lampung; and Mr. Syarif, former of initiated a three-party work: the BPN, the Unila, and the private companies. In response, the Unila formed a team of 4 lecturers: Drs. Wan an M.S.). The Unila team worked in the 4 villages, pilots for the project; started the access reform (agric. and soc-econ. supervising) at the same time the BPN started the land registration and certification. We initiated programs we call \"empowering local knowledge \". We made villagers realize what potentials and opportunities they have and they could make use of for these opportunities instead of asking support and subsidies from the government , like they used to in the past. We started with reforming and reactivating the Gapoktan in each village. Within a Gapoktan, there are groups of farmers with the same cro ps; agriculture (rice, corn, peanut, cacao, coffe e, rubber, and oil -palm), livestock (cattle -raising due to the fact that raising animal requires a lot less land than for cultivating crop, and (can be) more profitable, too. The ones we witness in Sidorejo are the f irst to start in all 4 villages , and fish - ponds (catfish; only in Pesawaran Indah and Wates having plenty of streams from their mountainous topography). Through Gapoktan meetings, we tried, among others: 239 (1) To established working -links among farming groups to empower self - sufficiency and self -sustainability through recycling: wastes from crops to animals to fishponds back to crops. (2) To differentiate products to obtain better price s: cacao seeds sundried fermented making cocoa but ter. (3) To differentiate market -places especially for cacao: middlemen for small quantity end trader for large amount from collective farmers chocolate industries for cocoa butter. Or catfish: traditional market for live catfish dressed catfish fo r super markets fish fillets for export. (The BPN put a brand -new high -speed core2duo -Intel PC in each village and with an existing internet link in a cell-phone's modem, e-commerce (marketing) is a possibility. Two potential commodities, cacao and catf ish exist, to go e -commerce. A young SPMA graduate lives in the village, who owned only a quarter ha of land, but as a SPMA -graduate, he can make use of the comp uter, including e -marketing (4) To make cattle feed themselves utilizing crop waste . This wor ks nicely in Sidorejo and Sidodadi. But in Wates, the villagers still want to know what to do with their cacao waste. Here we possibly stress too much self- sufficiency and self -sustainability , and forgot that that wastes w as a potential commodity . Recent studies in the Unila proofed that coffee and cacao , as well as cassava wastes are good sources for feed -concentrate using only a simple fermentation with certain fungi. We may also start with making silage. (5) Increase max credit of IRD50millions to IR D100millions per farmer for cattle -raising. This will double the profit since costs for in -family laborers and animal pens will remain the same. ( The banks have not agree d on our proposal because the farmers have to fill -in and submit tax report s - that may be too much of a burden for simple farmers. We negotiated this with the bank, but the regulation is issued by the BI, Jakarta and needs to be implemented with out exception). The BPN was successful in finding private businesses willing to act as bapak -angkat (step-father) for the Gapoktan. The step -fathers would take care of the Gapoktan in financing, supervising, and marketing the produces. For example, the GGLC in cattle raising, the Japfa Comfeed in corn, Kacang Garuda in peanuts, and Mukhtar Sani in catfish (unfortunately this one w as unsuccessful). The BPN was also successful in including the BSM and BNI - syariah banks. 240 To further support the program, the Unila teams placed two students working on their KKN program ( Kuliah Kerja Nyata ; an academ ic course accomplished by working together with the villagers in the field for a 2 - month period) in each village. We also placed a doctorate student from the IPB (he was a Unila lecturer) in fish ery to supervise catfish raising in Pesawaran Indah village. (In 2009, the Unila places eight KKN students in Pesawaran Indah and Wates, but unfortunately none in Sidorejo or Sidodadi). The 2007 - 08 program worked well, as we reported the results in the LMPDD (Land Management and Policy Development Project) meeti ng, 22 - 23 May, 2008. In that meeting, I realized that it was only Lampung that already accomplished the first stage of access reform program. From the discussion we had in Wates and Sidorejo villages, I witnessed several changes: (1) The fish -pond pro gram of no continuity, (2) The cattle -raising activity has become independent. Caution should be noted on: (a) 0.9 kg daily gain per animal, can it be achieved ?; (b) if it can, how does a farmer weigh his cattle prior to selling? During the project, the GGLC provided a digital scale with big -red-bright digits on its screen; (c) the practice of buying concentrate -waste from Suntory may not be acceptable si nce the farmers can not measure growth of pathogenic fungi in it, also diseases from previous pens can be easily introduced. (3) We expect that the selling price of corn kernels should be higher than the farm -gate price at harvest for two reasons: (a) the JC as the step -father should be willing to provide a 'better' price; (b) direct selling by the farmers - the JC must have had reduced costs for the middlemen. It is only fair that the JC shares its profit with the farmers. But of course , the JC deserves two thumbs up for not charging the farmers avalist fee. (4) The interest rate has increased from 6 % pe r annum to 0.9 % per month (= 10.8 % per annum). I think that's quite an increase (= 76 %). Is it because of the bank give s a 5-year period instead of the usual 6 month for cattle -raising? Are the farmers given a choice to pick the one suits them more? To me, extending the credit period raises risk more to the farmers than to the bank since we understand that it is difficult for the farmers to keep the pens clean and to feed the cattle with fresh -healthy concentrate. 3. Q : How about borrowing money fr om nonbank sectors? A: We do not have to and do not dare to do that. The nonbank loans mostly from middlemen on yarnen basis ( bayar panen ; paid for with harvest) and some from shark money -lenders. This yarnen creates more problems than it does benefit to us. Our agriculture is rain -fed, which is difficult to predict. Mr. Sunarsih, my colleaque Gapoktan head and I initiate a plan of collatering one certificate from each of us to get two IDR50million credits. 241 4. Q: Why do you want to take such risk div iding your credit money? What are criteria you apply for selecting the recipients? A: We do that since we realize that not all of my Gapoktan members owe certificates liable fo r bank credits since their parcels are too small. So I volunteered to put my certificate up for the credit. I selected the 9 members of the poor est members myself. The first credit will be paid for in full in the next three months, so I think the risk I take is worthwhile. Yes, those members pay the dues to me since I am who signs the credit contracts. But I do not charge extra profit from them. They know how much the interest should be paid for. C: This is another nice improvement. By using his certificate, Mr. Suratno and Mr. Sunarsih could possibly act as non -fee avalis . The risk on them is heavy, though, since the agriculture in Sidorejo is all rain -fed. I wonder if they keep the certificates of the other 18 members (8 of each Gapoktan) as collateral? Q: What are your criteria to decide whether a member is poor. A: (given by Mr. Riduan, the chief of Sidorejo village): the criteria for poor are: (1) one rice meal a day, (2) one new clothes a year, (3) go to a saman -healer instead of to a doctor when sick, (4) have hut (semi permanent) instead of permanent stone house, (5) ha ve no definable job, (6) land ownership of 0.25 ha or own no land at all. C: I might add that according to the State's Treasurer poor is defined as having collective income of IDR600,000 ($60) per month. It is called collective since it is rather common t hat there are 3 generations in one households. 5. Q: What else you think may the BPN do to help ? A: We need support for the poor to assist them in their farming, or maybe credits for them to raise cattle . We have an example here. One of our members cult ivates wood mushrooms on saw dust , two kinds of them: the white one and the tiram (clam -like) one. He is so poor that he cannot expand his enterpr ise, although the demand for these mushrooms is high, and with good profit. (These are different mushrooms than ones sold along the road. Those are wild mushrooms that grown on stumps of oil- palm trees ). C: We did visit the mushroom huts and met a farmer in clear need of financial assistance. An education center near Cianjur, West Java, exist known as VEDCA (Voc ational Education and Development Center for Agriculture) established in 1985 with a World Bank's grant. I visited VEDCA in 1992, and scientists were doing experiments of culturing wood mushrooms on wood -cuts instead of on sawmill -dust. Replacing sawmill - dust with wood -cuts will enable farmers use their own tree -wood. Many sawmill s, we suspect, get their tree illegally from the protected forest areas. 242 6. Q: Does any of you receive assistance from other Government agencies? Which one and in what occasio n? A : (from Mr. Sadi, the Gapoktan leader from Sidodadi village): Agraria n reform really helps us since the certificates can be used as collateral for bank credits. However, the problem remains. Let me give you example. My Gapoktan has 576 members of polivalen (polyagriculture). Out of 576, 150 have land less than one -fifth of a ha . which makes their certificates useless as collateral. We hope the BPN will make provisions to overcome this problem. We received help in form of BiSi -2 corn hybrid seeds f or 70 ha, gratis, from Dinas Pertanian (Government Agriculture Agency) at Kabupaten called BLBU ( Bantuan Langsung Benih Unggul ; Direct Subsidy of Superior Seeds). This year is the second year. 7. Q: How was the seeds distributed? A: The Gapoktan has 15 farmer groups, all groups applied for the seeds to Dinas Pertanian. The Dinas selected group (s) of total 70 ha to be given the seeds. In the following year, another group (s) was chosen - sort of a taking -turn fashion. No, w e are not happy to have to take turns. W e have to wait for a long time before we get our turn. We want the BPN fight for us. C: The BLBU may charge much for the seed subsidy. For 70 ha, the BLBU needs 70 ha X 20 kg of seeds per ha X IDR30,000 per kg seed s = IDR42millions, plus costs for administration, task -force personnel , transportation, food and lodging, etc., etc., I believe the BLBU , for that 70 ha needs no less than IDR250millions per year. 8. Q: Do you have any selling -contract? A: We have corn -selling contract with the Japfa Comfeed 9. Q: Somebody else would share his experiences with us? (Mr. Suwanto from Sidorejo volunteered and we visited his cattle and goats) A: I got an IDR50million credit for my certificate of 2 ha. I bought 4 stock - bulls as to comply with the bank understanding, but I also bought 25 stock - goats with rest of the money. I sold my cattle locally in Lampung, and my goats to traders from Palembang, South Sumatera. This way I got a better price and cut my transportati on cost for the goat s. 10. Q: How did you feed your animals, then, since you used the money for cattle feed to buy goat? A: I made feed from pineapple peels I bought from the GGPC, bought concentrate reject ed by Santory. But I need a chopper machine to chop the peels and grasses to make feed. 11. Q : Any other issues you deem important for us to known? 243 A (given by Mr. Riduan chief of Sidorejo): Our village is 560 ha wide. 185 ha have been certified with 900 deeds, yet still 375 ha are in waiting. What is the BPN plan on those 375 ha? We are grateful that the certification increase our land value from IDR60millions to IDR100millions per ha. I know because there were already 10 deeds already banked as collateral and 20 deeds have been marketed. C: In the beginning, the BPN (Mr. Sitanggang) and the Unila team planned to stamp the certificates with a \"not to be sold within 10 year period after issuance\". This was never done by the BPN. I strongly warned the reform -subject farmers in our first meeting here in 2007 , that I would rather have them deedless and occupy the land and be poor , than the BPN issuing deeds and then they sell the land and be landless -poor. That way they are not only lost their land, but more importantly , they lose their dignity. M aybe, I am overprotective ? Maybe those who sell the land will be better off by using the money to realize what they have hoped for in all those years? 244 Figure K 7 - Group meeting Lampung Province, August, 2009 Figure K 8 - Joint livestock venture, Lampung Province 245 Figure K 9 - Cottage I ndustry: Mushroom Cultivation on Sawdust, Lampung Province , 2009 (see also question 5, above) 246 "}
