Telecommunications for the Hearing Impaired: TTY 1-888-232-6348 Executive Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NCIPC are committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of \"Healthy People 2030\" and to measuring program performance as stipulated by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The proposed program of research addresses the Healthy People 2030 priority area of injury and violence prevention and is in alignment with NCIPC's performance goal to conduct a targeted program of research to prevent injuries and violence, and reduce their consequences. The intent of the NCIPC extramural violence prevention research program is to: Build the scientific base for the prevention of violence by helping to expand and advance our understanding of innovative strategies for the prevention of violence. Encourage professionals from a wide spectrum of disciplines including epidemiology, behavioral and social sciences, medicine, biostatistics, public health, economics, urban planners and others to conduct research that informs violence prevention efforts. Purpose The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is soliciting investigator-initiated research that will help expand and advance understanding of approaches to prevent community violence and eliminate racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. This initiative is intended to support effectiveness research to evaluate innovative programs, practices, or policies among groups experiencing a high burden of community violence. Innovative approaches are those that have not been Page 4 of 58 rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in reducing community violence. Funds are available to conduct studies focused on preventing all forms of community violence involving youth or young adults (ages 10-34 years), including assaults, homicides, violence between groups, and threats/use of weapons. The primary objectives we wish to achieve with this initiative are: Objective One: Effectiveness research to evaluate innovative approaches with the potential for immediate or near immediate benefits (i.e., within 6 months) for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Objective Two : Effectiveness research to evaluate place-based prevention approaches for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Objective Three: Effectiveness research to evaluate approaches that improve the social or structural conditions that contribute to community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Applicants are asked to clearly indicate in the application's Abstract which objective, or combination of objectives, the research proposal intends to address. Mechanism of Support The funding mechanism for this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will be a research grant (R-01). Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards CDC/NCIPC intends to commit up to $4,800,000 in FY 2022 to fund up to twelve (12) applications. Awards issued under this NOFO are contingent upon availability of funds and a sufficient number of meritorious applications. Because the nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to application, it is also anticipated that the size and duration of each award may also vary. The total amount awarded and the number of awards will depend upon the number, quality, duration and cost of the applications received. Budget and Project Period The maximum award amount will be $400,000 per award for the first 12-month budget period. This includes both direct and indirect costs. An applicant may request a project period of up to three years. The maximum total project funding amount is $1,200,000 (including both direct and indirect costs) over the expected project period length, with a maximum of $400,000 per award per year. The project period for this award is expected to run from 9/30/2022 to 9/29/2025. Application Research Strategy Length Page limits for the Research Strategy are clearly specified in Section IV. Application and Submission Information of this announcement. Eligible Institutions/Organizations Institutions/organizations listed in Section III. Eligibility Information 1. Eligible Applicants are eligible to apply. Page 5 of 58 Eligible Project Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) CDC does not make awards to individuals directly. Individuals with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research are invited to work with their institution/organization to develop an application for support. Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, as well as individuals with disabilities, are always encouraged to apply. Applications in which the contact Eligible PD/PI meets NIH Early Stage Investigator (ESI) status, as verified via the NIH Determination of Investigator Status process, and whose application has a meritorious peer review score, may be considered for prioritization during the second level of review (see Section V. Application Review Information 4. Review and Selection Process ). For the contact PD/PI Determination of Investigator Status : Prior to application submission, PD/PIs are encouraged to verify and/or enter the date of their terminal research degree or the end date of their post-graduate clinical training in their eRA Commons Profile to ensure the correct identification. NIH systems will automatically calculate the status of each investigator and display it within their eRA Commons personal profile. The ESI status of the PD/PIs on any R01 or R01 equivalent application will be flagged at time of submission. Investigators should make sure their status is correctly marked in their profile. If your status is incorrect, please contact the NIH eRA Service Desk . Number of PDs/PIs An application may name more than one PD/PI; their names must appear on the face page of the application. However: One (1) principal investigator must be designated as the contact PD/PI for all correspondence related to the application. All PD/PIs must include their eRA Commons Identification in the Credential Field of the Senior/Key Person Profile Component of the SF-424 (R&R) Application Package. Institutions/organizations proposing multiple PDs/PIs must visit the Multiple Program Director/Principal Investigator Policy and submission details in the Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded) Component of the SF-424 (R&R) Application Guide. Number of Applications Eligible applicant organizations may submit more than one application to this NOFO, provided that each application is scientifically distinct. However, applicant institutions can submit only one application with the same contact PD/PI. Only one application per contact PD/PI will be funded under this announcement. If two or more applications from the same contact PD/PI are received for this NOFO, the only application that will be submitted for review will be the last application received based on the document's time and date stamp in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov). The applicant must ensure that duplicate applications are withdrawn prior to the application review date. Additionally, applicant institutions submitting applications with essentially the same proposed research to two or more CDC/ATSDR NOFOs will not be funded under more than one NOFO.

Funding Opportunity Description Statutory Authority Section 301 (a) [42 U.S.C. 241(a)] of the Public Health Service Act, and Section 391 (a) [42 U.S.C. 280b(a)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. 1. Background and Purpose Community violence is a critical public health issue that has significant short- and long-term negative impacts on individuals of all ages, families, and communities. Community violence happens between unrelated individuals, who may or may not know each other, generally outside the home. Examples include youth violence, such as assaults or fights among groups, and shootings in public places such as schools or on the streets. Multiple data sources suggest that community violence is increasing. The U.S. homicide rate increased substantially (30%) between 2019 and 2020.1,2 Crime data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report also indicate that there was a 12% increase in aggravated assault offenses in 2020.3 These recent data raise significant concerns about increasing community violence and the critical need for public health strategies to prevent community violence. The impacts of violence are not only deaths, many more people suffer nonfatal injuries due to Page 7 of 58 violence. More than 1.5 million people were treated in emergency departments for assaults in 2019.4 People hospitalized with violence-related injuries often experience long-term consequences, including physical disabilities and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD).5-8 Experiencing violence is also associated with increased risk of substance use and developing chronic diseases (such as diabetes and heart disease).9-10 Living in a community experiencing violence may prevent people from engaging in healthy behaviors, such as walking, using parks and recreational spaces, and accessing healthy food outlets.11-12 Homicides and nonfatal physical assault-related injuries result in more than $20 billion annually in combined medical and lost productivity costs alone4 and can limit community and business growth and prosperity; strain education, justice, and medical systems; and slow community progress impacting access to life opportunities for members of the community, including educational attainment and employment. America's youth are especially vulnerable to violence and are disproportionately impacted by violence in their communities. Violence is a leading cause of death and nonfatal injuries among adolescents and young adults - over half of U.S. homicides in 2019 occurred among those ages 15 to 34.4 In 2019, 22% of youth attending high school in the U.S. reported being involved in a physical fight in the past 12 months, and 13% reported carrying a weapon in the past 30 days.13 Youth can be victims, perpetrators, and/or witnesses of violence. People exposed to violence during childhood or youth, as well as other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), are at increased risk of having short-term and chronic physical and mental health conditions, substance use disorders, behavioral difficulties, and social consequences.9,10 It is important for violence prevention approaches to start early in childhood and to continue across development into young adulthood. Violence is causing substantial harm in communities across the country; however, racial/ethnic minority groups and communities are disproportionately affected. There are substantial racial and ethnic inequities in rates of community violence, including homicides. Homicide is the leading cause of death among African American males 15 to 34 years of age and the second leading cause for Black females 15 to 24 years of age.4 Homicide is the third-leading cause of death for Hispanic/Latino and American Indian and Alaskan Native people, the fourth-leading cause for Asian and Pacific Islanders, and the fifth-leading cause of death among White, non- Hispanic people 15-34 years of age.4 Structural racism, including differential access to goods, services, and opportunities by race, that is reinforced through policies and institutional practices, is related to inequities in risk for community violence.14-15 Racial discrimination has a negative impact on mental and physical health,16-17 and can influence social determinants of health, or the conditions where people live, work, and play.18-19 Inequities in access to quality and affordable housing, education, healthcare services, and economic opportunity put some communities at greater risk of experiencing poor health and violence.19,20 Purpose: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is soliciting investigator-initiated research that will help expand and advance understanding of approaches to prevent community violence and eliminate racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. This initiative is intended to support effectiveness research to evaluate innovative programs, practices, or policies among groups experiencing a Page 8 of 58 high burden of community violence. Innovative approaches are those that have not been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in reducing community violence. Funds are available to conduct studies focused on preventing all forms of community violence involving youth or young adults (ages 10-34 years), including assaults, homicides, violence between groups, and threats/use of weapons. The primary objectives we wish to achieve with this initiative are: Objective One: Effectiveness research to evaluate innovative approaches with the potential for immediate or near immediate benefits (i.e., within 6 months) for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Objective Two : Effectiveness research to evaluate place-based prevention approaches for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Objective Three: Effectiveness research to evaluate approaches that improve the social or structural conditions that contribute to community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Applicants are asked to clearly indicate in the application's Abstract which objective, or combination of objectives, the research proposal intends to address. Minority Serving Institutions : This NOFO seeks diversity among applicant institutions, research investigators, and partnering organizations to ensure researcher experience and research outcomes are applicable and beneficial to all segments of our population and social ecology. Applicants from or collaborating with Minority Serving Educational Institutions (MSIs) representative of and serving the community participating in the evaluation are highly encouraged. For the purpose of this NOFO, MSIs include Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education . Meritorious applications from eligible MSIs or eligible institutions collaborating with MSIs, as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, may be considered during the second level of review to broaden distribution of awards (see Section V. Application Review Information 4. Review and Selection Process ). Considerations Regarding NOFO Scope: This NOFO will not support applications that propose to evaluate strategies that respond to violence after it occurs, such as treatment and rehabilitation (e.g., mental health treatment, physical rehabilitation) approaches or medical care (e.g., treatment of physical injuries) rather than focus on preventing violence from occurring. Research proposals proposing to evaluate response strategies focused solely on treating injuries or to help victims recover do not meet the scientific intent of this NOFO. Applications that propose to evaluate strategies aimed at responding to violence rather than preventing it will not be recommended for funding consideration during the NCIPC second level review (see Section V. Application Review Information ). The intent of this NOFO is to evaluate approaches to prevent community violence. If an applicant is proposing a therapeutic approach to prevent community violence, then it is critical to explain how the approach is innovative, how it Page 9 of 58 addresses the objective(s) of this NOFO, and how it substantially adds to what is already known about how the approach can prevent future violence . Prevention planning systems [e.g., Communities That Care (CTC)], and Promoting School- Community University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER Partnership Model)] use data to understand local needs and select specific prevention approaches to meet those needs. The intent of this NOFO is to evaluate innovative prevention approaches to help expand and advance understanding of approaches to prevent community violence so that communities will have additional programs, policies, and practices to consider in the future. Therefore, applications that propose to evaluate prevention planning systems rather than specific programs, policies, or practices do not meet the scientific intent of this NOFO. Also, because the intent of this NOFO is to evaluate innovative approaches to reduce community violence, this NOFO will not support applications that propose to evaluate the following approaches that have already been rigorously evaluated: universal school-based violence prevention curricula and parenting/family relationship programs for reducing youth violence. Applications proposing to evaluate universal school-based curricula, parenting or family relationship programs, or prevention planning systems [e.g., Communities That Care (CTC), Promoting School-Community University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER Partnership Model)] will not be recommended for funding consideration during the NCIPC second level review (see Section V.

Healthy People 2030 and other National Strategic Priorities This research addresses the \"Healthy People 2030\" focus areas of injury and violence prevention. Specifically, this NOFO supports the Healthy People 2030 Injury and Violence Prevention (IVP) area: IVP-09 Reduce homicides, IVP-10 Reduce nonfatal physical assault injuries, IVP-11 Reduce physical fighting among adolescents, IVP-12 Reduce weapon carrying by adolescents, IVP-13 Reduce firearm-related deaths, and IVP-14 Reduce nonfatal firearm-related injuries. This NOFO also supports Healthy People 2030 Adolescent Health (AH) area: AH-10 Reduce rate of minors and young adults committing violent crimes, and AH-R11 Reduce the rate of adolescent and young adult victimization from violent crimes. The projects funded under this NOFO will help address multiple cross-cutting and topic specific research priorities in the NCIPC Research Priorities. More information about the NCIPC research priorities is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html . The objectives in this NOFO also address the NCIPC priority of reducing youth violence and preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) which includes multiple forms of violence impacting children and youth. Public Health Impact Violence is a significant public health problem and a leading cause of death among young people. Additionally, each year millions of people require treatment in emergency departments for violence-related injuries. Exposure to violence can increase risk for future violence as well as other negative long-term health and life opportunity consequences, including depression and anxiety, substance use, chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, educational attainment, and stable employment. Community violence is an increasing problem that disproportionately affects young people, particularly racial and ethnic minority individuals, families, and communities. NCIPC is committed to preventing violence and addressing inequities in risk for violence. The results from the research funded under this announcement will have direct benefits to communities seeking to implement evidence-based approaches to reduce community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Relevant Work For nearly 30 years, NCIPC has been the nation's leading public health authority on violence and injury prevention. CDC's approach involves three elements: a focus on prevention, a science- Page 12 of 58 driven approach to identify risks and patterns, and multidisciplinary collaboration to address the problem and keep people safe and healthy. Descriptions of CDC's violence prevention initiatives are available on NCIPC's website: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/index.html Information about CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System is available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/index.html Information about CDC's Strategic Vision for violence prevention is available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/publichealthissue/strategicvision.html CDC's definition of youth violence is available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/definitions.html Information about Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), including resources, data, and prevention information is available at: https:/ /www.cdc.gov/injury/priority/aces.html . CDC has released a suite of technical packages to help communities make use of the best available evidence for violence prevention. These technical packages describe general prevention strategies and provide examples of specific approaches along with information about the evidence for these approaches. The technical packages are available at https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/communicationresources/pub/technical-packages.html CDC has also released an ACEs prevention resource that highlights six ACEs prevention strategies drawn from the CDC technical packages: https:/ /www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.htm l. 2. Approach For NOFO RFA-CE-22-005, applicants are expected to submit proposals that evaluate the effectiveness of approaches (e.g., programs, practices, or policies) to prevent community violence and reduce racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence, specifically among those aged 10-34 years. Applicants may propose research under one or more objectives. Applicants are expected to clearly indicate in the Abstract section of the application the objective or objectives that the research application is intended to address. Community violence happens between unrelated individuals, who may or may not know each other, generally outside the home. Examples include youth violence, such as assaults or fights among groups, and shootings in public places such as schools and on the streets. For the purposes of this NOFO, \"community\" is a population with shared characteristics or social ties within a geographically defined area (e.g., neighborhood, block, hospital or school catchment area, police jurisdiction, or city). Applicants should propose evaluations of approaches that are new or previously implemented in communities but have not been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in reducing community violence. Prevention programs, practices, or policies to be evaluated are expected to be theoretically justified (e.g., include a conceptual model or theory of change, with proposed mediators and moderators, for how the prevention approach will reduce community violence with a clear focus on inequities in risk for community violence experienced by racial and ethnic communities) and supported with epidemiological and behavioral research. Mediating factors help explain the mechanism or process through which an exposure to the intervention leads to reductions in community violence. Moderating factors qualify the impact of an exposure on community violence (Baron & Kenny, 1986). Recipients are expected to assess intervention Page 13 of 58 processes and mediators as appropriate. Examples of process data include intervention or policy implementation fidelity and intervention exposure data. Other examples of mediators appropriate to the proposed research include changes in risk and protective factors specific to the proposed intervention. Examples of violence outcome and impact data sources include vital statistics data, police records, child welfare reports, school records, injury-related hospital or emergency department data, or relevant self-reported behaviors. Applicants are encouraged to assess effects on multiple community violence outcomes, including severe outcomes such as fatal and nonfatal assaults with weapons. The inclusion of risk and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, educational attainment, employment opportunities, etc.) for the forms of violence studied is highly encouraged. The use of multiple data sources to improve validity and reliability of each outcome is also encouraged. While applicants are encouraged to include other violence-related outcomes as secondary outcomes, applications proposing research which is not focused on preventing community violence involving youth or young adults (ages 10-34 years), including assaults, homicides, violence between groups, or threats/use of weapons, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's Research Plan, will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. This NOFO is intended to support rigorous research designs. Rigorous designs are those that utilize experimental (i.e., randomized controlled trials) or quasi-experimental designs (e.g., designs involving matched comparison groups, designs using propensity-score matching, instrumental variable methods, regression point displacement, regression discontinuity, pragmatic clinical trial, or time series designs). Rigorous designs should include data analytic plans that are appropriate for that design and the prevention strategy, hypotheses, data collection measures, and that anticipate and evaluate the effects of threats to the internal and external validity of the specified research design. Applications proposing studies outside of the stated focus areas such as etiological research to examine the prevalence or correlates of behavior, research to strengthen surveillance, or proposals to conduct development and feasibility testing without also proposing an evaluation of a prevention program, policy, or practice, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's Research Plan, will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. As a public health agency, CDC focuses on public health responses to violence prevention. While a violence prevention strategy may collaborate with law enforcement agencies, applications proposing to evaluate approaches that are solely under the influence or control of the criminal justice system (i.e., policing, arrest, trial, sentencing, incarceration, mandated intervention and treatment approaches) will be considered nonresponsive, and these applications will not be forwarded to peer-review. However, rigorous evaluations of policies at the local- or jurisdiction-level such as restorative justice policies to prevent the school-to-prison pipeline or rigorous evaluations of policies that may lead to student disengagement (e.g., harsh disciplinary policies) will be considered. It should be noted that the focus of this announcement is not school-based programs or curricula. Page 14 of 58 Proposals should help expand and advance the understanding of strategies that prevent community violence affecting those ages 10-34 and advance the understanding of how to eliminate racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Applications must be scientifically responsive to NOFO RFA-CE-22-005 in order to be forwarded for peer review. Additional responsiveness criteria are listed in Section III. Eligibility Information 5. Responsiveness of this NOFO. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that the submitted research proposal meets all responsiveness criteria listed in Section III. Eligibility Information 5. Responsiveness . Protection of Human Subjects and Personally Identifiable Information The Research Strategy section of the application is expected to clearly describe the type, source, access to, and protections of the data and human subjects participating in the study. Access to non-publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy and documented with a signed Data Sharing Agreement or Letter of Support. Access to publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy. Protection of previously collected data includes, but is not limited to, protection of personally identifiable information from loss and/or misuse. The application is expected to identify each performance site that will be conducting human subjects research and include the FWA number for the applicant institution and each performance site. Research conducted with more than one institution will be expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations. See Section IV. Application and Submission Information, 10 Funding Restrictions, Human Subjects for details. Objectives/Outcomes Primary Outcomes to be achieved with funded research: The focus of this announcement is to support research that evaluates the effectiveness of innovative approaches (e.g., programs, practices, or policies) to prevent community violence and reduce racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence, specifically among those aged 10-34 years. Community violence happens between unrelated individuals, who may or may not know each other, generally outside the home. Innovative approaches are those that have not been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in reducing community violence. Funding is available to conduct such studies focused on preventing all forms of community violence experienced by those aged 10-34, including assaults, homicides, violence between groups, and threats/use of weapons. The intent is to build the evidence base for prevention approaches (e.g., programs, practices, or policies) that are effective in reducing community violence as well as approaches that reduce racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. The following research objectives are the focus of this announcement: Objective One: Effectiveness research to evaluate innovative approaches with the potential for immediate or near immediate benefits for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence . While the field has learned a great deal about violence prevention strategies that are effective there is an urgent need to build the menu of violence Page 15 of 58 prevention strategies that can have proximate benefits for participants and their communities. Some prevention strategies, such as street outreach programs, mentoring programs, hospital- community partnerships, and youth employment/apprenticeship and other after-school programs, when implemented well and reaching the intended participants, can quickly alter risk for violence. Applicants should explain why the proposed approach is innovative and describe the process and theoretical or empirical support for the potential for immediate or near immediate (i.e., within 6 months) benefits for reducing risk for community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Objective Two: Effectiveness research to evaluate place-based prevention approaches for reducing community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Place- based prevention approaches can be designed to create or enhance protective environments and to reduce the risks associated with physical spaces and how they are used. Changes, such as vacant building remediation, the creation of green spaces, and reductions in alcohol outlet density, can reduce opportunities for violence and enhance positive social interactions and opportunities to support young people. While there is some evidence for these and other place- based community violence prevention approaches, such as Business Improvement Districts and activities grounded in the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), additional research is necessary to increase the types of innovative programs, practices, or policies that have been rigorously evaluated and shown to work so that other communities can make decisions about the most appropriate approaches to meet their needs. Objective Three: Effectiveness research to evaluate approaches that improve the social or structural conditions that contribute to community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age (e.g., concentrated poverty, structural racism, high rates of unemployment, limited access to high-quality education) and they can contribute to health inequities and modifiable differences in health status seen across population groups. Potential research in response to this NOFO includes studies to assess the effectiveness of strategies that address social or structural determinants of health that are empirically or theoretically associated with community violence and racial/ethnic inequities. The focus could include, but is not limited to, the following: economic strategies (e.g., microfinance programs, cash transfer payments, access to banking institutions, livable wages or other employment and wage policies); housing development policies (e.g., Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Inclusionary Zoning), and other efforts to improve the physical, social, and economic characteristics of neighborhoods, schools and other settings (e.g., employment opportunities, transportation policies, school disciplinary policies, school funding policies); studies to assess the effectiveness of social and cultural norm change strategies addressing cultural values and beliefs (e.g., innovative social media and other communication strategies to enhance protective norms, behaviors, and social conditions); and studies to assess the effectiveness of strategies focused on reducing the level and concentration of community risk factors (e.g., limited access to affordable and Page 16 of 58 quality child care; limited access to housing, employment, etc., following incarceration). The prevention strategies listed above are examples and are not an exhaustive list. Applicants should describe how the prevention approach proposed has the potential to reduce community violence and racial/ethnic inequities in risk for community violence across the population subgroups that are the focus of the study. Applicants should propose evaluations of approaches that are new or previously implemented in communities but have not been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in reducing community violence. Applicants are strongly encouraged to engage the community in all aspects of the research process. This can include strong partnerships with community members with lived experience who participate throughout the project (e.g., developing study methods, collecting data, interpreting results, and disseminating findings). For Objective 3, a distinction is made between community-based prevention strategies and strategies to address health inequities and modifiable differences in health status seen across population groups. Community-based prevention strategies are implemented in a community setting but address change in individual-, peer- or family-level factors (e.g., attitudes, knowledge, etc.). In contrast, strategies of interest under Objective 3 focus on improving the social or structural community conditions (e.g., characteristics of communities that are empirically or theoretically associated with community violence such as concentrated poverty, structural racism, high rates of unemployment and community violence, limited access to high-quality education and/or affordable, high-quality childcare) that contribute to health inequities across population groups. Applications submitted under Objective 3 are expected to address the social or structural conditions that contribute to health inequities in rates of violence across population groups. Applications submitted under Objective 3 proposing to evaluate community-based strategies that are implemented in community settings but address change in individual-, peer- or family-level factors (e.g., attitudes, knowledge, parent-child relationships, parental monitoring, family environment, associations with peers at risk of violence, etc.) rather than social or structural community conditions do not meet the scientific intent of this NOFO. These applications will not be recommended for funding consideration during the NCIPC second level review (see Section V. Application Review Information ). Applicants are encouraged to consider using approaches that are trauma-informed (i.e., healing centered). While the primary focus and outcome of interest should be reductions in rates of community violence, applicants are also encouraged to test for reductions in other types of violence (e.g., intimate partner violence and sexual violence) and other adverse experiences, particularly among youth, that contribute to toxic stress and trauma, including abuse and neglect, witnessing violence in the home or community, bullying victimization, and exposure to family stressors such as substance use, mental health conditions, suicidal behavior, or incarceration, and family separation that contribute to toxic stress and trauma. Applicants are encouraged to measure any unintended consequences of the prevention approach and differential effects of the approach on subpopulations, if applicable. Applicants are also encouraged to include cost measures to inform economic evaluations. The three objectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, some approaches (e.g., inclusionary zoning laws, access to affordable housing) might address social and structural Page 17 of 58 conditions and enhance safety of physical spaces. Applicants are asked to clearly indicate in the application's Abstract which Objective or Objectives the research proposal intends to address. Data collection, acquisition, and analysis. Applicants must identify and describe appropriate data sources and provide evidence of their ability to acquire and/or collect data of sufficient quantity and quality to conduct the proposed research within the project period. Applications should clearly describe and justify the proposed sampling methods, sample size, power estimates, and data collection methods for the primary outcome(s), at a minimum, and other proposed secondary measures and subgroup analyses. The timeline for data acquisition (requests for extant data and or primary data collection) must be specified. Numerous data sources can be used for the outcome data, including emergency department data, law enforcement data, self- report data, and other sources of data. In addition, administrative data from relevant agencies and survey data collected prior to or in the context of the evaluation are potential sources. Appropriate data sources will vary by the proposed research approach and outcome measures. The inclusion of risk and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, educational attainment, employment opportunities, etc.) for the forms of violence studied is highly encouraged. Target Population Applicants should focus on populations at highest risk for experiencing community violence. Community violence affects people across the lifespan and in all communities. However, some subgroups are at substantially greater risk. For example, homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults and young people are disproportionately impacted by nonfatal community violence. Risk for community violence, and opportunities for prevention, start in childhood. People's health outcomes are influenced by the conditions in which they live, work, play, and learn. These conditions are called social determinants of health. Systemic racism, bias, and discrimination; economic instability; concentrated poverty; and limited housing, education, and healthcare access drive health inequities, such as violence. Racial/ethnic minority groups and communities often disproportionately experience these negative conditions, placing residents at greater risk for poor health outcomes. For example, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaskan Native, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates than other racial and ethnic demographic groups. This initiative is intended to support effectiveness research to expand and advance understanding of approaches to prevent community violence and reduce racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence. Funds are available to conduct studies focused on preventing all forms of community violence involving youth or young adults (ages 10-34 years), including assaults, homicides, violence between groups, and threats/use of weapons. When feasible, applicants are encouraged to address other populations at high risk for experiencing community violence, including, but not limited to, people with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, individuals returning home after incarceration, commercial sex workers, and individuals experiencing homelessness who live in areas with high rates of social disadvantage. Collaboration/Partnerships It is expected that for all applications, the applicant organization and contact PI will provide the scientific and technical leadership necessary to conduct the proposed research throughout the entire project period. It is expected that the proposed research work plan described in the Research Strategy section of the application and the SF-424 Research and Related Budget will Page 18 of 58 demonstrate the applicant organization's leadership and involvement throughout the entirety of the project period. The applicant organization cannot serve as a \"pass through\" to fund another entity to conduct the majority of the research or provide the scientific or technical leadership necessary to complete the proposed research project. As stated in the Background of this NOFO, NCIPC recognizes the importance of community conditions and community involvement in research to complete the proposed work. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek and include the meaningful involvement of communities, including state and/or local health departments, local governmental agencies and/or businesses, and community-based organizations in all phases of the development and conduct of the proposed research, and in the translation and dissemination of research results. This can include strong partnerships with community members with lived experience who participate in all phases of the research (e.g., developing study methods, collecting data, interpreting results, and disseminating findings). Partnerships between the applicant institution and outside entities may be necessary or advantageous to complete the proposed work. The application must clearly describe roles and responsibilities of each partnering entity. This includes demonstration of the applicant's access to planned data sources and study populations, and all partnerships necessary to complete the proposed project. The Research Strategy section of the application is expected to clearly describe the roles and responsibilities of each research team member individually and each participating entity. This includes describing how the partnership will allow the applicant to complete the proposed work. The Research Strategy section of the application must clearly describe the nature and extent of the proposed partnership, including the roles and responsibilities of the Principal Investigator(s) and of the outside entities or partner agencies, the existing working relationship, plans for the proposed research, the nature and extent of the involvement to be provided by the applicant institution and outside entity, the outside entity's scope of work, and how the partnership will ensure implementation and sustainability of the proposed evaluation. The Research Strategy section must clearly describe all data sources and the partnerships that are in place to assure data access for all proposed analyses to be completed within the project period. The roles and responsibilities described for each partnering entity must be substantiated with a signed Data Sharing Agreement, Letter or Support (LOS), or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and be included in the Letter of Support section of the application. The Data Sharing Agreement, Letter of Support (LOS), or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) must describe the partner's commitment of resources, time, and personnel to the proposed research. Applications that do not include a signed Data Sharing Agreement, Letter of Support, or Memorandum of Understanding from each partnering entity may not be recommended for funding (see Section V. Application Review Information, 4 Review and Selection Process ). Applications will be evaluated during peer review on: Page 19 of 58 The extent to which the Research Strategy section clearly describes the roles and responsibilities of each partner involved in data collection and/or the effectiveness evaluation. The extent to which the Research Strategy clearly describes the working relationships between the applicant institution and all partner organizations. The extent to which the Research Strategy clearly describes the involvement and scope of work each partner is willing to complete to ensure the success of the proposed research within the proposed project period. The extent to which the relationships and activities of the partnerships described in the Research Strategy, are documented by a signed Data Sharing Agreement, Letter of Support, or Memorandum of Understanding that clearly delineates the intent and capabilities of each partnership. It is incumbent on the applicant to clearly describe each contribution of each partnership to the proposed research in the Research Strategy and document the intent and capabilities of each partnership with a signed Data Sharing Agreement, Letter of Support, or Memorandum of Understanding. Minority Serving Institutions : This NOFO seeks diversity among applicant institutions, research investigators, and partnering organizations to ensure researcher experience and research outcomes are applicable and beneficial to all segments of our population and social ecology. Applicants from or collaborating with Minority Serving Educational Institutions (MSIs) representative of and serving the community participating in the evaluation are highly encouraged. For the purpose of this NOFO, MSIs include Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education . Meritorious applications from eligible MSIs or eligible institutions collaborating with MSIs, as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, may be considered during the second level of review to broaden distribution of awards (see Section V. Application Review Information 4. Review and Selection Process ). This NOFO encourages the inclusion of early-stage investigators as members of the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel research team to help build experience and expertise in violence prevention research. Applications should demonstrate that the research staff have the necessary skills and experience to ensure quality and timeliness of proposed activities. The participation of students and other researchers-in-training is encouraged. Applicants planning to incorporate training and/or mentorship roles into their research activities should describe the plans for the recruitment, training, and supervision of trainees/mentees and the ongoing quality assurance of their scientific products. Evaluation/Performance Measurement Applicants are expected to provide an evaluation and performance measurement plan with measures of effectiveness. The plan must be able to demonstrate the feasibility of accomplishing the proposed project objectives. Measures of effectiveness must relate to the goals stated in the Page 20 of 58 \"Purpose\" section of this announcement and be able to measure the intended outputs and outcomes described. Outcomes to be evaluated should be clearly specified. If applicable, performance measures should include the number of participants recruited into the study, the participation rate, and types of samples collected. Translation Plan When relevant to the goals of the research project, the PI should describe how the significant findings may be used to promote, enhance, or advance translation of the research into practice or may be used to inform public health policy. This description should be understandable to a variety of audiences, including policy makers, practitioners, public health programs, healthcare institutions, professional organizations, community groups, researchers, and other potential users. The PI should identify the research findings that could be translated into public health policy or practice and how the findings may be adopted in public health settings. Or, if they cannot be applied yet, this description should address which research findings may be translated, how these findings can guide future research or related activities, and recommendations for translation. If relevant, describe how the results of this project could be generalized to or adapted by populations and communities outside of the study. Applicants should describe plans for engaging community partners in the interpretation and dissemination of the results and are encouraged to develop translation products for the community partners to use for future funding programmatic decisions and funding opportunities. Applicants should also include plans to appropriately document the policy or program implementation methods as well as lessons learned to facilitate future replication in another research or non-research setting if the prevention strategy is found to be effective. These plans may include but are not limited to identifying the core components of the policy or program and documenting lessons learned from the study that might inform decisions about future adaptation or modification of the strategy for other settings or populations. Grant recipients will be required to attend one reverse site visit per year in Atlanta with CDC/NCIPC staff during the period of performance to review their progress and findings and to discuss opportunities for widespread dissemination of their research achievements and lessons learned. Travel costs for attending this meeting must be included in the application's travel budget submitted in response to this NOFO. 3. Funding Strategy Section II.

PLEASE NOTE: For applications due on or after April 4, 2022, applicants must have a unique entity identifier (UEI) at the time of application submission. In preparation for the federal government's April 4, 2022, transition from the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) to the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), applicants must obtain a UEI. The UEI is generated as part of SAM.gov registration. Current SAM.gov registrants have already been assigned their UEI and can view it in SAM.gov and grants.gov. Additional information is available on the GSA website , SAM.gov , and Grants.gov-Finding the UEI. Additionally, all applicant organizations must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) . Organizations must maintain the registration with current information at all times during which it has an application under consideration for funding by CDC and, if an award is made, until a final financial report is submitted or the final payment is received, whichever is later. SAM is the primary registrant database for the Federal government and is the repository into which an entity must provide information required for the conduct of business as a recipient. Additional information about registration procedures may be found at the SAM internet site at SAM.gov and the SAM.gov Knowledge Base . If an award is granted, the recipient organization must notify potential sub-recipients that no organization may receive a subaward under the grant unless the organization has provided its DUNS number to the recipient organization. 8. Eligible Individuals (Project Director/Principal Investigator) in Organizations/Institutions Any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the Project Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) is invited to work with his/her Page 26 of 58 organization to develop an application for support. Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for HHS/CDC support. 9. Cost Sharing This NOFO does not require cost sharing as defined in the HHS Grants Policy Statement (http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ). 10. Number of Applications As defined in the HHS Grants Policy Statement,( https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies- regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ), applications received in response to the same Notice of Funding Opportunity generally are scored individually and then ranked with other applications under peer review in their order of relative programmatic, technical, or scientific merit. HHS/CDC will not accept any application in response to this NOFO that is essentially the same as one currently pending initial peer review unless the applicant withdraws the pending application. Eligible applicant organizations may submit more than one application to this NOFO, provided that each application is scientifically distinct. However, applicant institutions can submit only one application with the same contact PD/PI. Only one application per contact PD/PI will be funded under this announcement. If two or more applications from the same contact PD/PI are received for this NOFO, the only application that will be submitted for review will be the last application received based on the document's time and date stamp in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov). The applicant must ensure that duplicate applications are withdrawn prior to the application review date. Additionally, applicant institutions submitting applications with essentially the same proposed research to two or more CDC/ATSDR NOFOs will not be funded under more than one NOFO. Section IV. Application and Submission Information 1. Address to Request Application Package Applicants will use a system or platform to submit their applications through Grants.gov and eRA Commons to CDC. ASSIST, an institutional system to system (S2S) solution, or Grants.gov Workspace are options.

Applicants are strongly encouraged to allocate additional time and submit in advance of the deadline to ensure they have time to make any corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. This includes the time necessary to complete the application resubmission process that may be necessary, if errors are identified during validation by Grants.gov and the NIH eRA systems. The application package is not complete until it has passed the Grants.gov and NIH eRA Commons submission and validation processes. Applicants will use a platform or system to submit applications. ASSIST is a commonly used platform because it provides a validation of all requirements prior to submission. If ASSIST detects errors, then the applicant must correct errors before their Page 31 of 58 application can be submitted. Applicants should view their applications in ASSIST after submission to ensure accurate and successful submission through Grants.gov. If the submission is not successful and post-submission errors are found, then those errors must be corrected and the application must be resubmitted in ASSIST. Applicants are able to access, view, and track the status of their applications in the eRA Commons. Information on the submission process is provided in the SF-424 (R&R) Application Guidance and ASSIST User Guide at https://era.nih.gov/files/ASSIST_user_guide.pdf . Note : HHS/CDC grant submission procedures do not provide a grace period beyond the grant application due date time to correct any error or warning notices of noncompliance with application instructions that are identified by Grants.gov or eRA systems (i.e., error correction window). Applicants who encounter problems when submitting their applications must attempt to resolve them by contacting the NIH eRA Service desk at: Toll-free: 1-866-504-9552; Phone: 301-402-7469 http://grants.nih.gov/support/index.html Hours: Mon-Fri, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time (closed on Federal holidays) Problems with Grants.gov can be resolved by contacting the Grants.gov Contact Center at: Toll-free: 1-800-518-4726 https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/support.html support@grants.gov Hours: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; closed on Federal holidays It is important that applicants complete the application submission process well in advance of the due date time. After submission of your application package, applicants will receive a \"submission receipt\" email generated by Grants.gov. Grants.gov will then generate a second e-mail message to applicants which will either validate or reject their submitted application package. A third and final e-mail message is generated once the applicant's application package has passed validation and the grantor agency has confirmed receipt of the application. Unsuccessful Submissions : If an application submission was unsuccessful, the applicant must: 1. Track submission and verify the submission status (tracking should be done initially regardless of rejection or success). a. If the status states \"rejected,\" be sure to save time stamped, documented rejection notices, and do #2a or #2b Page 32 of 58 2. Check emails from both Grants.gov and NIH eRA Commons for rejection notices. a. If the deadline has passed, he/she should email the Grants Management contact listed in the Agency Contacts section of this announcement explaining why the submission failed. b. If there is time before the deadline, correct the problem(s) and resubmit as soon as possible. Due Date for Applications 03/04/2022 03/04/2022 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date. 10. Funding Restrictions Expanded Authority: For more information on expanded authority and pre-award costs, go to https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf and speak to your GMS. All HHS/CDC awards are subject to the federal regulations, in 45 CFR Part 75, terms and conditions, and other requirements described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. Pre-award costs may be allowable as an expanded authority, but only if authorized by CDC. Public Health Data: CDC requires that mechanisms for, and cost of, public health data sharing be included in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. The cost of sharing or archiving public health data may also be included as part of the total budget requested for first-time or continuation awards. Data Management Plan: Fulfilling the data-sharing requirement must be documented in a Data Management Plan (DMP) that is developed during the project planning phase prior to the initiation of generating or collecting public health data and must be included in the Resource Sharing Plan(s) section of the PHS398 Research Plan Component of the application. Applicants who contend that the public health data they collect or create are not appropriate for release must justify that contention in the DMP submitted with their application for CDC funds (for example, privacy and confidentiality considerations, embargo issues). Recipients who fail to release public health data in a timely fashion will be subject to procedures normally used to address lack of compliance (for example, reduction in funding, restriction of funds, or award termination) consistent with 45 CFR 74.62 or other authorities as appropriate. For further information, please see: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar- 25.html Human Subjects: Funds relating to the conduct of research involving human subjects will be restricted until the appropriate assurances and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals are in place. Copies of Page 33 of 58 all current local IRB approval letters and local IRB approved protocols (and CDC IRB approval letters, if applicable) will be required to lift restrictions. If the proposed research project involves more than one institution and will be conducted in the United States, awardees are expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations for the Protections of Human Subjects Research, and include a single IRB plan in the application, unless review by a sIRB would be prohibited by a federal, tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy or a compelling justification based on ethical or human subjects protection issues or other well-justified reasons is provided. Exceptions will be reviewed and approved by CDC in accordance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Regulations ( 45 CFR Part 46), or a restriction may be placed on the award. For more information, please contact the scientific/research contact included on this NOFO. Note: The sIRB requirement applies to participating sites in the United States. Foreign sites participating in CDC-funded, cooperative research studies are not expected to follow the requirement for sIRB. Protection of Human Subjects and Personally Identifiable Information The Research Strategy section of the application is expected to clearly describe the type, source, access to, and protections of the data and human subjects participating in the study. Access to non-publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy and documented with a signed Data Sharing Agreement or Letter of Support. Access to publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy. Protection of previously collected data includes, but is not limited to, protection of personally identifiable information from loss and/or misuse. The application is expected to identify each performance site that will be conducting human subjects research and include the FWA number for the applicant institution and each performance site. Research conducted with more than one institution will be expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations. See Section IV. Application and Submission Information, 10 Funding Restrictions, Human Subjects for details. Data Management Plan Applicants should develop and include, as part of the application's Resource Sharing Plan section of the PHS 398 Research Plan Component, a data management plan that meets the requirements of AR-25 using their own template. Applicants funded under this NOFO will be required to use NCIPC's Data Management Plan Template, OMB NO: 0920-1301 (Exp. Date: 06/30/2023) to make revisions to the DMP as required during the award's project period. 11. Other Submission Requirements and Information Risk Assessment Questionnaire Requirement CDC is required to conduct pre-award risk assessments to determine the risk an applicant poses to meeting federal programmatic and administrative requirements by taking into account issues such as financial instability, insufficient management systems, non-compliance with award Page 34 of 58 conditions, the charging of unallowable costs, and inexperience. The risk assessment will include an evaluation of the applicant's CDC Risk Questionnaire, located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , as well as a review of the applicant's history in all available systems; including OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility and financial integrity systems (see 45 CFR 75.205(a)), and other sources of historical information. These systems include, but are not limited to: FAPIIS (https://www.fapiis.gov/), including past performance on federal contracts as per Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009; Do Not Pay list; and System for Award Management (SAM) exclusions. CDC requires all applicants to complete the Risk Questionnaire, OMB Control Number 0920- 1132 annually. This questionnaire, which is located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , along with supporting documentation must be submitted with your application by the closing date of the Notice of Funding Opportunity Announcement. If your organization has completed CDC's Risk Questionnaire within the past 12 months of the closing date of this NOFO, then you must submit a copy of that questionnaire, or submit a letter signed by the authorized organization representative to include the original submission date, organization's EIN and DUNS. When uploading supporting documentation for the Risk Questionnaire into this application package, clearly label the documents for easy identification of the type of documentation. For example, a copy of Procurement policy submitted in response to the questionnaire may be labeled using the following format: Risk Questionnaire Supporting Documents _ Procurement Policy. Duplication of Efforts Applicants are responsible for reporting if this application will result in programmatic, budgetary, or commitment overlap with another application or award (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract) submitted to another funding source in the same fiscal year. Programmatic overlap occurs when (1) substantially the same project is proposed in more than one application or is submitted to two or more funding sources for review and funding consideration or (2) a specific objective and the project design for accomplishing the objective are the same or closely related in two or more applications or awards, regardless of the funding source. Budgetary overlap occurs when duplicate or equivalent budgetary items (e.g., equipment, salaries) are requested in an application but already are provided by another source. Commitment overlap occurs when an individual's time commitment exceeds 100 percent, whether or not salary support is requested in the application. Overlap, whether programmatic, budgetary, or commitment of an individual's effort greater than 100 percent, is not permitted. Any overlap will be resolved by the CDC with the applicant and the PD/PI prior to award. Report Submission: The applicant must upload the report under \"Other Attachment Forms.\" The document should be labeled: \"Report on Programmatic, Budgetary, and Commitment Overlap.\" Application Submission Page 35 of 58 Applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the SF 424 (R&R) Application Guide. PAPER APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date.

Criteria Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the CDC mission (http:// www.cdc.gov/ about/ organization/ mission.htm ), all applications submitted to the CDC in support of public health research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the CDC peer review system. Overall Impact Reviewers will provide an overall impact/priority score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? To what extent will successful completion of the proposed activities significantly advance understanding about what works to prevent community violence impacting young people (ages 10-34)?

To what extent are the proposed activities innovative and important for informing future community violence prevention activities yet offer a reasonable potential of meeting the Purpose and Research Objectives of this NOFO? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and Page 38 of 58 benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility, and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves clinical research, are there plans for 1) protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? To what extent does the applicant address a specific research objective as stated in Section I of the NOFO? To what extent is the research plan appropriate for the specific research objective proposed for evaluation?

Additional Review Criteria As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact/priority score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects If the research involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the HHS/CDC Requirements under AR-1 Human Subjects Requirements (https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-1.html ). If your proposed research involves the use of human data and/or biological specimens, you must provide a justification for your claim that no human subjects are involved in the Protection of Human Subjects section of the Research Plan. Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for inclusion of minorities and members of both genders, as well as the inclusion of children. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the policy on the Inclusion of Women and Racial and Ethnic Minorities in Research (https://www.cdc.gov/maso/Policy/Policy_women.pdf and the policy on the Inclusion of Persons Under 21 in Research (https://www.cdc.gov/maso/Policy/policy496.pdf ). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific Page 40 of 58 assessment according to the following four points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 4) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/VASchecklist.pdf ). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Dual Use Research of Concern Reviewers will identify whether the project involves one of the agents or toxins described in the US Government Policy for the Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern, and, if so, whether the applicant has identified an IRE to assess the project for DURC potential and develop mitigation strategies if needed. For more information about this Policy and other policies regarding dual use research of concern, visit the U.S. Government Science, Safety, Security (S3) website at: http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse .

Additional Review Considerations As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact/priority score. Applications from Foreign Organizations N/A Resource Sharing Plan(s) HHS/CDC policy requires that recipients of grant awards make research resources and data readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication. Please see: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html New additional requirement : CDC requires recipients for projects and programs that involve data collection or generation of data with federal funds to develop and submit a Data Management Plan (DMP) for each collection of public health data. Investigators responding to this Notice of Funding Opportunity should include a detailed DMP in the Resource Sharing Plan(s) section of the PHS 398 Research Plan Component of the application. The AR-25 outlines the components of a DMP and provides additional information for investigators regarding the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation. Page 41 of 58 The DMP should be developed during the project planning phase prior to the initiation of collecting or generating public health data and will be submitted with the application. The submitted DMP will be evaluated for completeness and quality at the time of submission. The DMP should include, at a minimum, a description of the following: A description of the data to be collected or generated in the proposed project; Standards to be used for the collected or generated data; Mechanisms for, or limitations to, providing access to and sharing of the data (include a description of provisions for the protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights - this section should address access to identifiable and de-identified data); Statement of the use of data standards that ensure all released data have appropriate documentation that describes the method of collection, what the data represent, and potential limitations for use; and Plans for archiving and long-term preservation of the data, or explaining why long-term preservation and access are not justified (this section should address archiving and preservation of identifiable and de-identified data). Applications submitted without the required DMP may be deemed ineligible for award unless submission of DMP is deferred to a later period depending on the type of award, in which case, funding restrictions may be imposed pending submission and evaluation. CDC OMB approved templates may be used (e.g. NCCDPHP template https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/pdf/nofo/DMP-Template-508.docx Other examples of DMPs may be found here USGS, http://www.usgs.gov//products/data-and- tools/data-management/data-management-plans Budget and Period of Support Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. The applicant can obtain guidance for completing a detailed justified budget on the CDC website, at the following Internet address: http://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/application-resources.html The budget can include both direct costs and indirect costs as allowed. Indirect costs could include the cost of collecting, managing, sharing and preserving data. Indirect costs on grants awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities and performed fully outside of the territorial limits of the U.S. may be paid to support the costs of compliance with federal requirements at a fixed rate of eight percent of modified total direct costs exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000. Negotiated indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, and the World Health Organization. Indirect costs on training grants are limited to a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of Page 42 of 58 tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and sub-awards in excess of $25,000. If requesting indirect costs in the budget based on a federally negotiated rate, a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement is required. Include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or cost allocation plan approval letter. 4. Review and Selection Process Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group, in accordance with CDC peer review policy and procedures, using the stated review criteria. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: Will undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific and technical merit (generally the top half of applications under review), will be discussed and assigned an overall impact/priority score. Will receive a written critique. Applications will be assigned to the appropriate HHS/CDC Center, Institute, or Office. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this NOFO. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review. The following will be considered in making funding recommendations: Scientific and technical merit of the proposed project as determined by scientific peer review. Availability of funds. Relevance of the proposed project to program priorities. Applications that meet scientific and technical merit as determined by scientific peer review may also undergo consideration at the second level of review for: Consideration for meritorious applications that contribute to a diverse mix of approaches in proposed research to address community violence as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan. Consideration for meritorious applications that contribute to a geographic balance of proposed projects, as evidenced by the congressional district of the applicant organization, to broaden the distribution of awards. Consideration for applicant organizations from or conducting research in collaboration or partnership with Minority Serving Educational Institutions (MSIs) i.e., Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education , and as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, to broaden distribution of awards. Consideration for research to better address racial and ethnic inequities in risk for community violence and strategies that address social and structural conditions that contribute to inequities in risk for violence, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan. Page 43 of 58 Consideration of research conducted in collaboration/ partnership with the community, as evidenced by the Letters of Support section of the application. This may include state and/or local health departments, local governmental agencies and/or businesses, and community-based organizations. Consideration for applications including signed Data Sharing Agreements, Letters of Support, or Memorandum of Understanding for each partnership described in the Research Strategy section of the application clearly describing the support to be provided to conduct the proposed research. Consideration for applications in which the contact Eligible PD/PI meets NIH Early Stage Investigator (ESI) status, as verified by the NIH Determination of Investigator Status process. Exclusion from funding consideration, regardless of the scientific or technical merit of the proposed project , of applications that propose to evaluate: o Strategies that respond to violence after it occurs, such as treatment and rehabilitation (e.g., mental health treatment, physical rehabilitation) approaches or medical care (e.g., treatment of physical injuries) rather than focus on preventing violence from occurring. o Applications submitted under Objective 3 proposing to evaluate community- based strategies that are implemented in community settings but that address change in individual-, peer- or family-level factors (e.g., attitudes, knowledge, parent-child relationships, parental monitoring, family environment, associations with peers at risk of violence, etc.) rather than social or structural community conditions. o Applications proposing to evaluate universal school-based curricula, parenting and family relationship programs, or prevention planning systems [e.g., Communities That Care (CTC), Promoting School-Community University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER Partnership Model)]. Review of risk posed by applicants. Prior to making a Federal award, CDC is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, CDC is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Recipient Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. CDC may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.207. Page 44 of 58 CDC's framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If it is determined that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. The evaluation criteria is described in this Notice of Funding Opportunity. In evaluating risks posed by applicants, CDC will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following: (1) Financial stability; (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part; (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; (4) Reports and findings from audits performed under 45 CFR Part 75, subpart F, or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and (5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities. CDC must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities. 5. Anticipated Announcement and Award Dates After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) and other pertinent information via the eRA Commons. Section VI. Award Administration Information 1. Award Notices Any applications awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to the DUNS, SAM Registration, and Transparency Act requirements. If the application is under consideration for funding, HHS/CDC will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies- regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ). PLEASE NOTE: For applications due on or after April 4, 2022, applicants must have a unique entity identifier (UEI) at the time of application submission. In preparation for the federal government's April 4, 2022, transition from the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) to the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), applicants must obtain a UEI.

Page 49 of 58 Dual Use Research of Concern On September 24, 2014, the US Government Policy for the Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern was released. Grantees (foreign and domestic) receiving CDC funding on or after September 24, 2015 are subject to this policy. Research funded by CDC, involving the agents or toxins named in the policy, must be reviewed to determine if it involves one or more of the listed experimental effects and if so, whether it meets the definition of DURC. This review must be completed by an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) identified by the funded institution. Recipients also must establish an Institutional Contact for Dual Use Research (ICDUR). The award recipient must maintain records of institutional DURC reviews and completed risk mitigation plans for the term of the research grant, cooperative agreement or contract plus three years after its completion, but no less than eight years, unless a shorter period is required by law or regulation. If a project is determined to be DURC, a risk/benefit analysis must be completed. CDC will work collaboratively with the award recipient to develop a risk mitigation plan that the CDC must approve. The USG policy can be found at http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse . Non-compliance with this Policy may result in suspension, limitation, restriction or termination of USG-funding, or loss of future USG funding opportunities for the non- compliant USG-funded research project and of USG-funds for other life sciences research at the institution, consistent with existing regulations and policies governing USG-funded research, and may subject the institution to other potential penalties under applicable laws and regulations. Data Management Plan(s) CDC requires that all new collections of public health data include a Data Management Plan (DMP). For purposes of this announcement, \"public health data\" means digitally recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as a basis for public health findings, conclusions, and implementation. This new requirement ensures that CDC is in compliance with the following; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum titled \"Open Data Policy - Managing Information as an Asset\" (OMB M-13-13); Executive Order 13642 titled \"Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information\"; and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled \"Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research\" (OSTP Memo). The AR-25 https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html outlines the components of a DMP and provides additional information for investigators regarding the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation. Certificates of Confidentiality: Institutions and investigators are responsible for determining whether research they conduct is subject to Section 301(d) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. Section 301(d), as amended by Section 2012 of the 21st Century Cures Act, P.L. 114-255 (42 U.S.C. 241(d)), states that the Secretary shall issue Certificates of Page 50 of 58 Confidentiality (Certificates) to persons engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research activities in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected. In furtherance of this provision, CDC-supported research commenced or ongoing after December 13, 2016 in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected, as defined by Section 301(d), is deemed issued a Certificate and therefore required to protect the privacy of individuals who are subjects of such research. Certificates issued in this manner will not be issued as a separate document, but are issued by application of this term and condition to this award. See Additional Requirement 36 to ensure compliance with this term and condition. The link to the full text is at: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional- requirements/ar-36.html . 4. Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions N/A 5. Reporting Recipients will be required to complete Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) in eRA Commons at least annually (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm ; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms/report_on_ grant.htm ) and financial statements as required in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. A final progress report, invention statement, equipment inventory list and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. Although the financial plans of the HHS/CDC CIO(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity depend upon the availability of funds, evidence of satisfactory progress by the recipient (as documented in required reports) and the determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal government. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. Compliance with this law is primarily the responsibility of the Federal agency. However, two elements of the law require information to be collected and reported by recipients: 1) Information on executive compensation when not already reported through the SAM Registration; and 2) Similar information on all sub-awards/ subcontracts/ consortiums over $25,000. It is a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable CDC grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. See the HHS Grants Policy Statement (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies- regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ).
