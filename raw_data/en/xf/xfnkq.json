Questions? Clip art CASE STUDY A 19 -year -old man is on chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. What vaccines can he receive and what vaccines should he not receive? CASE STUDY A 30 -year -old woman is on chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. She has several young children at home. What routine childhood immunizations should her children not receive? CASE STUDY A 15 -month -old boy with sickle cell anemia has just received his final Prevnar\u00ae13. When does he need to get Pneumovax\u00ae23? How many doses of Pneumovax\u00ae23 does he need? CASE STUDY A 62 -year -old man with asthma received a course of prednisone, starting with a high dose (60 mg) and tapering off prednisone over twelve days. His last dose of prednisone was five days ago. Can this man receive a zoster vaccine today? CASE STUDY A 24 -year -old man has well -controlled HIV infection (CD4 cells > 500/ L, low viral load). He received all of his childhood vaccines, but he is seronegative for measles, varicella, and hepatitis B surface antibodies. Can he receive vaccines for any of these diseases? What other vaccines may he need? THANK YOU Karen Lewis, MD | AIPO Medical "}
