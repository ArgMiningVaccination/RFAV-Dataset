This results in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood and urine. When your body converts the food you consume into energy (also called sugar or glucose), insulin is discharged to help transport this energy to the cells. Insulin goes about as a \"key.\" Its chemical message informs the cell to open and get glucose. If you create almost no insulin or are insulin resistant, an excess of sugar stays in your blood. Blood glucose levels are higher than normal for people with diabetes. There are two primary kinds of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease in which the pancreas creates little to zero insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to permit sugar (glucose) to enter cells to create energy. Because there is no insulin to let glucose into the cells, sugar starts to build up in the bloodstream. This can cause severe complications such as heart and blood vessel disease, nerve damage, kidney damage, eye and foot damage, skin and mouth conditions and complications during pregnancy. Type 2 diabetes happens when the body does not deliver enough insulin, or when the cells can't utilize insulin properly, which is called insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is regularly called \"adult-onset\" since it is detected later in life, usually after the age of 45. 90-95 percent of individuals with diabetes have this type. As of late, Type 2 diabetes has been diagnosed in younger individuals, including children, more as often than in the past. These are some of the signs and symptoms of Type 2 diabetes that develop slowly. As a matter of fact, an individual can have Type 2 diabetes for years and may not be aware of it. Look for the following: Many factors can lead to the cause of having diabetes. Some of them are a poor diet, being overweight, high blood pressure, high levels of inflammation, living a sedentary lifestyle, and stress, just to name a few.
