He brings this broad experience to the residency and can offer a different perspective in regards to providing medical care from this experience. Dr. Boll enjoys providing care to the entire family and has seen the value of developing meaningful relationships with his patients. Building these relationships enables patients to trust the medical care provided and for the physician to better tailor evidence-based care to the needs of the patient.

He has taught extensively about rural medicine and rural medical issues such as snake bites, chronic pain, and addiction.

Timothy M. Heilmann, MD, FAAFP - Associate Director Specialty: Family Medicine and Prenatal Care Medical School: Jefferson Medical College Residency: Forbes Health System Board Certification: American Board of Family Medicine, American Board of Preventive Medicine - Clinical Informatics Dr. Heilmann's initial practice experience was in a small town in northwestern Pennsylvania\u2014in a setting so rural that there was even a hitching post behind the office for patients to tie their horses to. That rural setting provided an opportunity to practice the full spectrum of family medicine, from delivering babies (some at home) to fracture management, to making house calls, performing office surgery and visiting nursing homes. Dr. Heilmann brings all of those experiences and skills to the residency; many of his precepting sessions and mini-lectures begin with the words \"Well, when I was back in private practice.\" Lest it be said that he is just an \"old-fashioned country doctor,\" however, he also has a keen interest in evidence-based medicine and coordinates the residency's Journal Club to teach and explore EBM principles and practices in detail. Dr. Heilmann has also been very active in designing computer programs for teaching and for automating various residency functions, and he serves in the role of CMIO for the Susquehanna Health Medical Group.

Dr. Heilmann also puts the \"family\" in family medicine; he and his wife, Susie, are the proud parents of seven children. He is active in the Knights of Columbus; local community theatre; and a lector, cantor, and choir member at St. Ann Church. Dr. Heilmann has been very involved in organized medicine at the state and national level, having served for years on the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians board of directors and as chair of the Residents and Student Affairs Committee.

Dr. Kaderli is passionate about advocating for the expansion of the scope of practice for family doctors nationwide, but especially in rural and underserved areas. He particularly enjoys the opportunity to practice inpatient medicine, obstetrics, and to teach a collection of motivated and talented residents.

Pham, MD - Associate Director Specialty: Family Medicine Medical School: Penn State College of Medicine Residency: UPMC Williamsport Family Medicine Residency Board Certification: American Board of Family Medicine Dr. Pham grew up and attended college in the greater Philadelphia area. He developed an interest in primary care during his time at Penn State Hershey Medical Center's College of Medicine. After completing his family medicine residency at Williamsport in 2011, he decided to move back to central PA to work at a federally-qualified health center look-alike in Carlisle. Although he enjoyed his time there, he missed practicing inpatient medicine in an academic setting and interacting with residents and medical students. For these reasons, he enthusiastically accepted a faculty position at the Williamsport Family Medicine Residency in 2014. Dr. Pham's professional interests include practice management, preventative, and underserved medicine. Besides spending quality time with his wife and four children, he also enjoys music and sports. Over the past few years, Dr. Pham has also developed an interest in carpentry and home renovation. Rebecca Rickard, DO Specialty: Family Medicine with Prenatal Care Medical School: West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine Residency: UPMC Williamsport Family Medicine Residency Board Certification: American Board of Family Medicine Dr. Rickard grew up in a small town in western Pa. with her younger sister. Between the rural community and surrounding Pa. Wilds country, they would always spend a lot of time outdoors. She has fond memories of summers spent canoeing/floating down the Clarion River in Cooks Forest, Pa. She has continued to enjoy the outdoors through finding new trails to hike and camping with friends. Other hobbies include fitness, home d\u00e9cor/furniture restoration, reading/journaling and cooking/baking. Her journey to family medicine started back in college when she had a 2-week experience in a primary care program. She found that she loved the variety and continuity of care. Throughout medical school, she found that she continued to love every rotation, but especially enjoyed her OB, pediatric, and family rotations. She had a tough time deciding between OB and family medicine during the application process, but eventually concluded that she could have the best of both worlds in family medicine. In addition, the strong connections she could make with patients and entire families throughout their lives was another pull towards family medicine.

Enoch Tse, MD - Assistant Director Specialty: Family Medicine Medical School: Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University Residency: UPMC Williamsport Family Medicine Residency Board Certification: American Board of Family Medicine Dr. Tse was born and raised in Hong Kong, but has called Pennsylvania home for more than half his life. His passion for broad-spectrum family medicine burgeoned in medical school, during which he spent his clinical years in Danville, PA. This was solidified during residency right here in Williamsport, where he had the privilege to provide continuity of care for patients of all ages, and across multiple settings \u2014 from the clinic to inpatient units, and from the nursery to nursing homes. He strongly believes that the cornerstone of primary care is family medicine, and feels very fortunate to serve as faculty in a residency that shares the same philosophy. "}
