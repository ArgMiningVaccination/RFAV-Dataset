Instead, it's a philosophy that informs and defines a number of healthcare careers. There is a wide range of jobs that use the holistic health philosophy of treating the entire person (not just a symptom or disease), and a wide range of holistic health practitioner salary figures as well. Many [traditional healthcare providers have started incorporating holistic health practices](/blog/integrative-health-centers/) into their treatments and approaches, and this has contributed to an interest in salaries for holistic practitioners in recent years. While many holistic health practitioners still open and run their own practices, there are also opportunities for holistic providers in spas, wellness centers, and even medical centers that integrate holistic approaches. For example, the respected Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in California employs acupuncturists alongside registered nurses and other traditional healthcare professionals. This greater visibility and acceptance doesn't just benefit holistic providers who work at medical centers. It also means that providers who run their own practices might be able to attract more clients, plus set higher fees that reflect their skills and education.

It will also let your patients know that you're a true professional, something that's extremely important if you're looking to build your own business with a client base. The education you need depends on the career path you choose. Options include: Do I Need to Be Certified?

You'll need to meet standards for certification before you can get hired or open your own practice.
