To systematicallyreview the literature on aromatherapy in order to discoverwhether any clinical indication may be recommended for itsuse, computerised literature searches were performed toretrieve all randomised aromatherapyfrom the following EMBASE, BritishNursing Index, CISCOM, and AMED. The methodologicalquality of the trials was assessed using the Jadad score. Alltrials were evaluated independently by both authors anddata were extracted in a pre-defined, standardised fashion.Twelve trials were located: six of them had no independentreplication; six related to the relaxing effects of aromathera-py combined with massage. These studies suggest that aro-matherapy massage has a mild, transient anxiolytic effect.Based on a critical assessment of the six studies relating torelaxation, the effects of aromatherapy are probably notstrong enough for it to be considered for the treatment ofanxiety. The hypothesis that it is effective for any other indi-cation is not supported by the findings of rigorous clinicaltrials.

Introduction AROMATHERAPY is the use of concentrated essential oils extracted from herbs, flowers, and other plant parts to treat various diseases.1The proponents of aromatherapy lay claim to an ancient tradition of herbal medicine practised in countriessuch as Egypt and India thousands of years ago. However, theterm was initially used by the French chemist Gattefoss\u00e9 in abook first published in 1936. 2It is now commonly administered by massaging into the skin, and the term aromatherapy usuallyimplies massage with a range of aromatic plant extracts known asessential oils. 3It is practised in the United Kingdom by practi- tioners with a variety of qualifications. The AromatherapyOrganisations Council (AOC) acts as an umbrella organisationfor 12 professional aromatherapy associations; 4there is no single recognised qualification. About 7000 individuals are registeredwith one of the member organisations of the AOC. 5Clients and practitioners of aromatherapy perceive it to be effective6,7but physicians are often sceptical of this claim. This review aims to summarise the randomised intervention studies that have been carried out on the use of aromatic plantextracts (essential oils) for a variety of conditions. It also exam-ines systematically the use of aromatherapy massage for anxietyin a health care setting.Method We sought to identify all randomised clinical trials of the thera- peutic use of aromatherapy. Computerised literature searches were performed to identify published studies of aromatherapy. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, British Nursing Index, CIS- COM, and 'alternative 'essential oils', and 'aromatherapy'. The searches werecarried out in June 1999 and went back to the dates of origin of each database. We also searched our own files and consulted a number of colleagues with knowledge of the subject area to iden- tify further research published outside the indexed literature. Clinical trials were included if they were randomised, described as a trial of aromatherapy by the authors, and included human patients. They were excluded if they had no control group or were not randomised, 8or if they pertained to studies of local effects, such as the antiseptic effects of tea tree oil,9or pre-clini- cal studies of healthy volunteers. Trials for indications for which no other trials treating the same problem were identified (e.g.studies with no independent replication) are listed in Table 1 but are not included for detailed discussion. There were no restric- tions as to language of publication. All papers were read by both authors and data extracted into tables independently by both authors in a standard, pre-defined fashion. Characteristics of the studies which met the above criteria and their main findings are summarised in Table 2. Jadad 13proposed a scoring system to assess the methodologi- cal quality of clinical trials. Essentially it evaluates randomisa- tion, blinding, and the mention of drop-outs. Jadad scores for the included studies are shown in Table 3. Scores in the range one tofive are possible, with higher scores implying higher quality. Results Six studies (Table 1) for which no independent replications existwere located. 14,15-19With one exception,18they are all positive, i.e. suggesting a benefit of aromatherapy over control. Six further studies (Table 2) for which independent replications exist were located.20-25With one exception,20they also all suggest positive effects of aromatherapy. The latter considered the use of aro- matherapy massage in hospital settings and investigated its effects on anxiety and general well-being on cancer patients, post-operative patients (following cardiac surgery), and a mixed group of patients in an intensive therapy unit. Important aspectsof their design and methodological quality are shown in Table 3. The methodology of these studies varies substantially. They were all carried out by members of the nursing profession as part of the nursing care of patients in a hospital setting. The outcomes evaluated were similar: anxiety, well-being, symptom scores, and stress. The measuring instruments were questionnaires, such as the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, 26a popular tool27 used for studies of this type, or the Rotterdam SymptomChecklist, 28which was developed to assess the symptoms of can- cer patients. The interventions varied from whole-body massage to mas- sage confined to the feet. The frequency and duration of inter- ventions also varied between studies. The most popular control intervention was massage with a bland oil. One study compared two similar oils, and three studies had control groups that received no intervention as well as placebo groups receiving massage with bland oils. All the studies concluded that aromatherapy was better thanAromatherapy: a systematic review B Cooke, MBBS, MFPHM, research fellow; and E Ernst, MD, PhD, FRCP(ed), professor and head of department, Department of Complementary Medicine, School of Postgraduate Medicine and Health Sciences,University of Exeter.Submitted: 3 August 1999; final acceptance: 22 March 2000. \u00a9 British Journal of General Practice, 2000, 50, 493-496.494 British Journal of General Practice, June 2000BCooke and E Ernst Review article Table 1.

Five out of the six studies reportedstatistically significant findings. However, the reductions insymptom scores and anxiety were transient. Wilkinson made atypical comment: 'It would seem that massage and aromatherapy have an immediate effect in reducing anxiety, but that this may not be sustained over time'. 24 The studies were too heterogeneous and had no common denominator in terms of end-point evaluated for meta-analysis tobe attempted. The highest Jadad score achieved in any of thesetrials was 2 (out of a possible 5). Discussion The findings of this systematic review must be viewed with cau- tion because the original studies were all small and suffered from methodological flaws. Of course, trials of aromatherapy meetformidable methodological problems. For instance, the smell ofthe oils is difficult to mask and patient blinding can therefore bedifficult. Yet none of these studies offers a clearly stated hypoth-esis at the outset, and the general tone of the reports is one ofdocumenting, assessing or evaluating (rather than testing) the'established' effects of aromatherapy by using questionnaires administered before and after an intervention. One author 20did discuss hypothesis testing but only implied that her hypothesiswas that her two treatments were the same, and improvement cri-teria were not defined. The choice of oil was generally statedwithout any referenced justification. There was a prior assumption that the patients in these studies suffered from a degree of anxiety or distress that warranted inter-vention. Some of these patients were sedated, but there is no sug-gestion that they were candidates for conventional anxiolytic therapy (such as benzodiazepines). The patients were not seeking relief from a symptom and then being offered entry into a ran-domised controlled therapeutic trial of an established treatmentfor that symptom. They were not recruited into the studiesbecause they were complaining of anxiety, but because the inves-tigators believed that they were potential subjects with a level ofanxiety or other symptoms that would respond satisfactorily toaromatherapy massage. This may of course be true, but the scien- tific rigour of this approach in effectiveness research is question- able. Nevertheless, the results seem to support a belief that aro- matherapy massage can be helpful for anxiety reduction for shortperiods. The data do not undermine a hypothesis that aromather-apy massage is pleasant, slightly anxiolytic, and often enjoyablefor patients in stressful situations. However, the data do not sup-port a hypothesis that there may be legitimate clinical indications for the prescription of aromatherapy massage in a health care set- ting; it seems to have no lasting effects, good or bad. Five of these studies 21-25 compared massage with and without the addition of essential oils. They all reported a tendency foraromatherapy massage to be slightly more effective than 'place-bo'. However, the differences were modest and could all havebeen attributable to flaws in the study design. A double-blind design to compare aromatherapy treatments is probably impossi-ble to achieve. Thus the question of whether we are dealing withspecific or non-specific effects may never be resolved complete-ly satisfactorily. And as there was no attempt to differentiatebetween the effects of any transdermal absorption of the oils andthe effects of smell, it is not clear what the mechanisms of actionmight be. It is also unclear to what extent psychological factorsmay be important \u2014 pleasant memories triggered by particularsmells may be enough to account for any differences observed. Aromatherapy is pleasant and relatively safe compared with many other ways of spending an hour or so and \u00a320 to \u00a345. Theundoubted popularity of aromatherapy and the enthusiasm ofsome health care professionals has led to its introduction in sev-eral health care settings, notably cancer care and midwifery. Todate, the evidence that this approach may be cost-effective isinsufficient to advocate the use of aromatherapy on a broaderbasis. The studies reviewed here are all sufficiently flawed to prevent firm conclusions from being drawn. The effects under investiga-tion are not easy to measure, and their size seems likely to besmall. If the costs of aromatherapy, either to the patient or to ahealth care system, are brought into consideration, then the inte-gration of aromatherapy begins to lose some of its initial appeal. There is no published literature that provides a sound rationale for the use of aromatherapy massage as a medical intervention.In the absence of hard efficacy data for lasting and relevanthealth effects, it is probably best considered as a pleasant diver-sion for those who can afford it and are prepared to pay for it. Itwould be of considerable interest to know exactly how much aro-matherapy is being practised in National Health Service estab-lishments and how much it is costing the service. National guid-ance on the use of aromatherapy and other complementary thera-pies within the health service is needed to inform purchasingdecisions and to offer a rationale that can be passed on to ourpatients.

Its use is becoming more common within the health service. There are very few published trials on aromatherapy. Aromatherapy appears to have a transient effect in the reduction of anxiety but there is no evidence of a lasting benefit from its use. There is no central guidance available about the introduction and use of aromatherapy in routine healthcare.496 British Journal of General Practice, June 2000BCooke and E Ernst Review article 4.
