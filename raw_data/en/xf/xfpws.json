COVID-19 Etiquette for Faculty and Staff If you are ill: - Do not attend class, work, or other social gatherings. - If you have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, [report your symptoms](https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/daily-checkin)and seek and perform an [antigen test](https://health.cornell.edu/services/covid-19-services/covid-testing#antigen). - If you are feeling particularly ill, contact your primary care provider. If you test positive: [Report your antigen result](https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/sratest-redirect), which helps track the prevalence on campus and enables employees to receive appropriate workplace guidance. - Tell other close contacts that you have COVID-19. This will allow others to take proactive steps to monitor their health. - Isolate at home and follow Tompkins County Whole Health (TCWH) current [isolation guidelines](https://tompkinscountyny.gov/health/factsheets/coronavirusfaq#isolation). Information about Employee's COVID-19 Status The employee may self-disclose medical information with anyone of their choosing; however, ADA does not permit employers, regardless of how the information was obtained, to disclose an employee's medical information to an employee's colleagues, customers, or vendors. Employers can generally inform colleagues, customers, or vendors that an \"employee has tested positive for COVID-19\" or that an employee \"has been exposed to COVID-19.\" The employee(s) should not be identified and identifying information should not be provided. Employees are not required to tell their supervisor any medical diagnosis. However, if an employee is unable to work, in keeping with current policy, the employee is expected to notify his or her supervisor as soon as possible. Symptoms, Testing and Isolation When experiencing [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), employees are expected to: [Complete the health assessment](https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/daily-checkin)before arriving on campus. - Limit contact with others, wear a high-quality mask, and pick up a free antigen test as soon as possible at one of the [antigen testing pick-up locations on campus](https://health.cornell.edu/services/covid-19-services/covid-testing#antigen). - Benefits-eligible employees are covered for eight antigen rapid home tests per 30-day period for each insured individual in the household. [Self-report your results](https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/sratest-redirect). - Isolate at home and follow TCWH current [isolation guidelines](https://tompkinscountyny.gov/health/factsheets/coronavirusfaq#isolation). - Work remotely if possible. Recording Time off for COVID-19 If it's not possible to work remotely, inform your supervisor and local HR and [record your time in Workday](https://apps.hr.cornell.edu/workdayCommunications/HCM%20job%20aids/COVID-19%20Time%20Off%20Guidelines%20for%20Workday.pdf) in a timely manner as directed. This action will ensure continued pay. - If you are paid hourly record time that aligns with your normal work schedule, with a reason of \"Hours Unable to Work - COVID-19\". - Exempt employees should report time that aligns with their normal work schedule, in half or full days using \"Time Unable to Work - COVID-19\".

Employees Caring for Family Members Employees who regularly care for a family member who is at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19 may be eligible for time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Further, staff members may be covered by [NYS Paid Family Leave](/understand-your-benefits/leaves/new-york-state-paid-family-leave). Voluntary Reduction in Hours An employee may request a voluntary short-term reduction in hours (appointment) to help them meet their personal needs. Staff Time Off: If a staff member is not available, or not willing, to work as required, they may use their leave accrual balances in accordance with standard vacation and HAP policies after consultation with their supervisor. A staff member may also request an unpaid leave as permitted by policy/contract if: - the employee does not qualify for a workplace accommodation - the situation doesn't qualify for an approved paid leave - a remote work arrangement is not feasible Time off for Vaccinations Employees in New York State may take up to four hours off from work, with pay, to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The law adds section 196-c to the New York Labor Law., and expires on Dec. 31, 2023. The following clarifies our practices consistent with the state law: : - Employees will be provided up to four hours of paid time off to be vaccinated for COVID-19. This time off applies for each injection, including booster injections. - Covered individuals include anyone who receives an IRS Form W-2 from the University, e.g., full and part-time regular employees, hourly student employees, graduate assistantship appointments, temporary employees and casuals. - The paid time off is provided only for hours that cut across the individual's regularly scheduled workday/shift. - Supervisors, if deemed appropriate after consulting with local HR, may request proof of the vaccine appointment from the individual. - Individuals in non-exempt positions should record the use of this paid time off in Workday as regular time. - Individuals may not be discriminated against or retaliated against for requesting or using this paid time off to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Worker's Compensation If you get the vaccine and experience side effects, you may be eligible for paid leave you are otherwise entitled to if you are ill and unable to work. If you choose to file a work-related injury claim, the NYS Workers' Compensation Board will determine whether the claim qualifies for coverage under state law. "}
