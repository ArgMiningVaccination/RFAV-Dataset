January 11 (Tuesday) from 9:30 to 1:00: Understanding Child Trafficking: A Bio-Psycho-Social Perspective An extremely comprehensive view into the potential etiology of child trafficking, beginning with infant attachment and behavioral learning influences. The attachment pattern developed between an infant and the primary caregiver can have extensive influence across the entire life cycle. The deficits and resultant needs that develop in insecure attachment types will unconsciously impact upon subsequent relationship choices. The workshop will demonstrate how the development of certain attachment types in infants can lead to subsequent juvenile trafficking vulnerability, and how traffickers fulfill the inherent social-emotional deficits to trauma bond with, and exploit youth, then proceeds to teen cognitive and social-emotional development, the impact of trauma, relational influences, recruitment techniques, trauma bonding, red flags and language affiliated with the commercial sex industry, and concluding with engagement tips for work with trafficked youth. Based upon the timeframe, PowerPoint, media clips, and case scenario exercises will be utilized to facilitate learning. Originally presented at Shared Hope International's 2018 Juvenile Sex Trafficking Conference (\"Attachment, Trauma Bonding) and many 2019 - 2021 trafficking related conferences.

The normalizing concepts within media ads, museum art, films, shows, social media influencers and music videos serve to numb reactions and promulgate a sense of false glamour concerning sexual exploitation. This detrimental impact upon juvenile social-emotional development coupled with immature cognitive processes and often previously experienced trauma can influence the concept that exploitation is not only acceptable, but also appealing. The vulnerability to trafficking is also deeply enhanced through deficits and resultant needs that develop in insecure attachment types which unconsciously impact upon subsequent relational choices. The workshop will focus upon the identification of a variety of media platforms that not only influence, but actually normalize and/or glamorize exploitation. Media ads, film extracts, music videos, museum art, social media influencers and video games will be utilized as influential examples. Warning: Some media material is explicit in nature, so persons who are sensitive, easily offended or have the potential for traumatization/re-traumatization should not attend.

The Child Trafficking Database (CTDB) is the electronic mechanism that all ACS and provider agency staff must use to screen children for sex trafficking. This training will provide an overview of child trafficking, a description of the legislation that led to mandated sex trafficking screenings for children in the NYS and NYC child welfare systems, a detailed overview of the policy and a step by step walk through of CTDB screening procedures, including a hands-on demonstration of CTDB screenings. This training is a must for all NYC child welfare staff and any other professional who needs to understand ACS' trafficking policy and to perform the screenings correctly.

Labor trafficking exists across the world and occurs in many locations, but overall, it tends to profit from the exploitation of the world's most vulnerable. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 20.9 million people are victims of forced labor and human trafficking and 5.5 million of those are children. Children can be labor trafficked through debt bondage, agriculture, construction, mining, retail, forced child begging, and domestic servitude. Fair Trade helps to reduce child (and adult) labor trafficking by providing farmers and workers a living wage for their work, which can sustain them and create opportunities for social and economic development (including sending children to school). When we purchase items or services that are developed in accordance with Fair Trade guidelines, we inadvertently participate in labor trafficking. This workshop will provide an overview of labor trafficking, the International Fairtrade Standards, Fairtrade Certification and Fairtrade's Child Labor and Forced Labor Guidelines, highlight industries that demonstrate the purchaser's connection to exploitation, and discuss how consumers can develop awareness towards ending their unknowing participation in labor exploitation.

Each panelist will have about ten minutes to describe their program and work, followed by participant Q & A. January 19 (Wednesday) from 2:00 to 3:30: Intersection of Human Trafficking and Addiction The power of addiction in trafficking has been recognized by the criminal justice system. Addiction can exacerbate a trafficked person's vulnerability, be part of a trafficker's means of coercing the captive person to submit, be a tool the trafficker uses to control the captive, and can be used by the captive person as a means of coping with the physical and mental traumas of being trafficked. Opioids in particular are an effective coercion tool for traffickers. Some traffickers recruit directly from substance use treatment facilities. After exiting the trafficking situation, survivors with substance use issues need safety and support to recover. This session dispels myths about addiction and provides evidence-based information and trauma-informed recommendations for service providers that are applicable to children as well as adults. The presenter is a speaker, author, and survivor leader who holds five professional certifications in addiction treatment and is in long-term recovery from severe drug addiction. Her expertise is both clinical and experiential. Attendees will learn: [The Intersection of Human Trafficking and Addiction Webex Link](https://acsnyc.webex.com/acsnyc/onstage/g.php?MTID=eb1c3a41223ec5dc249557844c366da2f) January 20 (Thursday) from 9:30 to 12:00: Trauma-Informed Art Therapy for Kids Art therapy provides clients with an alternative method of communication and understanding of oneself. The art work that one creates is a reflection of the self, which can be more intimate in nature but also less intrusive. This makes it effective when working with clients who have experienced trauma. In this workshop you will learn about how art therapy can be utilized to explore the depths of trauma in children and adults, explore the benefits of art therapy, and get to do your own self-care art therapy exercise led by Art Therapist Crystal Chen, ATR-BC, LCAT, LMHC-A. No art skills or knowledge is necessary to participate in the art therapy exercise. This is a hands-on workshop, so the following art supplies will make it fun and productive: January 20 (Thursday) from 1:00 to 4:30: Safety Planning WITH Trafficked Youth Safety plans are integral to optimizing safety at every stage for survivors of trafficking and youth at-risk of sexual exploitation. Planning should occur regularly, relate to whether the survivor plans to leave or remain with the trafficker, and address multiple criteria. Since youth are the experts of their situations and experiences, they should always have an opportunity to be engaged directly in safety-planning. This workshop will discuss the importance of safety planning WITH youth and provide strategies to encourage them to take ownership of and participate in the development of their own personalized plans. The workshop will suggest dos and don'ts, discuss short-term versus long-term planning, and provide strategies to engage youth who may be reluctant to participate in planning. It will also provide an opportunity to practice individualized plan development through case scenarios and role play opportunities.

Attendees will become familiar with the NCMEC Intake process, the importance of providing photos, and the information provided to NCMEC during the course of a case. CST program and resources will be highlight by NCMEC Case Management, Child Sex Trafficking Team of analysts, and the Recovery Services Team. In 2020, 1 out of 6 missing children reported to NCMEC who had run away were likely victims of CST. Many of these cases involved children missing from the care of child welfare and it's clear that child welfare professionals are increasingly on the front lines of coordinating care, services and emergency response for survivors of CST. With the significant levels of trauma experienced by CST victims, advanced recovery planning and specialized response can mitigate challenges, streamline resources and allow for coordinated, trauma-informed interventions. This presentation will provide a deeper dive into the Recovery Services Team that launched in 2020 to support the development of proactive recovery and response plans focused on increasing rapport, youth engagement, and reducing running behavior for missing children who are being sex trafficked.

Many youth have been unknowingly trafficked as they do not recognize the red flag indicators for trafficking and believe they are in a \"relationship\" with their exploiter. It is a devastating recognition for which many defense mechanisms occur to avoid the trauma of emotional abuse/deceit added to the trauma of sex trafficking. Two therapeutic group models were created to help mitigate trafficking involvement, reduce trauma, develop healthier thought patterns, regulate emotions, and self-empower vulnerable youth. Mitigating Trauma Through Drama uses psychodrama techniques to safely guide youth through traumatic memories and address concerns. Be Sea (Be Safe, Empowered, Aware) uses Dialectical Behavioral Therapy skills to identify emotions and develop coping strategies. Both models facilitate expression and disclosure through universally applicable skills integrated with trafficking awareness scenarios and discussion and have achieved success with trafficked and at-risk youth in the NYC foster care system.
