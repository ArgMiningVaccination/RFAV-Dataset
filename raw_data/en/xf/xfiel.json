The BST3 was engineered to facilitate coordinated research in the areas of neurosciences, vaccine development, regenerative medicine and biomedical devices, and basic science disciplines. The facility is outfitted with open labs, procedure rooms, conference areas, and office spaces. This integrated design fosters interaction among investigators and provides an unparalleled learning environment for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates. In addition to housing some of the world's most accomplished medical researchers, the BST3 facilities refine and strengthen the synergies among the University; the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; and scientific, educational, and biotechnology organizations through out Western Pennsylvania. Explore the links below to learn more about the cutting-edge research that is being conducted within the walls of the BST3.
