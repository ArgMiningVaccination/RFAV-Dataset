She can go to her primary care physician, she can go to an orthopedist, she can see a chiropractor, an acupuncturist, a massage therapist, and the list goes on and on. Becky might choose one of these options, or combine a few. Her choices will depend on her personal preferences and what works best for her injury. The various treatment choices represent different fields of medicine. A field of medicine is a practice of a particular medical discipline. Generally speaking, there are two main fields: - Scientific, or conventional, medicine - Holistic medicine For the most part, holistic medicine refers to a general treatment practice that focuses on overall wellness and does not fall within the definition of conventional medicine. That's a bit circular, so let's start by examining and defining conventional, or scientific, medicine. Scientific Medicine Conventional medicine is science-based medicine. When you have a sore throat, and you go see your primary care physician at a doctor's office, you are partaking in scientific medicine. This type of medicine uses scientific observations in order to understand and treat the human body. Your doctor is most likely an M.D. Professionals holding this Medical Doctor title have studied and earned a degree in science-based medicine. According to the American Medical Association, the key difference between scientific medicine and all other forms of medicine is the educational qualification of practitioners to a particular scientific standard. So, you show up for your appointment with your sore throat. Your doctor takes a look inside your throat and swabs it in order to collect organisms. The swab will be processed in a lab. The results will let the doctor know whether or not you have an infection, like strep throat or the flu. Let's say the results show that you have strep throat. The doctor will then prescribe an antibiotic drug designed to eliminate strep infections. This scientific process is a newer type of medicine. It was developed over the last few centuries, but only became what we now know as conventional medicine, or modern medicine, in the 19th and 20th centuries. That was due to discoveries and advances relating to germs, infectious diseases, and medicines. The first true antibiotic wasn't discovered until 1928 and wasn't widely used until the late 1940s. Other important advances include microscopes, stethoscopes, and x-ray machines. Scientific medicine is based on documentation. Throughout the 19th century, medical researchers utilized the numerical method. This method analyzed specific treatments through statistics in order to determine effectiveness. For this reason, scientific medicine is also sometimes referred to as evidence-based medicine. Though research methods are drastically modernized, this type of clinical research is still central to scientific medicine. Holistic Medicine Now let's turn to holistic medicine. As you know, holistic medicine is any type of medicine that isn't science-based medicine. Specifically, holistic medicine focuses on overall wellness by treating the mind, body, and spirit. Historically, both Socrates and Plato advocated a holistic approach to medicine, though the term wasn't used until the 1920s and the concept wasn't widely accepted until the 1970s. Holistic practitioners believe that healing can only be accomplished by treating all three aspects of the human being, rather than focusing on just the body. This is the key difference between holistic medicine and scientific medicine, since science-based medicine focuses on the science of the human body. Many people use the terms 'holistic medicine' and 'alternative medicine' interchangeably. In fact, alternative medicine is just one kind of holistic medicine. Alternative medicine is a system of medicine built on theory and practice but not generally regarded as scientifically tested and proven. Many alternative medicine practices are centuries older than conventional practices. Alternative medicine includes homeopathic remedies, meditation, massage, chiropractic, kinesiology, and many other practices. Note that each of these alternative practices can also be used as complementary medicine. Complementary medicine is a second type of holistic medicine. It's used in addition to conventional treatment, in order to supplement scientific medical treatment. For example, let's go back to your sore throat. Let's say you start your antibiotic, but your throat is still bothering you. A friend suggests some warm tea with honey. This is an ancient homeopathic remedy. If you drink the tea and honey in addition to taking your medicine, then you're practicing complementary, holistic medicine. Lesson Summary Let's review. There are two main fields of medicine. A field is a practice of a particular medical discipline. These broad fields are: - Scientific, or conventional, medicine - Holistic medicine Scientific, also called science-based medicine, uses scientific observations in order to understand and treat the human body. It's based on research and documentation. During its development, researchers used the numerical method, which analyzes specific treatments through statistics in order to determine effectiveness. Holistic medicine is a general treatment practice that focuses on overall wellness and does not fall within the definition of conventional medicine. Holistic medicine treats the mind, body, and spirit. Two popular types of holistic medicine are: - Alternative medicine, which is a system of medicine built on theory and practice but not generally regarded as scientifically tested and proven - Complementary medicine, which is used in addition to conventional treatment, in order to supplement scientific medical treatment Learning Outcomes At the end of this lesson, students should be able to: - Name the two fields of medicine - Compare and contrast science-based medicine and holistic medicine - Distinguish the two types of holistic medicine "}
