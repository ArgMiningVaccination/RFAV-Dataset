If you're wondering how to keep your immune system strong, we're here to help with lifestyle changes and immune-boosting tips! Lifestyle Tips - Prioritize Sleep: I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but for a good reason! When you aren't getting enough sleep, your immune system begins to struggle. Make sure to sleep for at least 7 hours if possible! - Exercise Regularly: Physical activity helps strengthen your immune system and can improve the deterioration of the immune system. - Incorporate Immune Boosting Foods: Including citrus fruits, red bell peppers, garlic, ginger, spinach, bone broth, broccoli. - Reduce Stress: I know, another clich\u00e9 one, and everyone experiences stress, but the key is to manage it. Try breathing exercises, yoga, or daily meditation. Supplements & Herbs: - Elderberry: Elderberry, whether in the form of liquid drops, supplements, or cough drops has been shown to boost the immune system and treat the common cold and flu. - Echinacea: Loaded with antioxidants, this plant is great for defending your cells against oxidative stress and improved immunity. You can find this in the form of tea, tinctures, and supplements. - Vitamin C: Vitamin-C-rich foods may help reduce respiratory infections and help shorten the duration of common illnesses. Try adding in foods such as citrus fruits, red bell peppers, and parsley. - Zinc: Commonly used as remedies for colds and other illnesses. Zinc can help reduce cold-related symptoms. - Vitamin D: One of the more underrated supplements. Vitamin D regulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which helps regulate the immune system. It can help prevent diseases and lower your chances of catching the common flu. We hope these tips help & we wish everyone a healthy and happy "}
