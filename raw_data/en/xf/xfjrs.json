Data, Trend and Maps Overweight Children, ages 2-4 years Obese Children, ages 2-4 years Girls: Overweight Boys: Overweight Girls: Obesity Boys: Obesity Critical Issue About 40% of overweight children will continue to have increased weight during adolescence 7580% of obese adolescents will become obese adults The consequences of this disease starting in childhood may be more severe as the duration of obesity will be longer Freedman DS, Khan LK, Serdula MK, Dietz adult adiposity: the Bogalusa Heart Study. Pediatr ics. 2005;115:22 -27. Type 2 Diabetes The rate of new diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes rose most sharply in Native Americans (8.9 percent), Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (8.5 percent) and non -Hispanic blacks (6.3 percent). The rate of new diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes increased 3.1 percent among Hispanics. The smallest increase was seen in whites (0.6 percent). The rate of new diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes rose much more sharply in females (6.2 percent) than in males (3.7 percent ) Mayer -Davis, E. J. et al.

Transtheoretical Model of Change Intentional behavior change Views change as a process rather than an event The change process is characterized by a series of stages of change In attempting to change a behavior, a person typically cycles through the stages of change Why is it so effective? -Because it recognizes that people in different stages of change need different types of interventions to help them progress. Transtheoretical Model of One: Precontemplation Not considering making a change within the next 6 months (or ever) \"I don't have a problem\" \"I'll deal with it later \" \"My child is not overweight\" Stage Two: Contemplation Seriously considering making a change within the next 6 months \"Maybe I should change ...\" \"I would like to change ...\" \"Maybe she's right ...\" \"I'll think about it\" \"Maybe after his growth spurt\" Stage Three: Preparation Making plans to change within the next 30 days \"I want to change, so I need to ...\" Stage Four: Action Engaging in the changed behavior for at least 6 months -Nutrition education -Increased physical activity -More sleep -Reduced stress Stage Five : Maintenance Have met goal and maintained new behavior for at least 6 months Stage Six : Termination Goal met, behavior permanently changed However... Most people live in maintenance, or most likely cycle back to a previous stage What to do first? Identify the stage of change that you, or the person you are helping, are in. -Precontemplation -Contemplation -Preparation -Action -Maintenance -Termination next stage ... 1.Cognitive -information processing that goes on inside people's minds, including perception, attention, language, memory, thinking, and consciousness I know that eating a doughnut will not help me lose weight. If I eat it then I will have energy only for a short time, and I will feel bad 2. Behavioral Eating the doughnut or not eating the doughnut What else affects ability to change? -Decisional Balance Janis and Mann (1977) Decisional Balance -Precontemplation stage, the pros in favor of behavior change are outweighed by the relative cons for change and in favor of maintaining the existing behavior -Contemplation stage, the pros and cons tend to carry equal weight, leaving the individual ambivalent toward change. -If the decisional balance is tipped however, such that the pros in favor of changing outweigh the cons for maintaining the unhealthy behavior, many individuals move to the Preparation or even Action stage. -Maintenance stage, the pros in favor of maintaining the behavior change should outweigh the cons of maintaining the change in order to decrease the risk of relapse.
