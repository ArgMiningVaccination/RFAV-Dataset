The massage focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top muscles. Therapeutic massage is often recommended for individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy physical activity, such as athletes, and patients who have sustained physical injury. Also called prenatal massage, pregnancy massage is becoming increasingly popular with expectant mothers. Massage therapists who are certified in pregnancy massage know the proper way to position and support the woman's body during the massage, and how to modify techniques. Pregnancy massage is used to reduce stress, decrease swelling, relieve aches and pains, and reduce anxiety and depression. The massage is customized to a woman's individual needs. Aromatherapy massage is massage therapy with the addition of one or more scented plant oils called essential oils to address specific needs. Therapists will select oils that are relaxing, energizing, stress-reducing, balancing, or whatever your specific needs may be. Aromatherapy massage is particularly suited to stress-related conditions or conditions with an emotional component. Deep tissue massage targets the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue. The massage therapist uses slower strokes or friction techniques across the grain of the muscle. This massage is used for chronically tight or painful muscles, repetitive strain, postural problems, or recovery from injury. People often feel sore for one to two days after a deep tissue massage. "}
