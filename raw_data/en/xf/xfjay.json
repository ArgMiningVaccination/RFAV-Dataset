Pacific College's Acupuncture School Over the past 50 years, acupuncture and other similar East Asian modalities such as herbology or tui na bodywork have increasingly gained in popularity. In fact, they have evolved into one of the most utilized forms of complementary integrative medicine interventions in the United States. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH)*, more than 10 million acupuncture treatments are administered annually in the United States alone. This rise in popularity can be attributed in part to its effectiveness for pain relief, nausea, allergies, and other chronic and acute conditions, and in part to the fact that scientific studies have begun to prove its efficacy. Since 1986, Pacific College has led the movement and trained dedicated practitioners with graduate degrees in acupuncture and Chinese medicine. We tirelessly advocate for research and regulation, and even offered the very first doctorate completion program for acupuncturists holding a master's degree back in 2016. Today, as acupuncture continues to grow as a non-pharmaceutical, adjunct modality to conventional allopathic medical treatments, the demand from patients and their loved ones is increasing, and acupuncture is now offered even at prestigious academic medical centers. Pacific College's Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Programs Pacific College's acupuncture and Chinese medicine programs are endorsed under the umbrella of our prestigious institutional WASC accreditation, and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM).

Acupuncture Degree and Certification Highlights Acupuncture programs at acupuncture school This program makes students eligible for the California state licensure exams as well as the national certification examinations, which enable students to become licensed in the remaining states that regulate acupuncture colleges and Chinese medicine schools. This program helps students become eligible for the national certification examinations from NCCAOM and allows the student to become licensed in states that regulate acupuncture and Chinese medicine using the NCCAOM exam. As this program does not require herbology, it's a shorter duration than the MSAcCHM. The program has been designed for licensed acupuncturists and qualifies students to become eligible for the NCCAOM exam in Chinese Herbology. The Pacific College of Health and Science has designed this pathway for acupuncturists who already have their master's (or equivalent) to continue their work and receive their doctorate.

As a result, there's never been a better time to choose a career in acupuncture. According to LearnHealthCare.net, the discipline is expected to grow by 32 percent in America between 2016 and 2022. As of 2018, roughly 38,000 licensed acupuncturists worked in spas, cancer clinics, physical therapy and chiropractor offices, hospitals, educational institutions, and national and state agencies.
