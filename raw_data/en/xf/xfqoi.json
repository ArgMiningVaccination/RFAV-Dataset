Has anyone encountered the same error, do you know what causes it? We also saw these errors in the logs: \"An error occurred while generating the pdf\" (this is what the users see) and \"An error occurred while generating the pdf for <relative path>\" thrown in the application, but I think they are related to the protocol error. Chrome version: 108.0.5329.125 (Official Build) (64-bit) Platform version: 11.18.1 (Build 37828) Ultimate PDF for Traditional Web version: 6.0.0 Please see the stack-trace below: Protocol error (Network.setCookies): Invalid cookie fields at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw() at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task) at PuppeteerSharp.CDPSession.d__33.MoveNext() in C:\\projects\\puppeteer-sharp\\lib\\PuppeteerSharp\\CDPSession.cs:line 159 --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown --- at PuppeteerSharp.Page.d__156.MoveNext() in C:\\projects\\puppeteer-sharp\\lib\\PuppeteerSharp\\Page.cs:line 698 Thank you! Hi Imola. Please use version 8.0.4 instead of 8.0.3 and report back if it fixes your problem. Hi Imola. Could you try installing the Ultimate PDF version 8.0.3? https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-versions/5641/version/0/platform/ Then republish the Ultimate PDF for Traditional Web, and republish your application that is generating the pdf. Let me know if that fixes this issue. Thank you. "}
