The Legislature has the power to establish municipal courts in incorporated cities and towns. The judicial system stems from an effort to protect the individual from arbitrary social authority and to protect society against infringement upon its laws and customs. The system is an interdependent structure of administratively autonomous local, state and federal courts. The agency's relationships are primarily with district courts and the judges in these courts. In all formal relationships with the judiciary, decisions on legal points are the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. The agency has the responsibility for casework decisions and makes recommendations to the court based on these decisions. Example: The agency may decide that foster care is the appropriate care for a specific child. The court makes the decision to award temporary custody of the child to the agency; the agency decides upon the type of foster care and the specific home in which the child is placed. The agency's formal relationships with the judiciary are in three general areas: 1) criminal and civil actions against recipients or relatives of recipients (desertion, non-support, fraud, or other actions related to receipt of assistance); 2) civil actions related to children (custody, termination of parental rights, adoption, etc.); 3) juvenile court actions to the extent the court involves the Division for studies, reports and testimony, and where others petition the court to transfer custody to the Welfare Division. Informal relationships are of two general types: 1) representatives of the agency are invited to meet the district judges as their annual meeting of judges or to meet with the State Welfare Board and/or other agency representatives for discussion and solution of various types of problems with which the agency and the judiciary are involved. This type of relationship usually has statewide implications, and affects procedures effective uniformly; 2) relationships established with individual judges through discussion of general procedures or plans and procedures related to specific cases. This type of relationship is developed primarily on the local level with local applications. A. SUPREME COURT The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and four associate justices. A majority constitutes a quorum and a majority must concur to render a decision. B. DISTRICT COURT There are eight judicial districts in Nevada, three of them with more than one judge. Each of the 18 district judges is paid from the State General Fund as authorized by a direct legislative appropriation. ________________________________________________________________________________________ TN # 86-7 Supersedes Approval TN # 85-8 Attachment 1.2-A Page 8 NEVADA STATE WELFARE DIVISION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL Section 103.1 - 103.2 MTL 11/78 30 Jun 78 The judicial districts are: FIRST - Carson City, Douglas, Churchill, Lyon and Storey Counties - three judges; SECOND - Washoe County - Seven judges; THIRD - Eureka and Lander Counties - one judge; FOURTH - Elko County - one judge; FIFTH - Mineral, Nye and Esmeralda Counties - one judge; SIXTH - Pershing and Humboldt Counties - one judge; SEVENTH - White Pine and Lincoln Counties - one judge; and EIGHTH - Clark County - eleven judges.

A representative of the agency requests by petition or affidavit that certain action be taken and supplies the court with necessary facts and information on which the request is based and includes possible alternate plans. B. A representative of the agency supplies facts, general information, and recommendations to the court based on social analysis and casework decisions following initiation of action by others than the agency.

Section 2107(e)(I) of the Act was also amended to apply these requireme nts to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Consultation is requ ired concerning Medicaid and CHIP matters having a direct impact on Indian health pr ograms and Urban Indian organizations. Nevada Consultation Process The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Tribes, Indian Health Service, Tribal and Urban Indian Organiza tions (I/T/U) residing within of the State of Nevada created a Tribal Consultation Process. The Tribal Consultation Process was signed and became effective March 2010. Below is a summary of the pr ocess for the Tribal Consultation Process: Purpose - The purpose of the agreement is to establish an open and m eaningful consultation process between the Nevada Department of Hea lth and Human Services and the Indian Tribes in the State of Nevada to facilitate better communication and coll aboration between the entities. Agreement - The guiding principle of the agreem ent is to ensure that open and meaningful communication occurs in a timely manner for consultation between the parties regarding high-level policy changes that si gnificantly impact Indian Trib es in the State of Nevada. Policy changes that significantly impact Indian Tr ibes refer to actions that have substantial Tribal implications with direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, on relationship between the State of Nevada and Indian Tribes, or on th e distribution of roles on and responsibilities between the State of Nevada and Indian Tribes. A copy of the tribe-state consultation process can be requested from the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP). 1. Please describe the process the State uses to seek advice on a regular ongoing basis from federally-recognized tribes, Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations on matters related to Medicaid and CHIP pr ograms and for consultation on State Plan Amendments, waiver proposals, waiver extension s, waiver amendments, waiver renewals and proposals for demonstration projects prior to submission to CMS. Please include information about the frequency, inclusiveness and process for seeking such advice. Notification Process In addition to the tribe-state consultation process set forth be tween DHHS, Tribes, and I/T/Us; 9 (Continued Pg. 1) State: Nevada TN No. 10-013 Approval Date: _April January 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW DHCFP will consult with all federally recogni zed Tribes and I/T/Us within the State of Nevada on all Medicaid state plan amendm ents, waiver requests, waiver renewals, demonstration project pr oposals and/or on all matters that relate to Medi caid and CHIP programs. a. The notification will describe the purpose of the state plan amendment, waiver request, waiver renewal, demonstration pr oject proposal and/or on matter relating to Medicaid and CHIP programs and will incl ude the anticipated impact on Tribal members, Tribes and/or I/T/Us. The description of the impact will not be Tribal member, Tribe and/or I/T/U specific if the impact is similar on all Tribal members, Tribes and/or I/T/Us. b. The notification will also de scribe a method for Tribes and/or I/T/Us to provide official written comments and questions within a time-frame that allows adequate time for State analysis, consideration of any i ssues that are raised and the time for discussion between the State and enti ties responding to the notification. c. Tribes and I/T/Us will be provided a reasonable amount of time to respond to the notification. Whereof, thirty (30) days is considered reasonable. d. In all cases where Tribes and/or I/T/Us request in-person c onsultation meetings, DHCFP will make these meetings available. e. The tribe-state consultation process allows fo r an expedited process for notification of policy changes due to budget cuts prior to changes being implemented. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires Medicaid state plan amendments, waiver requests and waiver renewals, which fall within this category to have a notification process prior to these document s being submitted to CMS. Due to this, the State is instituting an expedite d process which allows for notification to the tribes of at least one week notice prior to the change s being implemented as agreed upon in the tribe-state consultation proce ss or two weeks prior to the submission of the state plan amendments, waiver requests and/or waiv er renewals, whichever date precedes. 2. Please describe the consultation process that occurred specifically for the development and submission of this State Plan Amendment, when it occurred and who was involved. State of Nevada, Department of Health a nd Human Services (DHHS) Tribal Consultation Process: On August 13, 2009, Michael J. Willd en (Director, DHHS), Charles Duarte (Administrator, DHCFP) and John Liveratti (Chief of Compliance, DHCFP) met with representatives from the Indian Health Boar d of Nevada (IHBN) to begin tribal-state collaboration process discussions. To help facilit ate this discussion, IHBN presented a draft of the State of Arizona's tribal-state consultation policy. Based on the outcome of this discussion and Arizona's draft policy, Mary Liveratti (D eputy Director, DHHS) created a draft tribal- state consultation policy. The draft policy was completed on September 15, 2009. Subsequently, the Deputy Director presented th e draft policy to the IHBN and DHHS division administrators. On October 7, 2009, a follow-up meeting was convened to discuss the draft policy. Those in attendance were Mary Liveratti, Diane Comea ux (Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services), Romaine Gillila nd (Administrator, Division of Welfare and 9 (Continued Pg. 2) State: Nevada TN No. 10-013 Approval Date: _April Effective Date: January 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW Supportive Services), Carol Sala (Administrator, Division of Agi ng and Disability Services), Dr. Luana Ritch (Health Division) and Larr y Curley (Indian Health Board Nevada).

Base d on feedback from the chairpersons, DHHS developed a final policy. In Ja nuary 2010, DHHS mailed policy agre ement letters, along with the final policy, to all the tribal chairpersons. Tribes were asked to sign and return the letters to DHHS. As of March 31, 2010, DHHS receive d 11 responses. On March 31, 2010, the Director sent out a memorandum to all of th e division administrators, along with the policy, requesting they sign and return the policy agreement letters to DHHS.

TN No. 13-004 Approval Date: June 18, 2013 Effective Date: January 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 07-009 State: Nevada Attachment 3.1-A Page 6b Each individual service must be identified on a written rehabilitation plan. This is also referenced as the treatment plan. Providers are required to maintain case records. Components of the rehabilitation plan and case r ecords must be consistent with the federal rehabilitation regulations. Rehabilitation services may only be covered by Medicaid if they are not the responsibility of other programs a nd if all applicable requirements of the Medicaid program are met. Services covered under the Title IV-E program are not covered under the rehabilitation program. Room and Boar d is not an allowable service under the mental health rehabilita tive program. Services are not provided to recipients who are inmates of a public institution. These services require utilization review accordi ng to the individual intensity of need and are time limited. Rehabilitative mental health services may be provided in a community-based, outpatient services, home-based, and school-based envir onment. Depending on the specific services they may be provided in a group or individua l setting. All collateral services that are delivered to a person that is an integral part of the recipient's environment such as medically necessary training, counseling and therapy, must directly support the recipient. Services are based on an intensity of need s determination. The assessed level of need specifies the amount, scope and duration of ment al health rehabilitation services required to improve, retain a recipient's level of functi oning or prevent relapse. The determination cannot be based upon the habilitative needs of the recipient. Intensity of needs determination is completed by a trained Qualified Mental Health Professional (QMHP) or Qualified Mental Hea lth Associate (QMHA) and is based on several components related to person- and family- centered treatment planning. These components include: A comprehensive assessment of the recipient's level of functioning; The clinical judgment of the QMHP; or The clinical judgment of the case manager working under clinical supervision who is trained and qualified in mental health intensity of services determinations; and A proposed Treatment Plan. A re-determination of the intensity of needs must be completed every 90 days or anytime there is a substantial change in the recipient's clinical status. Nevada Medicaid utilizes an intensity of need s grid to determine the amount and scope of services based upon the clinical level of care of the recipient. The grid is based upon the current level of care assessments: Level of Ca re Utilization System (LOCUS) for adults and Child and Adolescent Services Intensity Instrument (CASII) for children. The determined level on the grid guides the interdisciplinary team in planning treatment. TN No. 07-009 Approval Date: October 31, 2008 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No. 05-015 State: Nevada Attachment 3.1-A Page 6b.1 Within each level there are utilization standards for the amount of services to be delivered.

Definitions 42 CFR 438.50 An existing provider-recipient relatio nship is one in which the provider was the main source of Medicaid se rvices for the recipient during the previous year. This may be establis hed through state records of previous managed care enrollment or fee-for-s ervice experience or through contact with the recipient. i. A provider is considered to have \"traditionally served\" Medicaid recipients if it has experien ce in serving the Medicaid population. 1932(a)(4) 2. State process for enrollment by default. 42 CFR 438.50 Describe how the state's default enrollment process will preserve: i. the existing provider-recipien t relationship (as defined in H.1.i). New members will be allowed the opportunity to select an MCO with their Primary Care Provide r (PCP) in network. Returning Medicaid beneficiaries will be assigned to their former MCO and PCP. The MCO will then ensure that the prior provider-beneficiary relationship is preserved if the provider is still in that MCO's network.

New Medicaid beneficiaries will be asked to complete their selection of an MCO at the time of Medicaid application. If none is chosen, the State will complete a default enrollment process, and they will be automatically assigned to an MCO based upon an algorithm developed by the State to distribute enrollees among the MCOs. ii. the relationship with provide rs that have traditionally served Medicaid recipients (a s defined in H.2.ii). Prior to auto-assigning a benefici ary to an MCO, the State will review the beneficiary's past en rollment records to determine whether the beneficiary has a pr ior MCO relationship. If such a relationship is confirmed, and the beneficiary has been ineligible for Medicaid managed care, the beneficiary will be auto-assigned to that MCO. The MCO w ill then ensure that the prior provider-beneficiary relationship is preserved if the provider is still in that MCO's network. iii. the equitable distribution of Me dicaid recipients among qualified MCOs and PCCMs available to enroll them, (excluding those that are subject to intermediate sanction described in 42 CFR 438.702(a)(4)); and disenrollment fo r cause in accordance with 42 CFR 438.56 (d)(2). (Example: No auto-assignments will be made if MCO meets a certain percentage of capacity.) When assigning a beneficiary to a previous MCO is not possible, the State will distribute bene ficiaries equitably among qualified MCOs based upon an algorithm developed by the DHCFP. The State may also adjust the auto-assignment algorithm in consideration of the MCO's c linical performance measure results or other measurements. Under the NCCW, there is only one PCCM available to Medicaid beneficiarie s. Beneficiaries enrolled in the PCCM will be given the choice of at least two care managers in the PCCM. 1932(a)(4) 3. As part of the state's discu ssion on the default enrollment process, 42 CFR 438.50 include the following information: i. The state of Nevada will _X _/will not____ use a lock-in for MCO enrollment.

The beneficiaries will be notified of their option to change MCOs at least 60 days prior to the end of the lock-in period. Beneficiaries will be allowed to change MCOs during the annual open enrollment period. PCCM beneficiaries are locked-in without an open enrollment period based upon the Freedom of Choice option waived under the authority of the NCCW. PCCM beneficiaries are allowed to change care managers at any time. ii. The time frame for recipients to choose a health plan before being auto-assigned will be at the time of Me dicaid application. MCO beneficiaries are asked to complete their selection of an MCO at the time of Medicaid application before being auto- assigned, unless they have a previous history with an MCO. Returning beneficiaries without family curren tly enrolled in an MCO will be assigned to their most recent MCO with an opportunity to choose a new MCO at the next Open Enrollment, at least once every 12 months. Returning beneficiaries with family currently enrolled in an MCO will automatically be enrolled in their family's MCO. PCCM beneficiaries are automati cally enrolled in the PCCM in the next administrative month on ce they meet program eligibility criteria for enrollment. iii. Describe the state's process fo r notifying Medicaid recipients of their auto-assignment. (Example: state generated correspondence.) Potential enrollees are notified of their choice options and asked to complete their selection of an MCO at the time of Medicaid application. They are notified of their right to disenroll with cause at any time through the written enrollment packet provided by the MCO and by a letter generated by the MMIS. They are also informed of the State's default enrollment process or auto assignment process. The State prior approves the written enrollment packet which the cont racted MCOs use to provide this notification to potential enrollees, including the websites and phone numbers of the MCOs.

Describe the state's process for notifying the Medicaid recipients who are auto-assigned of their ri ght to disenroll without cause during the first 90 days of their enrollment . (Examples: state generated correspondence, HMO enrollment packets etc.) All MCO enrollees who are entitled to dise nroll without cause will receive a letter detailing that they have 90 days to change MCOs, even if they were automatically assigned to an MCO. Beneficiaries may disenroll wit hout cause within the first 90 days of enrollment in the MCO and at least once every 12 months. Beneficiaries may disenro ll with cause at any time. The request to disenroll from the MCO is made in writing to the MCO and occurs upon MCO approva l. Details on how to submit a disenrollment request is e xplained to enrollees in the enrollment packet they are provided at the time they are determined eligible for MCO enrollment. PCCM enrollees may disenroll w ith cause at any time. They will be provided disenrollment rights and procedures in writing from the PCCM. v. Describe the default assignment algorithm used for auto- assignment. (Examples: ratio of plans in a geographic service area to potential enrollees , usage of quality indicators.) Returning MCO enrollees will be assigned to their most recent MCO, regardless if they lost Me dicaid eligibility or were in Medicaid FFS during this time, unless a family member has an open case. If the enrollee's return to MCO eligibility occurs during an open enrollment period, then the beneficiary will be allowed to choose their MCO at the time of MCO re-eligibility. If the beneficiary does not select an MCO, they will be auto assigned to an MCO. Following au to-assignment, they will have 90 days to change their MCO plan. Returning beneficiaries who join an open case where another family member is currently en rolled in an MCO, will be assigned to the same MCO as the re st of the family and will not individually have a 90 day right to change period, nor will their addition to the family qualify any other members of the family C M S - P M - X X - X A T T A C H M E N T 3 . 1 - F D a t e : P a g e 1 7 OMB No.:0938-0933 State: Nevada _________________________________________________________ ______________________________ Citation Condition or Requirement ______________________________________________________________________________________________ No. 13-031 Approval Date: February 21, 2014 Effective Date: October 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 09-11 for a right to change outside of the regular open enrollment period. Returning beneficiarie s without a family member currently part of an open case will be auto assigned to their most recent MCO. New additions to an open case, whether newborn or additional family members who join the household after the MCO has been established, are also assigned to the same MCO as the rest of the family and do not have 90 days to change MCOs; these new case members, as well as the rest of the family, remain locked-in until the next open enrollment period. The new addition will be assigned to the family's MCO whet her or not they are an adult or child, and regardless of the time they have been absent from the case. They will not be given an option to change MCOs until the next open enrollment period. Enrollment in the MCO will begin at the beginning of the n e x t administratively possible month. Returning beneficiaries, and those being added to an open case, will be notified of this assignment by mail and informed th at they can disenroll at the next open enrollment period. For a true first time beneficiary, that is one who has never been enrolled in an MCO, they w ill be given information on all MCOs and will be asked to complete their selection of an MCO at the time of Medicaid application. Their choice will go into effect the first day of the next administratively possible month. Absent a choice by the beneficiary, they will be assigned to an MCO using the auto assignment algorithm shown below. The beneficiary will be allowed 90 da ys to change plans and will then be locked in until the next open enrollment period, never to exceed 12 months. Regardless of which enrollment or auto assignment process is used, the head of household will be notified of all choices that need to be made, the timeframe for making these choices, and the consequence of not making a choice. To reduce large disparities and adverse risk between MCOs, the State uses a default assignment algorithm for auto-assignment of first time beneficiaries. The algorithm will give weighted preference to any new MCO, as well as MCOs with significantly lower enrollments. This is based on a formula developed by the C M S - P M - X X - X A T T A C H M E N T 3 . 1 - F D a t e : P a g e 1 8 OMB No.:0938-0933 State: Nevada _________________________________________________________ ______________________________ Citation Condition or Requirement ______________________________________________________________________________________________ No. 13-031 Approval Date: February 21, 2014 Effective Date: October 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 09-11 State. The State may also adjust the auto-assignment algorithm in consideration of the MCO's clinical performance measure results or other measurements. The algorithm is as follows: *Auto Assignment Algorithm Number of Plans in Geographic Service Area Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 2nd Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 3rd Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 4th Largest Plan 2 plans 34% 66% 3 plans 17% 33% 50% 4 plans 10% 10% 30% 50% * The function of the al gorithm is to ultimatel y achieve no more than a 10% differential in enrollment between all MCO co ntractors. Once the differential is achieved, use of this algorithm will be discontinued and head of households will be auto assigned on rotating basis. vi. Describe how the state will monitor any changes in the rate of default assignment. (Example: usage of the Medical Management Information System (MMIS), monthly reports generated by the enrollment broker) The State will monitor the auto-assignment rates on a monthly basis through a genera ted MMIS system report. 1932(a)(4) I.

Under the NCCW authority, beneficiaries are allowe d to choose from at least two care managers. This does not apply to the MCOs, which are only located in urban areas. ___This provision is not applicable to this 1932 State Plan Amendment. 4. ___The state limits enrollment into a single Health Insuring Organization (HIO), if and only if the HIO is one of the entities described in section 1932(a)(3)(C) of the Act; and the recipient has a choice of at least two primary care providers within the entity.

PCCM enrollment is locked-in for all beneficiaries with no open enrollment periods since there is only one PCCM; however, they will have the option to choose between a minimum of two care managers at least once every 12 months. 3. Place a check mark to affirm state compliance. _X _The state assures that beneficiar y requests for disenrollment (with and without cause) will be perm itted in accordance with 42 CFR 438.56(c). Subject to the limitations outlined in Section H.3.(v) of this State Plan, an enrolled beneficiary may request disenrollment from the MCO with or without cause during the first 90 days of enrollment. Enrollment is mandatory in the PCCM program and there is only one PCCM from which to choose. There are no time re strictions for disenrollment with cause for the MCOs or the PCCM. Circumstances for disenrollment with cause are: The MCO beneficiary moves out of the MCO service area.

The State defines \"estate\" as follows: \"ESTATE\" - means all real and personal property and other assets included in the estate of a deceased recipient of Medicaid and any other assets in or to wh ich he/she had an interest or legal title at the time of their death, to the extent of that interest or title. The term includes assets passing by reason of joint tenancy, tenants-in-common , life estate, survivorship, living trust, annuity, homestead or other arrangement. 2. The State uses the following notification procedures): a. Advance Notice Procedure 1) All Medicaid applicants are notified of the Medicaid Estate Recovery program at their initial application process and annual redeterminati on, via the Signature and Affirmation (2920-EM (9/01) which they read and sign. Along with the application or redetermination, the applicant is provided with \"Medicaid Estate Recovery Notification of Program Operation\" (form 6160) which is signed and dated by the eligibility worker to confirm that a copy was provided to the applicant. The applicant keeps a copy of this form and a copy is filed in the permanent section of the client's case file. b. Recovery Notification Procedures Immediately following case identification, a ll known heirs, survivors and designated representatives are notified of: 1) the State's interest in the decedent's estate and of the right to recovery, 2) the amount of Medicaid assistance paid, to date, on behalf of the decedent, 3) the priority of estate creditors as defined by Nevada State Law, and 4) the method through which an undue hardship waiver may be pursued. 3. The State defines undue hardship as severe financ ial duress or a significant compromise to an individual's health care or shelter needs. 4. Application for Undue Hardship Waiver - Any heir or survivor may seek an undue hardship waiver by submitting a written request for a waiver by completing an \"Application (Request) for a Hardship Waiver Regarding Recovery of Correctly Paid Medi caid Benefits\" form, within thirty (30) days of notification of the Division's intent to recover. Documentary evidence that supports the applicant's claim should be attached. The written decision of th e Administrator will be provided to the applicant 90-days from receipt of the request. TN No. 02-09 Approval Date: April 14, 2003 Effective Date: Supersedes TN No. 95-11 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.17-A Page 2 5. The State will waive enforcement of any estate rec overy claim when the requesting party is able to show, through convincing evidence, the state's pursuit of estate recovery subjects them to undue hardship. A claim for emotional hardship is not cons idered sufficient to warrant waiver approval. No waiver will be granted if the Division finds the undue hardship was created by estate planning methods by which the waiver applicant or deceased client dive sted, transferred or otherwise encumbered assets, in whole or part, to avoid estate recovery. In determining whether undue hardship exists, the following criteria will be used: a. The asset to be recovered is the sole income-producing asset of the applicant; or, b. The recovery of the assets would result in the applicant becoming eligible for governmental public assistance based on need and/or medical assistance programs; or, c. A doctor's written verification of a medical conditi on that compromises the applicant's ability to repay the Medicaid claim. 6. If an undue hardship waiver is requested and the State determines that none of the above conditions apply, full payment of the claim may be ordered, recovery may be temporarily waived, compromised, or modified. The following factors shall be consider ed individually or in combination when making a decision to temporarily waive, modify, or compromise estate recovery: a. The gross annual income, property and other assets of the applicant and their immediate family; b. The type and level of care provided by the applicant (caregiver) to the decedent and the extent to which the care delayed or prevented the institutionalization of the decedent; 1) The State uses the following process for determin ing if the applicants will be considered as caregivers when through clear evidence they substantiate: a) Maintained residency in the Medicaid r ecipient's home for at least two years immediately preceding the recipient's d eath or admission into a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded or other medical institutions; and b) Provided care for the Medicaid recipient which meets or exceeds published state standard established for Intermediate Care Level (ICL 1), which includes as necessary, assisting the individual with ambulatory needs, feeding, grooming, personal hygiene, oral hygiene, nail care, bathing toilet activities, skin care and medical needs. c. The applicant continuously resided with the deceden t for two years or more immediately prior to the decedent's death and continues to reside in the decedent's residence and the prior occupancy permitted the decedent to reside at home rather than in an institution; d. The estimated value of the real or personal property at issue. If the cost of recovering the asset(s) of the deceased Medicaid recipient is more than the value of the asset(s), it would not be cost effective to recover, and/or; e. The financial impact of recovery against immediate family members of the applicant. TN No. 02-09 Approval Date: April 14, 2003 Effective Date: Supersedes TN No. 95-11 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.17 A P a g e 3 f. Applicants who seek a recovery delay (i.e., te mporary waiver) will be given the opportunity to provide written details or complete an \"Application for a Hardship Waiver Regarding Recovery of Correctly Paid Medicaid Benefits\" form, within 30- days of notification of the Division's intent to recover. 7. The following collection methods may be utilized when recovery is temporarily waived, compromised, or modified: a. Reduction of recovery amount; b. Reasonable payment schedule based on the asset to be recovered; and/or c. Where not prohibited by law, imposition of a lien against the assets of the deceased Medicaid recipient. 1) Before imposition of a lien, the Division shall no tify all persons having an interest in the estate of the deceased Medicaid recipient and petition the appropriate district court for the imposition of a lien per NRS 422.29355. 2) If a lien is placed on an individual's home, adjustment or recovery will only be made when: a) there is no surviving spouse; b) there is no child under the age of 21; or c) there is no blind or disabled (as defined in Section 1614 of the Social Security Act) child of the Medicaid recipient. 3) The lien will become due and payable upon the sale, refinance, transfer or change in title to the real property; and /or escrow funding, but only when there is no surviving spouse, children under 21, blind or disabled children of the Medicaid recipient. Recovery is limited to the Medicaid recipient's interest in the prope rty at the time of claim payment not to exceed the Medicaid claim or the percentage of interest of the Medicaid recipient in the asset. 4) Upon payment of the claim, or need of the st atutory exemptions, the division will prepare a release of lien or subordinate the lien. This release will be provided to the appropriate entity; such as, an escrow company or the county recorder's office. 8. The following time frames are used by the State in considering the waiving of estate recoveries: a. Any beneficiary, heir or family member claiming en titlement to receive the assets of the deceased Medicaid recipient may apply for a hardship wa iver by submitting a written request for a waiver within 30-days of being notified of intent to recover to the Medicaid Estate Recovery unit. b. The Division may request additional information or documentation from the waiver applicant. If some or all of the additional information or doc umentation is not provided within 30 days of the request, the hardship waiver request will be consid ered solely on the basis of the information and documentation provided. TN No. 02-09 Approval Date: April 14, 2003 Effective Date: Supersedes TN No. 95-11 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.17 A P a g e 4 c. Within 90-days of receipt of the undue hardship waiver request, the Division Administrator OR his appointed representative, will issue a written decision granting or denying the applicant's request for an undue hardship waiver. 9. The State defines cost-effective as follows (incl ude methodology/thresholds used to determine cost effectiveness): a. Cost-effective recovery is accomplished when the amount recovered exceeds the administrative (direct or indirect) expense associated with obtaining the recovery such as, but not limited to , legal fees and expenses. b. Many of the estate recovery activities have been automated thereby minimizing correspondence costs. Individual case analysis and management is not require d until a ninety (90) day delinquency has occurred. c. Therefore, case costs would begin to accrue after this time. Costs such as, but not limited to, staff costs, document filing fees, legal costs, postage, copying, tr avel and indirect administrative costs would be considered. 10. The Division may elect not to recover a Medicaid Estate R ecovery claim when the State determines that it is not cost-effective to do so. a. Cost-effectiveness will be decided on a case-by-case basis. b. If the Medicaid claim is $100 or less or the value of the asset to be recovered is $100 or less, recovery may not be pursued. 11. Hearing and Appeal Procedures a. If the undue hardship waiver is denied, the decision ma y be appealed within 30 da ys through the appropriate district court (Administrative Procedure Act 233B.130). 12. Action to Enforce Recovery: a. Actions to enforce recovery of Medicaid Estate R ecovery claims are accomplished through legal means using, if necessary, the appropriate court of jurisdiction. Use of the court protects the due process right of all and guarantees safe protection of the law. b. NRS. 150.220; \"Priority of Creditors\" list the order in wh ich assets are to be distributed after death. Money owed to the Department of Human Resources as a result of benefits paid to the Me dicaid recipient is listed as Number 6 in order of payment. c.

State Assurances and Findings . The State assures that it has made the following findings: 1. 447.253(b)(1)(i) - The State pays for inpatient hospita l services through the use of rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated providers to provide serv ices in conformity with appl icable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards. 2. With respect to inpatient hospital services-- a. 447.253(b)(1)(ii)(B) - The methods and standards us ed to determine paym ent rates take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs. b. 447.253(b)(1)(ii)(B) - The State elects in its State Plan to cover inappropriate level of care services ( that is, services fu rnished to hospital inpatients wh o require a lower covered level of care such as skilled nursing services or intermediate care services) under conditions similar to those described in section 1861 (v)(1 )(G) of the Act. The methods and standards used to determine payment rates specify that the payments for this type of care must be made at rates lower than those for inpatient hospital level of care services, reflecting the level of care actually received, in a manner consiste nt with section 1861( v)(1)(G) of the Act. c. 447.253(b)(1)(ii)(C) - The payment rates are ade quate to assure that recipients have reasonable access, taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time, to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality. 3. 447.253(b)(2) - The proposed rate will not exceed the upper payment limits as specified in 42 CFR 447.272: a. 447.272(a) - Aggregate payments made to hospitals for inpatient services when considered separately, will not exceed the amount that can reasonably be estimated would have been paid for under Medicare Payment principles. b. 447.272(b) - Aggregate payments to State-operate d hospitals for inpati ent services when considered separately will not exceed the amount that can reasonably be estimated would have been paid for under Medicare payment principles.

Related Information 1. a. 447.255(a) - Inpatient hospital: Estimated average proposed payment rate as a result of this amendment: $1,067 Estimated payment rate in effect for the immediately preceding rate period: $1,067 Amount of change: 0/ Percent of change: 0/%. b. 447.255(a) - DSH: Estimated proposed payment per Medicaid day as a result of this amendment: $576.02 Estimated payment per Medicaid day for the im mediately preceding rate period: $576.02 Amount change: 0/ Nevada=s aggregate DSH payment for this year and the immediately preceding year is $73,560,000. The DSH program this year is based on uncompensated costs for the majority of the hospitals, and not on Medicaid utiliza tion. The amendment to the DSH methodology will have no effect on the payment per day. 2. 447.255(b) - The estimated short term and long term effect of the change in the estimated average rate on: a. The availability of services on a statew ide and geographic area basis: NONE b. The type of care furnished: NONE c. The extent of provider participation: NONE d. The degree to which costs are covered in hospita ls that serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs. The change in the disproportionate share program will restrict payment to those hospitals that specialize in providing mental he alth services to low income patients. Since payments to such specialized hospitals was minimal there is no indication that this change will limit provider participation, type of care provi ded or availability of services. In aggregate, none of the remaining hospitals will receive less and some will recei ve more as a result of the proposed change.

HOSPITALS UNDER PROSPECTIVE RATES Types of rates: Inpatient hospita l services, which have been aut horized for payment at the acute level by a quality improvement or ganization (QIO-like vendor), as specified in the contract between the QIO-like vendor and Nevada Me dicaid, are reimburse d by all-inclusive, prospective per diem rates by type of admission. The all-incl usive prospective rates cover routine and ancillary services furnished by the hospital, including dir ect patient care for professional services furnished to inpatients by hospital-staffed physicia ns and practitioners. All-inclusive per diem rates are develo ped for Maternity, Newborn, Neonatal, Rehabilitative/Specialty Hospital, Level I Trauma , Medical/Surgical, and Psychiatric/Substance Abuse Treatment admissions, as de scribed in Sections II, III, and IV. All-inclusive rates for selected Organ Transplants are described in Sec tion III. Administrative day rate development is covered in Section V. Critical Access Hospitals under Medicare retrospective cost reimbursements are desc ribed in Section VII. II. PROSPECTIVE RATE DEVELO PMENT (Prior to September 1, 2003) The primary goals of the inpatient hospital ra te methodology are: Ra tes should be based on actual, reasonable, and allowable hospital co sts, and the rate development method should comply with federal requirements. The prospectiv e rates are inclusive of all ancillary services required by patients. A. Basic data sources for tier rate development. 1. The most recently filed Hospital Health Care Complex Cost Report (HCFA 2552) was the basis for identifying allowable cost . Routine cost limits were not applied. 2. Paid claims and billing information were taken from the Nevada database for Medicaid claim payment history report fo r services provided during the period covered by the HCFA 2552.

Adjustments made to determine allowable cost. The following adjustments were made to each individual hospital's cost report: 1. An audit adjustment was applied to the total Medicaid cost for each hospital. The adjustment was determined by using an average for each hospital of the audit adjustment percentages for the three most recent years available. Adjustments for two years were used if three were not available. 2. Since the hospitals' cost report periods var y, all cost data was indexed to the same period, using the Medicare inflation fact or for non-prospective payment system (non-PPS) hospitals.

Maternity Rate Conversion An all-inclusive per diem rate is paid for obstetrical hospital admissions. The rate also covers related admissions such as false labor, undelivered OB, and miscarriages. Historical Medicaid data for the Cale ndar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2002, has been extracted showing Medi caid Maternity admissions and Maternity patient days by tier. Projected Maternity payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Maternity admissions per tier times the current tier rate. Total projected Maternity payments are the sum of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for Maternity has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Maternity Payments ------------------ ------------------ ----------------- ------ = Maternity Per CY2002 Historical Maternity Patie nt Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the maternity per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the maternity per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the maternity per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 34% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospitals for obstetric services. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as direct ed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Th ere will be no cost settlement.

Projected Newborn payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Newborn admissions per tier times the current tier rate . Total projected New born payments are the sum of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for Newborn has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Newborn Payments ------------------ ------------------ ----------------- ------ = Newborn Per CY2002 Historical Newborn Patient Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the newborn per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the newbor n per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the newborn per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 34% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospital routine services related to the care of a newborn. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Ther e will be no cost settlement.

Neonatal Intensive Care Rate Calculation For admissions prior to September 8, 2008: A separate rate is used for patients admitted to Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units. The current rate was developed from historical costs pursuant to Section II, Prospective Rate Development. The calculated cost per day of each neonatal unit was arrayed from highest to lowest. The prospective per diem rate was then calculated at the 55th percentile and indexed. For admissions on or after September 8, 2008: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3.

Rehabilitative and Specialty Hospital Rate Calculation A few Nevada hospitals are li censed to provide acute care in single diagnostic category. Rehabilitative and specialty hospital patients generally have hospital stays of ninety or more days. The length of stay does not si gnificantly influence the cost per day. To the extent these hospitals participate in Medicaid, they are reimbursed as follows: 1. Inpatient hospital servic es which have been certified for payment at the acute level by a QIO-like vendor are reimbursed an all-inclusive per diem rate at the lowest rate acceptable to both parties. In establishing the lowest rate acceptable to both parties, Nevada Medicaid re views cost information filed by the provider, amounts paid by ot her insurers and national literature on comparable costs for similar services. The rate ca nnot exceed the reasonable and customary charges of the facility for similar services.

Medical/Surgical Rate Development The current tier rate will be paid for Medical/Surgical payments made on or prior to August 31, 2003. Beginning September 1, 2003, an al l-inclusive per diem rate will be paid for general hospital admission, not meeting the criteria of patient s described in Parts B. - D. and F. of this Section or Section IV. Historical Medicaid data for the Cale ndar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2002, has been extracted showing Medicaid Medical/S urgical admissions and Medical/Surgical patient days by tier. Projected Medical/Surgica l payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Medical/Surgical admissions per tier tim es the current tier rate. Total projected Medical/Surgical payments are the su m of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for the Medica l/Surgical category has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Medical/Surgical Payments ------------------ --------------- --------------- ----------- = Me dical/Surgical Per CY2002 Historical Medical/Surgical Patient Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the medi cal/surgical per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the medical/surgical per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the medical/surgery per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 22% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospital services for medical/surgery procedures. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Ther e will be no cost settlement.

PSYCHIATRIC/SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT RATE DEVELOPMENT Psychiatric/substance abuse treatment admissions can vary from short stays to several weeks. The length of stay does not significantly impact the cost per day. Therefore, a per diem rate is a more appropriate method to pay acute care hos pitals providing this type of service. 1. Psychiatric/substance abuse treatment costs for each hospital are divided by the number of psychiatric/substa nce abuse treatment days to determine a cost per day. The Medicaid related costs of fr eestanding psychiatric hospitals are determined using the steps in Section II, Parts A and B, then di viding their Medicaid costs by their total Medicaid days to determine the cost per day. The calculated cost per day of each general acute care hospital a nd freestanding psychiatric hospital is arrayed from highest to lowest. The prospective per di em rate is then calculated at the 55 th percentile and indexed in accordance with Section II, Part E of this plan. a. These rates do not apply to faciliti es accredited as Residential Treatment Centers by the Joint Commission on A ccreditation of Health Organizations (JCAHO). 2. State-operated Inpatient Psychiatric Hospitals are reimbursed under Medicare principles of retrospective reimbursement described in 42 CFR 413 and further specified in CMS Publication 15. a. In no case may payment exceed audited allowable costs. b. Interim rates will be base d upon the most recent aud ited cost reports for the current state fiscal year. The interim rate for the initial year of operation will be based upon cost and utilization projections. c. Each facility is paid an interim rate subject to settlement in accordance with paragraph 2., 2.a. and 2.b. above.

ADMINISTRATIVE DAY RATE DEVELOPMENT For those patients who remain in an acute care hospital awaiting admittance to a long-term care facility, an administrative day rate is used. Services so reimbursed are call \"administrative days.\" The administrative rate is calcula ted each year. It is based on the most recent statewide weighted average payment rate for skilled and intermedia te levels of care plus a 100% factor. Under certain circumstances, up to an additional 300% is added for a patient with exceptional or abnormal needs; for example, pa tients in need of is olation, ventilation dependency, or total parental nutrition. The administrative rate, plus the maximum 300% factor, is lower than the hospital rate as described in Part II of the State Plan. VI. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTERS Nevada Medicaid will only pay for stays in faci lities accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation Health Organizati ons (JCAHO) as Residential Tr eatment Centers (RTCs). All stays must be pre-approved by the QIO-like vendor . These services will be reimbursed at the lowest rate acceptable to both parties. In estab lishing the lowest rate acceptable to both parties, Nevada Medicaid reviews cost information file d by the RTC, amounts paid by other insurers, and national literature on costs for RTCs. Each facility will have a negotiated rate established for each general level of service. If a placement is being propos ed which is different from the general level of care offered by the facility, a rate will be negotiated after considering the average cost per day of the facility and th e additional will be reviewed based upon cost information received on or prior July 1 of th e year of review.

HOSPITALS UNDER MEDICAID RETROS PECTIVE COST REIMBURSEMENT (CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS) A few Nevada hospitals have been designated by Medica re as Critical Access Hospitals. To the extent these hospitals participate in Medicai d, they are reimburs ed under Medicare's retrospective cost reimbursement, as follows: A. Inpatient hospital services which have been certified for payment at the acute level by the QIO-like vendor, as specified in the contra ct between the QIO-like vendor and Nevada Medicaid, upon final settlement are reimburse d allowable costs und er hospital-specific retrospective Medicare princi ples of reimbursement in accordance with 42 CFR 413 and further described in CMS Publications 15-I and 15-II. 1. Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) will use the CMS-2552-96 cost report form and apply Medicare cost principles and cost apportionment methodology. 2. Critical Access Hospitals will file this cost report with the state annually within five (5) months of their respective fiscal year end. 3. In general, underpayments will be paid to the provider in a lump sum upon discovery and overpayments will either be recouped pr omptly or a negative balance set up for the provider. However, other solutions accep table to both parties may be substituted. 4. The federal share of any overpayment is refunded to the fede ral government in accordance with 42 CFR 433 Subpart F. B. On an interim basis, each hospital is paid fo r certified acute care at the Provider specific interim Medicaid inpatient per diem rate as follows: 1. Effective July 1, 2009, the base interim rate for Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) will be the FY2007 Total Medicare inpatient per diem rate. This interim rate is defined as total Medicare in-patient cost divided by to tal Medicare in-patie nt days, and applies to the revenue codes billed by genera l acute hospitals that fall under the Medical/Surgery level of service category for inpatient services. 2. The CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate will be updated annually for each provider on either January 1st or July 1st, depending upon the facilities' fiscal year as re ported on the Medicare/Medicaid cost report. TN No. 09-005 Approval Date: September 8, 2009 Effective Date: July 1, 2009 Supersedes TN No. 03-02 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 15a 3. The updated CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate will be calculated by dividing the total Title XIX program inpatient costs by the total program inpatient days as reported in the immediate prior years' Me dicare/Medicaid cost report as filed. 4. If Title XIX data reported in the immediate prior years' Medicare/Medicaid cost report is not sufficient to calculate the ad justed CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate, the CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate will default to the Medical/Surgery rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same service. This applies only to Critical Access Hospitals that have an existing CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate for the prior year. 5. Maternity, newborn and administrative days will be reimbursed at the rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same in-patient services. 6. Critical Access Hospitals that do not have a CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate for the prior year based on the methodology in Pa ragraph VII.B.3, will be assigned either the prior years' Total Medicare inpatient per diem rate if available or the rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same Medical/Surgery level of services until such time as the CAH Medical/Surgery interim rate can be updated according to the methodology detailed in Paragraphs VII.B.2 and VII.B.3. Facilities accredited as Residential Treat ment Centers by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organization (JCAHO ) are not considered specialty or general acute hospitals. Residential Treatment Centers are paid in accordance with paragraph VI above.

HOSPITALS SERVING LOW-INCOME PATIENTS DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS (DSH) A. Eligibility - A Nevada hospital will qualify for DSH payment if it meets the conditions of either paragraph 1 or 2. 1. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph c, a Nevada hospital will be deemed to qualify for DSH payment if it meets either of the conditions under subparagraphs a or b. The data used to determine eligibility is from the prior State Fiscal Year ending June 30th. For example, eligibility for SFY 14 DSH is done in the third quarter of SFY 13, using data from SFY 12. a. A hospital's Medicaid inpatient utilization rate (MIUR) is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for hospitals receiving Medicaid payment in the State. i. MIUR is the total number of inpatient days of Medicaid eligible patients, including patients who receive their Medicaid benefits through a health maintenance organization, divided by the total number of inpatient days of all patients during a fiscal year. b. The hospital's low income utilization rate (LIUR) is at least 25%. LIUR is the sum (expressed as a percentage) of the fractions, calculated as follows: i. Total Medicaid patient revenues paid to the hospital, plus the amount of the cash subsidies for patient service received directly from State and local governments in the cost reporting period, divided by the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the same cost reporting period; and, ii. The total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services attributable to charity care (care provided to individuals who have no source of payment, third-party or personal resources) in a cost reporting period, less the portion of any cash subsidies received directly from the state or local government for inpatient hospital services, divided by the total amount of hospital charges for inpatient services in the hospital in the same period. The total inpatient hospital charges attributed to charity care shall not include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for Medicaid assistance under an approved Medicaid State plan), that is, reductions in charges given to other third party payors, such as HMOs, Medicare, or Blue Cross Blue Shield. c. A hospital must: i. have a MIUR of not less than one percent; TN No. 13-011 Approval Date: July 18, 2013 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 10-008 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 22 ii. have at least two (2) obstetrician s with staff privileges at the hospital who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals entitled to such serv ices under State Medicaid plan. In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (that is, an area outside of a Metropolitan Statis tical Area, as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget) the term \"obstetrician\" includes any physicia n with staff privileges at the hospital to perform non-emergenc y obstetric procedures. This does not apply to a hospital in which: (a) the inpatients are predomin antly individuals under 18 years of age; or (b) non-emergency obstetric services were not offered as of December 22, 1987. iii. not be an institution for mental disease or other mental health facility subject to the limitation on DSH expenditures under Section 4721 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 2. Subject to the provisions of subparagr aph 1c above, a hospital will qualify for DSH payments if it is: a. a public hospital (i.e., hospital owned or operated by a Nevada hospital district, county or other unit of local government); or b. in Nevada counties which do not ha ve a public hospital, the private hospital which provided the greatest number of Medicaid inpatient days in the previous year; or c. a private hospital - loca ted in a Nevada county which has a public hospital, if the public ho spital has a MIUR great er than the average for all the hospitals receiving Medicaid payment in the State.

Distribution Pools: Hospitals qualified under paragraph 'A' above will be grouped into distribution pools on the following basis: 1. Distribution pools are established as follows: a) All public hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 700,000 or more, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 87.97% of the total computable DSH allotment for the State Fiscal Year. b) All private hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 700,000 or more, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 1.69% of the total computable DSH allotment for the State Fiscal Year. c) All private hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 5.86% of the total computable DSH allotment for the State Fiscal Year. d) All public hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is less than 100,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 1.34% of the total computable DSH allotment for the State Fiscal Year. e) All private hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is less than 100,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 3.14% of the total computable DSH allotment for the State Fiscal Year. f) Note: There is no public hospital in counties whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000. 2. The total amount distributed to an individual hospital may not, under any circumstance, exceed the total uncompensated care costs (DSH limit) for that facility. 3. Total annual uncompensated care costs equal the cost of providing services to Medicaid inpatients, Medicaid outpatients a nd uninsured patients, less the sum of: Regular Medicaid FFS rate payments (excluding DSH payments); Medicaid managed care organization payments; Supplemental/enhanced Medicaid payments; Uninsured revenues; and Federal section 1011 payments for uncompensated services to eligible aliens with no source of coverage. 4. An \"uninsured patient\" is defined as an individual without health insurance TN No. 13-011 Approval Date: July 18, 2013 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 10-008 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 24 or other source of third party coverage (except coverage from State or local programs based on indigency). A system mu st be maintained by the hospitals to report revenues on Medicaid and unins ured patient accounts to determine uncompensated care cost consistent with Section 1923 (g ) of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations at 42 CFR 447 Subpart E. Costs for Medicaid and uninsured patients will be based upon the methodology used in the HCFA 2552 report. Revenue will be deducted from cost. The total costs on the report will be subject to an independent audit. The HC FA 2552 report must be submitted within six months of the hospital's fiscal year end. C. Calculation of Hospital DSH Payments 1. Using the same period of data as outlined on subparagraph A 1, the Division will calculate the DSH payments for each hospital as follows: a. 50% of the pool amount will be distributed based on the percent to total of the uncompensated care percentage of the hospitals within the pool. i. Uncompensated Care Percentage is the uncompensated care cost of the hospital divided by the net patient revenues of the hospital, as reported on the Medicare Cost Report, which is required to be filed with the State. (a) Net patient revenues are total patient revenues less contracted allowances and discounts. This comes from Medicare cost report, Worksheet G-3 line 3, less any net patient revenue from non-hospital inpatient and non- hospital outpatient services. b. The remaining 50% of the pool amo unt will be distributed based on the percent to total of the uncompensated care cost of the hospitals within the pool. 2. The DSH payments will be made monthly to the eligible hospitals. Payments will be based on the State Fiscal Year. DSH payment will in no instance exceed a hospital's DSH limit. If any hospital's calculated DSH payment exceeds its DSH limit, the excess will be redistributed to the remaining hospitals within the pool using the same formula above. D. Adjusting DSH payments based on DSH Independent Certified Audit results 1. The Division will audit each hospital for eac h year in which the hospital received a disproportionate share payment pursuant to NRS, NAC and in accordance with the provisions of Title XIX of the Social S ecurity Act, 42 et seq. Approval Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 10-008 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 25 2. After conducting an audit, if a hospital's eligib ility changes or its initial DSH payment exceeded its audited DSH limit, the Division will recalculate the following for all hospitals in the affected pool: a. Audited uncompensated care costs b. Audited uncompensated care percentages c. Final DSH payment amounts using the same method ology as defined in paragraph C. Final DSH payment amounts are calcul ated using the audited amounts in subparagraph D 2a and b. d. The amount of monies available for re distribution within each pool based on a comparison of each hosp ital's final DSH payment amount and the initial DSH payment received by each hospital in the pool. 3. For all hospitals in the affected pool(s ), the Division will re concile each hospital's initial DSH payment to its final DSH paymen t as calculated in paragraph D 2. Any hospital whose initial DSH payment is greate r than the final DSH payment will return the difference to the Division, and any hosp ital whose initial DS H payment is less than the final DSH payment will be paid the difference. Th e final DSH payment amount for an individual hospital, as calcul ated in paragraph D 2 and in accordance with the methodology in paragraph C, will in no in stance exceed that hospital's audited DSH limit. 4. If each hospital within a pool of hospitals has re ceived the maximum amount of disproportionate share payments allowable by federal and state statutes and regulations, the Division will use th e money returned to pay additional disproportionate share payments as follow s in the method described in paragraph C above: a. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of pool A, to hospitals in pool B; b. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of pool B, to hospitals in pool C; c. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of pool C, to hospitals in pool D; d. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of pool D, to hospitals in pool E; or e. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of pool E, to hospitals in pool A.

HOSPITALS OUT OF STATE Elective out-of-state admissions require prior aut horization by Nevada Medicaid's Peer Review Organization, which must verify medical servi ces required by Medicaid-eligible or pending- eligible clients are not available in Nevada. The out-of-state payment rate for inpatient care is based on one of the following criteria, wh ether emergency or elective in nature. A. For California hospitals, the following rates will be paid: 1. If the hospital has no signed contract with the State of California to provide Medi- Cal services, the California interim reimbursement Medi-Cal rate. 2. If the hospital has a signed contract with the State of California to provide Medi- Cal services, the Medi-Cal contract rate is paid. If the contract rate is not made available to Nevada Medicaid, the Califor nia interim Medi-Cal rate is paid. B. For Utah hospitals the payment rate is 45 percent of billed charges. C. For all other states' hospitals, the payment rate will be either the Nevada Medicaid prospective rate or the Medicaid rate for the state in which the hospital is located, but not more than billed charges. To receive the Me dicaid rate for the state in which the hospital is located, the hospital must attach documentation to the UB -92 billing claim, produced and generated by that state's Medicaid program, verifying the state's payment rate to that hospital. D. All other states' freestanding psychiatric/s ubstance abuse hospitals are reimbursed 70 percent of billed charges. E. For Medicare crossover claims, the payment will be the lower of the Medicare deductible amount or the difference between the Medi care payment and the Nevada Medicaid prospective payment for that service. F. For services that cannot be provided by a provider that accepts payments under (A) through (E), the State will maintain a list of other qualified out-of-sta te providers and will negotiate competitive rates that will not exceed the provider's customary charge.

DIRECT GRADUATE MEDI CAL EDUCATION PAYMENTS This section of the state plan contains the pr ovisions for making additional Medicaid payments to recognize the additional dir ect costs incurred by non-state gove rnment owned hospitals with approved graduate medical education programs. A. Qualifying Hospitals: Non-state government owned hospitals that participate in the Medicaid program are eligible for additional reimbursement related to the provision of Dir ect Graduate Medical Education (GME) activities. To qualify fo r these additional Medicaid payments, the hospital must also be eligible to receive GME payments from the Medicare program under provision of 42 C.F.R. 413.75. B. Direct Graduate Medica l Education Definitions: (i) Base-year per resident amount - is the Medi caid allowable inpatie nt direct graduate medical education cost as reported on CMS form 2552, Hospital Cost Report; worksheet B, Part I, line 22, column 22 and line 23, column 23, divided by the un-weighted FTE residents from worksheet S- 3; Part I; line 12 and line 14, column 7 of the hospital cost re port ending in 6/30/2008. (ii) Current Number of FTE Re sidents - means the number of full-time-equivalent interns, residents, or fellow who partic ipate in an approved medical residency program, including programs in osteopat hy, dentistry, and podiat ry, as required in order to become certified by the appropria te specialty board reported on CMS form 2552, Hospital Cost Report ; worksheet S-3: Part I; line 12 and line 14, column 7. (iii) Medicaid Patient Load - is the ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total hospital inpatient days. This ratio is determined by the following; Medicaid inpatient days as reported on CMS form 2552, Hospital Cost Report ; worksheet S-3; Part I; lines 2, 2.01, 12 and 14; column 5 is divided by th e hospital's total i npatient days, as reported on worksheet S-3; Part I; lines 12 and 14; column 6. Medicaid inpatient days and total inpatient da ys included inpatient nursery days and managed care days.

Methodology for Determining Direct GME Payments: The hospitals that qualify for GME payments will have their hospi tal specific payment amount determined as follows: (i) The base-year per resident amount is mu ltiplied by the actual regulation market basket change and Medicare payment updated used for Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems (IPPS) as publ ished in the \"Federal Register. The index updates reflect payment increases before budget neutrality; (ii) The results in (i) are multiplied by the current number of FTE residents; (iii) The results in (ii) are multiplied by the Medicaid patient load which results in the total direct GME payment for the hospitals. D. Payments of Direct GME: (i) The current number of FTE residents and th e Medicaid patient lo ad will be updated annually using data from the most recen t Medicare/Medicaid hospital cost report (CMS form 2552) submitted to Me dicare by each qua lifying hospital; (ii) Beginning January 2, 2010, the state will calculate the total direct GME reimbursement for qualifying hospitals us ing the methodology in section C. above. The state will determine the annual GME amount payable to qualifying hospitals prospectively for period that will begin each July 1. On a quarterly basis, qualifying hospital will receive a GME payment equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the annually determined GME amount. A quarterly payment will be made in each calendar quarter during th e state's fiscal year.

FEDERAL UPPER PAYMENT LIMIT In order to preserve access to inpatient hospital services for needy individuals in the state of Nevada, the state's Medicaid hospital reimburseme nt system shall provide for supplemental payments to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals and private hospitals. Supplemental payments shall be made to no n-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals effective for servic es provided on after January 1, 2002. Supplemental payments shall be made to private hospitals effective fo r services provided on or after January 2, 2010. These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual basis and paid to qualifying hospitals on a quarterly basis. The supplementa l payments to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals shall not exceed, when a ggregated with other payments made to non- state, governmentally owned or operated hospi tals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals, except that payments for the period prior to May 14, 2002, such payments shall not exceed 150% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medi care payment principles for non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals. The supplemental payments to private hospitals shall not exceed, when aggregated with other pa yments made to private hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for private hospitals. The upper payment limit will be determined on an annual basis. In general, this approach identifies the upper limit through the application of Medicare's prospective payment system, which is a diagnosis related group (DRG) payment system. The upper limit computes, for each hospital, the Medicare DRG payment amount for each Medicaid discharge by determining a Medicare equivalent case mix in dex based on Medicaid di scharges. This upper limit also uses a payment per discharge calcul ation of the amount of Medicare pass-through and add-on reimbursement including but not limited to outlier, dire ct graduate medical education, organ acquisition, routine and anc illary pass-through, IME, DSH, and capital payments. The Medicare pass- through and add-on reimbursemen t are identified from the Medicare cost report and adjusted for Medica id where applicable. The hospital's Medicare payment per discharge, which includes th e DRG and the pass-through/add on amounts, are applied to the number of Medicaid discharges. The latest available information is used for Medicare DRG, Medicare pass-through and a dd-on payments, Medicare discharges, and Medicaid discharges. Inflation factors are accordingly applied to determine an individual hospital's Medicare payment for the UPL pe riod. The sum of each hospital's estimated Medicare payment for Medicaid discharges is the aggregate upper payment limit for the hospital class.

Identify all non-state government owne d or operated acute care hospitals. 2. For each facility identified in step #1, compute total Medica id fee-for-service inpatient hospital payments using latest availabl e data projected to the current period. 3. For each facility, calculate the difference betwee n payments identified in step #2, and the hospital's Medicare UPL. This difference is the total maximum disbursement available under this section of the state plan. These calculations will be set on a prospect ive basis and will not be retroactively adjusted to previous fiscal years. The state shall determine the annual s upplemental amount payable to hospitals prospectively for period that will begin each July 1. On a quarterly basis, hospitals will receive a supplemental payment equal to tw enty-five percent (25% ) of the annually determined supplemental amount. A quarterly payment will be made in each calendar quarter during the state's fiscal year. The state shall determine the amount of supplemental payments to each faci lity using the following criteria: 1. Total supplemental payments under this section of the state plan will not exceed the difference between Medicaid payments and the Medicare UPL calculated in step #3 above. 2. Facilities participating in the supplemen tal payment program will be identified. 3. Total supplemental payments will be apportioned to public hospitals participating in the supplemental payment program using each hospita l's participation percentage. This percentage is calculated by dividing each supplemental payment hospital's Medicaid days by the total Medicaid days for all supplemental payment hospitals. 4. Medicaid days for each supplemental paym ent hospital shall be identified using the most recent Medicare cost report data available at the time the calculation are prepared. 5. Once these participation percentages are determined they will be final and not subject to recalculation, except when errors are found in the calculations. The state will not recalculate the percentages following receipt of more accurate data, such as a more current or a udited Medicare cost report.

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMEN T FOR PRIVATE HOSPITALS In order to preserve access to inpatient hos pital services for needy individuals in the state of Nevada, effective for services provi ded on or after January 2, 2010, the state's Medicaid hospital reimbursement system sh all provide for supplemental payments to private hospitals affiliated w ith a state or unit of local government in Nevada through a Low Income and Needy Care Collaboration Agreement (Affiliated Private Hospitals). A Low Income and Needy Care Collaboration Agreement is defined as an agreement between a hospital and a state or unit of lo cal government to collaborate for purposes of providing healthcare services to low income and needy patients. These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual ba sis and paid to qualifying hospitals on a quarterly basis. The supplemental payments are payments for Medicaid fee-for-service inpatient hospital service. The supplemental payments shall not exceed, when aggregated with other payments made to private hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services unde r Medicare payment principles for private hospitals. The state will determine the payments to be made under this secti on of the plan using the following methodology: 1. Identify all Nevada priv ate hospitals. Non-state gove rnment owned or operated acute care hospitals and state owne d hospitals do not qualify under this methodology. 2. For those facilities identified in st ep #1, compute the Medicare UPL according to the methodology set out on Page 32 above. 3. The amount computed in step #2, less the Medicaid fee-for- service inpatient hospital payments to those facilities iden tified in step #1, is the total maximum disbursement available under th is section of the state plan in each fiscal year. If the payments under this section of the plan exceed this total maximum disbursement, the state will calculate the percentage by which the Medicare UPL is exceeded and reduce payments to all hospitals under this section of the state plan by the same percentage. The Medicaid director shall then determine the amount of supplemental payments to each facility using the following criteria. 1. Total supplemental payments under this sec tion of the state plan will not exceed the difference between Medicaid payments and the Medicare UPL calculated in Step #3 above. 2. Facilities participating in the supplemental payment program will be identified. All Affiliated Private Hospitals are eligib le to participate in the supplemental payment program.

Each Affiliated Private Hospital will r eceive quarterly supplemental payments. The annual supplemental payments in any fiscal year will be the lesser of: a) The difference between the hospital's Medicaid inpatient billed charges and Medicaid payments the hospital r eceives for services processed for fee-for-service Medicaid recipients during the fiscal year. b) For hospitals participating in the Nevada Medicaid DSH program, the difference between the hospital's tota l uncompensated costs (as defined in Section VIII) and the hospital's Medicaid DSH payments during the fiscal year.

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (PA) Prior Authorizations (PAs) will be screened for PPC codes and reviewed by the fiscal agent's medical review staff, which will make determinations fo r denials of payment for continued stay requests and/or level of care increases if the request appears to be related to a PPC. Payment denial does not consider medical necessity. Providers can appeal a PPC denial utilizing the exis ting appeals process. RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW Prior Authorization A provider who caused a PPC may be discovered in the process of reviewing a PA request from a second provider from whom the patient seeks treatment. If it is determined in the PA screening that a provider other than the provide r requesting the PA may be responsible for causing a PPC, a retrospective review of claims of the provide r possibly causing the PPC will be done. Payments associated with treating the PPC will be recovered, from the original provider, if those increases in payments can be reasonably isolated to the PPC event. Claims Review Under NRS 449.485 and R151-8 the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy and University of Nevada Las Vega s (UNLV) Center for Health In formation and Analysis (CHIA) collects and maintains billing record fields for Ne vada hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. This data set captures the Present on Admission (P OA) indicator for the UB- 04 claims for principal and each secondary (other) diagnosis field. Claims da ta with dates of service on or after July 1, 2012 will be reviewed and those fitting the criteria for PPCs will be identified. Providers will be supplied information identifying claims with the potential PPCs and will be given 30 days to review and respond to any discrepancies. Provider-confirme d PPCs will be subject to payment adjustment. Payment Adjustment For per diem payments, the number of covered da ys shall be reduced by the number of days associated with any PPC not present on admission. Nevada will use nationally accepted standards to determine the number of days attr ibutable to the diagnosis absent the PPC and the incremental number of days attributable to the PPC. Reimbursement may also be reduced for level of care changes attributable to a PPC.

Federally Qualified Health Centers (F QHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) FQHC and RHC reimbursement will adhere to section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act as amended by Section 702 of the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA). The reasonable cost-based reimbursement requirements fo r FQHC/RHC services previously described at paragraph (13) (C) are repealed and instead a Prospective Payment System (PPS) consistent with paragraph (15) payment described in section 1902(aa) of the Act for FQHCs/RHCs will be implemented. The Nevada Medicaid Prospective Payment System (PPS) is to take effect on January 1, 2001. Prospective Payment System (PPS) Re imbursement for Existing Facilities Beginning January 1, 2001 the State will pay curr ent FQHCs/RHCs (inclu ding \"FQHC look alike clinics\") based on a PPS. The baseline for a PPS will be set at 100 percent of the average of an FQHC/RHC per visit rate based on the reported reasonable and allowable costs of providing Medicaid-covered services during the FQHC/RHC fiscal years 1999 and 2000, adjusted to take into account any reported increase (or decrease) in the scope of services furnished during FY 2001 by the FQHC/RHC (calculating the payment amount on a per visit basis). Medicaid-covered services that are considered to be FQHC/RHC services are those services that were identified and approved to be provided by the facility as it applies to HRSA in order to be deemed as an FQHC/RHC facility. Beginning in Federal fiscal year 2002, and for each fiscal year thereafter, each FQHC/RHC is entitled to the payment amount (on a per visit basis) to which the center or clinic was entitled under the Act in the previous year, increased each October 1 st (FFY) by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for primary care services as defined in Section 1842 (i) (4) of the Social Security Act, and adjusted to take into account any reported increase (or decrease) in the scope of services furnished by the FQHC/RHC during that fiscal year. Prospective Payment System (PPS) Reimbursement for New Facilities Newly qualified FQHCs/RHCs after Federal fiscal year 2000 will have initial payments (interim rate) established either by reference to payments to one or more other clinics in the same or adjacent areas with similar caseloads and/or similar scope of services or based on an average of rates for other FQHC/RHC clinics throughout the State. Once their average per visit reasonable costs of providing Medicaid-covered services based on their first full year of operation can be determined, the initial payments of the FQHC/RHC will be cost settled and any over or under payments will be determined and the PPS rate will then be established based on act ual cost to provide those services for their first full year. The per visit PPS rate will then be adjusted annually every October 1st beginning at the next federal fiscal year by the percentage change in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for primary care services as defined in Section 1842 (i) (4) of th e Social Security Act, for that calendar year as published in the Federal Register, adjusted to take into account any reported change in scope of services, reported and requested during that year. All required documentation of actual costs for the first full year of providing services must be furnished to DHCFP no later than six (6) months after completion of the first full year of services. If the required documentation is not received within six (6) months after the completion of a full year of services, the annual MEI adjustments will be suspended until such time as the documentation is received and an actual PPS rate is determined. TN No. 13-017 Approval Date: January 30, 2014 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 10-007 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-B Page 1 (Continued p.1) Rebasing: Baseline PPS rates will not be subject to rebasing after their initial computation unless authorized by congress. The actual costs related to any reported change in scope of services will be calculated (based on a full year of providing those services) and an adjustment to the baseline PPS rate will be made. Alternative Payment Methodology (APM) Reimbursement For the period beginning January 1, 2001 and ending September 30, 2001, and for any fiscal year beginning with FY 2002, a State may, in reimbursing an FQHC/RHC for services furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries, use a methodology other th an the Medicaid PPS, but only if the following statutory requirements are met. First, the APM must be agreed to by the State and by each individual FQHC/RHC to which the State wishes to apply the methodology. Second, the methodology must result in a payment to the center or clinic that is a least equal to the amount to which the center or clinic is entitled under the Medicaid PPS. Third, the methodology must be described in the approved State plan. Effective October 1st (FFY) of each year after an APM rate has been established, for services furnished on or after that date, DHCFP will adjust the APM rate by the percentage increase in the MEI applicable to primary care services as published in the Federal Register for that calendar year, which will account for basic cost increases associated with providing such services. Change in Scope of Services PPS/APM rates may be adjusted to take into account any requested, documented and approved increase (or decrease) in the scope of services furn ished by the FQHC/RHC in any given fiscal year. The FQHC/RHC must submit a written request to the Division within 60 days of the effective date of those changes in order for the rate adjustment to be retroactive to the date of the Change in Scope of Services. If a written request is not received within 60 days of those changes, the effective date for a rate adjustment will be the date the written request for a Change in Scope of Services was received by DHCFP. Documentation and notification to support an increase or decrease in the scope of services is the responsibility of the provider. An FQHC/RHC requesting a rate adjustment for changes in scope of services must submit data/documentation/schedules that substantiate the changes in scope and the related adjustment of reasonable costs following Medicare principals of reimbursement. An interim rate will be determined using the first three months of actual cost data available from the provider. After a full year of providing the services related to the change in scope, an analysis will be performed on the actual costs for a full year of service and an adjustment will be made to the PPS/APM. Adjustments to the PPS/ APM rate for qualified/approved changes in scope will be based on Medicare Cost Reimbursement methodology, allocating costs related to patient care based upon a providers audited and approved charges for the change in scope services. The PPS/APM rate adjustment will then be determined by dividing the Medicaid allocated costs by the number of Medicaid visits for the given time period. TN No. 13-017 Approval Date: January 30, 2014 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-B Page 1 (Continued p.2) A Change in Scope of Services has been defined as a change in the type, intensity, duration and/or amount of covered Medicaid services (covered under the Medicaid State Plan and approved by CMS) that meet the definition of FQHC/RHC services as defined in section 1905 (a) (2) (B) and (C) of the Social Security Act. General increases or decreases in costs associated with programs that were already a part of an established PPS/APM ra te do NOT constitute a Change in Scope unless all of the following requirements are met: The change in the scope of services is a change in the type, intensity, duration, or amount of services, or any combination thereof as defined in section 1905 (a) (2) (B) and (C) of the Social Security Act. The cost is allowable under Medicare reasonable cost principals set forth in 42CFR Part 413. The net change in the FQHC/RHC's per visit ra te must equal or exceed 4% for the affected FQHC/RHC site. For FQHC/RHC's that filed co nsolidated cost reports for multiple sites to establish the initial Prospective Payment reimbur sement rate (PPS), the 4% threshold will be applied to the average per visit rate of all sites for the purposes of calculating the cost associated with a scope of service change. \"Net change\" means the per visit rate change attributable to the cumulative effect of all incr eases and decreases for a particular fiscal year. A Change in Scope of Services includes any of the following: A change in the types of services offered, i.e., the addition of dental services, may qualify as a Change in Scope which may warrant an adjustment to the PPS/APM rate. A change in intensity/duration or character of services offered by an FQHC/RHC attributable to changes in the types of patients served may qualify, such as services to patients with HIV/AIDS or other chronic diseases and othe r special populations requiring more intensive and frequent care. A change in the magnitude, intensity or character of currently offered services, demonstrated and documented by an increase or decrease in the patient volume of certain high risk populations that require more intensive and frequent care, which may reasonably be expected to span at least one year may qualify. A change in the type, intensity, duration or amount of service caused by changes in technology and medical practice used may qualify. Definition of a \"Visit\"/\"Encounter\" A \"visit\" or an \"encounter\" for the purposes of reimbursing FQHC/RHC services is defined as face- to-face contact with one or more qualified health professionals and multiple contacts with the same health professional that take place on the same da y with the same patient. A single payment will be made for each \"visit\" or an \"encounter\" regardless of the type of service.

However, if an FQHC/RHC's existing PPS/APM rate is sufficient to co ver its overall costs, including those associated with the extraordinary circumstances, other payment adjust ment is not warranted. The FQHC/RHC must show that its PPS/APM rate is not sufficient to cover the costs a ssociated with the extraordinary circumstance. The adjusted rate will only apply to the extent, and only for the period of time, that the additional costs for the event are reimbursable under federal Medicaid law and regulations governing claims for federal financia l participation (FMAP). DHCFP will work with the provider to gather the appropriate data at the time the in cident occurs and a written request for a rate adjustment is made by the Provider. Record keeping and Audit All participating FQHC/RHC's sh all maintain an accounting system which identifies costs in a manner that conforms to generally accepte d accounting principles and must maintain documentation sufficient to s upport all cost/visit data. The DHCFP, its fiscal agent or a designated and contracted financial entity may conduct periodic on-site or desk audits of all cost data, including fi nancial and statistical records of the FQHC/RHCs.

Failure to submit requested documentation may result in denial of a rate adjustment request. The DHCFP will conduct one audit annually (at a minimum) to the claims submitted by the FQHC/RHC for supplemental payments. Supplemental Payments for FQHCs/RHCs FQHCs/RHCs that provide services under a cont ract with a Medicaid Managed Care Entity (MCE) will receive quarterly or monthly (as agreed upon between the provider and the state) supplemental payments for furnishing such serv ices, that are a calculation of the difference between the payments the FQHC/RHC receives fr om the MCE(s) for all qualified Medicaid visits and the payments the FQHC/RHC woul d have received under the BIPA PPS methodology or APM. At the end of each payment period, the tota l amount of MCE payments received by the FQHC/RHC will be reviewed against the amount th at the actual number of visits provided under the FQHC's/RHC's contract with MCE(s) w ould have yielded under the PPS/APM methodology. If the amount exceeds the total amount of MC E payments, the FQHC/RHC will be paid the difference, if the amount is less, the FQHC/R HC will refund the difference to DHCFP. The FQHC/RHCs must provide sufficient documenta tion (as requested) to DHCFP to facilitate supplemental payment calculations. If the requi red documentation is not provided to support the supplemental payment, future suppleme ntal payments may be suspended. Documentation Required to Calc ulate/Support Supplemental Payments The FQHC/RHC will submit a written/electronic request for supplemental payment which will contain at least the following information for e ach line item of every qua lified encounter during the reporting time period (Quarterly or Monthly): Servicing and Billing Provider ID#s, Recipient MCE ID Number, Recipient Medica id ID Number, Date of Service, CPT Code(s), MCE Name, Total Billed Amount, MCE Paid Amount, Ot her Paid Amount and Total Amount Paid. The FQHC/RHC will submit claim data for suppleme ntal payment no later than thirty days after the end of the reporting peri od agreed upon with the DHCFP (Quarterly or Monthly).

Nevada Medicaid will meet all reporting and provision of information requirements of section 1927(b)(2) and the requirements of subsections (d) and (g) of section 1927. The State assures that the State will not provide reimbursement for an innovator multi -source drug, subject to the Federal Upper Limits (42 CFR 447.332(a)), if, under applicable State law, a less expensive non -innovator multi- source drug could have been dispensed. 1. Payment for multi -source drugs shall be the lowest of (a) Federal Upper Limit (FUL) as established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for listed multi - source drugs plus a professional dispe nsing fee; (b) State Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) plus dispensing fee; (c) Actual Acquisition Cost (AAC) plus a dispensing fee; (d) the pharmacist's usual and customary charge; (e) Department of Justice pricing less 15% plus dispensing fee or (f) billed charge. 2.

The FUL for multi -source drugs for which an upper limit has been set does not apply if a physician certifies in his or her own handwriting that a specific brand is medically necessary for a particular recipient, and the statement \"brand medically neces sary\" appears on the face of the prescription. 5. A generic drug may be considered for MAC pri cing if there are 2 or more therapeutically equivalent, multi -source, non- innovator drugs with a significant cost difference. The SMAC will be based on drug status (including non- rebateable, rebateable, obsolete, therapeutic equivalency ratings) marketpla ce availability and cost. The obsolete drug status will be taken into account to ensure that the MAC pricing is not influenced by the prices listed for obsolete drugs. The SMAC will be based on drug prices obtained from a nationally recognized comprehensiv e data file maintained by a vendor under contract with the Department. 6. The State's dispensing fees are defined as those given to outpatient retail pharmacists at a rate of $10.17 per prescription; P harmaceuticals given by Long Term Care pharmacists and f or Home Infusion Therapy providers receive dispensing fees in accordance with retail pharmacists. 7.

The lower of: a) billed charges; or b) an interim rate. The Interim rate is the rate for a specific service for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the co mpletion of cost reconcilia tion and a cost settlement for that period. To determine the Medicaid-allowable direct and i ndirect costs of providing Non-Residential Mental Health services the following steps are performed: 1. Interim Rates Governmental providers are reimbursed on an interi m basis for direct medical services per unit of service at the lesser of the provider's billed ch arges or a provider-specific interim rate. A provider-specific interim rate is an annual rate for the specific services for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of co st reconciliation and a co st settlement for that period. Interim rates are based on program experience and cost data reported during the prior fiscal year. 2. Annual Cost Report Process Each governmental provider will complete an a nnual cost report in the format proscribed by Nevada Medicaid in the Medicaid Operations Manual for all medical services delivered during the previous state fiscal year covering July 1 th rough June 30. The cost report is due on or before December 1 of the year following the close of the reporting period. The primary purposes of the cost report are to: a. document the provider's total Medicaid-allowabl e cost for delivering the medical services, including direct costs and indirect costs, base d on the methodologies/steps described below. b. reconcile its interim payments to its total Medicaid-allowable costs. The annual Medicaid Cost Report includes a certification of funds statement to be completed, certifying the provider's actual, incurred allocable and allowable costs/expenditures. All filed annual Cost Reports are subject to audit by DCHFP or its designee. To determine the Medicaid-allowable direct and i ndirect costs of providing covered services to Medicaid-eligible clients, the following steps are performed: TN No. 07-009 Approval Date: October 31, 2008 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No. 08-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B Page 3d A. Facilities that are primarily providing medical Services: (a) Direct costs for covered services include unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly char ged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay, and travel. Thes e costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. (b) Total direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs for covered services. (c) Indirect costs are determined by applying th e agency specific approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs. If the pr ovider has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derive d from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. Th ese allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medi caid non-institutional reimbursement policy. The indirect costs details are accumulated on the annual cost report. (d) Net direct costs (Item b) and indirect costs (Item c) are combined. (e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Medical services described in the applicable section 3.1-A State plan pages and is used to dete rmine the percentage of time that medical service personnel spend on direct medical services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100 percen t of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct medical services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs. (f) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co- payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs.

Facilities that are used for multiple purposes and the provision of medical services are not the primary purpose: (a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocated payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. These costs are accumulated on the annual cost report. (b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. (c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specific approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those cost that are \"directly attributable\" to the professional component of providing the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy. For those costs incurred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but w ould be incurred at the same level if the medical services did not occur are not allowed, e.g. room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the annual cost report. (d) Net direct costs (Item (b)) and indirect costs (Item (c)) are combined. (e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Medical services described in the applicable section 3.1-A State plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that medical service personnel spend on direct medical services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100 percent of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct medical services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs. (f) Medicaid's portion of the total net allocable and allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue received for the same services, e.g. Medicaid co-payments and TPL, to arrive at the total Medicaid net (h) allocable and allowable costs.

Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be responsible fo r reconciling total allowable computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medicaid services delivered during the reporting period as document in the MMIS, resulting in cost reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within twenty-four months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 4. Cost Settlement Process If a governmental provider's interim payments exceed the actual, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicaid clients, DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims payments from the provider until the amount of the federal share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment. If the actual, certified costs exceed the in terim Medicaid payments, DHCFP will pay the federal share of the difference to the provider in accordance with the final actual certification agreement. DHCFP will issue a notice of settlement that denotes the amount due to or from the provider.

Non-residential mental health rehabilitation services provided by private entities or governmental entities that do not undergo the Medicaid cost identification and repor ting procedures w ill be reimbursed based on a statewide fee schedule. Rate Methodology: The rates are market based. This mode l is developed to reflect service definitions, provider requirements, operational service delivery and administrative considerations. The following elements are used to determine the rates: Wage information is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The wage is based on similar occupations reported by BLS and identified by Medicaid sta ff as comparable to services provided under the mental health rehabilitation program. Employee related expenses (ERE) percentage of 27% was based on input from the Task Force memb ers and Medicaid Staff. It includes paid vacation, paid sick leave, holiday pay, health insurance, life insurance, disa bility, workers compensation, and legally required payroll taxes. Productivity adjustment factor wh ich accounts for the amount of non-billable time spent by staff. This includes the time staff needs to complete required documentation and record keeping, time associated with missed appointments and average travel time by the provider. Program Support costs - costs based on average of 4 hours per day. This is to assist with pa perwork and follow-up related to treatment. Allowance for supervisory time - costs for the time directly spent in supervising the medical professional providing these services. Allowances for capital costs - th e costs are not included in the Administrative overhead. It includes the average hourly expense for building rental and maintenance, equipment leasing and utility expenses. Administrative overhead, 10%, is th e percentage of service costs that should result from non-direct care activities. It includes insurance, administrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It also does not include staff training. The following steps are used to determine the rates: TN No. 07-009 Approval Date: October 31, 2008 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No. NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B Page 3i 1. The State will use Nevada-specific hourly wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. The hourly amount is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly compensation calculated in Item 2 to equal to the hourly rate. 4. The adjusted hourly rate per individua l is the hourly rate per individual (Item 3) increased by the program support costs per hour per individual, allowance for supervisory time and capital costs per hours. 5. Administrative overhead (10%) is applie d to the adjusted hourly rate per individual (Item 4). 6. Total hourly rate is the sum of the adjusted hourly rate per individual before administrative overhead (Item 4) and the administrative overhead (Item 5). 7. Total hourly rate is scaled to the pr oper unit based on the unit of service. 8. Group rate is the individual rate divided by the group size assumption. These rates have been compared to other private sector fee-for-service rates. Documentation of the assumptions used, rate development methodology, and fee schedule payment rates will be maintained by The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy.

Services provided by an out-of-state pr ovider require prior authorization by Nevada Medicaid, which must verify that the services required by Medicaid-eligible or pending-eligible clients ar e not available in Nevada. The out-of- state payment rate for services provide d by an out-of-state provider is based on one of the following criteria: a. The out-of-state provider will be paid the lesser of the provider's billed charges or the fee-for-service ra te that is paid to an in-state provider for the service. b. If the out-of-state provider refuses to accept this rate, then the out-of- state provider may be paid the lesse r of the provider's billed charges or the same fee-for-service rate as it would be paid by its home state Medicaid program.

Targeted Case Management (TCM) services will be reimbursed as follows: Prior to the beginning of each rate year, each of the governmental providers providing TCM services must select one the reimbursement methodologies described below for reimbursement. For example, by April 30, 2009, governmental provide rs must select a me thodology for the rate year beginning July 1, 2009. Once a selected methodology is determined for a rate year, governmental providers will not be able to ch ange the selected me thodology until the following rate year. A. Reimbursement Methodology for Targeted Ca se Management Services provided by a non-governmental entity and governmental entities who do not undergo the Medicaid cost identification and reporting procedures: I. TCM: One unit per 15 minutes. II. TCM services provided by a private/non- governmental entity and governmental entities that do not undergo the Medicaid cost identification and reporting procedures will be reimbursed the lower of a) billed charges, or b) a fixed quarter hour rate. III. The quarterly hour rate is a market ba sed model. This model reflects service definitions, provider requirements, operati onal service delivery and administrative considerations. The following elements are used to determine the rate: 1. Wage Information is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The wage is based on similar occupations reported by BLS and identified by Medicaid staff as comparable to CM and TCM services. 2. Employee rated expenses (ERE) percentage of 27% was based on input from the Provider Rates Task Force members a nd Medicaid Staff. It includes paid vacation, paid sick leave, holiday pay, hea lth insurance, life in surance, disability, workers compensation and legally required payroll taxes. 3. Productivity adjustment factor which accounts for the amount of non-billable time spent by staff. This includes the time staff needs to complete required documentation and record keeping, time associated with missed appointments and average travel time by the provider. 4. Allowance for supervisory time - costs for the time directly spent in supervising the professional providing this CM and/or TCM service. 5. Allowance for capital costs - the costs are not included in the administrative overhead. It includes the average hourly expense, for building rental and maintenance, equipment leasing and utility expenses. 6. Allowance for mileage - the average cost s related to the miles to travel to clients.

Administrative overhead, 10%, is the percentage of service cost that should result from non-direct care activities. It includes insurance, administrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It also does not include staff training. IV. The following steps are used to determine the fixed quarter hour rate: 1. The State will use Nevada-specific hourly wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. This hourly compensation is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly compensation calculated in Item 2 to equal the adjusted hourly rate. 4. Allowance for supervisory time is determined. 5. Administrative overhead (10%) is applied to the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3) and the allowance for supervisory (Item 4). 6. Allowance for mileage cost is determined. 7. Allowance for capital costs is determined. 8. Fixed hourly rate is the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3), allowance for supervisory time (Item 4), administrative overhead (Item 5), allowance for mileage (Item 6), and allowance for capital costs (Item 7). 9. Quarter hour rate is the fixed hourly rate (Item 8) divided by 4. This rate has been compared to other private sector fee-for-service rates. Documentation of the assumptions used, ra te development methodology, and fee schedule payment rates will be maintained by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy.

Reimbursement Methodology for Targeted Case Ma nagement Services provided by a state or local government entity: Targeted Case Management services provided by a state or local government entity are reimbursed according to one of the following two payment methodologies. The second methodology must be used by providers who undergo all Medicaid cost identification, reporting, reconciliation and settlement procedures. I. the lower of: a) billed charges; or b) a cost based rate. The cost-based rate is an annual rate developed based on historic costs. Cost based rates will be calculated annually and are determined by dividing estimated reimbursable costs of providing Medicaid-covered services by the projected total direct medical service utilization for the upcoming fiscal period.

The budget forecast must reflect a projection for allowable, necessary and proper expenses in providing Medicaid-covered services. Allowable costs ar e those direct and indirect costs deemed allowable by CMS which are incurred and ar e proper and necessary to efficiently deliver needed services. Direct costs in clude unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly char ged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i .e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay, and travel. These direct costs are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. The Agency's rates were set as of July 1, 2007 and are effective for services on or after July 1, 2009. All rates are publis hed on the Agency's website at www.dhcfp.nv.gov . II. the lower of: a) billed charges; or b) an interim rate. The Interim rate is the rate for a specific service for a period that is provisiona l in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. To determine the Medicaid-allowable direct a nd indirect costs of pr oviding Targeted Case Management services the following steps are performed: 1. Interim Rates Governmental providers are reimbursed on an interim basis for direct medical services per unit of service at the lesse r of the provider's billed charges or a provider-specific interim rate. A provider-speci fic interim rate is an annual rate for the specific services for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that pe riod. Interim rates are based on program experience and cost data reported during the prior fiscal year. 2. Annual Cost Report Process Each governmental provider will complete an annual cost report in the format prescribed by Nevada Medicaid in the Me dicaid Operations Manual for all medical services delivered during the previous state fiscal year covering July 1 through June 30. The cost report is due on or before December 1 of the year following the close of the reporting period. The primary purposes of the cost report are to: a. document the provider's total Medicaid-allo wable cost for delivering the medical services, including direct costs and indirect costs. b. reconcile its interim payments to its total Medicaid-allowable costs.

All f iled annual Cost Reports are subject to audit by DCHFP or its designee. To determine the Medicaid-allowable di rect and indirect costs of providing covered services to Medicai d-eligible clients, the following steps are performed: A. Settings that are primarily providing medical services: (a.) Direct costs for covered services include unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly charged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and cont ract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay, and travel. These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. (b.) Total direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs for covered services. (c.) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specific approved indirect cost ra te to its net direct costs. If the provider has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. Th ese allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medicaid non-intuitional reimbursement policy. The indirect costs details are accumulated on the annual cost report. (d.) Net direct costs (b) and indirect costs (c) are combined. (e.) A CMS approved time study is require d when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Targeted Case Management services described in the applicable section 3.1-A State plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that case management service personnel spend on direct Targeted TN No. 08-006 Approval Date: March 17, 2009 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No. NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B Page 4 (Continued p. 4) Case Management services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100 percent of the time to assure that there is no duplicate clai ming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Targ eted Case Management services time study percentage is applied agai nst the net direct and indirect costs. (f.) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g.) Total Medicaid allowable costs (f ) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co-payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. B. Facilities that are used for mu ltiple purposes and the provision of medical services is not the primary purpose: a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocated payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specified approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are reduced by any allowable amount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those costs that ar e \"directly attributable\" to the professional component of provi ding the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy. For those costs incurred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but would be incurred at the same level if the medical services did not occur are not allowed, e.g., room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the annual cost report.

This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Targeted Case Management services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs. (f) Medicaid's portion of the total net allocable and allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue received for the same services, e.g. Medicaid co-payments and TPL, to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. 3. Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be responsible for reconciling total computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medicaid services delivered during the re porting period as document in the MMIS, resulting in cost reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within twenty-four months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 4. Cost Settlement Process If a governmental provider's interim paymen ts exceed the actual, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicaid c lients, DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims payments fr om the provider until the amount of the federal share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment.

When a hospital, clinic, or county social service department determines a person receiving emergency services is indigent and an illegal alien, the alien w ill be referred to the State Welfare Division District Office for application. If the appli cant is unable or reluctant to go to the Welfare District Office, the hospital/clinic/social service department will assist the applicant in completing the application and gathering verification and will send the application a nd verification to the Welfare District Office with the billing(s). The District Office eligibility worker will request fr om the provider a bill or other evidence services were rendered and will obtain an application (if not already completed) and necessary verifications/information. The eligibility worker will approve eligibility for the months in which services were rendered and the applicant meets in come/resource and other criteria (e.g., disability or incapacity).

For example, by April 30, 2013, governmental providers must select a methodology for the rate year beginning Ju ly 1, 2013. Once a selected methodology is determined for a rate year, governmental provide rs will not be able to change the selected methodology until the following rate year. The Agency's rates were set as of January 1, 2006 and are effective for services on or after January 1, 2006. All rates are published on the Agency's website at www.dhcfp.nv.gov . The billable unit of service for ADHC is 1 unit per 15 minutes or the daily rate. If services are authorized and provided for less than 6 hours per day, provider should bill one unit for each 15 minutes; If services are authorized and provided for 6 hours or more per day, provider should bill the per diem rate. Rate Methodology: The rate is market based. This model is de veloped to reflect service definitions, provider requirements, operational service delivery and administrative considerations. The following elements are used to determine the rate: Wage information is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The wage is based on similar occupations reported by BLS and identified by Medicaid staff as comparable to ADHC services. Employee related expenses (ERE) percentage of 27% was based on input from the Task Force members and Medicaid Staff. It includes paid vacation, paid sick leave, holiday pay, health insurance, life insurance, disability , workers compensation, and legally required payroll taxes. Productivity adjustment factor which accounts for the amount of non-billable time spent by staff. This includes the time staff needs to complete required documentation and record keeping, time associated with missed appointments and average travel time by the provider. Administrative overhead, 10%, is the percentage of service cost that should result from non- direct care activities. It includes insurance, ad ministrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It also does not include staff training. SRV REF: Attachment 3.1 - G, Page 30 - 30a TN No. 11-016 Approval Date: April 1, 2013 Effective Date: January 1, 2012 Supersedes TN No. 07-003 State NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B Page 14a Allowances for capital costs - the costs are not included in the Administrative overhead. It includes the average hourly expense for building rental and maintenance, equipment leasing and utility expenses. The following steps are used to determine the rate: 1. The State will use Nevada-specific hourly wage s from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as of May, 2004 inflated to June, 2006. 2. This hourly compensation is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly compensation calculated in Item 2 to equal to the adjusted hourly rate. 4. Administrative overhead (10%) is applied to the adjusted hourly rate (Item 3). 5. Determine allowance for capital costs per hour. 6. Fixed hourly rate is the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3), administrative overhead (Item 4) and capital costs (Item 5). 7. Fixed hourly rate is scaled to the proper unit based on the procedure code. This rate has been compared to government entities who do not follow all cost reporting rules and other private sector fee-for-servi ce rates. Documentation of the assumptions used, rate development methodology, and fee sc hedule payment rates will be maintained by The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy. A. Reimbursement Methodology for Adult Day Hea lth Care (ADHC) services provided by a state or local government entity: ADHC services provided by a state or local government entity are reimbursed according to the following payment methodology. This met hodology is used by providers who undergo all Medicaid cost identification, reporting, reconciliation and settlement procedures. I. The lower of: a) billed charges; or b) an interim rate. The Interim rate is the rate for a specific service for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. To determine the Medicaid-allowable direct and indirect costs of providing Adult Day Health Care Services the following steps are performed: 1. Interim Rates Governmental providers are reimburse d on an interim basis for direct medical services per unit of service at the lesser of the provider's billed charges or a provider-specific interim rate. A provider-specific interim rate is an annual rate for the specific servi ces for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. Interim rates are base d on program experience and cost data reported during the prior fiscal year.

Annual Cost Report Process Each governmental provider will complete an annual cost report in the format prescribed by Nevada Medicaid for all medical services delivered during the previous state fiscal year covering July 1 through June 30. The cost report is due on or before December 1 of the year following the close of the reporting period. The primary purposes of the cost report are to: a. document the provider's total Medicaid-allowable cost for delivering the medical services, including direct costs and indirect costs. b. reconcile its interim payments to its total Medicaid-allowable costs. The annual Medicaid Cost Report includes a certification of expenditures statement to be completed, certifying the provider's actual, incurred allocable and allowable costs/expenditures. All filed annual Cost Reports are subject to audit by DHCFP or its designee. B. Settings that are primarily providing medical services: a) Direct costs for covered services include unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly charged to cove red medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay, and travel . These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement polic y and are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. b) Total direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs for covered services. c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the cognizant agency approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs. If the provider has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the annual cost report. d) Net direct costs (b) and indirect costs (c) are combined. e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the ADHC services de scribed in the applicable section 3.1-A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that service personnel spend on direct ADHC.

This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Adult Day Health Care Services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs. g) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. h) Total Medicaid allowable costs (f) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co- payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. C. Facilities that are used for multiple purposes and the provision of medical services is not the primary purpose: a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocated payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the cognizant agency approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are reduced by any allowable amount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those costs that are \"directly attributable\" to the professional component of providing the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policy. For those costs incurred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but w ould be incurred at the same level if the medical services did not occur are not allowed, e.g., room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the annual cost report. d) Net direct costs (Item (b)) and indirect costs (Item (c)) are combined. e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Adult Day Health Care Services described in the applicable section 3.1-A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that service personnel spend on direct Adult Day Health Care Services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100 percent of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming.

Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be respons ible for reconciling total computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medicaid services delivered during the reporting period as documented in the MMIS, resulting in cost reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within twenty-four months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 4. Cost Settlement Process If a governmental provider's interim paym ents exceed the actual, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicai d clients, DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims payments from the provider until the amount of the federal share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment. If the actual, certified costs exceed th e interim Medicaid payments, DHCFP will pay the federal share of the difference to the provider in accordance with the final actual certification agreement. DHCFP will issue a notice of settlement that denotes the amount due to or from the provider.

The following elements are used to determine the rate: Wage information is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The wage is based on similar occupations reported by BLS and identified by Medicaid staff as comparable to services provided under the intensive outpatient program and partial hospitalization program. Employee related expenses (ERE) percenta ge of 27% was based on input from the Task Force members and Medicaid Staff. It includes paid vacation, paid sick leave, holiday pay, health insurance, life insura nce, disability, workers compensation, and legally required payroll taxes. Productivity adjustment factor which accounts for the amount of non-billable time spent by staff. This includes the time staff needs to complete required documentation and record keeping, time associated with missed appointments and average travel time by the provider. Program Support costs - costs based on averag e of 4 hours per day. This is to assist with paperwork and follow-up related treatment. Allowance for supervisory time - costs for th e time directly spent in supervising the medical professional providing these services. Allowance for capital costs - the costs is not included in the Administrative overhead. It includes the average hourly expense for building rental and maintenance, equipment leasing and utility expenses. Administrative overhead, 10%, is the percentage of service cost that should result from non-direct care activities. It includes insura nce, administrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It also does not include staff training.

The State will use Nevada-specific hourly wage s from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as of May, 2004 inflated to June, 2006. 2. The hourly amount is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly compensation calculated in Item 2 to equal the hourly rate. 4. The hourly rate per individual is the hourly rate (Item 3) divided by the number of individuals based on staffing ratio assumption. 5. The adjusted hourly rate per individual is the hourly rate per individual (Item 4) increased by the program support costs pe r hour per individual, allowance for supervisory time and capital costs per hours. 6. Administrative overhead 10% is applied to th e adjusted hourly rate per individual (Item 5). 7. Total hourly rate is the sum of the adju sted hourly rate per individual before administrative overhead (Item 5) and the administrative overhead (Item 6). 8. Total hourly rate is scaled to the proper unit based on the billable unit of service. These rates have been compared to other privat e sector fee-for-service rates.

OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS This section of the state plan contains the provisions for making additional Medicaid payments, in order to preserve access to outpatie nt hospital services for needy individuals in the state of Nevada. Effective for services provided on or after March 1, 2010, the state's Medicaid hospital reimbursement system shall pr ovide for supplemental outpatient payments to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals. These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual basis and paid to qualifying hospitals on a quarterly basis. The supplemental payments shall not exceed, when aggregated with other fee-for-services outpatient hospital payments made to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount th at would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles in accordance with the federal upper limit regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7447.321. a. Methodology for Determining Outpatient Supplemental Payments: The hospitals that qualify for outpatient supplemental payments will have their payment amount determined using a pa yment-to-charge ra tio UPL methodology. Outpatient supplemental payments for each hospital will be calculated using following method: (i) Calculate Total Medicare Outpatient Payments from: CMS 2552-96 Wkst E Part B, Co l 1, Line 17 + CMS 2552-96 Wkst E Part B, Col 1, Li ne 17.01 + CMS 2552-96 Wkst E Part B, Col 1, Line 21+22 [Add comparable fields for subproviders 1 and 2] (ii) Calculate Total Medicare Outpatient Charges from: CMS 2552-96 Wkst D Part V, Line 104, Col 5 + CMS 2552-96 Wkst D Part V, Line 104, Col 5.01 + CMS 2552-96 Wkst D Part V, Line 104, Col 5.02 + CMS 2552-96 Wkst D Part V, Line 104, Col 5.03 [Add comparable fields for subproviders 1 and 2] (iii) Calculate Medicare Outpatient Payment to Charge Ratio.

(v) Total Medicaid Outpatient Payments for the period are subtracted from the result (iv) to determin e the annual amount of Outpatient Supplemental Payment. Total Medicaid Outpatient payment shall be derived from Nevada Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) adjudicated claims data. b. Outpatient Supplemental Payments: (i) Each qualifying hospital will provide documentation of CMS form 2552 cost report for Medicare charge and payment information for the previous fiscal year to Medicaid by April 1st of each year. (ii) Beginning April 2010, Medicaid w ill calculate the total outpatient supplement payment for qualifying hospitals using the methodology in section A. above. At the end of each calendar quarter, hospitals will receive a payment amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the hospital's total outpatient supplemental payment.

To the extend reimbursements exceed upper payment limits, the State will return to CMS any federal funds used to reimburse these providers in excess of this limit. To establish the federal upper payment limit for these services the following methodology is used: 1. Segregation: Providers are divided into two primary categories - hospital based providers and free- standing clinics. These two categories are further segregated three additional categories: a. Privately-owned or operated facilities. b. State government-owned or operated facilities c. Non-state government-owned or operated facilities 2. Free-Standing Privately-owned or operated facility UPL estimation a. A sample of at least one calendar quarter of Me dicaid claims for these providers will be used as base data. b. Medicaid reimbursement is estimated for these claims using the methodology described in 4.19B, page 5. c. Medicare reimbursement is estimated using the guidelines established in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual and Transmittal AB-03-116. d. The amounts calculated in b. and c. are compared. If b. is less than c. Medicaid reimbursement is in conformance with the provisions of 42 CFR 422.321. 3. Free-Standing state and non-state government-owned or operated facilities - there are no facilities providing services under attachment 4.19B, page 5 in Nevada. 4. Hospital-based privately-owned or operated facilities. a. The methodology utilizes Medicare cost principles to estimate UPL b. The methodology includes all hospital outpatient services, including those provided under 4.19B, page 1 and page 5. c. The most recently filed Medicare cost report outpatient cost to charge ratio is used for each facility. d. A sample of at least one calendar quarter of Me dicaid claims for the services described in 4.b. above will be used as base data. e. Medicaid reimbursement is estimated for these claims using the methodology described in attachment 4.19B. f. Medicare reimbursement is estimated by multiplying the total billed charges for each facility from d. above by the cost to charge ratio from b. above. The result is the Medicare UPL for these services. g. The amounts calculated in e. and f. are compared. If e. is less than f.

A. Hospital-Based Facilities: (Hospital-based facility is defined as: a) a facility sharing a common building or common tract of land with a hosp ital owned or operated by the state, or an instrumentality or unit of government within the state, located within a county of a population of 100,000 or less; or b) a facility (public or privat e) which prior to July 1, 1992, was paid for both inpatient hospital services under Attachment 4.19-A of the Medicaid State Plan and long-term nursing facility services under this section.) 1. Hospital-based nursing facility services are pa id for under Medicare reasonable cost-based reimbursement principles, including the routine co st limitation (RCL), and the lesser of cost or charges (LCC). Effective October 1, 2001, hospital-based nursing facilities shall continue to be reimbursed under Medicare's cost based reimbursement prin ciples, along with the other provisions of paragraphs A.2 and A.3. Under this methodology, payment will follow any and all applicable Me dicare upper payment limitation (UPL) requirements such that paymen ts will not exceed the UPL. The rates the State of Nevada would pay per day of nursing facility care comply with the Medicare upper payment limit at 42 CFR 447.272, as amended. The routine cost limit (RCL) used in co st settlements will be $160.14 per day, effective October 1, 2001. This RCL will apply to cost reports ending on or after October 1, 2001, and will only apply to the portion of the cost repor t period on or after October 1, 2001. For those cost reports beginning prior to October 1, 2001 and ending on or after October 1, 2001, a weighted average RCL will be used. The RCL applicable to the portion of the cost report period prior to October 1, 2001 will be the per diem routine service cost paid to the facility during the most current cost report peri od ending prior to October 1, 2001. The RCL applicable to the portion of the cost report period on or after October 1, 2001, will be the RCL of $160.14, as adjusted for inflation. For example: If a hospital-based facility with a June 30 year end was paid $140 per day for routine se rvice cost during its year ending June 30, 2001, the $140 per day would be the RCL for this f acility during the portion of the cost reporting year from July 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001. The RCL for the remainder of the year ending June 30, 2002 (October 1, 2001 through J une 30, 2002) would be the $160.14 RCL, as adjusted for inflation. The $160.14 RCL will be indexed (adjusted fo r inflation) from October 1, 2001 to the midpoint of the cost-reporting peri od to which it is applied. The Skilled and Intermediate Care Facilities without capital (non-seasonally adjusted) Ta ble 9: Percent Change in Medical Prices as published by MEI will be used in indexing the RCL. If this index becomes unavailable, a comparable index will be used.

In preparing the free-standing nursing fac ilities for a resource utilization group (RUG) based Medicaid reimbursement system; a trans itional rate setting process will be adopted effective January 1, 2002. The significant elements of this system include the following: b. Base operating rates will be calculated for each facility effective January 1, 2002. The base operating rates will be calculated for each free-standing nursing facility using the weighted average operating rate for each facility effective October 1, 2001, (excluding SNL-3 days and rates). The days used to prepare the weighted average operating rates will be paid nursing facility days from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2001 (excluding SNL-3 days) as shown on a paid claims listing prepared in November 2001. Each facility's capital rate effective October 1, 2001, will be added to their weighted average operating rate. If the statewide Medicaid day weighted average operating and capital rates, calculated as described above, ex ceed the budget target rate of $121.02, a budget adjustment factor will be employed to adju st the calculated rates to meet the budget target. c. For those facilities with unstable occupancy (i .e. facilities receiving their initial Medicaid certification on or after January 1, 2000), their ba se rate will be adjusted for changes in Medicaid acuity as follows: 1. A snapshot Medicaid average case mix index (CMI) will be calculated for each facility effective October 1, 2001. 2. Medicaid average CMIs will be prepared for these facilities as of January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002, using the same weights as were used to prepare the October 1, 2001 snapshot. 3. The change in average Medicaid CMI, for each unstable occupancy nursing facility as measured from October 1, 2001 to January 1, 2002, and from October 1, 2001 to April 1, 2002, will be used to pr oportionally increase or decrease 40% of that facility's operating rate effective January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002.

Reimbursement Methodology July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003: a. Effective July 1, 2002, each nursing f acility's base rate (the rate in effect for each facility on June 30, 2002) will be adjusted for the cha nge in their average Medicaid CMI. The ratio to use in this calculation will be deve loped using as its numerator each facility's simple average of their Medicaid CMI as of January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002. The denominator will be the simple average of each facility's Medicaid CMI calculated as of October 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002. b. The rates in 2.a. will be further acuity-adjus ted quarterly. In preparing these rate adjustments, the denominator of the fracti on described in item 2.a. above will remain unchanged for each facility. The numerat or of the fraction for October 1, 2002 adjustment will reflect the simple average of each facility's Medicaid CMI as of April 1, 2002 and July 1, 2002. The July 2002 and October 2002 average Medicaid CMI will be used in the January 1, 2003 rate setti ng, while the October 2002 and January 2003 average Medicaid CMI will be used in the April 1, 2003 rate adjustments. c. The acuity-adjusted rates, as described above in item 2.a. and b., will be further adjusted by an adjustment factor to not exceed th e industry Medicaid weighted average per patient day rate effective January 1, 2002 as described in B. 1. b. above. d. 40% of each facility's weighted average ope rating rate will be subject to the acuity adjustments described in this section. e. Facilities that were initially certified be tween July 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, will have their rates adjusted to reflect the adjustments to rates that were made to unstable occupancy facilities during the period of January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002. These rate adjustments will be effective July 1, 2002. The intent of this provision is to treat facilities initially certified during this period as if they had been identified as unstable occupancy facilities during the period from January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002.

Reimbursement Methodology - Effective July 1, 2003: Effective July 1, 2003, a nursing facility pri ce-based reimbursement system will be implemented. Individual facility rates will be developed from prices established for three separate cost centers: operating, direct health care and capital. The allowable cost used in these rate setting activities will be nursing facility health care cost determined to be allowable in accordance with the Medicare / Medicaid provide r reimbursement manual, commonly referred to as HIM 15. a. Operating Cost Center - The operating cost center will be comprised of all allowable cost excluding direct care cost, capital cost and direct ancillary service cost. The statewide price for this cost center will be set at 105% of the Medicaid day weighted median. TN No. 03-09 Approval Date: July 6, 2004 Effective Date: July 18, 2003 Supersedes TN No. 02-08 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 5b Direct Health Care Cost Center - The direct health care cost cente r will be comprised of allowable RN, LPN, and Nursing Aide salaries and wages; a proporti onate allocation of allowable employee benefits; and the direct allowable cost of acquiring RN, LPN and Nu rse Aide staff from outside staffing companies. The statewide price will be established for this cost cen ter at 110% of the Medicaid day weighted median case mix neutralized cost. In preparing the case mix neut ralization, a minimum of two calendar quarters from each facility's available quarterly f acility wide case mix index information that most closely matches their base year cost report will be used to calculate the Medicaid day weighted average. On a quarterly basis, each facility's specific direct health care price is determ ined by adjusting the statewide price using as the numerator, the facility's most current quarterly Me dicaid case mix index and as the denominator, the Medicaid day weighted average of the facility wide case mix indexes used in setting the statewide price.

Capital Cost Center - This cost center will be comprised of allowable depreciation, capital related interest, rent / lease, and amor tization expenses. A fair rental value (FRV) reimbursement system will be used to determine each facility's capital rate. The following items will be used in determining each facility's FRV rate: i. Value of New Beds (7/01/03) $73,000.00 ii. Bed Value Indexed Annually (using Marshall Swift, Class C nursing facility index) iii. Rate of Depreciation 1.5% Year iv. Maximum Age 40 Years v. Rental Rate 9.0% Annually vi. Minimum Occupancy Percent 92% These values will be used to determine a facility's FRV payment as demonstrated below: (Example facility has 100 beds and is 10 years old) Licensed Beds 100 Times Value / Bed $73,000 Gross Value $7,300,000 Depreciation Rate (1.5% x 10 Years) 15% Depreciated Value (85%) $6,205,000 Rental Rate 9% FRV Payment (Gross) $558,450 Divided by Greater of Actual or Minimum Days 33,580 Fair Rental Value Payment $16.63 TN No. 03-09 Approval Date: July 6, 2004 Effective Date: July 18, 2003 Supersedes TN No. 02-08 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 5d.1 1) Capital Renovations / Remodeling Projects - The fair rental value of each facility will be adjusted (increased) to reflect the cost of major renovation / replacement projects completed by each facility not to exceed a 24-month period. The renovation / replacement adjust ment would be made at the start of the first rate year following comp letion of the renovation / replacement project. The cost of renovation / replacement pr ojects must be documented within each facility's depreciation schedule, must be reported to the Medicaid program by May 1 st prior to the July 1st rate year when they would first be eligible for incorporation into the FR V rate setting process, and must exceed $1,000.00 per licensed bed in order to be considered a major renovation / replacement. The cost of these re novation / replacement projects will be depreciated at a rate of 4% per year , but will also be indexed (inflated) annually using the bed value indexing methodology incorporated into this fair rental value system.

This age will be reduced for renovations and/or additions of beds that have occurred since the facility was built. If a facility added beds, thes e new beds will be averaged in with the original beds and a weighted averag e age for all beds will be used as the initial age. If a facility performed a major renovation project between the time the facility was built and the time when the initial age is determined, the cost of the renovation project will be used to determine the equivalent number of new beds that project repr esents. The equivalent number of new beds would then be used to determine the weighted average age of all beds for this facility. The equivalent num ber of new beds from a renovation project will be determined by dividing the cost of the renovation project by the cost of a new bed (using the new bed valuation methodology incorporated into the FRV system) at the time the renovation project was completed. Facility ages will be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Inflation Factor Used in Rate Setting - When establishing the medians for the operating and direct health care cost centers, cost will be adjusted from the midpoint of each provider's base year cost report to the mi dpoint of each state fiscal year using the Nursing Home Services without capital (non-seasonally adjusted Table 9: Percent Change in Medical Prices) as published by ME I. If this index becomes unavailable, a comparable index will be used. In non-rebasi ng years, the Medians from the most recent rebasing period will be indexed forward to th e midpoint of the current rate year using this indexing methodology.

Base Year Cost Report (July 1, 2003 Rate Year) and Rebasing Frequency - Cost reports used to establish the July 1, 2003 ope rating and direct care medians, and ultimate prices, will be the most current cost report for each facility whose audit or desk review was completed at least three (3 ) months prior to the July 1st rate effective date. Only audited or desk reviewed cost reports will be used in the rate setting process. New cost report information will be brought into the ra te setting process on a periodic basis. The cost report information used to establish th e operating and direct health care medians, and ultimate prices, will be rebased no less frequently than once every two (2) years.

Budget Adjustment Factor - In the event that the reimbursement system described in this section would result in anticipated pa yments to nursing facility providers being greater or less than the funding appropriate d by the Nevada legislature, proportional increases or decreases will be made to the ra tes so that anticipated payments will equal legislative appropriations . This adjustment to rates will be made as a percentage increase or decrease in each provider's rate. The pe rcentage will be determined in accordance with the following fraction: (Legislative appr opriations / (The Sum of Each Facility's Calculated Rate Multiplied by Each Facility 's Proportional Share of the Anticipated (Budgeted) Case Load for A ll Freestanding Nursing Facilities)). Medicaid days from the cost reports used in rate setting will be the basis for the proportional allocation of anticipated case load across all freestanding facilities. TN No. 03-09 Approval Date: July 6, 2004 Effective Date: July 18, 2003 Supersedes TN No. 02-08 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 6 C. Cost Reporting Requirements: 1. Hospital-based and free-standing nursing facilities mu st complete and file an annual cost report with the Medicaid program. Cost and other statis tical information within the cost report must be reported in compliance with allowable and non- allowable cost definitions contained in the Medicare/Medicaid provider reimbursement manual (commonly referred to as HIM 15). 2. Free-standing nursing facility cost reports are to be received by the Medicaid program by the last day of the third month following a facility's fiscal year end. If the facility is unable to complete their cost report within this time fr ame, a request for a 30 day extension can be requested from the Medicaid program (Division of Health Care Financing and Policy) prior to the original cost report due date. Reasonable extension requests will be granted. 3. Hospital-based nursing facility cost reports ar e to be filed with the Medicaid program following the cost report filing deadlines a dopted by the Medicare program. If a facility requests an extension from the Medicare program, they must also request an extension from the Medicaid program (Division of Healthcar e Financing and Policy). Extension requests approved by Medicare will automatically be approved by the Medicaid program, once the Division of Health Care Financing and Polic y receives evidence of Medicare approval from the facility. 4. Facilities failing to file a Medicaid cost report in accordance with these provisions may have their payments suspended, or be required to pa y back to the Medicaid program all payments received during the fiscal year period upon which they were to provide a cost report. Facilities may also be subject to late filing fees assesse d in accordance with guidelines issued pursuant to the Medicaid Services Manual.

New Facilities and Change of Ownership: 1. New facilities are those entities whose beds have not previously been certified to participate in the Medicaid program. New free-standing fac ilities will be reimbursed an interim rate computed from the following Nursing Facility rate components in effect on the date of the facility's Medicaid certification: a. The Fair Rental Value per diem will be de termined based upon an initial capital survey the new provider completes and submits to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, and upon the methodology described in section B.3.c. of this attachment. b. The operating component for the rate will be the 'Operating Statewide Price' as described in section B.3.a. of this attachment. c. The direct health care component will be the 'Statewide Direct Health Care Price' as described in section B.3.b.of this attachment. d. The 'Budget Adjustment Factor', as describe d in section B.3.h. of this attachment, will be applied to determine the Facility Medicaid Rate. This interim rate will be paid until such time that the rate is rebased under the provisions of Section B.3.e of this attachment. 2. New hospital-based facilities will receive an interi m rate equal to the average rate (expressed as a percent of charges) paid to all other hospital-based nursing facilities effective at the start of the state fiscal year in which the facility be gan providing services to Medicaid recipients. 3. A change of ownership exists if the beds of the new owner have previously been certified to participate in the Medicaid program under the previous owner's provider agreement. Rates paid to free-standing nursing facilities that have undergone a change of ownership will be based upon the base rate and acuity data of the previous owner. The new owner's acuity data will be used to adjust the facility's rate following the rate adjustment schedule discussed in this rule. Facilities (hospital-based and free-standi ng) that undergo a change in ownership are required to file a closing cost report for the seller within 45 days of the date of sale. A new cost reporting period for the buyer will start on the eff ective date of the transaction. The interim rate paid to a new hospital-based owner will be the same interim rate the prior owner was receiving.

In calculating the case mix for each facility, CMS-mandated RUG and MDS systems will be utilized. 2. Each nursing facility resident in a facility, with a completed and submitted MDS shall be assigned to a RUG classification group on the fi rst day of each calendar quarter. These RUG assignments will be based upon each resident's most current MDS assessment available on the first day of each calendar quarter. Using the facility's simple average of the individual residents' case mix indexes, two case mix inde xes (CMIs) will be calculated for the facility. One being a facility wide CMI, which will be ba sed upon all of the facility 's residents, and the other being the Medicaid CMI, which will be cal culated using only the Medicaid residents for each facility. Both of these average case mix i ndexes will be rounded to four decimal places.

Special Care Rates: 1. The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy shall establish special care rates for recipients ages 21 and over that are ventilator dependent, or behaviorally complex, and pediatric recipients less than 21 years of age w ith special high cost care needs and/or who are ventilator dependent. These special care rates will be all-inclusive per diem rates based on the costs of providing services to recipients. a. Effective August 1, 2011 the per diem rate for recipients ages 21 and over that are ventilator dependent is the facility-specific fa ir rental value per diem, as computed under section B.3.c. of this attachment, plus an add-on of $495.00. b. The per diem rate for behaviorally complex recipients is the facility-specific per diem rate plus an add-on rate that will be determined based on the minimum staffing level multiplied by the Nevada Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) median wage. The Median Hourly Wage for the State of Nevada published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey will be used as the CNA median wage for the per diem calculation. The minimum staffing level is broken down into the following three categories: i. 1 - 8 hours, use 7.5 hours ii. 9 - 16 hours, use 15 hours iii. 17 - 24 hours, use 22 hours The Nevada CNA median wage will be reviewed on odd numbered years on July 1 and will become effective as of July 1 of the respective year. c. The per diem rate for recipients less than 21 years of age with special high cost care needs that meet the Level of Care requirement s for Pediatric Level I as defined, effective March 25, 2013, in the Medicaid Services Manual is $635.00. d. The per diem rate for recipients less than 21 years of age that meet the Level of Care requirements for Pediatric Level II as defined, effective March 25, 2013, in the Medicaid Services Manual is $695.00. 2. The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy shall establish negotiated facility specific all-inclusive per diem rates for Medicaid recipients with unique high cost care needs. Nursing facilities may not bill the Medicaid program for special care recipients other than on a per diem basis using the established negotiated rate. Rates will address the following client care issues: a. Patient's acuity b. Availability of beds c. Patient's freedom of choice 3. When special care rates are required or when multiple facilities are equally acceptable under E.2. above, the nursing facility with the lowest per di em rate will be selected. The per diem rate will not exceed the facility's usual and customary rate for similar services.

Nurse Aide Training Cost: Nursing facilities are required to reimburse certifie d nurses aides (CNAs) if the CNA paid for the training within one year of being employed by the facility and has not previously been reimbursed. The amount nursing facilities are required to reimburse the CNA is limited to the cost of the class and books at Nevada community colleges. The aide is to be reimbursed after three months of employment in the facility. Nursing facilities must follow the procedures specified by Nevada Medicaid to receive reimbursement from Medicaid fo r their share of the amount paid to the CNA. Facilities which conduct a training progr am will continue to bill Medicaid for the cost of the training and competency evaluation.

Supplemental payments are not available for nursing facilities owned by the State of Nevada or any of its political subdivisions. Fifty percent (50%) of the supplemental payment is based on Medicaid o ccupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality measures. Fifty percent (50%) of the payment is based on acuity. Th e amount available for supplemental payments is computed quarterly and reimbursed in the quarter in three equal monthly payments. A. The amount available for Supplemental Payments to Nursing Facilities (NF) will be calculated each quarter based on actual net revenues from patient services and actual patient days for each facility during the Base Quarter. 1. The Base Quarter is defined as the quarter beginning six months prior to the quarter in which the supplemental payments are being distributed. (For the quarter beginning October 1, 2011, the supplemental payment computation would be based on actual net revenues and bed days for the quarter April 1 through June 30, 2011.) 2. The total amount available for Supplemental Payments is calculated by multiplying the net revenues from patient services in the Base Quarter by 6 percent. 3. One percent (1%) of this amount each quarter is retained by Nevada Medicaid to pay administrative costs associated with the Suppl emental Payment Program. The remaining funds are the amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to free-standing nursing facilities. 4. The amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to free-standing nursing facilities is matched by federal Medicaid funds calculated according to the formula in 42 CFR 433.10 (b). B. Calculation of Fifty Percent of Supplementa l Payments Based on Medicaid Occupancy, MDS Accuracy, and Quality 1. Fifty percent of the amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to Nursing Facilities is paid out based on the facility's Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality scores. 2. Calculations for the Medicaid occupancy a nd MDS accuracy components of Supplemental Payments require bed day counts, which are th e actual bed days repor ted by the free-standing nursing facilities for the Base Quarter. 3. The Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality components are calculated by assigning points to each facility for each component according to the methodologies described below. The unit reimbursement value for each of the component points is TN No. 13-005 Approval Date: August 9, 2013 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. 11-012 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 10b determined by calculating the amount availabl e to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to Nursing Facilities for that compone nt plus the federal Medicaid matching funds and dividing by the total points in the com ponent for all facilities receiving Supplemental Payments for that quarter. Calculation of the Unit Reimbursement Value for a Component Total Dollars Available for Component Divided by Total Points for Component Equals Unit Reimbursement Value for Component 4. Supplemental Payment for Medicaid Occupa ncy, MDS Accuracy, and Quality Components i. Medicaid Occupancy Component: Distribution of 82% of the state funds available for the portion of the Supplemental Paym ents based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matching dollars is based on Medicaid occupancy. The facility receives a Medicaid occupancy rate modifier, which is the Medicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days divided by total occupied bed days times 100. The facility's Medicaid occupancy rate modifier is multiplied by the number of Medicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days to yield the Medicaid occupancy points. The Medicaid occupancy points will be multiplied times the unit reimbursement value to determine the Medicaid occupancy component of the facilities' reimbursement. Calculation of the Facility Specific Medicaid O ccupancy Component of the Supplemental Payment: Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Divided By Facility Total Occupied Bed Days Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Rate Times 100 Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Rate Modifier Times Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Points Times Medicaid Occupancy Component Unit Reimbursement Value Equals Facility Total Medicaid Occupancy Component Payment ii. MDS Accuracy Component: Distribution of nine percent (9%) of the state funds available for the portion of the supplemental payments based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matching dollars are based on MDS accuracy rate from th e most current review performed by Medicaid staff. To qualify for MDS accuracy payments, the facility must have an accuracy rate of 70% or higher. Accuracy rates will be rounded to the nearest TN No. 11-012 Approval Date: April 6, 2012 Effective Date: October 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 10c whole percentage. If the partial percenta ge point is less than 0.5%, it will be rounded down to the next whole percentage point. If the partial percentage point is 0.5% or greater, it will be rounded up to the next whole percentage point. Facilities who qualify for MDS accuracy payments will be assigned an MDS accuracy modifier as follows: Accuracy Rate Modifier 0 - 69% 0 70 - 79% 1 80 - 89% 3 90 - 100% 5 The MDS accuracy modifier is multiplied tim es the number of Me dicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days to determine MD S accuracy points. Each facility's MDS accuracy points will be multiplied by the unit reimbursement value to determine the facility's total reimbursement for MDS accuracy component. Calculation of the MDS Accuracy Component Facility MDS Accuracy Modifier Times Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Equals Facility MDS Accuracy Points Times MDS Accuracy Unit Reimbursement Value Equals Facility Total MDS Accuracy Component Payment iii. Quality Component: Distribution of nine per cent (9%) of the state funds available for the portion of supplemental payments based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matchi ng dollars is based on quality measures. The quality component of the supplemental paymen t provides reimbursement for a facility's efforts to improve resident care and safety. Quality measures are selected from MDS data compiled by the Nevada State Health Division Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance (HCQC). Four quality measures are chosen based on MDS data and input from HCQC and stakeholders. The four quality measures currently selected include: 1) Percent of long-stay residents who have moderate to severe pain; 2) Percent of high risk long-stay residents who have pressure sores; 3) Percent of long-stay residents who had a urinary tract infection; 4) Percent of long-stay residents who lose too much weight. Facilities receive one quality point for each percentage point they are better than the Nevada MDS average for each measure. Quality measure percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percentage. If the partial percentage point is less than 0.5%, it is rounded down to the next whole percentage point. If the partial percentage point is 0.5% or greater, it is rounded up to the next whole percentage point. The facility's total quality points are multiplied by the unit reimbursement value for the quality component to determine the facility specific amount of the quality component of the supplemental payment. Nursing facilities that are identified by TN No. 11-012 Approval Date: April 6, 2012 Effective Date: October 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-D Page 10d the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as Special Focus Facilities are not eligible for the quality component of th e supplemental payments. Special Focus Facilities are nursing homes that have a hist ory of persistent poor quality of care. These nursing homes have been selected for more frequent inspections and monitoring. A current list of Special Focus Facilities is available at the CMS Certification and Compliance website. 5. Facilities that do not have MDS or MDS Accu racy data available have MDS accuracy and quality component payments calculated using th e average component points of all facilities receiving Supplemental Payments for which data is available. Facilities that are not enrolled as Medicaid providers are not eligible for payments of the MDS accuracy or quality components or any other components of this supplemental payment for the quarter. C. Calculation of the Component of the Supplemental Payments Based on Acuity 1. Nursing facility standard per diem reimburse ment is calculated for each Medicaid provider quarterly based on methodology described in th e Medicaid State Plan, Attachment 4.19-D, pages 5a through 5i. The per diem rate is adjusted for acuity and fair rental value. Fifty percent (50%) of the funds av ailable for Supplemental Payments plus the Federal matching funds is paid under this acuity component as described below. Calculation of the Supplemental Payment Portion Based on Acuity The weighted average total amount of reimbursement based on acuity per Medicaid nursing and LTC hospice bed day is calculated by divi ding the total for amount available for the acuity component of Supplemental Payments by the total nursing and LTC hospice bed days in the Base Quarter. This is added to the weighted average budget neutral per diem for all facilities to determine the total amount of reimbursement that will be based on acuity.

The full rate per diem is the amount the facilities would receive if the budget adjustment factor in Nevada Medicaid St ate Plan, Attachment 4.19-D, page 5i, were not applied to the per diem rates. The weighted average portion of reimbursement based on acuity is divided by weighted average full rate per diem to yield a budget adjustment factor for the acuity component of the Supplemental Payment. Total Full Rate Reimbursement for Facilities Receiving Supplemental Payments Divided by Total Nursing and LTC Hospice Days Equals Weighted Average Full Rate Per Diem Weighted Average Portion of Reimbursement Based on Acuity Divided by Weighted Average Full Rate Per Diem Equals Budget Adjustment Factor for Supplemental Payment The budget adjustment factor for supplemental pa yments is applied to the facility specific full rate per diem to arrive at a facility specific unit reimbursement value based on acuity. The facility specific NF per diem rate for each facility is calculated by multiplying the budget adjustment factor describe d in Attachment 4.19-D, page 5i, times the facility specific per diem rate. This budget adjustment fact or also equals the weighted average budget neutral per diem for all facilities divided by the weighted average full rate per diem. The facility specific NF per diem rate is subtracted from the facility specific unit reimbursement value based on acuity to yield the facility specific unit reimbursement value for the Supplemental Payment based on acuity. The facility specific reimbursement unit value for the Supplemental Payment portion ba sed on acuity is multiplied by the number of Medicaid nursing facility and hospice days in th e Base Quarter to determine the quarterly Supplemental Payment based on acuity.

ICFs/MR (non state-operated): a. Prospective Payment Rate: Non state-operated ICFs/MR-Small (\"small\" is defined as facilities having six beds or less) will be paid a prospective payment rate for basic service costs, other than day training costs and property costs, on a per patient day basis. Day training costs and property costs, excluded from the basic prospective rate, will be reimbursed under Medicare principles of retrospective reimbursement as described in paragraph 1 above. 1. The initial basic prospective payment rate per patient day will be the average of costs (excluding residential staff wages and benefits) of the four private ICFs/MR-Small operating a full year, from 1993 audited cost reports. Costs will be indexed to the common time period of December 31, 1993. Residential staff wages and benefits cost is calculated, and added to the average, at the rate of $11 per hour for 6.4 full-time equivalents. The initial rate period is one year from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996. Therefore, the rate will be adjusted for inflation for the period June 30, 1993 - December 31, 1995 (the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the rate period) by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index - All Urban and Clerical Workers (CPI), for calendar year 1993 times 2.5. The initial rate will be effective for private ICFs/MR-Small on July 1, 1995. 2. Rates in effect March 31, 2002, will be continued without adjustment. When rebasing, costs will be indexed to a common point in time, arrayed from highest to lowest, and the cost of the 60 th percentile facility selected. The rate will further be adjusted for inflation by the CPI. Only audited cost reports of private facilities completed by March 31 st of the same year will be used. 3. In addition, the rate will be adjusted fo r increased costs of services over basic inflation resulting from new federal or state guidelines. 4. Day training costs must be approved by the Division of Mental Health Developmental Services (MHDS). These approvals must be obtained annually on all patients and anytime there is an increase in service cost. 5. Property costs consist of a property lease (or in the case of an owned facility, interest and depreciation) as well as depreciation of equipment, property insurance and property taxes. b. Prospective Payment Rate: Non state-operated ICFs/MR-Large (\"large\" is defined as facilities having more than six beds) will be paid an all-inclusive prospective per diem rate equal to the interim rate in effect at December 31, 2003. 1. These all-inclusive rates will be effective for services rendered after December 31, 2003, until the rates are rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services.

'433.138(d)(1)& (d)(3) (1) The Welfare Division has an Interagenc y Agreement with the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, Em ployment Security Division (ESD) for a data match in Bendex tape format. The tape matches names and SSNs of Medicaid recipients with records from ESD. At the time of application for assistance, a match is done automatically on a daily tape and in formation is available to the Eligibility Certification Specialist (ECS) on the com puter screen. After the initial match has occurred, the ECS is alerted with output only if there is a change. This includes any changes for previously unmatched applicants. The Division also receives quarterly wage reports from ESD for matched recipients. The Division is the State IV-A agency. A ll employment information is utilized to determine Medicaid eligibility and employment third party liability (TPL) information is sent to Medicaid's fiscal agen t (FA) for input into the TPL master file. Support Enforcement (IV-D) has an automated quarterly match with ESD's quarterly wage report and can obtain information upon request. IV-D will follow up on court ordered health insurance or will seek a court order on employed non-custodial parents. TPL information on court ordered health insurance is sent to Medicaid's FA for input into the TPL master file. '433.138(d)(4) The Division has an agreement with th e State Industrial Insurance System (SIIS) to tape match Medicaid recipients by name and SSN against the open SIIS claims file. A quarterly report of matched Medicaid recipi ents and open SIIS claims was sent to Medicaid's FA for follow up by the TPL Un it until SIIS inadvertently omitted the production of this report during a major data processing system conversion. The Division has requested re-establishment of this report. The Department of Motor Vehicles and P ublic Safety DMV&PS) has a computerized system containing information of individua ls involved in accidents, associated injuries for Nevada Highway Patrol re ported accidents only. No medical insurance coverage information is reported. (A copy of the letter from DMV&PS is attached.) '433.138(e) The Medicaid claims processing syst em on a per claim basis edits for ICD-9 codes 800 through 999 and E series trauma codes with the following exceptions: TN and 921.3, contusion of eye base 930, eye-related trauma 931-939.9, foreign body, ear, nose, face, scalp, neck 942.22, covers blisters 944.20, covers epidermal agent, medicines 989.5, snake bite 990-995.89, radiation sickness, motion sickness, frost bite 996-998.9, unspecified and not classified elsewhere 999.8, transfusion reaction The exceptions are the unproductive trauma codes Nevada elected to exempt from the list identified in Medicaid Regional Memorandum 93-130. (2) Within 45 days from application, redetermination, or anytime TPL is discovered; the Division verifies TPL coverage, incorporates the information into the eligibility case file and sends the TPL information to Medicaid's FA. The FA inputs the information into the TPL master file weekly to trigger edits for claims processing. (3) N/A: The information is not available through Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety. (4) Claims which edit for ICD-9 trauma codes 800 through 999 and E series with the exceptions listed in paragraph (1) above are referred to the FA Subrogation Unit for follow-up if the billed amount of the claim is gr eater than the tolerance level. The claim is reviewed to determine if the nature of the trauma is one which warrants follow-up (e.g., a broken leg as a result of a fall in i ndividual's own home versus a traffic accident). If an investigation is not in process or pr obable liability has not been established at the time the claim was filed, the investigator w ill begin research to determine if a probable third party is liable. If TPL is not establis hed within 60 days, the claim is processed for payment. Upon discovery of a third party, post payment recovery is sought within 60 days or in the case of extensive legal actions, a lien is filed to protect the State's rights and recoup medical payments. Information regarding probable liability and subrogation is forwarded to the Division ECS unless the information was received from the ECS, maintained in a file by the FA third party recovery unit for subrogation cases, and incorporated into the third party data base for claims processing. The tolerance levels for suspension or termin ation of recovery efforts are identified in Attachment (i) and (g) (2) (i) '433.138(g) (3) (i) and (iii) '433.138(g) (4) (i) through (iii) STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX Attachment 4.22-B STATE OF NEVADA Page 1 THIRD PARTY LIABILITY The Nevada Medicaid program is de signed to function primarily as a cost avoidance system. This method was chosen as the most efficient and l east costly due to the multitude of insurance companies utilized by Nevada residents. Also, insurance data is fed into our bill paying system on an individual basis through our local We lfare district offices. Direct contact is made by the Eligibility Certification Specialist (ECS) with the policy holder or dependent and all available information is collected. However, when necessary, post-payment recovery is also incorporated. Criteria have therefore been established for both systems with emphasis on cost effectiveness and FFP compliance. I. Cost Avoidance - Medical Insurance/Established Casualty Policy a. Claims with Medicaid paid amounts greater than zero are rejected on the remittance advice with insurance billing instructions and carrier information. b. Services identified by individual policies as non-covered are not subject to cost avoidance or recovery. II. Post-Payment Recovery - Medical Insurance a. Recovery From Provider 1. Claims which were unidentified or missed in cost avoidance are subject to a. above. Recovery is made by computer history adjustments. 2. Recovery efforts are not attempted when more than 12 months have elapsed from date of service to the projected adjustme nt date. (Insurance company filing dates rarely exceed this time limit. Also, it becomes increasingly difficult for providers to locate policy holders.) b. Direct Post-Payment Recovery - Insurance Carrier 1. When necessary, direct recovery is attempted through individual insurance carriers. This can occur when providers are unsuccessful with billing attempts, but the fiscal agent (FA) has sufficient information to pursue collection. Claims with Medicaid paid amounts of less than $25 are not pursued. 2. Claims with Medicaid paid amounts of $25 or greater are pursued by the FA through the individual insurance company.

If the billed amount is less than $125, no investigation is initiated unless numerous claims exist for this diagnosis or service date. C. Claims with billed amounts of $125 or more are investigated and followed through the legal process until settlements are reached or a determination made to drop the case.

An advance directive is generally a written statement, which individuals complete in advance of serious illness, about how they want medical decisions made . The two most common forms of advance directive are: - a \"Living Will,\" or \"Declaration\"; - a \"Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.\" An advance directive allows individuals to state their choices for health care or to name someone to make those choices for them, if they beco me unable to make decisions about their medical treatment. In short, an advance directive can enable individuals to make deci sions about their future medical treatment. They can say \"yes\" to treatment they want, or say \"no\" to treatment they do not want. WHAT IS A LIVING WILL OR DECLARATION? A Living Will or Declaration generally states the kind of medical care individuals want (or do not want) if they become unable to make their own decisions. It is called a \"Living Will\" because it takes effect while they are still living. WHAT IS A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE? A \"Durable Power of Attorney fo r Health Care\" is a signed, dated, and witnessed paper naming another person, such as a husband, wife, daughter, son, or close friend as an \"agent\" or \"proxy\" to make medical decisions for an individual who should become unable to make such decisions. The power of attorney includes instructions about any treatment the individua l may want or wish to avoid, such as surgery or artificial feeding. IS IT REQUIRED TO WRITE AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE UNDER THE LAW? No. It is entirely up to the individual. TN 91-23 4.34-A Page 2 CAN AN INDIVIDUAL CHANGE HI S/HER MIND AFTER A LIVING WILL OR HEALTH CARE POWER OF ATTORNEY IS WRITTEN? Yes. Individuals may change or cancel these docum ents at any time in accord ance with state law. Any change or cancellation should be written, signed, and date d in accordance with state law, and copies should be given to the family doctor, or to others to whom the individual may have given copies of the original. If an individual wishes to cancel an advance direc tive while in the hospital, the individual should notify his/her doctor, family, and others who may need to know. Even without a change in writing, wishes stated in pe rson directly to an individual's doctor generally carry more weight than a living will or durable power of a ttorney, as long as the individual can decide and can communicate his/her wishes. The individuals must be sure to state their wishes clearly and be sure that they are understood. This is a form of a \"Declaration,\" provided for under Nevada Statutes: DECLARATION If I should have an incurable and irreversible condition that, without th e administration of life- sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician, cause my death within a relatively short time, and I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I direct may attending physician, pursuant to NR S 449.540 to 449.690, inclusive, and section 2 to 12, inclusive, of this act, to withhold or withdraw tr eatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary for my comfort or to alleviate pain. If you wish to include this statement, you must INITIAL the statement in the box provided. (If the statement reflects your desires, initial the box next to the statement.) I direct my attending physician not to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration by way of the gastrointestinal tract if such a withholding or withdrawal would result in my death by starvation or dehydration.

The Bureau of Regulatory Health Services (bureau) may request the welfare division to deny Medicaid payment to a facility for new admissions if: (a) The facility does not substantially correct the deficiencies within 90 days or within the time required by federal Medicai d law after the facility is notified by the bureau of the deficiencies; or (b) The bureau has cited a facility with substa ndard quality of care (severity score of level three or more and scope of level three or more as defined under federal survey guide-lines) on two of the last three consecutive standard surveys. 2. If the facility achieves and maintains co mpliance with the requirements, the bureau shall request the welfare division to resume payments to the facility prospectively; effective on the date compliance was achieved. Sec. 134 1. The bureau may request the welfare di vision to deny payment to a facility for new admissions who have certain specified diagnoses or special care needs if: (a) The facility is not currently able to provide appropriate care, services, or treatment for these persons; or (b) Caring for these persons will adversely a ffect care provided to other recipients. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 2 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: the facility achieves and maintains co mpliance with the requirements, the bureau must request the welfare division to resume payment to the facility prospectively, effective on the date compliance was achieved. Sec. 135 1. The bureau may request the welfare divi sion to suspend all or part of the Medicaid payments to a facility for services furnished to a Medicaid recipient on or after the date of the deficiency, regardless of whether th e recipient was admitted before, on, or after the date of the deficiency. 2. If the facility achieves compliance with th e requirements, the bureau shall request the department of human resources to resume payments retroactively. CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES Sec. 106 The bureau may impose a monetary penalty alone or in addition to other penalties. The purpose of a monetary penalty is to provide a fund for protecting the h ealth, safety, rights, welfare, and well-being of recipients and the property of residents in facilities and to deter future deficiencies. If a penalty is imposed, the criteria in section 107 below must be applied. Sec. 107 1. Except as otherwise provided in s ubsection 4, the bureau may impose a monetary penalty on any facility that is not in co mpliance with any federal participation requirement, regardless of whether the deficiency constitutes an immediate and serious threat. 2. If a monetary penalty is imposed, the initial penalty based on the severity and scope score of the deficiency must be imposed as provided in section 111 below. 3. In addition to the initial penalty, the bureau may impose a monetary penalty for each day of noncompliance from the date the nonc ompliance occurs or is identified until compliance is veri-fied. 4. A facility is not subject to a monetary penalty for a de minimis deficiency. As used in this subsection, \"de minimis deficiency\" m eans a finding rated as having a severity level of one or two under federal survey guidelines. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 3 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: 1080P/0019P 1. The bureau shall impose an initial pena lty pending a hearing or appeal. The payment of the penalty must not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal. 2. The payment of any daily penalties that accrue while the facility has a hearing pending on the initial determination of deficiencies leading to the imposition of sanctions must be stayed pending the appeal. Sec. 109 If the bureau imposes a monetary penalt y, the penalty must be imposed as provided in sections 109, 110, and 111 of this attachment. In imposing the penalty, the total penalty assessed against any facility bears interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum. Sec. 110 1. In no event may the principal amount of the total daily monetary penalty assessed against any facility exceed $1,000 per deficiency per day. 2. Where more than one deficiency is subject to a monetary penalty, the total daily penalty assessed against a facility may not exceed the maximum daily penalty per facility permitted by 42 U.S.C. ' 1396r for monetary penalties assessed against Medicaid facilities. 3. If the maximum daily administrative penalty per facility permitted by federal law for a facility of the type being sanctioned is le ss than that permitted by 42 U.S.C ' 1396r, the lower maximum penalty amount must be imposed. Sec. 111 1. In determining the amount of an initial penalty, the bureau shall consider the severity alone if the severity level is four. In de termining the amount of the monetary penalty where the severity level is less than four, bot h severity and scope must be considered. In determining whether to impose a daily m onetary penalty, the bureau shall consider the severity and scope and the factors indi cated for increased and decreased penalties provided in sections 112 and 114 of this attachment. 2. For initial deficiencies with a severity leve l of four, an initial monetary penalty of $500 per deficiency must be imposed. In add ition, a penalty of $10 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 4 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: 1080P/0019P 3. For initial deficiencies rated with a severity level of three and a scope level of three or more, a monetary penalty of $400 per defici ency must be imposed. In addition, a penalty of $8 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. 4. For initial deficiencies with a severity level of three and a scope of level of two, an initial monetary penalty of $200 per deficiency must be imposed. In addition, a penalty of $4 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. 5. For initial deficiencies with a severity level of two and a scope level of three, an initial monetary penalty of $100 per deficiency-cy must be imposed. The payment of this penalty must be suspended if the facility ha s corrected the deficiencies within the time specified in the plan of correction. In a ddition, a penalty of $2 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. Sec. 112 1. Penalties must be increased if deficienci es are uncorrected or repeated or compliance is falsely alleged. 2. For each uncorrected deficiency present after the time specified by the bureau for correction of the deficiency, the monetary pena lty must be computed at the rate of one and one-half times the rate that was or could have been assessed initially for a deficiency of that severity and scope 3. For each repeat deficiency present within 18 months after an initial finding of the deficiency, the monetary penalty must be computed at the rate of one and one-half times the rate that was or could have been assessed initially for a deficiency of that severity and scope. 4. The bureau may double the daily penalty that was or could have been assessed if the facility alleges compliance and the bureau finds on a survey that at the time compliance was alleged, the deficiencies continued to exist. Sec. 113 There is a rebuttable presumption that deficiencies identified on a subsequent survey were present on each day between the date of the in itial finding and the date of the subsequent finding. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 5 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: 1080P/0019P Sec. 114 1. If a facility against which a monetary penalty is imposed: (a) waives the right to a hearing; (b) corrects the deficiencies that were the basis for the penalty; and (c) pays the penalty within 15 days after notice of the penalty, the penalty must be reduced by 25 percent and no interest may be charged. 2. If, before a survey by the bureau, the facility identifies and corrects the deficiencies that are the basis for the penalty, the penalty must be reduced by 50 percent and no interest may be charged if the assessment is paid within the time required by sections 52 to 147, inclusive, of this attachment. Sec. 115 If a monetary penalty is assessed on a daily basis according to the number of recipients and the number of recipients fluctuates, the penalty must be computed on the basis of the average daily number of recipients during the thr ee (3) months preceding the imposition of the penalty. Sec. 116 The effective beginning date of a daily monetary penalty is: 1. In the case of an immediate and serious threat, the date the deficiency occurred; and 2. In any other case, the day the deficiency is identified. Sec. 117 1. Daily penalties and interest must be com puted after compliance has been verified or the provider has been sent notice of termination of a license or provisional license. A daily penalty must end on the effective date of co mpliance or termination of the license of the facility. 2. If a provider achieves complia nce, the bureau shall send a separate notice to the facility containing: (a) The amount of penalty per day; (b) The number of days involved; ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 6 TN No. due date of the penalty; and (d) The total amount due. 3. If a license of a facility is to be term inated, the bureau shall send the information required by subsection 2 in the notice of termination. 4. If the bureau's decision of noncompliance is upheld on appeal or the facility waives its right to a hearing, the monetary penalty must be imposed for the number of days between the effective date of the penalty and the date of correction of the deficiencies or, if applicable, the date the license of the facility is terminated. Sec. 118 1. The daily accrual of a monetary penalty must end if the facility demonstrates that substantial improvements have been made to correct the deficiencies and that the health, safety, and well-being of recipients are adequately protected and safeguarded. 2. A monetary penalty may be imposed on a da ily basis for no longer than six (6) months, after which the bureau shall deny, suspend, or revoke the license of the facility and, if the facility is a Medicaid facility and major deficiencies remain, request the welfare division to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement of the facility. 3. If a deficiency in a Medicaid facility pres ents an immediate and serious threat and continues to exist on the 23rd day following the appointment of temporary management, the bureau shall request the we lfare division to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement of the facility. 4. If the provider can supply credible ev idence that substantial compliance with participation requirements was attained on a date preceding that of the survey, monetary penalties accrue only until that date of correction for which there is credible evidence. As used in this subsection, \"c redible evidence\" mean s actual documentation that compliance has been achieved. Sec. 119 1. Initial penalty assessment payments are due within 15 days after notice of the penalty and must be paid irrespective of any administrative appeal. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 7 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: 1080P/0019P 2. The daily monetary penalty is due and must be paid within 15 days after compliance is verified or termination of a license is eff ective and the facility is notified of the amount of the total daily penalty due. 3. If the facility has appealed a decision impos ing a monetary penalty, the daily penalty is due and must be paid after the final admi nistrative decision is rendered and 15 days after the facility has been notified of th e amount of the total daily penalty due. Sec. 120 1. If the facility fails to pay a moneta ry penalty, the health division may suspend the license of the facility. 2. The health division shall provide proper notice of its intent to suspend the license of the facility. 3. If the facility fails to pay the penalt y, including any additional costs incurred in collection of the penalty, within 10 days afte r receipt of the notice, the health division shall suspend the license of the facility. Th e suspension must not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal. Sec. 121 Any costs, including attorney's fees, incu rred by the bureau or the health division in the collection of any monetary penalty may be recovered from the facility. Sec. 122 1. The amount of any penalty owed by a Me dicaid facility, if it has been determined, may be deducted from any money otherwise owed to the facility by the welfare division. 2. If the facility does not pay a monetary pena lty by the date it is due and no extension of time to pay is granted, the administrator of the health division shall notify the administrator of the welfare division of th e amount of the penalty due and owing and shall request withholding of the amount owed. 3. The administrator of the welfare division w ill take the appropriate steps to withhold the amount of the penalty owed, including any in terest and costs of collection, from the Medicaid payment otherwise due the facility. Money so withheld must be remitted to the health division for deposit in the speci al fund established pursuant to section 124 below. Money withheld for costs of collec tion must be applied by the administrator of the health division to the account incurring the costs. ATTACHMENT 4.35-A Page 8 TN No. 90-13 Approval Date: HCFA ID: 1080P/0019P Unless it is waived as provided in secti on 114, interest at the rate prescribed in NRS 449.163 will be assessed on the unpaid balance of the penalty, beginning on the due date. Sec. 124 1. Unless otherwise required by federal la w, money collected by the health division as administrative penalties must be deposited in to a separate fund and applied to the protection of the health, safety, well-be ing, and property of recipients, including residents of facilities that the health division finds deficient. 2.

TN No. 93-3 Approved Date: May Employee Education About False Claims Recoveries a. The Medicaid agency meets the require ments regarding establ ishment of policies and procedures for the education of em ployees of entities covered by section 1902(a)(68) of the Social Security Act (the Act) regarding false claims recoveries and methodologies for oversight of entitie s' compliance with these requirements. 1. Definitions. a. An \"entity\" includes a governmental agency, organization, unit, corporation, partnership, or other business arrangement (including any Medicaid managed care organization, irrespective of the form of business struct ure or arrangement by which it exists), whether for-profit or not -for-profit, which receives or makes payments, under a State Plan approved under title XIX or under any waiver of such plan, totaling at least $5,000,000 annually. If an entity furnishes items or services at more than a single location or under more than one contractual or other payment arrangement, the provisions of section 1902(a)(68) apply if the aggregate payments to that entity meet the $5,000,000 annual threshold. This applies whether the entity submits claims for payments using one or more pr ovider identification or tax identification numbers. A governmental component provi ding Medicaid health care items or services for which Medicaid payments are made would qualify as an \"entity\" (e.g., a stat e mental health facility or school district providing school-based health services). A government agency which merely administers the Medicaid program, in whole or part (e.g., managing the claims processing system or determining beneficiary eligibility), is not, for these purposes, considered to be an entity. An entity will have met the $5,000,000 annual threshold as of January 1, 2007, if it received or made payments in that amount in Federal fiscal year 2006. Futu re determinations regarding an entity's responsibility stemming fr om the requirements of section 1902(a)(68) will be made by January 1 of each subsequent year, based upon the amount of payments an entity either received or made under the State Plan during the preceding Federal fiscal year. TN No.07-004 Approval Date May 25, 2007 Effective Date January 1, 2007 Supersedes TN No. NEW 79y.2 State: Nevada b. An \"employee\" includes any officer or employee of the entity. c. A \"contractor\" or \"agent\" incl udes any contractor, subcontractor, agent, or other person which or who, on behalf of the entity, furnishes, or otherwise author izes the furnishing of, Medicaid health care items or services , performs billing or coding functions, or is involved in th e monitoring of health care provided by the entity. 2. The entity must establish and di sseminate written policies which must also be adopted by its contractors or agents. Written policies may be on paper or in electronic form, but mu st be readily available to all employees, contractors, or agents. The entity need not create an employee handbook if none already exists. 3. An entity shall establish written policies for all employees (including management), and of any contractor or agent of the entity, that include detailed information about the False Claims Act and the other provisions named in section 1902(a)(68)(A). The entity shall include in those written policies detailed informati on about the entity 's policies and procedures for detecting and preven ting waste, fraud, and abuse. The entity shall also include in any employee handbook a specific discussion of the laws described in the written policies, the rights of employees to be protected as whistleblowers and a sp ecific discussion of the entity's policies and procedures for detectin g and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. 4. The requirements of this law should be incorporated into each State's provider enrollment agreements. 5. The State will implement this State Plan amendment on January 1, 2007. b.
