Geographically, it is bordered by China to the Nort h, Cambodia and Laos to the East and the South China Sea to the West. The country consists of 64 p rovinces and four regions: the Northern, Central, Highlands and Southern parts. In 2010, the populati on was estimated at 87 million [1]. The gross national income (GNI) per capita was US$ 1,010 in 2 009 [1]. The estimated health expenditure in 2008 was 7.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP), with government expenditure accounting for only 38.5% of total expenditure for health [2]. Vietnam was ra nked 113 on the Human Development Index 1 with a life-expectancy of 75 years in 2010. The under-five mortality rate was 19 per 1,000 live births [3]. The Vietnamese health system is a mixed public-priv ate provider system, in which the public sector plays a major role in healthcare provision, policy making, research and training. The private sector h as grown steadily since the health sector reform in 19 89, but is mainly active in outpatient care while inpatient care is still provided through the public sector. The healthcare network is organized under state administrative units: central, provincial, district , commune and village levels, with the Ministry of Health coordinating at the central level. In the public se ctor, there are 774 general hospitals, 136 speciali zed hospitals and 11,576 primary health centers [4]. As of 2008, the number of doctors, nurses and pharmacists per 1,000 inhabitants was 0.65, 0.78 an d 0.12, respectively [4]. The uniqueness of the Vietnamese health system is characterized by the es tablishment of the grassroots healthcare network, which provides health services at the lowest levels , (i.e. commune and district). It is the foundation for healthcare achievements highlighted by the attainme nt of national healthcare goals for the entire population. A milestone was the delivery of healthc are services to the people in the most remote regions, that are highly inaccessible and where tra nsport is difficult. Additionally, the contribution from the private sector to the Vietnamese health system has increased remarkably during the past two decades since the health care reform, highlighted b y the presence of 83 private hospitals, accounting for ~8.2% of the total number of hospital nationwid e thus far [4].This helps to reduce the overload of patients in public hospitals in Vietnam. The goals of Vietnam's health system is to provide curative care of diseases, preventive care through immunization, training and education of the healthc are workforce and developing health policies. In th is thesis, I focus on the immunization strategies in V ietnam and explicitly on the health economics of immunization strategies against selected diseases, applying new and underused vaccines. Immunization is a very important part of the public health in Vietnam and the immunization system is organized from the lowest level of the health syste m (so-called the commune health center). In very remote areas where transport is cumbersome and not easily accessible, outreach posts and mobile services are additionally provided. Due to limited human resources for health especially in rural and remote regions, the majority of immunization in Vie tnam is provided through fixed immunization days 1 The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary comp osite index that measures a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human develo pment: health, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 9 (~2 days per month) at community health centers. Ho wever, in bigger cities, immunization services are provided daily. Universal vaccination against selec ted diseases is implemented through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), which is centrally run by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) [5]. Figure 1 describes the ope rational structure of the National Expanded Programme on Immunization. Z Expanded Programme on Immunization The EPI in Vietnam was established to promote and p rovide free universal childhood immunization. The program started in 1981 and is one of the most succ essful national priority health programs. In 1989 t he goal of universal childhood immunization in Vietnam was achieved, with a national coverage of 87%. At present, there are 9 vaccines tion cholera, Japanese encephalit is (JE) and typhoid. Some are generally administered o n a national level and others are administered in high risk areas only (Table 1). In addition, the government of Vietnam has set up s everal national EPI goals to be achieved by 2012, which include achieving universal immunization at a national coverage of 90% of children; maintaining the nation's polio-free status; eliminating materna l and neonatal tetanus, eliminating measles; achiev ing hepatitis B control by 2012, and introducing new va ccines such as rotavirus vaccines [5;6]. The scope of this thesis is to focus on health econ omic aspects of the implementation of hepatitis B vaccination, which has been universallyimplemented in Vietnam since 2002, and of rotavirus vaccination, which ispotentially included in the EP I in the near future. In particular, the rotavirus vaccine has recently been recommended by the World Health O rganization (WHO) on universal implementation worldwide. Hepatitis B immunization Epidemiology The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prev alent blood borne viruses worldwide and is a major cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [7;8]. Vietnam is a high-endemic country of HBV infection. Several epidemiological s tudies carried out in Vietnam showed that the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg) carriers is between 8.8% and 20.5% across different populations and regions in Vietnam [9;10] . Therefore, with the population estimated at 87 million in 2010 [1], a large number of Vietnamese p eople will be at risk of premature death due to HBV infection. In addition to the costly antiviral ther apy to treat chronic hepatitis B infection, HBV immunization has become one of the best preventions against the disease. Therefore, in 1992, the WHO recommended that all countries should include u niversal HBV vaccination in their national immunization programs [11].

Initially a locally pr oduced vaccine was used, but supply constraints limited it s usage to a small number of districts. Financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and I mmunization (GAVI) enabled the introduction of hepatitis B vaccine (produced outside of Vietnam) o n a national level, covering about half of the dist ricts in 44 provinces in 2002, and the remaining district s in these provinces in 2003. Locally produced vaccine is still used in the other 17 provinces. Ho wever, universal HBV immunization was only completed by mid-2003 in Vietnam. In particular, th e hepatitis B third dose coverage increased from less than 20% in 2000 to more than 90% in 2005 [12] . In the meanwhile, the policy on hepatitis B birth dose was gradually changed from administration with in 3 days of birth to less than 24 hours after birt h, according to the WHO recommendation [12]. Universal hepatitis B immunization will support the regional hepatitis B control goal to reduce HBsAg+ prevalence to 2% in under-5 year children by 2012 [13]. Rotavirus immunization Epidemiology Diarrhoea is a leading cause of child mortality and rotavirus has been identified as the most common cause of severe diarrhoea [14;15]. A large share of the mortality and morbidity caused by diarrhoea occurs in developing countries such as Vietnam [16] . Results from a sentinel surveillance network for rotavirus conducted in six major hospitals in four principal cities in Vietnam in 1998 showed that rotavirus was detected in 56% of all under five-yea r-old children, who were hospitalized for severe diarrhea [16;17]. The national data indicate that a pproximately 15.4% of all deaths among these children are due to diarrhoea. If rotavirus were as sociated with one quarter or one half of these diarrhoeal deaths, the yearly rotavirus-associated deaths among under five-year-old children would be between 4%-8% or, correspondingly, 1 in every 300 c hildren would die of rotavirus-related diarrhoea [16;17]. With the 2010 birth cohort of more than 1, 550,000 newborns, the risk for children to suffer f rom rotavirus-related morbidity and mortality would be very high. Immunization Currently, rotavirus vaccines have not yet been int roduced in the EPI in Vietnam although two worldwide-approved rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq\u00ae (Me rck) and Rotarix TM (Glaxo Smith Kline), have been available since 2006 [18;19]. These vaccines h ave demonstrated good protection against rotavirus infection and against rotavirus-related severe diar rhoea [20-22]. Studies on rotavirus immunization using either these vaccines have proved their effec tiveness in potentially protecting the lives of nea rly 2 million children in the next decade alone [23] as w ell as its acceptable economic impacts to countries ' healthcare systems. Therefore, the WHO has expanded its recommendations to include rotavirus vaccines into countries' immunization programs [24] . Importantly, the WHO and the GAVI have committed to provide financial support to developin g countries such as Vietnam in expediting the introduction of such vaccines [24;25]. CHAPTER 1 12 ZAim and Outline of the Thesis The general aim of this thesis is providing an over all picture of the cost-effectiveness of the curren t universal hepatitis B immunization and the recommen ded universal rotavirus immunization in the developing world with a specific focus on Vietnam a s the example. The actual analyses are carried out to evaluate the cost-effectiveness results using Vi etnam's epidemiological and costing data. In the absence of local data, data from other countries, w here the epidemiology of hepatitis B and rotavirus are the most similar to Vietnam, have been used. Al l cost-effectiveness analyses are performed using Markov models. Based on the cost-effectiveness resu lts on universal immunization against hepatitis B and rotavirus, recommendations are provided to Viet namese health decision-making authorities in order to find appropriate ways for sustaining immunizatio n, appropriate policies to support the success of t he EPI program are proposed and evidence is provided s upporting applications for external funding from the international health community. The thesis is structured into two parts. In Part I the epidemiology and economics of hepatitis B immunization in developing countries are presented, with a focus on Vietnam. In particular, chapter 2 is a comprehensive review of hepatitis B immunization programs in developing countries. Cost- effectiveness results of immunization strategies in the developing world are summarized to provide information on the success and challenges that deve loping countries have achieved and encountered during the implementation of universal hepatitis B immunization. The chapter sets the scene for the original studies presented in the subsequent chapte rs. Chapter 3 presents a cost-of-illness study of chronic hepatitis B in Vietnam. The study summarize s the financial burden an average Vietnamese would bear when being chronically infected with hep atitis B, as well as the cost burden incurred to th e health system of Vietnam regarding the disease in i ts various stages. In chapter 4 a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to assess results of the cur rent universal hepatitis B immunization in Vietnam. In this study, additionally a cost-effectiveness af fordability curve was derived to propose different budgetary thresholds at which hepatitis B immunizat ion would become both cost-effective and affordable for the Vietnamese government. For compa rison, a contrasting picture of the hepatitis B situation in a developed country, the Netherlands w as provided as an annex to this chapter. In this annex, information on drug utilization for the trea tment of chronic hepatitis B was presented using information on drug use from pharmacy-dispensing da ta from community pharmacies in northern Netherlands. The data were obtained from the Univer sity of Groningen's IADB.nl database (www.iadb.nl ), which harbours information on drug utilization f rom 55 community pharmacies and covers more than 500,000 people since 1999. Additio nally, the methodology for pharmacy data gathering was applied to Vietnam, enabling the afor ementioned cost-of-illness study in chapter 3. Part II of the thesis discusses the potentials and challeng es of implementing rotavirus immunization in developing countries, again with a focuson Vietnam. Chapter 5 provides an overview of cost- effectiveness results of universal rotavirus immuni zation in the developing world once the vaccine is officially included in countries' immunization prog rams. Cost-effectiveness results of immunization strategies in the developing world are summarized t o provide information on the effectiveness and GENERAL INTRODUCTION 13 challenges that developing countries would achieve and encounter if the vaccine were introduced based on the WHO's recommendations. The chapter also emph asizes the important role of the GAVI in assisting developing countries to introduce rotavir us vaccines. To resolve several challenges faced by developing countries in carrying out rigorous studi es on cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination, chapter 6 provides an overview of several cost-effectiveness models on rotavirus vaccination, which would eventually benefit middle and low-income coun tries in designing cost-effectiveness analyses using new or adapting existing models. In a more el aborated and practical fashion, chapter 7 presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of rotavirus vaccinat ion in Vietnam using one of the economic models recommended in chapter 6 . The study presents the results of rotavirus vacci nation in Vietnam as well as challenges faced by the Vietnamese health sector if vaccination were introduced in the future. Finally, in chapter 8 the main findings of the studies as presented in t he previous chapters are summarized and discussed and an outlook and future perspectives are given. In more details, challenges and limitations faced by developing coun tries in estimating the cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions for infectious diseases ar e pointed out. More importantly, suggestions on how to improve the quality of cost-effectiveness studie s are suggested. Recommendations are also provided to aid health decision-making in Vietnam and other developing countries for a sustainable and good immunization program against infectious diseases in children in the future.

Tu Herman J. Woerdenbag Sumit Kane Arthorn Riewpaiboorn Marinus 2009; 8(7): 907-920 CHAPTER 2 18 ZSummary Economic evaluations, in particular cost-effectiven ess, are important determinants for policy makers a nd stakeholders involved in decision-making for health interventions. Up until now, most evaluations of cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination have been performed in developed countries. Appropriate health-economic studies on this topic specifically targeted at the developing world are essential in o rder to justify adding another vaccine into the existing Expanded Program on Immunization in these countries. We present a systematic review of econom ic evaluations of vaccination against HBV for developing and less-developed countries. Vaccine pr ice, the discount rate, incidence and prevalence of HBV infection were found to be major drivers of cos t-effectiveness. Data accuracy and reliability were also major issues, with major potentials for improv ement in studies of these countries. The choice between monovalent or combination vaccines (diphter ia, tetanus and polio-hepatitis B) poses new challenges to cost-effectiveness analysis. It is co ncluded that for many developing countries implementation of universal immunization against HB V to reduce the level of endemicity of hepatitis B is an appropriate strategy, and probably cost effectiv e in many settings. Given their limited financial resources, developing countries should properly pla n how to achieve this. Further country-specific economic evaluations and related gathering of high- quality data must be conducted in developing countries in order to raise both public awareness o f the effectiveness and economic attractiveness of universal immunization against HBV. Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 19 Z Introduction HBV is one of the most prevalent blood borne viruse s worldwide, responsible for liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is an important public health problem in developing countries where the endemicity of the disease is generally high or inte rmediate and is less a problem in developed countri es (Table 1). Despite the availability of effective va ccines for two decades, HBV still contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that over 350 million people in the w orld are currently chronically infected with HBV [101]. They are at high risk of death from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer diseases that kill over 1 million peop le each year. The epidemiology of HBV is one of the key factors in determining the cost-effectiveness o f the vaccination program against the virus. Over time, thanks to universal HBV vaccination in develo ping countries, more and more children in these countries benefit from vaccination, which in turn r educes the level of endemicity in high and intermediate-risk countries. In 1992, the WHO recommended that all countries sho uld include universal HBV vaccination in their national immunization programs. In particular, thre e doses of the HBV vaccine should be supplied regardless of the prevalence of infection. The WHO set this target for all highly endemic countries by 1995 and two years later for all other countries [1 02]. However, owing to reasons such as different le vels of endemicity and poor availability of funds for un iversal vaccination, strategies have not been fully implemented across the world. In December 2007, 171 countries had included the HBV vaccine into their national infant immunization programs compare d to 31 countries at the start in 1992 [103]. In various developed countries, HBV vaccination has be en limited to specific risk groups (ethnic minoriti es, healthcare workers, sexual partners of chronically infected persons, homosexual men and children of immigrants from high-endemic countries). In develop ing countries, universal HBV vaccination has mostly been given to newborns and infants, and not yet bee n extended to other groups such as adolescents owing to the financial limitations. However, hepati tis B continues to be an important public health problem in these areas because the infection is spr ead by maternal transmission at birth. Children in the poorest countries do not receive HB V vaccines because their governments cannot afford it (high vaccine prices compared to limited budgets given to the health sector), the poor healthcare infrastructure (vaccine storage facilities, deliver y systems) and there is a lack of effective public health policies. Recently, however, with the support of th e Global Alliance of Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), vaccines have been made available for many developing and less-developed countries [104]. Thus far, little is known about cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of vaccination against HBV in the developing world as compared to the developed world . Very few such studies have assessed hepatitis B immunization in developing countries. This review aims to give a systematic view on HBV vaccination, with a focus on developing countries and economic e valuation. The paper summarizes the results and methodologies of the formal CEA and other economic evaluations on different HBV vaccination strategies. Furthermore, we analyze the current imp lementation of HBV immunization strategies in developing countries and the constraints (fund avai lability, vaccine costs, and so on) faced by them i n CHAPTER 2 20 attempts to introduce HBV vaccine into their routin e immunization programs. Up front, we realize that divergent results on cost-effectiveness ratios of v arious immunization strategies might sometimes be related to methodological issues in economic evalua tions, in addition to other aspects such as demography, cultural characteristics and prevalence of HBV. Intuitively, for developing countries, vaccine price is among the most critical factors an d cost-effectiveness is key in deciding upon the introduction of the vaccine into the national Expan ded Program on Immunization (EPI). This review concludes with an explanation of possible options t o assist health policy-makers of developing countri es to formulate appropriate health policies in making this vaccine available to their people in a cost- effective manner.

Keywords for retrieval were total, 202 potentially rele vant articles published between 1993 and 31 January 2008 were retrieved. Figure 1 describes in detail the diagram of the literature search. Eligibility criteria Further eligibility criteria stipulated that: Studies should be strictly classifiable in one of the formal health-economic categories of cost- effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit analys is (CEA, CUA and CBA, respectively); Studies should be written in languages that could be mastered by the authors' team [1] Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 21 Abstracts retrieved from the electronic databases w ere independently screened by two members of the research team (Maarten J Postma and Hong-Anh T Tu). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Studies that were deemed relevant at th is first screening were retrieved in full-text form at and screened by one reviewer for further eligibilit y. After excluding letters and editorials, 11 diffe rent original articles of research results were identifi ed (Figure 1). Data abstraction Detailed information was abstracted using a pre-spe cified data extraction form. Items of the form included author(s), publication year, country, appr oach, validation/calibration of models, type of sensitivity analysis, perspective and outcome. For our review, we specifically focus on economic m odeling, the perspectives taken (societal vs. healthcare), discount rates, vaccine costs, epidemi ology of HBV and specific immunization strategies (universal vs. selective). Generally, these aspects are well known to reflect important issues in the health-economics of vaccines ZResults General We found 11 relevant studies in total, focusing on the economic evaluation of HBV vaccination in developing countries. Three of the studies [2-4] be long to the Western Pacific Region. Data shows that CHAPTER 2 22 the Western Pacific Region accounts for 50% of deat hs from hepatitis B despite the fact this region on ly accounts for one third of the world's population [5 ]. All countries in this region have introduced HBV immunization into their national vaccination progra mmes. The region has set 2012 as the target date fo r reducing the current level of endemicity of 8%-10% to less than 2% among children under five years old and to less than 1% as the final goal [106]. Three studies come from India [1, 6, 7], a country of intermediate endemicity of HBV. Four out of 11 stu dies [8-11] are from Africa. All of African countri es involved in these studies were eligible for GAVI fu nd support. In Africa, by 2000 only six countries h ad introduced the HBV vaccine into their national immu nization programmes, however, 25 additional countries implemented vaccination in 2005. The Afri can region has set a goal of integrating the hepati tis B vaccine into the national immunization programmes of all countries in the region by 2009 [12]. One study originated from Iran [13] in the Middle East\" . The oldest paper that emerged from our search was f rom 1993 [11] dealing with an analysis of costs and benefits of HBV vaccination in China and the mo st recent one was from 2007 [8], addressing the economic evaluation of HBV vaccination in low-incom e countries, using cost-effectiveness analysis inclusive affordability curves. Most of the develop ing countries under study could be classified into intermediate or high endemicity (Table 1). The most relevant aspects of these studies are summarized in Table 2. Study Characteristics Depending on the level of endemicity of HBV across countries as well as on the fund availability for implementing hepatitis B immunization, the choice o f the specific immunization strategy can be either universal or targeted (selective). Universal vaccin ation strategies were evaluated in 8 of the 11 stud ies. All focused on universal vaccination of newborns an d infants. Targeted vaccination strategies were evaluated in 2 of the 11 studies (i.e. vaccination of high-risk groups). One study did not specificall y focus on either strategy but rather performed an in ventory of potential cost components. Specific vaccination strategies differed on details among these studies. In particular, the difference s related to the exact comparisons made in the analys es. These aspects are summarized in Table2 . Detailed Results on Economic Evaluations of Hepatit is B Immunization Strategies against HBV Universal Vaccination Prevention of HBV infection by universal vaccinatio n has long been recognized as an effective means for reducing healthcare costs associated with the d isease [14]. The effectiveness of universal HBV immunization programmes has been demonstrated in ma ny countries; epidemiological data and economic evaluations have shown that universal HBV vaccination is potentially highly cost-effective. However, universal vaccination is still being postp oned in many countries such as in the UK, the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands [15], al so due to uncertainties on the actual cost- effectiveness of the vaccine. From a healthcare poi nt of view, one could argue that vaccinating the entire population to prevent the transmission of th e virus, potentially leads to reducing the burden o f various hepatitis B-related diseases. Below, we bri efly summarize all studies included in our review. Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 23 Kim et al. analyzed the situation in the Gambia, being the fir st African country in which HBV immunization was introduced on a routine basis to n ewborns, in 1990 [8]. Striking in this study was th e use of cost-effectiveness affordability curves, whi ch gave probabilities of a vaccination programme to be both cost-effective and affordable by showing diffe rent acceptability thresholds. A multivariate uncertainty analysis was conducted to drive the aff ordability curve and showed the probability of an affordable programme under different budget options . This is the only study in the review, which applied formal cost-effectiveness affordability curves. T he cost-effectiveness affordability curves can also pr ovide information to decision makers for choosing a proper vaccine programme while facing uncertainties about the health and economic outcomes of such a programme, as well as of the resources required t o make the programme run. The authors concluded that it was cost-effective for universal infant vac cination to be implemented in the Gambia when cost- effectiveness thresholds exceeded US$ 97 per DALY a verted and not cost-effective when the thresholds were less than US$ 25 per DALY averted ( the Gambia's per-capita GDP equals approximately US$ 300). With an estimated US$47 per DALY averted, from a payer's perspective, the possibility of the programme being cost-effective w ould be 65%. Vimolket et al. [2] conducted of mate rnal HBsAg screening and vaccinating at-risk babies in Thailand. Four vaccin ation strategies were suggested: screening all pregnant women for HBsAg, vaccination plus HBIG to those who have HBsAg positive (1); screening all pregnant women for HBsAg and HBeAg (if HBsAg+) and providing the vaccine and HBIG to those HBeAg+ (2); universal vaccination of all neonates ( 3); and no vaccination (4). Assessing these four strategies, the authors recommended that universal newborns vaccination to be continued, as the cost- effectiveness per case prevented was lowest (US$ 37 .76) compared to the other alternatives. The authors emphasized that if the funds were available , the second strategy would be additionally worthwhile since it both promoted universal vaccina tion and protected at risk newborns to HBsAg+ mothers with both vaccination and provision of HBIG . This will certainly increase the efficacy of the overall HBV prevention programme. However, this in turn raises the issue of supplying HBIG and equipments for HBsAg pregnant mothers, which may re flect major constraints in many developing countries. Different from the study in Gambia, the study did not analyze any cost-effectiveness thresholds to further guide decisions on funding im munization strategies against HBV. Griffiths et al. [22] performed the first cost-effectiveness study of a health intervention in Mozambique [9]. Mozambique receives support from the GAVI in t he introduction of HBV vaccine. However, in the long run the country itself has to finance the vacc ine procurement. The authors wanted to calculate th e cost-effectiveness of introducing the HBV vaccine i nto the national immunization programme. A strong point of this study is the application of a model d esigned for WHO in estimating disease burden caused by HBV, which helps to calculate exact numbers of d eaths averted by age and sex due to the introduction of HBV vaccine in the Mozambique. A fu rther advantage of the model is the limited amount of data required for specific calculations. Cost pe r DALY averted and the number of deaths averted annually were used as the outcomes. The incremental costs of introducing the combination vaccine CHAPTER 2 24 (DPT-Hepatitis B) and monovalent hepatitis B vaccin e were calculated. The authors convincingly showed that the monovalent vaccine against HBV was more cost-effective than the combined vaccine of DPT and HBV (US$15 and US$36 per discounted DALY averted, respectively or US$178 and US$436 per death averted, respectively). It was als o estimated that nationwide 4,000 deaths were averted per annum by the introduction of the vaccin e. Aggarwal et al. elaborated on the cost-effectiveness of universal HBV immunization of newborns for low-income and intermediate endemic countries using a Markov model [1]. The study showed that universal vaccination against HBV in early childhoo d reduced the hepatitis B carrier rate from 4% to 1.15%. Estimated life expectancy and QALY gains wer 0.173 and QALY were US$16.27 and US$13.22, respectively. Compared to the GDP per cap ita in India, these figures show that universal immunization against HBV may be highly cost-effecti ve. The authors also emphasized that the results from this study could be used for other low-income and intermediate-endemic countries that are comparable to India and thus help health administra tors of those countries in decision making regardin g universal HBV vaccination. However, the study also stressed some constraints in conducting this type o f research. In particular, this concerned limited ava ilable data in low-income and intermediate-endemic countries on diseases progression, absence (of info rmation on) treatment of hepatitis B complications and the cost components building a cost-effectivene ss analysis of HBV vaccination. For example, this specific study had to use data from other regions s uch as disease progression data from high-endemic and low-income countries. In another study focusing on India, Prakash address ed a different point of view [7]. Instead of conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis per se, Pr akash analyzed crucial parameters potentially affecting cost-effectiveness of universal HBV immun ization. India is classified as a country of intermediate to high hepatitis B endemicity with a prevalence rate of 2.5-10% [16]. Costs of the vacci ne and vaccine efficacy were important factors influen cing the analysis. Vaccine price per pediatric dose was around US$0.75 if purchased through EPI program me. If the costs of the vaccine could be reduced to US$0.60, the cost per DALY averted would be redu ced another approximate 5%. At the time of this study, India had not integrated the HBV vaccine int o the national EPI due to its large population and the relatively high vaccine price. Also, HBV prevalence was rather intermediate than high by that time [17 ]. These sheer numbers raised the question of how to m ake universal hepatitis B immunization in India implementable and cost-effective. Targeted immuniza tion did not seem to be a feasible option for an overpopulated country as India since it would not r elevantly affect transmission and only achieve limi ted prevention in an at-risk subpopulation (such as new borns to hepatitis B-infected mothers). In contrast to the two above-mentioned Indian studi es, Sahni et al. shifted the analysis towards cost- benefit of universal immunization against HBV [6]. They compared selective vaccination against HBV given to newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers and uni versal vaccination given to all newborns. The authors argued that in the particular context of In dia - where 65% of mothers delivered at home - universal HBV vaccination of newborns was not cost- beneficial because the discounted cost of saving Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 25 each QALY (Rs 259,610 or US$ 5,192; at 3% discount rate) was ten times higher than the per capita GNP (Rs 20,250 or US$ 405). It was concluded that u niversal immunization was not cost-beneficial if compared with selective immunization. In another cost-benefit analysis from 1995, Liu et al. concluded that universal vaccination in China would be cost-saving with BCRs 2 between 42.41 and 48.01 [3]. The study analyzed ma ss vaccination of all newborns in Jinan City in 1990. The author anal yzed three different strategies: (i) screening and vaccination of all newborns born to HBsAg+ mothers with 3x10\u00b5g vaccine; (ii) screening and vaccination of only those children born to HBsAg+ m others with a relatively high dosage (3x30\u00b5g); and (iii) vaccination of all newborns with a normal dos age. The administration of vaccination to newborns was assumed at 0, 1 and 6 months, respectively. The second strategy appeared to be the most cost- beneficial strategy. Yet, the other two strategies also seemed very beneficial, and the study conclude d that if there was enough supply of HBV vaccines, al l newborns should be vaccinated. The Gambia was one of the African countries that ac tively introduced the hepatitis B vaccine into its national immunization programme in 1986. Hall et al. calculated that adding the hepatitis B vaccine to the EPI in Gambia would increase the marginal cost to US$4.2 per child for three doses of vaccine [11] . Similar to other studies, vaccine price contributed the biggest part in the increase of the total cost of the EPI programme (80%). The study showed that through vaccination against HBV, the cost per averted death from liver cancer would be between US$150-200 , which would be comparable with other EPI vaccines. It was obvious in the study that vaccine price per dose was the major factor which could be manipulated to improve cost-effectiveness. A combin ed vaccine against DPT and hepatitis B could reduce the vaccine price and improve the cost-effec tiveness by hedging the cost of labeling and administration (for example, personnel costs, stora ge and supplies). At the time the Gambia's study wa s conducted, the GAVI fund did not yet exist and the study did not clearly show if hepatitis B vaccinati on was cost-effective. However, 13 years later, when K im at al. conducted another study in the Gambia, routine immunization was estimated to be very cost- effective in that country [8]. These authors concluded that vaccinating infants against HBV redu ces the burden of HBV-related diseases by more than 80%. All universal HBV vaccination programmes discussed in this review were done on newborns and infants (8 studies) [1,2,5-9,11]. Universal vaccination of newborns was generally considered cost-effective an d appropriate for the control of HBV infection in reg ions of medium and high endemicity, which is the ca se in most developing countries. A further common conc lusion from all of the studies was that vaccine price was an important and critical factor influenc ing cost-effectiveness and the decision of health administrators of respective countries to introduce the vaccine in their national immunization programmes. Results also showed that EPI programmes could effectively facilitate the implementation of HBV immunization through discount procurement of the vaccine with the support from GAVI, 2 BCR is the ratio of the benefits of a project relat ive to its costs. For the BCR, both benefits and co sts are expressed in monetary terms. CHAPTER 2 26 extending vaccine coverage through administration t ogether with DPT, and using existing facilities set up within the EPI framework. However, the combinati on vaccine DPT-hepatitis B cannot be used \"at birth\", because the pertussis component is contra-i ndicated until 6 weeks of age. Thus, if countries w ant to use the combined of DPT- hepatitis B vaccine, th e birth dose would be monovalent hepatitis B vaccine, and from the second dose onwards the combi ned vaccine can be used. The other option would be to start the vaccination series from the six wee ks onwards with the combined vaccine. Targeted Vaccination Two of the studies included in this review focused specifically on target groups: pre-marriage couples in Iran [12], and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army in China [3]. In the study from Iran, Adibi et al. were convinced that in the Iranian society, target ed vaccination of pre- marriage couples was an effective and feasible way to prevent virus transmission [12]. The study underpinned that targeted immunization did help to protect this at-risk population (at the time this s tudy was conducted, Iranian children of 10 years or olde r had not received HBV vaccination). Two strategies to reduce HBV infections were tested: (i) HBsAg scr eening to find those would-be couples that are HBsAg positive and provide them with HBV vaccinatio n, single dose HBIG and condoms; and (ii) HBsAg screening as in the first strategy in additio n to HBcAb screening in HBsAg negative spouses of HBsAg + persons followed by the same protocol to HB cAb negatives. The first strategy was found a bit more expensive than the second (US$ 202 vs. US$ 197 ). However, the authors yet seemed to favor the first strategy because it consisted of fewer steps and would be easier to manage. In the most recent Chinese study on HBV, Hu et al. did an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against HBV targeted at soldiers servin g in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) [3]. To identify the optimal vaccination strategy, the auth ors evaluated two different strategies: (i) immedia te vaccination; and (ii) screening and vaccination. Bo th were compared with no vaccination. DALYs were used to assess the effectiveness of the respective strategies. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 men and women was monitored for 5 years and separated into four groups according to age (15-20; 20-30; 30- 40; >50). It was concluded that screening followed by vaccination was the most cost-effective scheme for this particular population with US$57 per DALY, compared to immediate vaccination with US$61.89 per DALY. It was suggested that the sooner vaccinat ion was implemented the more beneficial it would be for the PLA. This was the only study in the revi ew focusing particularly on adults. It is clear that universal immunization against HBV in developing countries where HBV endemicity is high or intermediate is cost-effective and cost-ben eficial on the long run. However, funding issues an d resource mobilization are still big barriers for de veloping countries. Griffiths et al. came to the conclusion that the full benefits of a vaccination programme w ere only realized after some time (in the case of t he study in Mozambique, it required 40-50 years) [9]. This concern should not distract from the importanc e and urgency of executing a universal or targeted va ccination programme in a given country. Griffiths et al. concluded that targeted vaccination against HBV sh ould only be a temporary solution as long as financial resources are not available to initiate a universal programme [9]. Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 27 One study by Edmunds et al. focused on the analysis of composition of cost com ponents when introducing HBV vaccine into Ethiopia's EPI [10]. T he authors introduced a method for estimating the additional costs incurred of introducing a new vacc ine. It was concluded that the cost of the hepatiti s B vaccine was the majority part of the cost of introd ucing HBV vaccine into the EPI. The cost- effectiveness of HBV vaccine would be most sensitiv e to the vaccine cost. This is the only study, whic h was not focused on either universal or targeted vac cination but on cost composition. General model characteristics Table 3 shows that the vaccine price per pediatric dose ranged from US$0.27 to US$1 for the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine provided that admini stration cost was not included in these vaccine costs. It was shown that through national EPI progr amme, the hepatitis B vaccine could be procured at reduced prices, which helped countries much in intr oducing the vaccine into their national immunizatio n programmes. The adult dose, as shown in the Iran st udy, was much higher at US$4.8 per dose than for newborns. Net costs per health outcome indicator (Q ALY, DALY, LYG, or death averted) were very diverse across countries and studies. These diversi ties could be explained by the selection of differe nt cost base years, epidemiological data, costing tech niques, applied modeling techniques and varying discount rates. Indeed, given the potential large t ime span between HBV infection and hepatitis B disease, there was a big difference between discoun ted and non-discounted outcomes within and across studies. A Markov model was generally used f or disease progression and the typical structure is drawn in Figure 2. Discounting Discounting addresses the issue of translating valu es obtained from one time period to another. Discounting makes current costs and benefits worth more than those occurring in the future because of an opportunity cost to spending money now and there is desire to enjoy benefits now rather than in the future. Cost and benefits, certainly often in case of vaccination, often occur at different point in t ime. For example, in the case of HBV vaccination benefit s are not generated immediately, but obviously only after a period of time, in terms of a reduced incid ence of cirrhosis and liver cancer [18]. CHAPTER 2 28 As summarized in Table 3 three studies used the sam e discount rate of 3% per year for both cost and health effects [7-9], which is in line with the WHO guidelines on discounting [19]. Three studies discussed in this review only discounted costs and not health effects. They all applied the recommended rate of 3%. In a few studies in this re view, health outcomes were both reported discounted and undiscounted in the base case. Two s tudies used 6% only for costs [10,11]. For example, in the Gambia's study by Hall et al. [23]the 6% discount rate was the difference between the interest rate of treasury bills and the national in flation rate in mid-1988 [11]. Three studies [2-4] did not state any discount rate. In the case of Thailand [2 ], the authors only calculated costs and effects fo r one year and discounting was thus not required. Insuffi cient information is available from the two Chinese studies [3,4]. Methodological Issues Study types The studies reviewed in this paper mainly concerned cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and cost- benefit analyses (CBA) (see Table 2). Of the 11 stu dies, eight were cost-effectiveness analyses (i.e. health gains expressed in one-dimensional natural u nits, infections prevented or life-years gained) [1,3,6-11], two were cost-benefit analyses (i.e. he alth gains converted into monetary terms, such as dollars) [2,5], and one analysis combined both tech niques [12]. Some of the CEAs could be further classified as cost-utility analyses or CUAs (i.e. h ealth gains expressed in integrated units adjusted for quality, such as quality adjusted life-years (QALYs ) or DALYs) [3,5-8]. rity of CEAs over CBAs may be that valuing health in mon etary terms is quite difficult. Moreover, cost- minimization analysis (CMA) was only applied in of the study by Edmunds et al. , where CMA was applied next to CEA [10]. The authors mentioned CMA as an instrument to investigate reductions in vaccine price and to show potentials for improving cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination in low-income countries. Most of the studies performed CEAs from a societal perspective except for the study conducted by Kim et al [24], in which a CEA was carried out from both the societal and the healthcare perspectives [8]. The results of the CEAs in our review were quite di vergent, depending on various factors such as the specific vaccination strategies compared, particula r populations considered, outcome measurements used etc. Vimolket et al. [2] and Hu et al. [4] both conducted CEAs of various strategies givin g different results based on the specific context of HBV in Tha iland and China. Different from other studies such as in Hall et al. [11], Griffiths et al. [9] concluded that monovalent vaccines against HBV would be more cost-effective than the combined DPT-Hepatitis B va ccine. The results in this study perhaps could be explained by the context of Mozambique and the devi ation between the procured price of the monovalent vaccine from the combined vaccine. Our f indings in this respect are similar to the conclusions of Beutels in an earlier review [20]. A lthough different methodologies and different types of economic analyses could lead to divergent results e ven for the same country on the short run (e.g. universal vaccination against HBV was cost-effectiv e in India in one study [6] but not if analyzed by Sahni et al. [6]), all authors of studies under review came to t he same conclusion that hepatitis B vaccination was cost-effective in the long-run. Vac cine price was identified as the most influential f actor Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 29 affecting the cost-effectiveness of immunization ag ainst HBV and whether this vaccine was integrated into the national immunization programmes in severa l studies [6,7,9-11]. Modeling approaches Cost-effectiveness analyses in this review used dif ferent modeling approaches. Theoretically, basic typologies of models used in the CEAs concerns stat ic versus dynamic and decision tree versus Markov model (Figure 2). Some studies explicitly used a Markov model, for ex ample, Prakash [7] and Aggarwal et al. [1]. Some problems with these Markov models did emerge. For e xample, in the study by Aggarwal et al. acute or fulminant stages of the disease were not included[1 ]. Moreover, there were few published data on the disease progression rate especially for the low- an d intermediate-income countries to fill the Markov models that were applied. Thus, the authors had to apply rates from other regions. The point of unreliable data on costs of treatment was raised by Griffith et al. [9] in the study for Mozambique. Four studies from Thailand [2], Iran [12] and China [3,4 ] used straightforward decision trees for calculati on. Yet, unable to grasp all the details of more comple x Markov models or even dynamic models, decision trees may certainly provide insights in the crude r elations between costs, savings and health gains within the cost-effectiveness framework. All studies in the review applied static models (se e Table 2). Dynamic transmission models were not applied in these studies. Typically, dynamic models take the spread of infections explicitly into acco unt and generally use formal mathematics to define its structure. Oppositely, in a static model, the force of infection is constant over time (or changes as a fu nction of age or other individual-based factors) [2 1]. In a dynamic model, the probability of an individual a cquiring an infection is dependent on the contact patterns of that individual in the interactions wit h others, the infectiousness of the infection and t he distribution of infections within the population ov er time [21]. Uncertainty analysis Uncertainty analyses have been applied in various s tudies (Aggawal et al. [1], Prakash et al. [7], Kim et al. [8], Griffiths et al. [9], Hall et al. [11]). They were used to deal with different types of uncertainties popular in cost-effectiveness analyses (such as par ameters uncertainty, model uncertainty, and modeling process uncertainty). For example, in the study by Kim et al. , a multivariate uncertainty analysis examined the affordability of a vaccinatio n under different budget options [8]. In Aggawal et al., one way sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simula tion were utilized to examine the robustness of the study's results [1]. In Prakash et al. , parameters uncertainty was inherent, where the ep idemiology was the most crucial factor affecting the cost-effectiv eness of the vaccination programme [7]. In Griffith s et al., probabilistic uncertainty analysis show how much co st-effectiveness ratios can deviate [9]. In this study, cost-effectiveness was found to be most sens itive to the epidemiology of HBV infection and the rate of clearance of HBsAg. In the study by Hall at al. [11], uncertainty analysis was applied to the change of vaccine price [11]. CHAPTER 2 30 ZDiscussion and Policy Recommendation Most of the existing studies on HBV immunization in high- and intermediate-endemic developing countries provide clear evidence that universal HBV immunization of newborns and infants is cost- effective or even cost-saving in comparison with no vaccination. Only one study by Sahni et al. concluded that universal immunization against HBV w as not economically attractive on the short term [6]. The conclusion by Sahni et al. emphasized that countries' traditions (for example , 65% of mothers in India deliver babies at home) might have important impacts on the outcomes of economic evaluations of vaccination programmes. In terms of epidemiology, i n high- and intermediate-endemic countries, universal immunization appears to be the most cost- effective option to combat HBV infection related morbidity. So far few studies on the economic evaluations of H BV vaccination were done in developing countries, thus, the results and conclusions summarized in thi s review might not be representative for the curren t situation in all these countries. Some studies in t he review even date back to the early 90's, e.g. th e study from China [3] in 1995 and the study from Gam bia in 1993 [11]. In these studies, the data might be out-of-date and the current HBV epidemiology in these countries might have changed. In particular, the determinants for designing an appropriate HBV v accination programme depend on many time- varying factors (e.g. epidemiology, funding, demogr aphy, cultural practices, etc). The studies, albeit few in number, have shown that for developing and less-developed countries, it is very important to design an effective and appropria te HBV vaccine policy in order to make the vaccine available for universal immunization against HBV. T o shape such a policy, many determinants should be considered, including both vaccine value and hea lth systems characteristics. Both may be of equal importance in this. Vaccine value characteristics i nclude the disease burden to be prevented, safety a nd performance, and cost effectiveness. For policy mak ers in countries with limited health budgets, disea se burden has been the most important factor in settin g priorities for current and new vaccines to be integrated into the national immunization programme s. In other words, the higher the endemicity, the more urgent and attractive it is to introduce a new vaccine into the routine vaccination programme of the country [22]. The second vaccine value characterist ic relates to safety and performance. One of the concerns for health policy makers is the safety and low rates of side effects when making a decision t o introduce a new vaccine. Hepatitis B vaccine has be en proven to be effective with duration of immunity up to 15 years and with an efficacy up to 75-90% [2 3]. All of the studies in this review also assume a vaccine efficacy of up to 90%. Cost-effectiveness i s the final vaccine characteristic to determine whe ther a vaccine should be introduced. Economic evaluation s and cost-effectiveness analyses help determine if vaccination is economically attractive for the s ociety in the long run and if vaccines' effectivene ss outweighs the costs. Many studies in the review hav e concluded that vaccine price is a critical factor influencing the cost-effectiveness of the immunizat ion programme. The second set of crucial factors considered by pol icy makers relates to the health-system characteristics. An important question is whether t he health care system can support the proposed intervention. For example, is reliable cold storage available and can the required number of doses be Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 31 administered at appropriate times? In the case of t he HBV vaccine, an additional important question to be asked is whether indeed a birth dose can effecti vely be implemented within 48 hours for children from HBV-positive mothers. Thus, introduction of a new vaccine requires a well-functioning infrastructure, including well-trained staff. HBV is moderately to highly endemic in developing a nd less-developed countries. However, lack of financial resources has prevented many countries in the region from launching universal immunization. Thus, all universal immunization strategies against HBV studied in this review were targeted at newborns and infants. Facing such constraints as fi nancial viability, resource limitations, poor healt h infrastructure, universal vaccination against HBV f or adolescents or a wider population, for example i n catch-up settings, could not yet be achieved in the se countries. Certain limitations have been found in the studies throughout the review. In all studies reviewed in t his paper, static models or straightforward calculation s without formal models were used for evaluating th e cost-effectiveness of different immunization strate gies against hepatitis B. Dynamic models were not utilized in any of the studies conducted in this re view, possibly because they required a lot of input data, which is indeed one of the major limitations faced by developing countries. Lack of data is a striking disadvantage of studies conducted in developing cou ntries if compared to studies in developed countries. In particular, several dynamic models we re applied and developed in research for developed countries, such as the study by Kretzschmar et al. [24]. Further limitations refer to different methodologies and a variety of uncertain parameters crucially influenced the results of economic evaluations of the vaccination programmes. One exam ple is the application of the same or of different discount rates for costs and health effects, an iss ue yet to be resolved but imminently influencing outcomes of HBV economic analyses. There are a lot of ongoing debates on whether healt h outcomes/effects and costs should be discounted at the same rate, which should theoretically be so if market perfection exists. Gravelle et al. argued that when health effects are valued in monetary terms as in a CBA, both cost and health effects should be discounted at the same rate [25]. However, when hea lth effects are measured in quantities (QALYs) as in CEAs and the value of health effects increases o ver time, it was argued that health effects should be discounted at a lower rate than costs [25]. Literat ure shows that there are also other economists, who favor using a lower rate for health effects than fo r costs. Parsonage et al . recommended that health effects should be discounted at a lower rate than c ost, which in turn was reflected by the UK Department of Health's recommendations for evaluati on of health interventions during the nineties and early 21 st century [26]. This review is not intended to advis e which discount rates to be used for health and effects, it merely describes which rates have b een applied. It is useful to present both discounte d and non-discounted cost and health effects since th ere are a large difference between results. It assi sts policy-makers in the judgment of a future life agai nst a present investment and consequently makes a suitable decision in choosing the appropriate healt h interventions in a particular country. None of th e studies attempted to use a lower discount rate for health effects. CHAPTER 2 32 A further limitation concerns the data. Different s tudies have addressed the issue of unreliable data of treatment costs on complications of hepatitis B. Li mited data on disease progression rate is available , carrier rate is under reported. For example, studie s also show that due to data limitations, a lot of assumptions were made in analysis (e.g. in Sahni et al. findings in a small part of India was generalized to the whole country; epidemiological data in Aggar wal et al. was gotten from other regions, etc). Generally, Cooper et al . also came to the same conclusion about the differ ent sources of data, the need to make various assumptions on disease progression, non-transparency of identifying input data to use in these models [27] and even the bias created by r esearchers in choosing model structures and parameter values as inputs in models. Another probl em is that none of the studies took the impact of herd immunity into account when estimating the long -term effects of hepatitis B vaccination. It is yet difficult to predict whether its inclusion would in deed drastically further improve cost-effectiveness and with which size. It is obvious that the vaccine price and the type o f vaccine (monovalent or combined DTP-hepatitis B) chosen can be important determinants in implementin g universal immunization in the developing world. Vaccine price has been shown as a constraint for de ciding to introduce the vaccine into the national immunization programmes because it accounts for the larger part of the incremental cost generated due to the introduction. EPI programmes can effectively help to introduce the immunization against HBV and the vaccine procurement at a discount price. Few st udies mentioned the importance of the GAVI fund [8,9] as a financial tool to help low-income countr ies to introduce the new and underused vaccines. Countries, which are considered to benefit from the fund, have the opportunities to vaccinate their newborns against HBV through their EPI programmes. Programmes costs, such as administration costs, costs related to keeping up the cold chain, etcetera, were mentioned in all cost-effectiveness evaluations. It was obvious that programme costs al so contributed substantially to the total vaccinati on costs. However, EPI programmes also have advantages in this respect, for example in assisting the negotiations for procurement of hepatitis B vaccine at discount prices and in allowing use of existing facilities for the introduction of a new vaccine su ch as trained staff and existing cold chains. Developing countries need to raise cost-effectivene ss issues even more than developed countries, in order to decide between universal and targeted vacc ination strategies. Developed countries are currently of low endemicity due to the success of u niversal vaccination and/or \"at-risk\" strategies fo r targeted vaccination and lower baseline prevalence levels prior to vaccination implementation. In the developing world, where hepatitis B morbidity and m ortality is the highest, cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is very attractive [28-30]. Sooner or l ater, such developing countries should implement universal vaccination for broader populations (not only for newborns and infants but also for adolesce nts and health workers). Using a combined vaccine (Hepa titis B-DPT vaccine) instead of a monovalent vaccine to increase the coverage and to reduce the administration costs might be an option to further improve cost-effectiveness. Some authors in the studies reviewed emphasized the contribution and benefits of the GAVI Alliance. GAVI Alliance is an organization, which mobilizes f inancial support from international donors and Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination for developing countries 33 organizations in supporting low-income countries by providing funding for new and underused vaccines including HBV vaccines. Thanks to the GAVI Alliance , children in many developing and less-developed countries in Africa and Asia have accessed to immun ization against HBV, which makes the plan of integrating HBV vaccine into countries' immunizatio n programme more feasible. The results of the review show that immunization (e ither universal or targeted) against HBV is cost- effective from the health care point of view and co st-savings for the society in the long run in terms of avoiding future treatment cost. Obviously, in gener al, immunization is a good preventive care practice . However, to make economic evaluations more rigorous and more properly designed, studies on cost- effectiveness against HBV should be conducted in th e developing world. Their outcome will assist policy-makers in designing appropriate health inter ventions and for planning the necessary resource allocation for executing HBV vaccination strategies . Universal vaccination in developing countries generally provides a relevant issue, in order to le t policy makers know about financial needs and cost - effectiveness in implementation. In the end this al l contributes to the battle against life- threateni ng diseases caused by the HBV. ZConclusion and Expert Commentary On the basis of the available international literat ure on the economic evaluations of HBV immunization in the developing world, we conclude that it is cos t-effective to implement universal immunization against HBV. Vaccine price is a dominant factor con straining developing countries from effectively implementing HBV vaccination universally. Possible options to overcome this problem include combined vaccines and support from the international communi ty. Still, further high-quality economic evaluation s are needed in the near future, for example, using d ynamic models for simulating the spread of HBV in populations in developing countries. ZFive-Year View WHO has recommended that developing countries imple ment universal immunization against HBV. Each region has developed its own plan in order to achieve this goal. For example, the Western Pacific Region has set a goal to reduce chronic HBV infecti on rate to less than 2% by 2012 among children of five years old. Achieving this will however have hi gh costs attached to it. On this issue and in gener al, decision makers in these countries must make choice s about the best way to spend the limited resources available for the health of their populat ions. To be able to help policy makers to take evid ence informed policy decisions on the issue, the researc h community must come up with convincing and locally relevant evidence. Therefore, high quality economic evaluations have to be done on the cost- effectiveness of HBV immunization in different sett ings in the next five years. The cost-effectiveness of combined vaccines also deserves to be explored in t he near future. Such combined vaccines may present options for relevant efficiency gains and c ost savings. Such evidence would also be critical t o gather financial support from international donors (e.g. GAVI fund). Countries that have more established infant immunization programmes, higher capacity and greater resources should consider having universal immunization programmes at least f or children under 5 years old. Also, in the next 5 CHAPTER 2 34 years, developing countries should develop protocol s or guidelines on different strategies for vaccination of older children (e.g. catch-up or pat ch-up) depending on the country context. ZKey Issues We found evidence that developing countries with i ntermediate and high prevalence of HBV infection greatly benefit from HBV immunization. Un iversal immunization against HBV would have great impact in reducing endemicity and would be co st-effective in the long run. Evidence that the high price of the HBV vaccine wa s the key determinant restraining developing countries from implementing universal immunization against HBV. Combined vaccine (DPT- Hepatitis B) is a potentially a viable cost effecti ve alternative. We found that dynamic modeling was not applied in any cost-effectiveness analysis study reviewed as the needed data is not available. Dynamic modeli ng has been applied in research on cost- effectiveness analysis studies from developed count ries. It would be very valuable if in the future, when data is available, developing countries look i nto the possibilities of applying dynamic models in their economic evaluations on HBV too. This would h elp improve the quality and value of research on cost-effectiveness analysis of HBV in the develo ping world. 1Immunization give to the whole general population o r to all within a certain age group of the populati on (newborns, adolescents, adults, and so on) 2Immunization programs selectively targeting individ uals at risk Hepatitis B surface antigen; N A: Not available Table 2 Economic evaluations on hepatitis B vaccination in developing and low-income countries as published i n the international literature between 1993 and January 2008 Author/ Publication year Country Study objective Detailed analysis Types of economic analysis Approach Kim et al , 2007 [8] Gambia To identify the level of affordability for hepatit is B vaccination from the payer's perspective by using affordability and cost- effectiveness affordability curves Comparison of cost-effectiveness between vaccinatio n and non-vaccination CUA Universal 1 Vimolket et al , 2005 [2] Thailand To evaluate the cost-effectiveness by comparing fou r different infant vaccination strategies against HBV infection in Thailand Comparison of vaccination strategies depending on t est results: 1 screening for HBsAg, and vaccination; 2 screening for HBsAg, then HBeAg, and vaccination; 3 universal vaccination of all neonates; and 4 no vac cination CEA Universal Griffiths et al , 2005 [9] Mozambique To perform a CEA on the introduction of the HBV vac cine into the routine infant immunization services in Mozambi que by calculating the costs per death and DALY averted Cost composition analysis of introducing the HBV va ccine into a country's national immunization program and cost comparison between the use of monovalent HBV vaccin e and combination vaccine (DPT-Hepatitis CUA Universal Adibi et al , 2004 [12] Iran To assess the economic aspects of HBV transmission prevention for pre-marriage couples in Iran (interm ediate HBV endemicity) Evaluation of various strategies: 1 HBsAg screening for HBsAg+ person of the would-be couples followed by H BV vaccination, single dose HBIG and advice on condom protection; and 2 HBsAg screening followed by HBcAb screening in the HBsAg- spouses of the HBsAg+ perso ns and applying the above protocol only to HBcAb negat ive CEA Aggarwal et al , 2003 [1] India To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal child hood immunization in India For the analysis a specific Markov model was develo ped to grasp all the details of HBV in India CUA Universal Prakash, 2003 [7] India To identify the cost-effectiveness of universal HBV immunization in India Specific interest was directed at identifying cruci al factors influencing cost-effectiveness CUA Universal Hu et al , 2001 [4] China To select an optimal vaccination approach and provi de basis for decision-making on the control of hepatitis B i nfection in the People's Liberation Army in China Comparison of vaccination strategies with different administration strategies depending on test results : 1 screening for HBsAg prior to deciding on vaccinatio n; 2 immediate vaccination; and 3 no vaccination CUA Targeted dmunds, 2000 [10] Ethiopia To identify the cost-effectiveness of adding HBV va ccine into EPI of Ethiopia Cost composition analysis of introducing hepatitis B vaccine into a country's national immunization program CEA, CMA N/A Liu et al , 1995 [3] China To estimate the cost-benefit of vaccinating newborn s against HBV A decision-tree model was explicitly developed to a nalyze costs and benefits CBA Universal Hall et al , 1993 [11] Gambia To estimate cost-effectiveness of introducing the H BV vaccine into the national immunization program in the Gambi a Cost composition analysis was applied using inciden ce of liver cancer and registered hepatitis B as indicato rs and specific comparison between the use of the monovale nt HBV vaccine and combination vaccine (DPT-Hepatitis B) for infants CEA Universal Authors (country, year)Original price level Methods and perspective Disease-related treatment costs Base case discount rates (%) Costs Effects Target groups Vaccination costs per vaccinated person (US$ 2000) Vaccination strategies: results (US$ 2000) Kim et al .

Postma Shu Chuen Li Accepted by Value in Health (Regional Issue) CHAPTER 3 42 ZSummary Objectives: To estimate the total financial burden of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection for Vietnam by quantifying the direct medical, the direct non-medi cal and indirect costs among patients with various stages of CHB infection Methods: Direct medical cost data were retrieved retrospect ively from medical histories of inpatients and outpatients in 2008 from a large referral hospi tal in Hanoi, Vietnam. Direct non-medical and indir ect costs data were obtained from face-to-face intervie ws of outpatients from the same hospital. The treatment cost per patient per CHB infection stage was multiplied by the total estimated patients in Vietnam to get the total cost-of-illness for the na tion. Results: Nationally, the total cost attributable to CHB infe ction and its complications in 2008 was estimated to be approximately US$ 4.4 billion with the direct medical cost accounting for about 70% of that estimate. The cost of antivirals was the major cost driver in treating chronic HBV infection. The per- patient total annual direct medical cost increased with the severity of the disease with the estimated costs for CHB infection and hepatocellular carcinom a as US$ 450.35 and US$ 1,883.05, respectively. When compared with the 2008 gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of around US$ 1,024, the financial burden of treating chronic HBV infection is very high in Vietnam. Conclusion: This study confirmed that chronic HBV infection po ses a significant financial burden for the average patient and that lacking treatment would be come a social issueis a social issue in Vietnam. Although vaccination against HBV has been universal ly implemented, more healthcare investment and the greater availability of affordable medications are still needed to attain equity in proper treatme nt for patients with HBV infection. Cost-of-illness of chronic hepatitis B infection in Vietnam 43 ZIntroduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prevalen t blood-borne viruses worldwide with chronic HBV infection afflicting over 350 million people [1]. M ajor clinical consequences of HBV infection include liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HC C) [2,3]. These complications lead to more than one million deaths each year [3-5]. Thus, HBV infection is an important public health problem, especially for developing countries where the endemicity is often either intermediate or high. Vietnam is one such high-endemic country for HBV in fection [6]. Population surveys from the two biggest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, have sh own a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+) rate of 9-14% [7,8]. High HBsAg+ prevalence in Viet nam is supported by another small survey of children in rural regions. In this survey, the HBsA g+ rate was 19.5% [9]. While there is very little d ata in Vietnam on the proportion of patients who were HBsA g+ and have chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, cirrhosis or HCC , the international literature has reported that 75-80% of patients with CHB, 34% of patients with cirrhosis, and 72% of patients with H CC were also HBsAg+ [10]. Hence, chronic HBV infection and the resulting liver diseases would po se a heavy burden for the Vietnamese healthcare system. For the average Vietnamese patient, whose annual in come is around US$ 1,024 [11], the cost of treatment for diseases stemming from HBV infection is significant. Moreover, antiviral drugs remain ve ry expensive. Comprehensive analyses of the financial burden of HBV infection in Vietnam, however, are very limited. In view of this, we conducted a cost- of-illness (COI) study of HBV infection using data from one major referral hospital in Vietnam and we aimed to extrapolate the results to the entire country. Our analyses should provide the Vietnamese decision mak ers some guidance on resource allocation for health, particularly for HBV related conditions. ZMaterial and Methods The study contains two parts: 1) quantification of the direct medical cost and 2) quantification of th e direct non-medical cost and the indirect cost of HB V infection. The financial burden to the Vietnamese society is represented by the total cost (direct me dical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs) mult iplied by the estimated number of infected subjects in Vie tnam. The study protocol was approved by the Director of Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, where the s tudy was carried out. Bach Mai Hospital is one of t he largest hospitals in Vietnam and is a highly specia lized multi-disciplinary medical facility with a fo cus on internal medicine. It contains 1400 beds and is the most active in treating hepatitis B patients in Ha noi. In the cost analysis, the study followed the bottom up approach [12]. The direct medical costs were estimated from retrospective analysis whereas the d irect non-medical costs and the indirect costs were obtained from patient interviews. CHAPTER 3 44 Part 1: Measurement of direct medical cost Data were collected from medical and financial reco rds of Bach Mai Hospital from 1 January to 31 December 2008. The records for all inpatients treat ed at the Department of Infectious Diseases and all outpatients treated at the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Outpatient Department were included. Patients were classified into four groups: (i) chro nic hepatitis B (CHB), (ii) compensated (iv) hepatoc ellular carcinoma (HCC). Using the codes established by the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision (ICD-10), we identified and retrieved information on HBV patients classified un der B18 (CHB patients), K74 (CC and DC patients) and C22 (HCC patients). Patients coded with K74 wer e subsequently differentiated as either CC or DC through clinical diagnosis from patient case notes. Cost consideration The total direct medical cost related to the treatm ent of chronic HBV and associated complications included clinic visit cost (outpatient visits and h ospitalizations), investigation cost (laboratory te sts and procedures), drug costs (antiviral drugs and other medicines) and other services (bed costs, meals, an d so on). The study assessed resource utilization based on ho spital charges in 2008 and is expressed in US$ at the exchange rate of US$ 1 = VND 17,803 [13]. Becau se Bach Mai Hospital is a public non-profit healthcare institution with most service charges ba sed on cost recovery, the use of charge for the estimation of costs would be the most appropriate a pproach [14]. Calculation of direct medical cost The total annual direct medical cost per patient fr om each category of chronic HBV infection was calculated by summing the average annual cost for i npatient admission and outpatient admission as described by: Annual cost/patient = Cost per visit x Visits per y ear + Cost per admission x Admissions per year where visits per year are the aggregated visits of observed patient cases divided by aggregated observed patient cases and admissions per year are the aggregated admissions of observed patient cases divided by aggregated observed patient cases. Part 2: Measurement of direct non-medical and indir ect costs Direct non-medical costs were defined as expenses t hat were due to illness but did not involve the direct purchase of medical services (e.g. travel ex penses, accommodation, meals etc.). Indirect costs were earnings and productivity loss that resulted f rom work absence, directly attributable to the illn ess, by either the patient or the caregiver. Estimations of direct non-medical and indirect cost s were collected through interviews of patients treated in the Outpatient Department during the stu dy period. Informed consents were obtained for all patients in the study. In the cases where no consen ting subject for a particular category of clinical Cost-of-illness of chronic hepatitis B infection in Vietnam 45 diagnosis (described above) was available, physicia ns were interviewed as surrogates for their opinion s on the likely costs to the patient. In the interviews patients were asked several stand ardized questions including socio-demographic characteristics, patients' view on HBV infection as a financial burden, time spent for outpatient visi ts (including traveling time), extra expenses incurred for outpatient visits (including direct non-medica l expenses), job loss as a result of HBV infections, and the need for informal care (caregivers quitting their jobs or employment of domestic help to provid e care). Calculation of direct non-medical and indirect cost s The direct non-medical and indirect costs for both working and non-working patients were calculated as described below. Because a significant proportion (around 70%) of pa tients at Bach Mai Hospital resides outside Hanoi city, travel time to the hospital, expenses on trav els, meals and lodging were important components of the direct non-medical cost. In this study, medica l leave (i.e., number of day-offs) and time-off (i. e., number of hours taken off) were combined as one cos t item in the indirect cost category while productivity loss was considered a separate cost it em. For the working group, medical leave and time-off w ere the components for the indirect cost. The annual cost of day-offs for medical leave was calcu lated by multiplying the days taken for medical lea ve by the average daily wage rate. The annual time-off cost for outpatient visits was calculated by multiplying the total time-off by the average hourl y earnings. For daily and hourly wage calculation, a 5- day work week and an 8-hour work day were assumed. For the non-working group, productivity loss was us ed as the indicator of indirect cost and was calculated using the assumption that minimum wage w as the monthly wage [15]. Estimation of prevalence To extrapolate from this hospital-based study to Vi etnam's population, the values from the cost analys is were multiplied by the estimated prevalence of pati ents across various disease stages of chronic HBV infection. However, these prevalence data are not a vailable in Vietnam. Consequently, data were extrapolated from results of studies on HBV infecti ons and HBV-related cirrhosis in Vietnam in 2005, which were estimated at 10.05% and 481 per 100,000, respectively [16]. Assuming the same prevalence rate as in 2005 and extrapolating to the 2008 population in Vietnam of 86,084,547 [17], the estimated number of HBV carriers was 8,651,497 and the number with cirrhosis was 414,067. No official data on the ratio of CC to DC cases was av ailable in Vietnam, but the ratio of CC to DC at Ba ch Mai Hospital was 8:1. Using this ratio as a guide, it would translate to approximately 368,059 CC and 46,007 DC cases. The prevalence of HCC was estimated by multiplying the HCC incidence rate and average duration of HCC. Thus, with an incidence rate of 0.019% in 2005 [16] and the average survival of HCC patients of 1 year [18-20], the prevalence of HCC cases in Vietna m in 2008 was 16,356. CHAPTER 3 46 The total number of CHB cases was determined by sub tracting the number of cirrhosis and HCC cases from total chronic HBV carriers, which was estimate d to be 8,221,074. Sensitivity analysis We conducted both one-way and two-way sensitivity a nalyses for the cost estimates. For the direct medical cost, two one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. In the first sensitivity analysis, the lower and upper limits of the cost components (95% CI) fr om the direct medical cost calculation were tested and the number of patients was unchanged. In the se cond sensitivity analysis, the cost component remained constant and the number of patients in dif ferent chronic HBV disease stages was varied by: using the prevalence rate of HBV-infected patients of 8 to 16% [7-9;21]as the lower and upper limits, respectively, for estimating number of chro nic HBV carriers using survival times from 5 months to 16 months [2 2-25] as the lower and upper limits, respectively, for estimating prevalence of HCC subjects applying the base-case ratio of liver cirrhosis ca ses to chronic HBV carriers of 4.79% [16] to the lower and upper limits of chronic HBV carriers to e stimate the lower and upper limits for the number of liver cirrhosis cases. For direct non-medical and indirect costs, two one- way sensitivity analyses were also performed. In th e first analysis the 25 th and 75 th percentiles of the indirect cost were tested. In t he second analysis the number of patients in each disease stage was varied as was done for the direct medical cost. Two-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the combined effects of varying both the number of subjects and the treatment costs. However, only the best- and worst-case scenarios were examined. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine h ow the number of patients on antiviral treatments would change as a result of reducing the number of patients from all disease categories in the base- case by 20% while the number of patients on other m edications and medical services remained constant. We then evaluated the difference in the t otal direct medical cost that resulted from this variation. ZResults Direct medical cost A total of 904 patient cases (470 outpatient and 43 4 inpatient) were included for analysis, consisting of 226 CHB, 203 CC, 117 DC, and 358 HCC cases. The mea n age of the inpatient cases was 46.4 years (range: 13-83 years) and 82.8% were males. The mean age of the outpatient cases was 39.4 years (range: 15-61 years) and 59% were males. Virtually all of the subjects (99% for inpatients and 100% fo r outpatients) were Kinh, the most dominant ethnic gr oup in Vietnam. Overall service utilization and direct medical cost analysis of chronic HBV infections by disease stag es Annual healthcare utilization for each disease stag e and the estimated average annual treatment cost per patient for each disease stage are listed in Ta ble 1 and Table 2, respectively, with the lowest co st in Cost-of-illness of chronic hepatitis B infection in Vietnam 47 CHB patients (US$ 450.35) and the highest in HCC pa tients (US$ 1,883.05). On average CHB patients made the fewest outpatient visits (3.84 trips/year) while DC patients made the most (5.7 trips/year). Patients with HCC had the most hospital admissions per year and patients with DC had the longest hospital stay (13.54 days). Disease stages 1 Chronic hepatitis B Compensated cirrhosis Decompensated cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma Outpatient visits per person 3.84 (3.02-4.66) 4.31 (2.65-5.97) 5.7 (3.79-7.61) 5 (3.09-6.91) No. 0.27 (0.21-0.48) 0.51 (0.37-0.65) 2.34 (2.11-4.45) (2.02-2.98) 13.54 (9.87-17.20) 12.76 (10.87-14.65) 1Liver transplant program was not established at Bac h Mai Hospital. Table 1 Annual outpatient visits and hospitalizations for patients with chronic HBV infection by disease stages in Vietnam in 2008 1 Cost composition of chronic HBV infection Table 2 shows that the annual direct medical cost o f the treatment increased with disease progression. Drug costs accounted for approximately 70% of the d irect medical cost for CHB, CC and DC and 46.81% in HCC cases. Inpatient care constituted abo ut 63% of the direct medical cost in HCC but only 2% for CHB and 5% for CC. Expenses on antiviral gs were about 15% in CHB, 27% for CC and DC, and 2% for HCC. Expenses on laboratory tests and pr ocedures were done extensively for HCC (~44%). Expenses on medications other than antivirals were extensively used in all disease stages accounting for more than 45% of the total direct medical cost. Similar to the findings from the Singaporean study (26), lamivudine was the most frequently used antiviral agent in our study. This finding is likel y due to the fact that lamivudine is currently the only agent reimbursed by the health insurance of Vietnam . Based on the estimated prevalence for the different chronic HBV disease stages, the base-case direct medical cost associated with the different chronic HBV stages is shown in Table 3A. The total direct medical cost in 2008 was estimated to be US$ 4 billion. The one-way sensitivity analysis for estimating dir ect medical cost, where the cost components were varied and the number of patients was unchanged, re vealed that the estimated direct medical cost in 2008 was between US$ 2.8 and 5.5 billion. The rever se one-way sensitivity analysis, where the cost component remained constant and the number of patie nts was varied, showed the estimated direct medical cost in 2008 ranging between US$ 3.2 and 6. 4 billion. The two-way sensitivity analyses, however, resulted in a range of US$ 2.2 to 8.8 bill ion (Table 3B). CHAPTER 3 48 The sensitivity test, where the number of patients on antiviral treatment was reduced by 20% but the number of patients on other medical services was un changed, resulted in a 3% reduction in the total direct medical cost (Table 4).

The mean age of the patients was 36.12 years (range: 16-59 years) and 64.7% were males. Al l participants considered chronic HBV infection as a financial burden that heavily influenced the hous ehold's income. Indirect cost components of caregivers and loss of job None of the participants in the financial survey re ported job loss, the need to employ caregivers, or family members giving up employment to provide care as consequences of chronic HBV infections. The study results showed these elements had minimal imp act on indirect costs for chronic HBV carriers in Vietnam. Direct non-medical cost and indirect cost Because the cost distribution was skewed, the media n rather than mean values were used to calculate indirect costs. Many patients were from the surroun ding provinces to the hospital and their travel tim e often consisted of a whole working day. Thus, expen ses on transportations, meals and lodging were higher than medical leave, time-off and productivit y loss. The cost item representing medical leave an d time-off was the second largest cost component of t he direct non-medical and indirect costs (Table 4). Disease category Medical leave and time off Productivity loss 7 Transportation, meals, accommodation Annual direct non - medical and indirect costs of reduced productivity = Reported los s of productivity x monthly wage rate where: Reported loss of productivity = number of sick days due to HBV/total number working days of a month. Table 4 Annual direct non-medical and indirect costs (US$) of chronic HBV infection by disease stages per patient in Vietnam in 2008 CHAPTER 3 50 From our study, the base-case estimation for total direct non-medical and indirect costs for all the different chronic HBV disease stages in Vietnam was roughly US$ 375 million (Table 5A). Results of one-way sensitivity analyses for estimating direct non-medical and indirect costs are summarized in Table 6B. Varying the cost components while keeping the number of patients in various stages unchanged resulted in a wider impact (US$ 153 milli on-929 million) than the reverse situation where th e costs were unchanged and the number of patients was varied (US$ 299 million-600 million). In two-way sensitivity analyses where both the number of patie nts and the non-direct medical costs (direct non- medical and indirect costs) were varied, the total cost was between US$ 122 million and US$ 1.5 billio n (Table 5B). Cost-of-illness for chronic HBV infection estimatio n When the total cost-of-illness for chronic HBV infe ction in Vietnam was compared for the various disease stages, chronic HBV infection was the most costly condition, estimated at US$ 4 billion. Furthermore, the ratio of direct to indirect cost i ncreased with progression of disease severity (Tabl e 6). Direct medical cost was the major component of the total treatment cost of HBV infection patients, accounting for approximately 70% of the expenses. A.

Our results clearly showed that CHB infection and i ts complications impose a significant financial burden on the Vietnamese society and healthcare sys tem. If all patients with CHB and its various disease stages were treated in hospitals, the total annual cost would amount to approximately US$ 4.4 billion, which is approximately 5% of the GDP of Vi etnam in 2008. In reality the Vietnamese government's expenditure on health accounted for only a quarter of the total national health expenditure with the remainder comi ng from patients' out-of-pocket payment (27-29). Even if the individual patient is responsible for o nly part of the treatment costs of chronic HBV infe ctions, the current low Vietnamese GDP per capita of US$ 1, 024 (11) would still make the partial cost a significant financial burden for the average Vietna mese patient. Furthermore, as 80% of the population works in the agricultural sector with low wages, th e number of HBV patients who cannot bear these costs would be substantial and therefore many may b e under-treated or untreated. As a consequence of these costs, many patients turn ed to traditional medicines as an alternative. From interviews with physicians from Bach Mai Hospital, it appeared that only 1% of patients with CHB infection and other complications received hospital treatment. One suggested solution to alleviate the financial burden for individual patients seeking ch ronic HBV treatment is to continue and upgrade the operation of the existing Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP), which has been in place in Vietnam since 2000. CHAPTER 3 52 In our study, expenses on medications were the larg est cost driver for the direct treatment cost for C HB, CC and DD. These costs accounted for more than 70% of the total direct medical cost. However, this finding differs from another published study in whi ch laboratories tests were extensively conducted (2 6). The difference may be explained by the high drug pr ices in Vietnam. While the prices of nucleosides are becoming less e xpensive, they are still very costly in Vietnam. As a result, antiviral therapy is affordable for only a small proportion of HBV infected patients. This pro blem is exacerbated by the higher drug prices in public pha rmacies (30), where many patients with chronic HBV infections would purchase their medications. In fac t, prices for drugs in general and branded drugs in particular are many times higher in the Vietnamese market than in many of the other countries in the region (31). For chronic diseases, one-month treatm ent cost might be equivalent to 22 days' minimum wages for generic drug and up to 50 days' wages for an innovator brand (30). Contributing factors to the high drug prices in Vietnam include an ineffici ent procurement process and a lack of sound regulations on mark-ups. Thus, if more generic drug s could either be manufactured domestically at a lower cost or be allowed to enter the Vietnamese ma rket at a lower price, then affordability of chroni c HBV treatment would increase as a result of the low ered drug prices. The one-way sensitivity analysis investigating the number of patients on antiviral t reatment also showed that a decrease in the number of patients would result in a small reduction in the t otal direct medical cost. Resource utilization patt ern for the direct medical costs in this study was consiste nt with other published studies; direct medical cos ts increase with disease progression (26, 32-34). Direct non-medical and indirect cost accounted for approximately 6% of the total treatment cost for CC and DC and 12% for CHB and HCC. This study differs from other studies on the same subject in that the direct non-medical costs resulting from lodging , transportation and meals were considered. Because many chronic HBV patients reside outside of Hanoi, these costs could be quite high and even exceed the total indirect cost. This naturally would lead to the suggestion of establishing more healthcare institutions in rural areas. Improved health care a ccess in rural areas where approximately 80% of the Vietnamese population resides would also ameliorate the common problem of patient overloading of hospitals in major Vietnamese cities. While other studies on this topic used health insur ance data [26-28], our study used medical records o f Bach Mai Hospital. A study using data from the medi cal and financial records would not only provide a more detailed breakdown but also more accurately ca pture resource utilization compared to studies using health insurance data. Furthermore, hospital records allow for the identification of items not covered by health insurance and information on pati ents without health insurance, which represent a large proportion of the Vietnamese population. Our study also has several limitations. One limitat ion is the issue of representativeness of the patie nt sample. Many inpatients after discharge do not ret urn to outpatient clinics for follow-up. Ideally, t hey would have to go back for post-discharge assessment and therapy. However, in reality this does not happen in Vietnam for a number of reasons. Many chr onic HBV patients live in provinces distant from Hanoi and are agricultural workers with very low in come. Thus, it is not easy for them to travel to th e Cost-of-illness of chronic hepatitis B infection in Vietnam 53 hospital for regular outpatient visits. Hence, our outpatient samples were from those who attended the outpatient clinic and may not be truly representati ve as evident that formal care was not required by any of the participants. In addition, our study was confined to the northern area of Vietnam and we only collected data from on e central hospital albeit the biggest in the North an d not in other two regions of the country (Central and the South). However, as medications accounted for ~ 70% of the total cost in our study and there is lit tle variation in drug prices across Vietnam, this would allow an extrapolation to the whole country. Likewise, minimum wage was applied in estimating me dical leave and time-off for the indirect cost, and there would not be much deviation of direct non-med ical and indirect cost when our results are extrapolated to different regions in Vietnam. However, extrapolation of treatment cost collected from one hospital to the national level could be pr one to overestimating the treatment cost of chronic HBV infection in Vietnam. Nonetheless, in lieu of any cost information in Vietnam, our results could be v iewed as a potential scenario that provides an estimation of what the \"might be\" quantum of the co st to fill in an existing information gap. Finally, we were unable to retrieve the expenditure data on traditional medicines in treatment of chro nic HBV infections either; thus underestimating the tot al treatment costs. In Vietnam, there is a fairly l arge population seeking care from traditional medicines rather than western medicines despite a lack of published studies on their efficacy and safety. Bes ides cultural and traditional belief in traditional medicines, there is also the benefit of easier acce ss and lower costs. Although patients may still ne ed to travel far to access to traditional medicine, th ey will not need to do it regularly as traditional healers can prescribe medicines for several months if finan cial conditions of patients disallow frequent trave ls. Even with these potential limitations, this study, as the first and only COI study on chronic HBV infe ction in Vietnam, still provides valuable information for health care decision makers in resource allocation and planning. The heavy financial burden presented here suggests that the continuation of universal immunization against HBV is the optimal long-term s olution to minimize HBV-associated costs. Universal infant immunization against HBV in Vietna m started later than other countries in the Asia- Pacific region, however, the coverage has now reach ed more than 90% nationwide [29]. To reduce the prevalence of chronic HBV cases in Vietnam, catch-u p HBV vaccination will also be required. Another suggestion is the implementation of universal healt h insurance that would at least partially subsidize the treatment cost of chronic HBV infection. However, u niversal health insurance would definitely require additional financial resources, which likely requir e support from international organizations. ZConclusion We showed that chronic HBV infection potentially im poses a heavy financial burden on Vietnam, and patients with chronic HBV infection clearly face ma ny difficulties in attaining the appropriate treatm ent. Our results showed that prices of antivirals were s till very high making the chronic HBV treatment ver y expensive in Vietnam. If medical care for HBV infec tion and its complications is to be accessible to CHAPTER 3 54 those in need, at the least the costs of drugs must either be reduced or be subsidized for the poor. Beside the direct medical cost, direct non-medical cost was for the first time taken into consideratio n and appeared to be a substantial component of the i ndirect cost in Vietnam. Given the high prevalence of HBV infection in Vietn am, it is imperative that steps be taken at various levels to address the problem. In addition to unive rsal vaccination of newborns against HBV, a re- consideration of Vietnamese policies on drug pricin g, treatment of chronic HBV infections, and other initiatives for the prevention of infection are req uired.

Postma Accepted by Value in Health (Regional Issue) CHAPTER 4 58 ZSummary Objectives: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis and to id entify the cost-effectiveness affordability levels for a newborn universal vaccination program against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Vietnam Methods: Using a Markov model, we simulated a birth cohort using 1,639,000 newborns in Vietnam in 2002 and estimated the incremental cost-effectivene ss ratios (ICERs) for quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained following universal newborn vaccinati on against HBV. Two types of analyses were performed, including and excluding expenditures on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and its complications. In addition, we used Monte Carlo sim ulations to examine cost-effectiveness acceptabilit y and affordability from the payer's perspective and constructed a cost-effectiveness affordability curv e to assess the costs and health effects of the program. Results: In the base-case analysis, newborn universal vacci nation against HBV reduced the carrier rate by 58% at a cost of US$ 42 per carrier averted. Fro m the payer's perspective, ICER per QALY gained was US$ 3.77 which is much lower than the 2002 Gros s Domestic Product (GDP) per capita estimate of US$ 440. Vaccination could potentially be affordabl e starting at a budget of US$ 2.1 million. At the c ost- effectiveness threshold of US$ 3.77 per QALY and an annual budget of US$ 5.9 million, the probability that vaccination will be both cost-effective and af fordable was 21 percent. Conclusions: Universal newborn vaccination against HBV is highl y cost-effective in Vietnam. In low- income, high-endemic countries, where funds are lim ited and the economic results are uncertain, our findings on the cost-effectiveness affordability op tions may assist decision-makers in proper health investments. Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B immuniza tion in Vietnam 59 ZIntroduction The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prev alent blood borne viruses worldwide and is a major cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1,2]. It is an important public health problem for developing countries where the e ndemicity is generally high. Currently, it is estim ated that 350 million people in the world are chronic HB V carriers, as demonstrated by the presence of the surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) for more than 6 mont hs [3]. These individuals are at much higher risk of liver damage;15-40% of the infected patients eve ntually develop cirrhosis, liver failure or HCC, contributing to more than 1 million deaths annually [1,4,5]. Epidemiological studies have reported tha t the prevalence of chronic HBsAg carriers is between 8.8% and 20.5% across different populations and regions in Vietnam [6,7]. Therefore, with a populat ion of 86 million in 2010, Vietnam would have more than 7.5 million people who are at risk of prematur e death as a result of HBV infection. For high-endemic regions of chronic HBV infections, universal vaccination of newborns against HBV could be a feasible and effective solution for the prevention of HBV infection [8]. Studies have shown that vaccination against HBV is cost-effective in t he developing world [9]. In Vietnam, a locally prod uced hepatitis B vaccine was first introduced into the E xpanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in 1997, but its use was limited because of supply constraints [ 10]. Universal vaccination against HBV was not completed until mid-2003 with the support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) starting in 2002 [10]. To date, data is lack ing regarding the impact of universal vaccination o f newborns in Vietnam from a health-economic perspect ive. While cost-effectiveness analyses of universal vaccination against HBV have been extensi vely performed for many developed countries, such analyses are still scarce for the developing w orld [9]. However, economic studies, specific for developing countries, suggested that HBV vaccinatio n is cost-effective and may even be cost-saving [9] . In order to aid decisions on the allocation of scar ce healthcare resources, it is important to assess the cost-effectiveness of any large scale prevention pr ograms, which require substantial resource inputs. Properly conducted economic analyses can also ident ify the programs that would provide the best value. In this paper we estimated the cost-effectiveness o f the current HBV vaccination program for the Vietnamese situation. Additionally, cost-effectiven ess affordability curves were constructed to estima te the impact of the budget on the vaccination program . ZMethods Modeling approach We designed a decision analytic model to estimate t he cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination against HBV compared with no vaccination. A Markov model simulating disease progression was linked to a decision tree (figure 1). The analyses were pe rformed using the simulation software TreeAge Pro, version 2009 (Treeage Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). In the model we focused only on chronic hepatitis B infections because chronic infections comprise the largest burden of the disease and published clinica l data on acute hepatitis B infections are currentl y CHAPTER 4 60 lacking for Vietnam. The Vietnamese birth cohort of 2002 was selected because universal vaccination against HBV was completed in mid-2003; thus, we can compare the impacts before and after universal HBV vaccination. Type 1 mortality was assumed (i.e. , everyone lives to the life expectancy, which is 7 5 years in Vietnam). Each Markov cycle was defined as 1 year. The Markov health states used in the model were: (1) alive, (2) immunity, (3) chronic he patitis B, (4) compensated cirrhosis, (5) decompensated cirrhosis, (6) HCC and (7) death. Parameters Probabilities The transition probabilities used in the model repr esent the natural course of chronic hepatitis B infections and were obtained from international lit erature(through PuBMed), particularly from studies in high-endemic Asian countries where the epidemiology of hepatitis B infections is more similar to that of the Vietnamese situation (Table 1). In the cases wh ere there were two or more studies reporting estimates for a particular transition probability, we combined the outcomes of the studies using a random effect model to account for possible heterog eneity [11]. In Vietnam the reported prevalence of HBsAg carrier s was between 8.8% and 20.5% in 2002 (6;7). For the purpose of our study, we took the mean of the t wo values (14.7%) as the base-case prevalence of HBsAg carriers. Other parameters such as vaccine co verage, vaccine efficacy, vaccine wastage were also taken from published literature (Table 1). The vaccine coverage for newborns in Vietnam was reported to be 70% (range of 45%-94%) [12]. The eff icacy of the monovalent vaccine against HBV from a 3-dose schedule (0, 2 and 4 months) was approxima tely 84% (range of 65%-95%) [13-15]. In Vietnam, the hepatitis B vaccine was provided in the form of two-dose vials. Thus, the vaccine wastage was estimated at 12.5% (range of 5-25%) [12,16]. Vaccin e wastage was calculated by the Vaccine wastage = [(Amount of vaccines purchased-Am ount of vaccines used)/Amount of vaccines purchased]*100 Cost estimates The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from societal, healthcare, and payer's perspectives. The affordability analysis was conducted from the payer 's perspective only. For the societal perspective, we included the direct medical costs (vaccination cost and the averted costs of treatment for chronic hepatitis B infections and hepatitis B-related case s), the direct non-medical costs (travel, meals and lodging), and the indirect costs (productivity loss ). For the healthcare perspective, vaccination cost and direct medical costs were included. For the payer's perspective, where the Vietnamese government or international organizations are the main payers for vaccination programs,we included only the vaccination cost because we explicitly wanted to as sess the affordability of implementing a vaccinatio n program. Treatment cost of chronic hepatitis B and its relat ed progressions were taken from a previous cost-of- illness study we conducted for Vietnam (data is ava ilable upon request). However, the costs in that study were calculated for year 2008. To convert the costs back to year 2002 levels (matching the birth Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B immuniza tion in Vietnam 61 cohort used in this study), we used the country's g ross domestic product deflators. All costs were reported in US$ based on a conversion rate of 1 US$ = 17,803 Vietnamese Dong [18]. 1CHB = Chronic hepatitis Hepatocellu lar carcinoma; HBsAg = Hepatitis B surface antigen Figure 1 Decision analytic model for estimating the cost-ef fectiveness of universal hepatitis B vaccination in Vietnam 1 The hepatitis B vaccine used for newborns in Vietna m was Euvax-B and it was purchased through GAVI's financial support from 2002-2008. The cost o f the vaccine alone was approximately US$ 1 [19,20]. Including the administration costs, the fu ll cost per dose was estimated to be US$ 1.50 (rang e of US$ 0.5-3.5) [19,20]. In this study, we did not take into account indirect costs such as time and money spent by parents to bring the child for immun ization. However, we included the direct non- medical costs and the indirect costs that resulted from complications of chronic hepatitis B infection s (e.g., chronic hepatitis B, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). CHAPTER 4 62 Quality of life (QOL) Due to a lack of data on specific QOL estimates for Vietnam, we used QOL estimates based on various international sources (Table 1). The utility values range from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Other assumptions In the model we made several assumptions: (i) all c hronic hepatitis B infections occurred in the first year of life; (ii) the mortality and losses of QALY and LYGs that were due to acute hepatitis B infections were ignored; (iii) the simulation continued until 99.9% of the cohort had deceased; and (iv) the hepatitis B unrelated death rate was based on the age-specifici ty mortality of the Vietnamese population (19). In the absence of age-specific mortality rates for 200 2, we used the rates from 2006 under the assumption that mortality rates remained constant between 2002 and 2006. Sensitivity analysis To evaluate the uncertainties associated with cost- effectiveness outcomes, we performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses for all three perspectives. Th e model input parameter values and the associated distributions are shown in Table 1 [21]. For each s cenario we conducted 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results were subsequently presented in cost-eff ectiveness acceptability and cost-effectiveness affordability curves from the payer's perspective o nly. We then evaluated affordability based on the j oint distribution of simulated incremental costs and hea lth gains of HBV vaccination. Affordability analysi s was done with the assumption that vaccination progr ams for infants were indivisible, which means it cannot be done for only a fraction of infants becau se in Vietnam universal hepatitis B vaccination is for every child. Using the theory and methodology descr ibed by Sendi and Briggs [22], we generated a cost-effectiveness affordability curve by capturing the points in the cost-effectiveness (C-E) plane u nder the horizontal lines representing different budget levels. Several univariate analyses were performed to asses s the effects of uncertainties surrounding input parameters on the outcomes. However, only the analy ses from the payer's perspective are shown. The parameters included in the univariate analyses were vaccine coverage, vaccine wastage, vaccine price, vaccine efficacy, and HBV prevalence rate. Outcome measurement The two effectiveness outcomes investigated in the model were life-years-gained (LYG) and quality- adjusted-life-year (QALY). In addition, the ICER per LYG and per QALY for different scenarios (vaccination vs. no vaccination).

Table 1 Base-case estimates and corresponding distribution s for deterministic and probabilistic analyses ZResults Baseline results The results of the base-caseanalyses comparing univ ersal hepatitis B vaccination with no vaccination are presented in Table 2. Under the framework of th e model, implementing universal vaccination of newborns reduced HBV prevalence by 8.66% (a change of 58%) from 14.70% to 6.04% and increased the expected LYG and the QALY gained per person by 0.80 years and 0.95 years, respectively. The cost incurred to prevent one HBV infection case was estimated to be US$ 41.79. From the payer's perspective the ICER per LYG and QALY gained were e stimated at US$ 4.52 and US$ 3.77, respectively. From the societal and healthcare pers pectives, universal vaccination of newborns against HBV dominated no-vaccination (i.e., more effective and cost-saving).

The results revealed that I CER values were most sensitive to vaccine price and HBV prevalence rate, moderately sensitive to vaccin e efficacy, and less sensitive to vaccine wastage. Because the applied model in the study was a static design, sensitive analysis on vaccine coverage did not affect the results of the ICER per LYG and per QALY (data not shown).

Under the societal and hea lthcare perspectives, all points lied in the southe (5%-25%) US$/QALY CHAPTER 4 66 quadrant (lower cost and greater effectiveness), co nfirming that from these perspectives universal vaccination dominates no-vaccination. Figure 3 5000 Monte Carlo simulations of incremental cost-ef fectiveness ratios plotted on a C-E plane comparing vaccination vs. no-vaccination Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B immuniza tion in Vietnam 67 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve We further presented the uncertainty of the C-E pla ne on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) for the payer's perspective (figure 4). The CEAC reports the probability that infant universal vaccination against HBV would be cost-effective for a range of WTP thresholds. For the base-case threshold of US$ 3.77 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness for the vaccination program was 51%. At the WTP threshold of US$ 18 per QALY, the p robability of cost-effectiveness reached 100%, but decreased to 0% when the WTP threshold was less than US$1 per QALY. Figure 4 Cost-effectiveness (C-E) acceptability curve for un iversal newborn vaccination against HBV in Vietnam (payer's perspective Affordability curve To overcome the above limitation of the cost-effect iveness acceptability curves, affordability curves were generated to explain the impacts of financial resources on the vaccination program. Accounting fo r the uncertainties of all parameters, the curve visu alizes the probabilities of affordability for a vac cination program given different budgetary levels. The focus of this study was to assess the impact of the budget on vaccination alone. Thus, all affordability and subsequent cost-effectiveness aff ordability analyses were explicitly evaluated from the payer's perspective. The results indicated that the vaccination program would not be affordable when the budget is less than US$ 2 million. In contrast, vaccination would always be implementable when the budget exceeds US$ 13 million. Thus, the implementa tion of infant HBV vaccination in Vietnam would require between US$ 2 and 13 million. For the base- case scenario with a vaccination budget of US$ 5.9 million per year (Table 2), the probability that th e program would be affordable was only 26% because of the uncertainties surrounding the program cost. CHAPTER 4 68 Figure 5 Affordability curve to explain the impacts of finan cial resources on the universal newborn HBV vaccination program in Vietnam (payer's perspective ) Cost-effectiveness affordability curve The ideal situation is for the vaccination program to be both cost-effective and affordable. Combining the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and the affordability curve, the cost-effectiveness afforda bility curve presented various scenarios for a vaccination program to be both cost-effective and affordable a t different cost-effective threshold values and budge ts (figure 6). The analyses showed that if the budg et is less than US$ 2 million, the probability for the vaccination program to be cost-effective and affor dable is 0%, regardless of the WTP threshold. In the base -case scenario with a cost-effective threshold of US$ 3.77 per QALY and a budget of US$ 5.9 million, the probability for the vaccination program to be both cost-effective and affordable was 21 percent. If the budget was increased to US$ 10 million, the program would have a 65% probability of being cost- effective and affordable at a WTP threshold of US$ 6.5 per QALY. Under the most ideal situation wh ere the budget reaches US$ 13 million and the WTP threshold reaches US$ 18 per QALY, the vaccinat ion program would be 100% cost-effective and affordable. Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B immuniza tion in Vietnam 69 Figure 6 Cost-effectiveness (C-E) and affordability curve pr esenting various scenarios for universal newborn vaccination against HBV in Vietnam to be bo th cost-effective and affordable at different cost- effective threshold values and budgets (payer's per spective) ZDiscussion The results from the baseline analyses showed that universal newborn vaccination against HBV could reduce the HBV carrier rate by approximately 60 per cent. Using the World Health Organization's criteri a for cost-effectiveness [47], our analyses suggest t hat vaccination against HBV in Vietnam is highly co st- effective from the payer's perspective. The increme ntal cost-effectiveness ratio was only US$ 3.77 per QALY, which is much lower than three times the GDP per-capita in Vietnam for 2002 [48]. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that vaccine efficacy a nd vaccine wastage had little impact on cost- effectiveness whereas changes to vaccine price and HBV prevalence rate markedly influenced the cost- effectiveness of the program. From the societal perspective, when the treatment c osts of complications were included, universal newborn vaccination not only dominated no-vaccinati on but also was a cost-saving strategy. Vaccinating Vietnamese newborns against HBV could p otentially save US$ 1 billion by averting the treatment costs of chronic hepatitis B infections a nd associated complications such as compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellul ar carcinoma. CHAPTER 4 70 Considering that the country's GDP per-capita was a pproximately US$ 440 in 2002 [48] and assuming that the cost for a fully-immunized child was US$ 4 .5 as was done in this study, vaccination remained quite an acceptable and affordable option even for a Vietnamese household to pay out-of-pocket. However, with an annual birth cohort of 1,639,000 i n 2002, universal vaccination against HBV for newborns could amount to a very large investment fo r the Vietnamese government. As investment in health is still limited in Vietnam and resource all ocation among health interventions is quite competi tive, the cost of universal vaccination poses a heavy fin ancial burden when the GAVI's support for Vietnam i n the EPI program is terminated. This financial impli cation should prompt the Vietnamese health decision makers to access the processes involved in setting priorities and allocating limited resources among different childhood vaccination programs. In this c ontext, the importance of examining affordability a nd cost-effectiveness should be taken in consideration . Furthermore, our results may aid the Vietnamese government in the application for further financial support from the GAVI. The results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses in our study partly addressed concerns regarding a number of uncertainties surrounding a universal vac cination program against HBV. By constructing the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, this study reported the probabilities that a vaccination progr am is cost-effective over a range of willingness-to-pay t hresholds. However, cost-effectiveness does not imp ly affordability. Application of the affordability cur ve showed that the newborn vaccination program agai nst HBV in Vietnam could start as low as US$ 2,100,000 but becomes 100% cost-effective and affordable with an annual budget of at least US$ 13 million (f igure 5). Even at this maximum level of investment, the program cost is extremely modest in comparison to the treatment costs of chronic HBV infections in Vietnam that could amount to more than US$ 1 billio n. In addition, a vaccination program will graduall y reduce HBV prevalence in Vietnam. Therefore, contin uing the vaccination program appears to be a wise health investment. Our study confirms that vaccination is absolutely c ost-effective in Vietnam from the payer's perspecti ve and is a cost-saving intervention from the societal and healthcare perspectives. These results are in agreement with other studies in high-endemic and in termediate-endemic countries. Because Vietnam is a high-endemic country regarding HBV infection, a u niversal newborn vaccination program is a \"must- do\" strategy. However, this study has a few limitations. First, w e applied a simple static Markov model of the disea se instead of a dynamic model. Because of the lack of data and information, we opted to focus only on the chronic part of the hepatitis B infection and ignor ed the acute and fulminant stages of hepatitis B infection. However, morbidity from these clinical p resentations was short-lasting and mortality constituted only a small proportion of hepatitis B related deaths. Therefore, the inclusion of these f actors in our model would likely result in the vaccination strategy being even more cost-effective. Second, there is an absence of published epidemiological da ta on hepatitis B in Vietnam. As a result, we used published data from other countries in the region w here extensive research on the disease had been conducted [25,31,34,35,40], and in the cases where no data were available at all, we used data from the western world. This is justified because diseas e progression rates appear to be stable across Cost-effectiveness analysis of hepatitis B immuniza tion in Vietnam 71 populations. Third, we did not have age-specific di sease progression rate and we assumed the same prevalence rate for all age groups. This might unde restimate the number of infections that would occur in this birth cohort and that current prevalence is a rough estimate for infections that might occur t o the population. Fourth, the study did not take into acc ount the indirect herd-immunity effects; doing so w ould likely result in a more favorable cost-effectivenes s for the vaccination strategy. As the first cost-effectiveness study on universal newborn vaccination in Vietnam, the outcomes are very encouraging and informative. The results will assist policy makers in evaluating the continued support for universal vaccination against HBV infec tion. Our findings will also be informative for hea lth- policy decisions in other highly endemic countries of HBV prevalence. In addition, our study demonstrated how the application of cost-effectiven ess affordability curve could be used for resource planning of other health interventions, especially for new and underused vaccines. To fully evaluate impacts of HBV vaccination in Vietnam, future studi es applyingdynamic models of HBV infection to account herd immunity and acute fulminant stages of the disease are recommended.

Tu Jens H.J. Bos Herman J. Woerdenbag Sipke T. Visser 133-144 ANNEX 1 76 ZSummary Objectives: The main aims of this work were to describe pattern s of medication use in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patien ts in the northern part of the Netherlands and to compare these practices with established guidelines . In addition, the duration of use and the costs of these treatments were investigated. Methods: We selected subjects from the University of Groning en's IADB.nl database; by 2006, the database provided information about drug utilizatio n from 55 community pharmacies in the northern Netherlands and included a population of 528,911 in dividuals, of which 49% were male. Eligible subjects had received 1 prescription for drugs used to treat chronic HBV 2000 and 2006. The annual prevalence and cumu lative incidence of HBV treatment per 1000 people covered in the database were calculated and stratified by sex. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to analyze the duration of use. Drug costs in the treatment were calculated for all patients or per patient, and by drugs used per subperiod (2000- 2003 and 2004-2006). Treatments for hepatitis C virus and HIV were excluded from the analyses. Results: From the database, we identified 59 patients (46 ma le, 13 female), aged 25 to 60 years, who received 1 prescription for a medication to treat chronic HB V infection between 2000 and 2006. The overall prevalence of people using chronic treatmen ts for HBV was between 0.03 and 0.06 per 1000 during the years of the study. The cumulative incid ence of treatment was ~0.01 per 1000 per year (ranging from a high of 0.021 in 2000 to a low of 0 .009 in 2006). When stratified by sex, there were more male than female subjects who received medicat ions for HBV. Lamivudine was the most commonly prescribed drug, followed by adefovir and pegylated interferon- 2b. In 2000 and 2001, lamivudine was the only medication prescribed for t he treatment of chronic HBV. From 2002 to 2006, the prescription rate for lamivudine dropped from 9 0% to 61%. In contrast, the prescription rate for adefovir increased from 4% in 2003 to 36% in 2006. Pegylated interferon- 2b remained stable at 8% to 11% between 2002 and 2006. Twenty-five percent of p atients had stopped HBV treatment by the end of 1 year. Fifty-five percent had stopped by 3 years. Seventy-seven percent of patients received their fi rst HBV prescription from a medical specialist. Per pat ient, the cost of drug therapy was highest with adefovir. From 2004 to 2006, the cost of adefovir t herapy accounted for 49% of total expenditures for the treatment of chronic HBV (equivalent to \u20ac128,03 7; as of January 2010, \u20ac1.00 = US $1.43). The second and third most expensive drugs were tenofovi r and pegylated interferon- 2b (\u20ac33,700 and \u20ac33,250, respectively). Costs incurred per patient increased over the years of the study period. Conclusions: The overall prevalence and cumulative incidence of patients with treatments for chronic HBV were relatively low in the northern part of the Netherlands between 2000 and 2006. The prescribing and utilization patterns were in agreem ent with international and Dutch guidelines. Given the low numbers of prescriptions, the costs also remain ed relatively low. Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 77 ZIntroduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most prevalen t blood-borne viruses worldwide, causing chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is an important public health problem for developing countries, where the endemicity is gener ally high or intermediate, as well as in developed countries. It is currently estimated that >350 mill ion people in the world are chronically infected wi th HBV. They are at risk of death from liver cirrhosis and HCC, which cause the deaths of >1 million people worldwide each year [1]. In the Netherlands and in Scandinavian countries, t he carrier rates for HBV are estimated to be <2% [2 - 4]. In the Netherlands, the estimated seroprevalenc e of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B co re antigen antibodies are ~0.2% and ~2.1%, respectivel y [5]. Notified new cases of chronic hepatitis B were estimated at 1443 (0.01%) in 2005 [6].Despite relatively low endemicity, the Dutch health authorities have begun considering nationwide unive rsal infant vaccination against HBV [7, 8]. Until now, only infants from ethnic minorities and specif ic risk groups (such as those whose biological pare nts are drug users or men who have sex with men) are pr ovided with targeted vaccination against HBV. Cost-effectiveness is one of many issues that must be considered in the decision about whether to implement universal HBV vaccination. In addition, t here may be regional differences in the occurrence of HBV infection within the Netherlands; for exampl e, it is possible that the occurrence of HBV might be relatively low outside the major urban areas in the western Netherlands. The availability of antiviral drug treatment of chr onicHBV infection has largely improved treatment ov er the last decade, but such treatment has also become s more complicated, creating the need for treatment guidelines for chronic HBV. Existing guid elines include the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [9], the Asian-Pacific co nsensus statement [10], and the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease s (AASLD) [11]. In the all suggested drugs for treatment of chronic H BV infection in Europe [9]. The Asian-Pacific consensu s statement of 2008 provides recommendations on the treatment of chronic HBV infection using the fo llowing clevudine has been approved in Korea an d thymosin-1 has been approved in several countries in Asia [8 ]. In the AASLD guidelines lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, and telbivudin e are the recommended drugs for the treatment of chronic HBV infection [9]. The list of recommended drugs differs depending on the time when these guidelines were published. The Dutch gui delines published in July 2008 for the treatment of chronic HBV infection were based on these internati onal guidelines [7-9]. Table I shows the drugs recommended for the treatment of chronic HBV infect ion according to the Dutch guidelines. The main objectives of the current study of informa tion from a claims database were to describe the actual prescribing and drug utilization patterns, d uration of use, and costs of drug use in the treatm ent of ANNEX 1 78 chronic HBV infection in patients in the northern N etherlands, and to compare our findings with nation al and international treatment guidelines [7-10]. Group Name (substance) Approval date in NL ter Beoordeling van Ge neesmiddelen (CBG) or Medicines Evaluation Board (M EB); ATC-code: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification code [30] Table 1 List of drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatiti s B included in the Dutch guidelines of 2008 ZMethods Setting and Population Information on drug use and related costs from phar macy-dispensing data from community pharmacies in the northern Netherlands was obtained from the U niversity of Groningen's IADB.nl database (formerly called the InterAction DataBase). Dutch patients ty pically register at a single community pharmacy; therefore, this pharmacy can provide an almost comp lete listing of the subject's prescribed drugs [15] . By 2006, the database provided information about dr ug utilization from 55 community pharmacies in the northern Netherlands and included a population of 5 28,911 individuals, of which 49% were male. The database's pharmacy information includes, among oth er data, the name of the drug dispensed, anatomic-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) classification, date of prescription, number of days covered by the prescription, and the number of defined daily d oses based on the definition of the World Health Organization [14]. However, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and in-hospital prescriptions are not included. Cumulatively, the database includes data for nearly 1 million people, dating back to 1999 (~6% of the total population of the Netherlands) [1 6, 17]. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed patients' data from 2000 to 2006. Internal Review Board and Human Rights Issues Because this was a retrospective analysis of inform ation from a single database, internal review board approval was not necessary, and human-rights protoc ols were not required. The information in the database is anonymous, so subject identity was prot ected. Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 79 Selection Criteria We selected, from the IADB.nl database, all patient s who received 1 prescription between 2000 and 2006 for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Su ch prescriptions were identified by the ATC codes listed in Table I, as well as those for tenofovir ( ATC code J05AF07) and PEG-IFN- 2b (ATC code L03AB10), which are also used in daily practice and recommended by international guidelines for the treatment of chronic HBV infection [9-11]. Because some of the drugs used to treat patients with chronic HBV infection may also be used for other in fections and diseases, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV), some patients were excluded to limit t he sample to the patients who were most likely to have been treated for chronic HBV infection. We aim ed to identify patients using drugs for HBV treatment alone, rather than combination treatment for other and/or concomitant viral infections. The strategy applied for selecting patients who were mo st likely to have chronic HBV infections is depicte d in Figure 1. The first step was to discriminate between groups o f patients in the data obtained from the database. The drugs listed in box 1 of Figure 1 were used as the first inputs to discriminate for H BV, but may also have been used for HIV and HCV infection treatment. The second step was to exclude HIV-infected patients, whom we defined as those who received 1 prescription per month of a combination of 2 drugs from the list of HIV drugs or to receive comb ined antiviral drug therapy (box 2). The third step was to exclude HCV-infected patients, identified as tho se who received drugs listed in box 3; for chronic HBV infection, PEG-IFN- treatment should last >40 weeks and not be combine d with ribavirin.18 Patients using IFN- were also excluded because this drug is used in th e treatment of other diseases, such as multiple sclerosis [19-22]. In the IADB.nl database, it was impossible to distinguish between patients who were using IFN- to treat chronic HBV and those using the drug for other reasons; the information in the database is related to individua l prescriptions and not to the complete medical his tory. Thus, to avoid the possibility of including patient s who were not infected with chronic HBV, we exclud ed all patients, and instead considered only patients who used other drugs approved for the treatment of was not a criterion we considered for screening ou r patients and was not included in the filters shown in Figure 1.) Ultimately, the remaini ng patients were considered to have chronic HBV infections. To validate the filters applied in this selection o f subjects from the database, clinicians who specia lize in the treatment of infectious diseases reviewed the l ists of drugs used to treat HIV, HCV, and HBV. Afte r we identified HBV-infected patients from the IADB.n l database, we randomly selected subsets of included and excluded subjects and the lists of dru gs they had used. The clinicians identified the disease of these patients based on the list of pres cribed drugs given to such patients. All patients i n the subset were correctly identified as being infected with HBV or were correctly excluded. This validated our approach to selecting patients with chronic HBV infection. ANNEX 1 80 Figure 1 Flow scheme used to select chronic HBV-infected pat ients from the IADB.nl database Data Analyses The annual prevalence of chronic HBV infections per 1000 people was calculated by counting the number of patients receiving 1 prescription for a medication for chronic HBV inf ection in a given year, divided by the total population covered in the data base in that year and then multiplied by 1000. We stratified prevalence by sex. Cumulative incidence was calculated by counting the number of patients who were identified as receiving new prescriptions for medications to treat chronic HBV infection, divided by the total population covered in the data base in that year, multiplied by 1000. The continui ty correction method, which is used for very small pro portions, was used to calculate the 95% CI values [23].A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed to examine the duration of drug use in the treatmen t of chronic HBV infection for treatment initiators u sing the standard methodology. Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 81 A treatment initiator was defined as someone who ex isted in the database for 180 days before the initial prescription of anti-HBV treatment. We defi ned 180 days as the lag time between a prescription and the subsequent prescription, as is typically do ne in this type of drug utilization analysis. If a subject stopped using the drug for >180 days, he or she wou ld be counted as a treatment initiator when treatment was resumed. (The 180-day threshold for d efining treatment cessation was used because it is a standard in pharmacoepidemiology research and bec ause patients with chronic HBV infection are typically seen every 3-6 months.) The starting date was defined as the date on which a patient receive d his or her initial prescription of drugs for the tr eatment of chronic HBV. To identify the date when t herapy ended, we calculated the number of days of duration for every prescription, based on the daily dosage and the prescribed number of units (eg, tablets, ca psules) for each patient. The number of days between the starting date and the end date was subs equently calculated. Duration of drug use was considered to be censored if the last recorded pres cription was within 180 days. Additionally, data regarding the cost of drugs used in the treatment of chronic HBV infection were retrieved from the IADB.nl database. We calculated the total cost of the drugs for either all patients or per individual for the period from 2000 through 200 6, based on the Dutch pharmacists' official price l ist [24].For this purpose, prescriptions of drugs for t he treatment of chronic HBV infection were linked t o the Z index,the official price index for all drugs and their specific formulations registered for the Dutc h market. Total costs were calculated for 2 subperiod s (2000-2003 and 2004-2006) to visualize the cost effects of differences in the patterns of drug pres criptions. In particular, 2003 was chosen as the cu toff because several new antiviral drugs for chronic HBV treatment were introduced to the Dutch market that year (eg, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir) [14].We c alculated the annual total drug cost per subject fo r chronic HBV treatment by dividing the total cost of drugs per year for all patients by the number of patients who received 1 prescription for the treatment of chronic HBV inf ection in a given year. ZResults Overall Utilization From the IADB.nl database, we identified 59 subject s (46 men and 13 women), ranging in age from 25 to 60 years, who had received 1 prescription for the treatment of chronic HBV inf ection in the period from 2000 through 2006. The total number of prescri ptions for chronic HBV medications during this period was 716 (a mean of 12.1 prescriptions per su bject). The number of patients increased from 15 in 2000 to 33 in 2006 ( P < 0.001). Figure 2 shows the overall prevalence of patients w ho were treated for HBV infection, stratified by se x and year. The overall prevalence increased every ye ar during the study period from 0.03 to 0.06 per 1000 people in the database. Prevalence among women was considerably lower than among men. Female prevalence remained stable from 2000 to 2002 at 0.01 per 1000 women in the database, slightly increased from 2002 to the end of 2003, bu t decreased from 2004 to 2006. The prevalence for men increased only slightly from 2000 to 2003, but it greatly increased between 2004 and 2006. ANNEX 1 82 Figure 2.

Patients with sus pected coinfection with hepatitis C virus or HIV we re excluded. The total number of patients in the population cove red by the IADB.nl database is shown in Table II , along with annual cumulative incidence. The cumulat ive incidence was stable at ~0.01 per 1000 people between 2001 and 2006, ranging from an overall high of 0.021 in 2000 to an overall low of 0.009 in 2006.

Per-Year Utilization Patterns Figure 3 shows changes in drug use over the study period (20 00-2006). Lamivudine was the most prescribed anti-HBV drug overall. In 2000 and 2001, it was the only drug prescribed for the treatment of Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 83 patients with chronic HBV infections. In 2002, 90% of patients used lamivudine. From 2003 to 2006, the proportion of prescriptions for lamivudine among al l anti-HBV drugs remained fairly stable (61%-70%). The proportionate use of PEG-IFN- 2b remained relatively constant from 2002 to 2006 ( 8%-11%). In the era of the new antiviral drugs (eg, adefovir, t enofovir, entecavir) being introduced to the Dutch market, adefovir became the second most prescribed drug for chronic HBV infection; the proportionate use of adefovir substantially increased from 4% to 36% between 2003 and 2006. The use of tenofovir remained stable following its introduction to the D utch market in 2002. However, with the introduction of the other new antiviral drugs, there appeared to be a switch from monotherapy (2000, 2001, and 2003) to combined drug therapy (2002 and 2004-2006); swit ching patients to newer antiviral medications also appeared to be common. Based on the information fro m the IADB.nl database, it appeared that the only combination therapy used was lamivudine plus adefov ir. Prescribers' characteristics were analyzed for trea tment initiators. In particular, 43 subjects initia ted treatment during the study period. Of these patient s, 10 (23%) received their first prescriptions from a general practitioner and 33 (77%) received their fi rst prescriptions from a medical specialist. Indivi dual drug choices were quite similar between general pra ctitioners and specialists; for example, all initia l prescriptions were for monotherapy. We divided the study period into 2 subperiods (2000 -2003 and 2004-2006) to further investigate differences in the patterns of initial prescription s. It became obvious that the proportion of lamivud ine use among treatment initiators dropped by 21% from the first to the second subperiod (from 80% to 59%). During the second subperiod (2004-2006), adef ovir became the second most prescribed drug, after lamivudine, among treatment initiators (29%). ANNEX 1 84 Duration of Use After 3 years, 55% of users were still taking medic ation for chronic HBV infection ( Figure 4 ). The respective proportions of patients who still used t he drug after 1 and 2 years were estimated at 75% a nd 68%, respectively, suggesting relatively good persi stence. Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showing duration of dru g use in a retrospective analysis of prescription claims for drugs to treat hepatitis B virus infection, dispensed from 2000 to 2006, in th e northern Netherlands, based on a retrospective anal ysis of the IADB.nl database. Patients with suspected coinfection with hepatitis B or HIV were excluded. Cost Incurred by Drug Use Figure 5 shows the cost of drugs to treat chronic HBV infect ion in relation to total expenses for chronic HBV treatment. No costs were incurred for entecavir and PEG-IFN- 2a in the period from 2000 to 2003 because they were not used for the treatment of chr onic HBV infection until 2004, based on information in the IADB.nl database. Costs for adefovir therapy increased substantially from subperiod 1 (2000- 2003) to subperiod 2 (2004-2006); in subperiod 2, t hey amounted to \u20ac128,037 (as of January 2010, \u20ac1.00 = US $1.43)25 and represented 49% of all expe nditures for chronic HBV therapy. Although the purchase price for lamivudine was almost the same i n the 2 subperiods, the proportion of overall anti- HBV treatment that was attributable to lamivudine t herapy decreased from 62% in subperiod 1 to 19% in subperiod 2. Thus, expenditures for novel drugs increased over time. Expenditures for PEG-IFN- 2b remained constant between subperiod 1 and subperiod 2. The annual costs per patient for anti-HBV drugs increase from subperiod 1 (2000-2003) to subp eriod 2 (2004-2006), from \u20ac950 to \u20ac2947 (Figure 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 Duration of therapy or drug exposure (days) 1,0 0,8 0,6 0,4 0,2 0,0 Proportion of subjects on therapy Censored Survival Function Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 85 6). In 2006, these per-patient costs were \u20ac171 per 1000 people in the general population, or \u20ac0.18 per capita. Figure 6.

Patien ts with suspected coinfection with hepatitis C viru s or HIV were excluded. ZDiscussion Principal Findings During the study period from 2000 to 2006, the annu al prevalence of chronic HBV infection appeared to increase steadily, based on database information re garding prescriptions for anti-HBV medications. Lamivudine was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by adefovir, as recommended by international and Dutch guidelines [9-12]. Lamivudi ne was the only drug prescribed from 2000 to 2001, as it was the first nucleoside analogue approved in the Netherlands for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. From 2000 to 2001, no other antiviral dr ugs were available on the Dutch market [14]. When more antiviral drugs were introduced to the Dutch m arket, the prescription rate for the older drugs (i e, lamivudine) decreased, and the prescription rate of newer drugs (e.g., tenofovir, adefovir) increased. Our results also indicated that combined therapy se emed to be more popular from 2004 to 2006; the combination of lamivudine and adefovir was the only one used. PEG-IFN- was used for a very small and stable number of patients over the years. PEG-I FN-2b and tenofovir were not recommended for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Dutch guidelines [12]. However, the utilization of these 2 drugs was stable among the population investigated in this retrospective database analysis. Prescripti on patterns for drugs to treat chronic HBV infections in the Netherlands were generally consistent with t he recommendations of international guidelines [9-11]. ANNEX 1 86 In terms of duration of drug use, 25% of patients ( n = 9) stopped using drugs for treatment of chronic HBV infection within 1 year after initiation; 68% ( 36 patients) were treated for >2 years. Fifty-five percent (34 patients) continued the therapy for >3 years. T his illustrates the chronicity of the disease and r elated drug use; clinical guidelines call for patients to receive therapy for chronic HBV infection for an ex tended period, or even for the rest of their lives. In add ition, most of the patients in the IADB.nl database used or nucleotide of using nucleoside or nucleoti de analogues is that they typically require prolong ed or indefinite therapy because the sustainability of their response after treatment discontinuation is limited [26]. In this retrospective analysis of Dutch prescriptio n data, more men than women were treated for chroni c HBV infection; the between-sex difference in infect ion prevalence increased over the course of the study period. This is unsurprising, given that men who have sex with men are considered to be at particularly high risk of HBV infection, which migh t have been increasingly detected with the risk-gro up- based approach to vaccination in the Netherlands in recent years [27]. Other populations at high risk for HBV infection include persons who have multiple sex ual contacts, immigrants from areas of moderate or high endemic HBV prevalence, and intravenous dru g users. Although the database used in the present study included information about sex, it di d not include information about subjects' ethnicity . The patients identified in the IADB.nl database were in the age range of 25 to 60 years. Adefovir, which was introduced to the Dutch market in early 2003, appeared to be the most costly drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Lamivud ine was the most prescribed drug; expenditures for this drug remained steady over the period investiga ted. Annual mean per-subject expenditures for anti- HBV drugs increased from 2000 to 2006. This may hav e been partly the result of higher prices for newer drugs. Study Strengths and Weaknesses As noted previously, this study was conducted with the IADB.nl database, which contains information about prescriptions dispensed in the Netherlands. T he IADB.nl database has several strengths. It includes information about 528,911 people for a lar ge period of time (from 1999 to the present), providing detailed dispensing records. Moreover, it also provides information about costs incurred for the purchase of drugs to treat chronic HBV infectio n over the course of a given year. However, the database could not provide information about the actual use of dispensed medicines. Therefore, the present study describes patterns of drug dispensing, rather than drug use; it is possib le that the 2 may differ. Furthermore, the database do es not contain medical records; thus, diagnoses must be inferred from the drugs dispensed, rather t han determined more directly. By trying to filter o ut patients who might have received antiviral medicati ons for other diseases, we may have underestimated the number of patients with chronic HBV infection. For example, we excluded users of IFN- because this medication may be used to treat other diseases , even though it was the first medication used to treat HBV infection. Also, no information about dru gs obtained OTC or in hospitals was available; however, the role of such drugs in the treatment of chronic HBV may be minor. Despite these Database Analysis of Drug Utilization and Costs for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B 87 limitations, the IADB.nl database makes it possible to retrospectively evaluate drug use in a relative ly large and well-defined population. Further work sho uld seek to link the IADB.nl prescription database with other databases comprising medical, diagnostic , and virologic information. According to Dutch treatment guidelines [12], the r ecommended duration of therapy with PEG-IFN- is 1 year for all patients, and the required duration of therapy with nucleoside or nucleotide analogues is longer. Our results suggest that prescriptions forc hronic HBV infection in the Netherlands conform to this recommendation. The primary difference between actual practice and the Dutch guidelines was that tenofovir and PEG-IFN- 2b were prescribed for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in practice, even though the guidelines do not yet recommend such use in the Netherlands. However, the Dutch guidelines were published relatively recently, so p atients who were treated for chronic HBV infection before their publication may have received therapy that did not conform to the current recommendations. The results of the present analysis indicate relati vely low prevalence and incidence of HBV infection in the Netherlands during the study period, which supp orts previously published findings.6 In fact, the prevalence we observed (0.03-0.06 per 1000) is low compared with the overall prevalence of chronic HBV infection in the Netherlands (0.2%) [12]. Howev er, it should be noted that the present analysis included only patients who received pharmacotherapy , and excluded those who were likely to have been coinfected with HCV or HIV. The general preval ence of 0.2% includes patients who do not receive pharmacotherapy, as well as those with coinfections . Our results also indicate that switching to newer a ntiviral drugs and prescribing combined therapy (particularly lamivudine plus adefovir) have become more common since 2004. A previously published study reported that combination therapy with lamivu dine and adefovir was associated with higher rates of response and lower rates of resistant mutations than lamivudine monotherapy [28]. The combination of IFN- or PEG-IFN- with lamivudine is also associated with higher rat es of treatment response than lamivudine monotherapy [11]. Despite the relatively low prevalence of HBV infect ion in the Netherlands, the Dutch health authoritie s are currently considering a nationwide universal in fant vaccination against HBV [7,8].It should be not ed that the occurrence of HBV infection might be great er in urban areas, and the epidemiology of HBV in the Netherlands may be influenced by populations or iginally from regions where HBV infection is more common [23,27,29,30]; more immigrants live in the l arge cities in the western Netherlands (e.g., Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague). The IADB.nl datab ase covers the population of the northern part of the Netherlands, where considerably fewer immigrant s live. However, the low rate of treatment and modest expenditures for anti-HBV therapy in the nor thern Netherlands do not support the inception of a national HBV vaccination program. ZConclusions The results of this retrospective analysis of infor mation from the IADB.nl database indicate that the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in the northern Netherlands was modest between 2000 and 2006, ANNEX 1 88 based on the numbers of prescriptions for and the e xpenditures for pharmacotherapy to treat the disease during the study period. To our knowledge, this is the first study of drug u tilization and costs for the treatment of chronic H BV infection in the Netherlands. Patients with chronic HBV infections may be coinfected with either HIV o r HCV, but patients taking pharmacotherapy that sugge sted such coinfections were excluded from the present analysis. Further research is needed to exp lore drug utilization in HIV-HBV or HBV-HCV coinfected patients.

Since 2006, two rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix and Rotateq, have been available in the market. These vaccines h ave proved to have high efficacy in developed countries. Clinical trials are being undertaken in Asia and Africa, and early clinical results find th at the vaccine significantly reduces severe diarrhoea epis odes due to rotavirus (48.3% for Asia and 30.2% for Africa). The World Health Organization (WHO) recomm ended that rotavirus immunization be included into all national immunization programs. Based on W HO's recommendations, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) decided to provide financial support of rotavirus immunization in the developing world. In this review, we attempted to a scertain the cost-effectiveness of universal rotavi rus immunization in developing countries. After an ext ensive literature search, we identified and evaluat ed 15 cost-effectiveness studies conducted in the deve loping world. The results from these studies showed that rotavirus immunization is a cost-effective str ategy and the \"best hope\" for prevention of rotavir us- related diarrheal disease. However, rotavirus vacci nes are expensive and the vaccine price appears as the most challenging and crucial factor to decision -makers regarding whether to introduce this vaccine into developing countries' immunization. All the st udies concluded that rotavirus immunization is cost - effective but it might not be affordable for the de veloping world at present. Developing countries wil l definitely rely on the financial support from inter national organizations to introduce rotavirus vacci nation. It is recommended that more cost-effective research with updated data be conducted and new rotavirus vaccine candidates be developed at cheaper price to speed up the introduction of rotavirus immunization in the developing world.

Annually, worldwide, around 1.8 million chil dren under the age of five die from diarrhoeal diseases and rotavirus is identified as the most common caus e of severe diarrhea [1-3]. Rotavirus infection has b een reported to be responsible for more than 2 mill ion hospitalizations and roughly 527,000 deaths [4]. Th e burden of disease of rotavirus infection is considered high in both developed and developing co untries. However, the disease mortality caused by rotavirus is a more serious public health concern i n the developing world as more than 85% of the rotavirus-related deaths occur in Africa and Asia [ 5]. Correspondingly, rotavirus infection and its consequences have become a heavy economic burden to both national healthcare systems and families in many low-income countries. In addressing high rotavirus-related diarrhoeal hos pitalizations and mortality rates among young children, immunization against this virus appears t o be the most promising prevention strategy. This i s particularly so for regions in Asia and Africa, whe re living conditions are poor and medical services are limited thus enhancing potentials for rotavirus inf ections to develop into more severe complications. Since 2006, two approved rotavirus vaccines, Rotate q (Merck) and Rotarix (Glaxo SmithKline), are available worldwide. These vaccines have demonstrat ed good protection against rotavirus infection and as such a good preventive agent against rotavirus-r elated severe diarrhoea and hospitalizations [6-11] . Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) reco mmends the inclusion of rotavirus vaccination into countries' immunization programs [12]. However, the costs of current generations of rotavirus vaccines are high in comparison to the current budgets spend ing for vaccines for prevention of childhood illnesses in many developing countries [13,14]. The decision to incorporate rotavirus vaccination i nto national immunization programs must be based on evidence including evidence on cost-effectiveness o f such a strategy. At the global level as rotavirus vaccines is introduced into national immunization p rograms of developing countries, often with financi al support from global initiatives, monitoring the imp lementation of these strategies is very important t o ensure that the public fund is not being used subop timally. Part of the assessment should include conducting cost-effectiveness analyses of rotavirus immunization in developed and developing countries, both prior and after potential introduct ion. In this review, we systematically summarize the int ernational peer reviewed literature on economics an d cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immunization with a focus on studies performed in the developing world . This focus is justifiable on the ground that it is in the developing world where the burden of rotavir us- related disease is the highest and the challenge of assuring vaccine performance the greatest when introducing rotavirus vaccination into countries' n ational immunization programs most urgent. This pap er shows the results and methodologies of formal cost- effectiveness analyses, different vaccine pricing scenarios, under which rotavirus immunization might be affordable and acceptable, and challenges faced by governments of developing and low-income c ountries when considering to introduce rotavirus vaccines into their routine immunization schemes. CHAPTER 5 96 ZMethods Criteria for cost-effectiveness evaluation of healt hcare interventions All cost-effectiveness studies included in this rev iew used one of the following standards set by eith er the WHO or the World Bank to assess the cost-effect iveness of rotavirus immunization in countries where studies were carried out. WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health There is no formal threshold for cost-effectiveness evaluations of healthcare interventions in develop ing countries. The WHO's Commission on Macroeconomics a nd Health suggests that interventions are considered \"very cost-effective\", \"cost-effective\" and \"not cost-effective\" when their costs are less than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita per dis ability-adjusted life year (DALY), three times GDP per capita per DALY and higher than three times GDP per capita per DALY, respectively (102). The World Bank For developing countries (a country of low- or midd le-level of GDP per capita is labeled a developing country [World Bank definition] [103]), an interven tion is defined as highly cost-effective if an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is US$ 227 per DALY averted [15]. For low-income countries (a low-income country is a country with 2 008 gross national income per capita at US$975 or less [World Bank definition] [103]), an interventio n is defined as highly cost-effective if an ICER is US$ 166 per DALY averted (15). Search strategies Economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccination were searched using PubMed and Embase databases. Keywords for retrieval were \"rotavirus\" or \"rotavir w-income countries\". We decided to select studies between 2000 and August 2010 because rotavirus vacc ines are very new vaccines, which have been available in the market only since 2006. Eligible criteria Further eligibility criteria stipulated that: Studies should be strictly classifiable in one of the formal health-economic categories of cost- effectiveness, cost-utility or cost-benefit analysi s (CEA, CUA and CBA, respectively). Studies should be written in English and only peer -reviewed journals were considered. Studies were strictly conducted in developing or l ow-income countries. All abstracts retrieved from the electronic databas es were independently screened and reviewed by two team members (MJ Postma and HA Tu). Disagreements w ere resolved through discussions. Eligible abstracts were later retrieved in the full-text for mat and screened by another reviewer (HJ Woerdenbag ) for confirming eligibility. Reference sections of t he retrieved articles were manually searched for an y potential missing studies. Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 97 Data abstraction Detailed information was abstracted using a pre-spe cified data extraction form. Items in the form included author(s), publication year, country, appr oach, validation/calibration of models, type of sensitivity analysis, perspectives taken and outcom es included. In this review, we specifically focus on economic m odeling, perspectives taken (societal, healthcare, payer), and discount rate as they are important fac tors for cost-effectiveness analyses. Generally, th ese aspects are well known to reflect important issues in the health economics of vaccines, especially for new and underused vaccines. ZResults General In total, 138 potentially relevant articles publish ed between 2000 and August 2010 were retrieved. Figure 1 describes the flow chart of the literature search. After culling according to the eligibility criteria, we found 15 studies conducted in 13 developing coun tries focusing on the economic evaluations of CHAPTER 5 98 rotavirus immunization between 2000 and August 2010 . Of these, 8 studies took place in Asia [14,16- 21]; 3 came from Africa [22,23] and 4 were done in Central and Latin America [24-27]. Eight studies were conducted in GAVI Alliance-eligible countries [13,14,17-20,23]. The search result and culling process are shown as per Figure 1. The oldest study emerging from the search was from 2005 [16] and the most recent study was published in 2010 [13]. The most relevant aspects o f these studies are summarized in Table 1. Study characteristics Most studies being review evaluated the cost-effect iveness of universal rotavirus immunization [13,14,16-21,23,24-28] except for the study by Orte ga et al. [22] , being a cost-benefit analysis. In all studies, universal rotavirus immunization was evalu ated and no study was found for targeted immunization. This is not surprising given the gene ral notion that no clear risk factors for rotavirus infections can be identified. Thirteen studies mode led impacts of universal rotavirus immunization on children under 5 years of age [14,16-24,26-28], whi le two studies [13,25] modeled impacts of universal immunization of children up to only two years old. Details are provided in Table 1. Perspectives taken in evaluation rotavirus immuniza tion All studies under review followed the WHO's generic protocol for monitoring the impact of rotavirus immunization [29]. All cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from either the societal perspective (e.g., including direct medical cost, direct non-me dical cost and indirect cost, n = 14) or/and the healthcare perspective (e.g., including direct medi cal cost and direct non-medical cost, n = 15). In o ther words, there is only one study, which was conducted solely from the healthcare perspective. Detailed results on economic evaluations of rotavir us immunization Cost-effectiveness analysis Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) were carried out in two countries in Africa [32;33]. In Malawi rotavirus infection is very common in children. The country is eligible for the highest support from t he GAVI Alliance for co-financing new vaccines. Berry et al. conducted a CEA of universal rotavirus immunization in Malawi [13]. This study differs fro m others because impacts of rotavirus immunization were evaluated in children under two years old only , which can be considered as a conservative approach. Importantly, the study considered impacts of both the GAVI Alliance subsided vaccine price and the marketed vaccine price on the cost-effectiv eness result. The study shows that at both the GAVI - subsided and the marketed vaccine price, universal rotavirus immunization in Malawi is cost-effective, with ICERs per DALY of US$ 5.07 and US$ 74.73, resp ectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that under both vaccine pricing schemes, the cost-effect iveness was most sensitive to vaccine efficacy, vaccine price and rotavirus-related mortality of un der-two-year-old children. The authors also noted t hat even at a relatively low preliminary estimate of va ccine efficacy of 49%, the vaccine still presents a very good value for money. Adding rotavirus vaccination to Malawi's immunization program was recommended as very advantageous to public health. Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 99 In a study conducted in Kenya it was shown that uni versal rotavirus immunization could prevent 55% of deaths, 65% of hospitalizations and 59% of clinic v isits, all related to rotavirus infection [23]. The program would be cost-saving if the vaccine price w as less than or equal to US$ 1.03 per dose (including administration). The study revealed that outpatient cost was a major part in the treatment costs (and potential savings) of rotavirus infectio n in Kenya. The authors concluded that when vaccine price was below US$ 7.35, 9.26, and 20.31 per dose based on thresholds of the WHO, World Bank and the Kenyan GDP per capita in 2006, which was US$ 58 0, respectively, rotavirus immunization would be cost-effective. However, these pricing thresholds a re much higher than the GAVI-subsidized price of US$ 0.30 per dose that is offered to developing and low-income countries, thus making immunization cost-saving only if Kenya receives financial suppor t from the GAVI Alliance. The authors also emphasized that the GAVI's additional financial sup port is only available for the first 5 years of vac cines implementation. After that, Kenya will have to fina nce rotavirus immunization by itself with the risk of becoming unaffordable to Kenyan government in the l ong run, although mentioned threshold prices do provide some room for still being cost-effective at higher pricing. It is notable that at the time the study was carried out, only early results of rotavirus va ccine trials were available in Africa. The authors considered it very important to continue surveillan ce on the impact of immunization on the disease burden in Kenya. Several economic evaluations on rotavirus vaccinati on have been performed in Asia to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. The mo st recent CEA comes from Thailand. Similar to many studies in the developing world, the authors wanted to explore the feasibility if rotavirus immunizati on were introduced to Thailand [28]. The study highlig hted that universal rotavirus immunization could be cost-effective in that country, saving 109,918 outp atient visits and preventing 419 deaths per year. T he break-even price calculated from the healthcare per spective was quite high (US$ 6.2 per dose), which almost equals the current market price of available rotavirus vaccines in Thailand. Yet, for rotavirus immunization to be affordable in Thailand, the vacc ine price should be lower than the current market price of US$ 7 per dose. In addition, Thailand is n ot a GAVI-Alliance eligible country; therefore, it will not receive concessional purchase price for rotavirus v accines. This indicates that implementing rotavirus immunization in Thailand could be a financial chall enge for the government. Two CEAs were carried out in Vietnam. The first stu dy, being the oldest one included in this review, explored the impact of universal rotavirus immuniza tion from both the societal and healthcare perspectives [16]. Cost data were collected and com pared for urban and rural areas. Direct medical costs were about 1.5 times higher in urban areas th an in rural areas. In contrast, the total cost per outpatient visit was higher in rural than in urban areas. Hospitalizations accounted for 75% of the to tal direct medical cost. The authors concluded that int roducing rotavirus immunization might potentially reduce 70% of related outpatient visits, 84% of hos pitalizations and 83% of deaths and probably become a cost-effective strategy in Vietnam. The co st-effectiveness of the program would be most sensitive to rotavirus-related mortality rate and v accine price. The medical break-even point occurred when the vaccine price was estimated at US$ 1.04 fo r a two-dose vaccination regime (Rotateq). It was clear from the study that vaccine price was the key driver for deciding whether to include rotavirus CHAPTER 5 100 vaccine into the Vietnamese routine immunization. A t the time the study was conducted in 2005, the GAVI Alliance did not provide financial support for rotavirus vaccination yet. The second Vietnamese study by Kim et al . was the first to conduct a cost-effectiveness ana lysis of universal rotavirus immunization in a developing an d low-income country by applying a complex Markov model [19]. Many comparable studies only used a sim ple static model with the assumption that each child would be infected with rotavirus only once in his or her life-time. However, these authors embar ked in exploring the impact of rotavirus immunization b y developing a Markov model, which captured the key features of rotavirus infections such as allowing a child to get up to four infections during the chil d's lifetime. The model also took into account partial immunity by wild type infection that varies dependi ng on the number of past infections. Another differenc e of this study compared to almost all studies in t his review was the inclusion of vaccine wastage in the model and the use of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results incl uding parameters' uncertainty. The study revealed t hat cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to vaccine pr ice, vaccine efficacy against severe diarrhoea and discount rate. In summary, the study showed that ro tavirus immunization would reduce the incidence of severe cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis by 67%. V accination appeared to be a cost-effective strategy , as the ICER per DALY was US$ 540 and US$ 550 from s ocietal and healthcare perspectives, respectively, values that were lower than GDP per c apita in 2009 [15]. However, the authors argued tha t for a developing and low-income country like Vietna m, favorable cost-effectiveness of an immunization program does not necessarily implies affordability for the country's healthcare system when the resource is limited. Obviously, rotavirus vaccine i s still quite expensive, thus posing a financial hu rdle for its introduction into the national immunization. No netheless, both the studies by Fischer et al. [16] and Kim et al. confirmed the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immu nization in Vietnam [19]. In China, the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus vaccine has al ready been developed and licensed since 1998, but rotavirus immunization has not yet been integrated into the EPI. Wang et al. conducted a cost- effectiveness study to assess potential benefits of universal rotavirus immunization by using this vac cine [21]. The authors concluded that in China rotavirus immunization was cost-effective, especially in remote rural areas. In contrast to other studies, t he analysis was performed from the patient's perspective where all out-of-pocket payments were c onsidered. It was clear that in the absence of health insurance in rural areas in China, treatment cost are borne by the patient's family and thus, t he patient's out-of-pocket expenditures would be the m ajor hurdle for the introduction of rotavirus immunization. The strength of this study compared t o other studies is that it did not rely heavily on many assumptions. Much data was derived empirically from a prospective, population-based diarrhoeal surveillance. The authors themselves also conducted a cost-of-illness study to collect the cost incurr ed due to rotavirus infection. Univariate and probabil istic sensitivity analyses showed that the cost- effectiveness of rotavirus immunization was most se nsitive to vaccine price. The authors concluded tha t in China where 80% of people live in the rural area s, rotavirus immunization should be considered as a potential, cost-effective measure against rotavirus infection. Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 101 Wilopo et al. in a study in Indonesia confirmed that rotavirus im munization can effectively reduce the disease burden and rotavirus-associated healthcare cost [14]. The study evaluated the possibility to introduce rotavirus vaccine in the Indonesian natio nal immunization program. It showed that immunizing children of less than 5 years old reduced deaths, h ospitalizations, outpatient visits by 76.5%, 84%, a nd 70%, respectively. Immunization would become cost-s aving with the vaccine price less than US$ 2.7 per dose from the healthcare perspective. Vaccine c ost was the main driver influencing the program's cost-effectiveness. Similar to all other studies un der review, rotavirus immunization in Indonesia was considered a cost-effective intervention. However, affordability of a rotavirus immunization program i s uncertain to the government despite its obvious cos t-effectiveness results. This is congruent with findings from the studies by Kim et al [19] and Tate et al [23] . Indeed, available rotavirus vaccines have been argued as costly vaccines and they face likely competition by other childhood vaccines for gainin g the limited budget allocation. The authors emphasiz ed the need for external financial support from international organizations and less-costly produce d rotavirus vaccines in Indonesia in order to make universal rotavirus immunization affordable. Two studies were carried out in the Central Asia. W ith a set-up comparable to other cost-effectiveness studies on rotavirus immunization, Flem et al performed their research in Kyrgyzstan [17], a GAV I Alliance-eligible country [105]. The authors analyz ed the disease cost in terms of direct medical, dir ect non-medical and indirect costs due to rotavirus inf ection and estimated the future savings from immunization against the disease. A detailed cost c omposition showed that medical costs accounted for 52% of the total cost-per-episode of rotavirus admi ssion, while the remaining 48% were generated from the direct non-medical and indirect cost. Out-of-po cket payment to take care of inpatients and outpatients contributed substantially to the total treatment cost. From a detailed sub-analysis, it appeared that families of children with diarrhea us ed almost 62% of their savings, which in turn reduc ed household expenses by 31% in order to shift funds t o cover illness expenses. Through the cost- effectiveness analysis, it was calculated that rota virus immunization for children under five years ol d would reduce 63% of direct medical costs or 66% of the total cost of treatment. Rotavirus immunization would be cost-effective at a vaccine price per chil d of less than US$ 9.41 per dose. The program would become cost-saving for the Kyrgyz government at the GAVI-subsided price of US$ 0.3 per dose and also in the range of US$ 0.5-1 per dose if the soci etal perspective is taken. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the program's cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to mortality rate, vaccine efficacy against mortality and vaccine price. The study was carried out at the time Kyrgyzstan received GAVI's financial support for rotavirus immunization. Howev er, the future possibility for immunization being affordable is still questionable when the country w ould eventually rely on its own funding in sustaini ng immunization. The study's strength lies in applying the same methods for economic evaluation, which has been applied in similar studies in Eastern Euro pe region. This enables comparisons within the same region and income strata. However, it also encounte red several similar limitations as other studies in terms of calculation of the disease costs, which ar e of often difficult to measure and estimated with broad ranges of uncertainty in developing countries . CHAPTER 5 102 The second study carried out in Central Asia came f rom Uzbekistan [18]. Like Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan is a GAVI Alliance-eligible country. In general, the c ountry has high vaccine coverage and a well- established infrastructure for vaccines delivery. T he authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis on universal rotavirus immunization in Uzbekistan usin g both the national and international data on mortality. Based on the national data, rotavirus im munization would be cost-effective at vaccine price s up to US$ 8 per dose. In contrast, using the intern ational data, rotavirus immunization could be cost- effective at the vaccine price up to US$ 25 per dos e. It was concluded that the cost-effectiveness res ults were most sensitive to mortality rate and vaccine p rice were most crucial in determining the cost- effectiveness results. Rotavirus immunization could prevent 91% of hospitalization cost, of which dire ct medical costs accounted for 89% (equivalent to US$ 328,154 for the healthcare system). The authors also estimated out-of-pocket expenses spent by fami lies on hospitalizations, which was around 37% of families' incomes. This figure clearly supported th at rotavirus infection is a heavy financial burden for Uzbek individuals due to the long hospitalization i n the rotavirus treatment protocol in Uzbekistan. T he authors suggested to shorten the hospitalization st ay in order to save costs incurred by these individ uals beyond healthcare insurance cover. The study also f aced several limitations. The cost incurred by outpatient visits was neglected and the reported in direct cost was low as the data was collected only by interviewing women, who traditionally do not work i n Uzbekistan. However, this was the first study in a former Soviet Union's country, which aimed to quant ify the financial burden caused by rotavirus infection. It would definitely support health decis ion makers in such countries to develop a proper rotavirus immunization plan. The most recent cost-effectiveness study on rotavir us immunization in Latin America comes from Columbia and was done by De la Hoz et al [25] . Different from all other studies, the authors mea sured the impact of using the two available vaccines (Rot arix vs. Rotateq) by comparing immunization against \"no vaccination\" for three hypothetical cohorts (im munization using Rotarix, immunization using Rotate q and no immunization). This approach could capture c osts and effects from all possible immunization scenarios using available vaccines in the market. T he results showed that rotavirus immunization could be highly cost-effective in Columbia, with the aver age cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) of approximatel y US$ 1,063 per DALY if comparing vaccination with no vaccination. Compared to no immunization,it would bring a 27% and 25% reduction in hospitalizat ion and death averted for Rotarix and a 30% and 28% reduction in hospitalization and death averted for Rotateq. Rotavirus immunization would become cost-saving at the vaccine price of US$ 3 per dose. Sensitivity analyses also revealed that vaccine pr ice and vaccine efficacy are the critical variables to the cost-effectiveness results. The authors emphasi zed that although both vaccines have high potentials of being beneficial to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) program in Columbia and could po tentially reduce the mortality rate in the country, the final choice on vaccination still has to be mad e by the health decision makers. Using Rotateq resulted in a higher reduction rate of hospital adm issions and deaths, but the three-dose course for children requires more logistics and investment. In contrast, Rotarix requires only two doses, and thu s reducing a lot of direct non-medical and indirect c ost of caregivers as well as the cost of the health system. The authors further suggested that selectin g appropriate immunization strategies depends on Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 103 the choice of vaccines. To do that, surveillance an d identification of the rotavirus strains related t o the disease are needed. Rose et al evaluated the cost-effectiveness of mass immunizat ion in India using one specific rotavirus vaccine [20]. In contrast to comparable studies con ducted in other developing countries where the complexity of the disease epidemiology was ignored, the authors of this Indian study took a different approach in their economic evaluation. In the model , the simulations of sequential events, from infect ion to symptoms development, use of health services, di sease outcomes, recovery and re-infection for a heterogeneous birth cohort were explicitly taken in to account. Similar to Kim et al [19] , the model in this study shared some key features of rotavirus infecti on such as incorporating partial immunity from previous infections and the possibility of being re -infected. However, the major strength of this mode l is that it simulates clinical events and health servic es while accounting the effects of each individual' s age, infection and vaccination history. Vaccine efficacy was also adjusted to account for specific rotaviru s strain distributions in India. Methodologically, th e Markov model used in this study was the most sophisticated and most complex compared to other CE As included in this review. The authors also concluded that universal rotavirus immunization was cost-effective in India and the results were reconfirmed by one and two-way sensitivity analyses . An interesting finding emerging from this study was the sensitivity of ICERs to the probability of using outpatient services. This in fact was the onl y parameter that could plausibly increase the ICERs t o a value greater than one time GDP per capita while being varied. In the most recent study from Brazil, de Soarez et al conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of universal rotavirus vaccination in that country [26 ]. Brazil is one of the first countries, that has implemented universal rotavirus immunization using the Rotarix vaccine since 2006. The study was performed from both the societal and healthcare per spectives. In the healthcare approach, only costs incurred from public health facilities were calcula ted, although 30% of healthcare services in Brazil come from the private sector. The authors developed a decision tree model to simulate the disease progression in the case of rotavirus infection. The disadvantage of this model was that it only allowe d each child to get one rotavirus infection during hi s or her lifetime. The study concluded that univers al rotavirus immunization in Brazil was proven very co st-effective from both societal and healthcare perspectives. The authors argued that if the model were allowed to capture rotavirus re-infections, rotavirus immunization would become even more cost- effective. Results from sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of immunization woul d be the most sensitive to rotavirus incidence, proportion of severe, moderate and mild diarrhea ep isodes, vaccine coverage and vaccine prices. Cost- effectiveness results were not sensitive to treatme nt cost or discount rate. The break-even point for immunization would be US$ 9.98 and US$ 4.24 per dos e from the societal and healthcare perspective, respectively. The authors also emphasized that in a populous country like Brazil, where there is a hug e regional and socio-economic difference, using only local data on costs to represent the national value s might undermine the accuracy of the results. Like a ll other CEA studies, indirect effects of herd immunity were not considered as no data was yet ava ilable from the literature. Despite these shortcomings, results of this study appeared to be valid and robust and confirmed that introducing CHAPTER 5 104 rotavirus vaccination in Brazilian National Immuniz ation Program in 2006 was justifiable from the economic point of view. In an earlier study from Brazil, Constenla et al performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of rotavir us vaccination in the country [24]. The authors explor ed the benefits of mass rotavirus immunization by calculating the savings from the medical treatment of gastroenteritis, number of averted hospitalizati ons, outpatient visits, deaths and DALYs. The outcome me asures of this study were different from the study by de Soarez et al , where the authors aimed to calculate the number o f life-years saved and deaths averted [26]. It was shown that rotavirus vaccinati on possibly saved Brazil's healthcare system US$ 19.3 million of direct medical costs. Cost-effe ctiveness results were most sensitive to vaccine pr ice, vaccine efficacy and rotavirus-associated mortality rate. The authors argued that at US$ 7-8 per dose, the program would be cost-effective according to th e WHO's definition. However, it might not be affordable in Brazil if the government eventually h ad to fully finance the entire immunization program . As calculated, if the vaccine price was estimated at U S$ 2.17 per dose, immunization would be considered cost-saving. In all cases, rotavirus immunization r educed outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deat hs averted by 77%, 76% and 73%, respectively. The auth ors also recommended the herd immunity be considered to better estimate the full benefits of rotavirus immunization. Valencia-Mendoza et al evaluated the cost-effectiveness of universal rota virus immunization using the pentavalent vaccine, Rotateq, in Mexico [27]. The a uthors measured the cost-effectiveness outcomes in various dimensions: incremental cost per case preve nted, death averted and life-year gained. By conducting sensitivity analyses, it was shown that the leading determinants of the cost-effectiveness results were case fatality, vaccine price, vaccine efficacy, serotype prevalence, and annual waning of efficacy. More specifically, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination was very sensitive to the number of case fatalities, which implies that the vaccine mig ht contribute significantly more to public health i n the poorer areas and where access to prompt medical car e is limited, both enhancing case-fatality rates. When vaccine price was less than US$ 15 per dose, i mmunization would be very cost-effective. Interestingly, cost-effectiveness was insensitive t o the medical cost of the disease, which is differe nt from the findings by Rose et al [20] . However, the model was based on the healthcare pe rspective where only direct medical cost was considered. Dire ct non-medical cost on transportation, foods etc an d indirect cost of productivity loss of caregivers we re ignored but might contribute substantially if considered. Similar to the analysis in Kenya [23], affordability of immunization was again debated in spite of its potentially favorable cost-effectivene ss. Cost-benefit analysis This review locates only one cost-benefit analysis (CBA), a study carried out in Egypt [22]. The autho rs aimed to calculate benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) based on various vaccine prices (worst-case, base-case, and best-case scenarios). In the base-case scenario , the BCR was 0.0726:1, which implied that introducing rotavirus immunization in Egypt would n ot be a cost-saving strategy explicitly from the Ministry of Health's perspective. However, rotaviru s vaccination could reduce outpatient visits, hospitalizations and mortality by 91%, 90% and 88%, respectively. Rotavirus immunization also Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 105 contributed to 63% reduction in the morbidity. Sens itivity analyses showed that vaccine price was the most critical parameter followed by the rotavirus i ncidence, and the frequency of outpatient visits. T his study looked at the financial burden of the disease only from the Ministry of Health's perspective, in which only the direct medical cost was considered. Despite its preliminary results, the study proved t hat immunization was clearly beneficial to the Egyptian society in terms of the health and economic gains related to reduced morbidity and mortality as well as the saved treatment cost incurred from rotavirus infection. The study's results revealed that vaccin e price is a crucial factor influencing the cost-sa ving of the program. The authors suggested more in-depth si milar research be carried out in that country. Methodological Issues General model characteristics Almost all studies included in this review used sim ple decision tree models of rotavirus infections. Consequently, they encountered several limitations. The model applied in these studies only allows a child to be infected once with rotavirus during his /her life-time [14,17,18,21,23,24,26,27], and hence could not fully incorporate all key features of rot avirus infection (e.g., allowing more than one rota virus infection during the life of a child). This creates some uncertainties in the ICERs as the potential i mpact of these key features that were not incorporated re mained unexplored. To overcome these issues, Kim el al in the study in Vietnam developed a Markov model w hich allowed up to four re-infections per child [19]. In addition, their Markov model also consider ed partial immunity by wild type infections. In a s imilar analysis Rose et al in the study in India developed a Markov model, w hich additionally captured the shifts in the mix of inpatient and outpatient care that might result from decreased severity of sympt oms among vaccinated children who became infected [20]. However, a common limitation that all reviewed studies encountered is the exclusion of the herd im munity in the analysis. This issue has been acknowledged and discussed in several papers[14,20, 24,26,30]. Had herd immunity been considered in the analyses, the effects of universal immunization might be enormous. However, to do this, there should be data available on the magnitude of herd i mmunity. Partial immunization has also been reflected in the modeling across several studies [2 2,24,26]. For example, in the study by de Soarez et al , effects of immunization with one dose versus two do ses of the Rotarix vaccine was considered [26]. Regarding the effect due to the type of vaccines, m ost of the studies modeled on the use of the monovalent two-dose vaccine (Rotarix) [14,17-20,23, 24,26]. One study made a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing the two available vaccines (R otarix and Rotateq) [27] whereas another focused on the cost-effectiveness of Rotateq vaccine alone [34]. The study from China conducted a CEA using a Chinese-manufactured vaccine [21]. In terms of the methodology, all studies are quite similar in the way they carried out cost-effectiven ess analyses. All CEAs were performed from either healt hcare (only direct medical cost) or societal perspectives (including direct non-medical cost and indirect cost) or both. Only one study under revie w conducted a CBA [22]. The studies being review diff er in the way cost items were collected and cost categories were defined. This happens because count ries have different healthcare structures and the way costs collected would depend on the country-bas e context. Nevertheless, no study collected treatment cost of rotavirus infection throughout th e entire country. Either the treatment cost was CHAPTER 5 106 collected in one region (urban vs. rural) or from h ospitals (central vs. regional vs. district) and th en extrapolated nationally. Hence, the treatment cost might not represent the true treatment cost in a country. However, these limitations were discussed in all studies. Basic typologies of models used in the CEAs are sta tic versus dynamic or decision tree versus Markov models. Fourteen studies in this review were CEAs w ith twelve studies of these CEAs used decision trees in modeling [13,14,16-21,25-28]. The similari ty of these decision tree models was that they only captured one rotavirus infection per child during t he first 5 years of their life. A few studies tried to develop a more complex decision tree model in an at tempt to incorporate as many possible health outcomes from rotavirus infection [13,26,27]. In co ntrast to very simple decision tree models, Markov models would enable capturing more than one infecti on per child during his or her life. It is notable that two Markov models developed are quite comprehensive and sophisticated [19,20]. These models indeed could capture many additional features of ro tavirus infections such as allowing multiple rotavi rus infections, factoring in acquisition of partial imm unity from previous infections, the changing effect s of individual's age, the impacts of vaccine efficacy d ue to different strains, and the timing of clinical events (e.g., time interval corresponds to episodes of rot avirus infection). Nevertheless, none of the studie s tried to apply dynamic modeling in conducting CEAs. This could be due to the lack of available data on rotavirus epidemiology. Herd immunity was also not taken into account in any of the studies due to the same reasons. Discounting Discounting refers to the translation of values obt ained from one time period in future to the present value. Discounting makes current costs and benefits worth more than those occurring in the future owing to an opportunity cost to spend money now and a desire to enjoy the benefits now rather than in the future. As summarized in Table 1, in the study by de Soarez et al the cost and health effects were discounted at the highest discount rate of 6% [26]. The authors argued that it was considered as the most appropriate discount rate for developing count ries. The remaining 14 studies in the review applie d a 3% discount rate per year for both cost and healt h outcomes [13,14,16-25,27,28], which is in line wi th the WHO's guidelines on discounting [31]. Study types Cost-effectiveness analyses (i.e., health gains exp ressed in integrated units adjusted for quality or infections prevented or life-years gained) were con ducted in 14 studies [13,14,16-21,23-28]. Only one study [22] focused on a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) . The effectiveness outcomes investigated in CEAs life-year gained (LYG) and DALY, and quality-a djusted-life-year (QALY) was not utilized in any of the studies. Possible reasons are that it was diffi cult to measure quality of life of a child under 5 years old and published literature on QALYs for rotavirus -related diarrhoea is not available. All studies being review followed the WHO's generic protocol for research on rotavirus immunization [32]. As described in Table 2, in addition to calcu lating ICERs in monetary value per DALY as the most common health outcome indicator, cost-effectiveness results of rotavirus immunization were also expressed in terms of reduction of hospitalizations , outpatient visits, number of deaths averted, numb er Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 107 of reduced severe cases, and the direct medical cos t saved when comparing immunization vs. no- immunization. Model parameters It appeared from all analyses that the cost-effecti veness results were most sensitive to variation in vaccine price. Although cost-effectiveness results revealed that rotavirus immunization was either cos t- effective or very cost-effective in developing coun tries, vaccine price appeared to be unaffordable to governments of developing countries where the rotav irus vaccines have to compete with other less expensive childhood vaccines (e.g. hepatitis B or p olio) for the limited resources.Hence, vaccine pric e has become one of the most important factors in dec ision making of whether to include this vaccine int o the country's routine immunization program. Mortali ty rate and vaccine efficacy are other two factors having substantial impacts on cost-effectiveness re sults. So far, clinical trials of vaccine efficacy are being conducted in several developing countries and results will soon be released. Therefore, many studies in this review have to use vaccine efficacy data from developed countries where clinical data is available. Rotavirus-related mortality rate is not available in any of the studies being review, thus all studies had to use diarrhoea-related mortality rate , which is naturally higher. Uncertainty analyses Due to the fact that results of rotavirus vaccinati on depends largely on many parameters like vaccine price, vaccine wastage, vaccine efficacy, diarrhea incidence, case-fatality rate, severity of, diarrhe a, hospitalization costs, mortality, and morbidity, th ere is a huge uncertainty surrounding the cost- effectiveness results of rotavirus immunization. Th erefore, in all studies, sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Se veral studies even conducted probability sensitivit y analysesto test the effects of multiple parameters simultaneously [19,20]. ZDiscussion All reviewed studies on rotavirus immunization in d eveloping and low-income countries provide clear evidence that universal rotavirus immunization of c hildren under 5 years old is either cost-effective or very cost-effective, but the vaccine price is still expensive and not yet affordable by the healthcare system of these countries. However, sensitivity ana lyses have shown that even at a vaccine price as high as US$ 25/dose [35], rotavirus immunization wo uld still be cost-effective. Since all studies incl uded in this review explored the possibility of introduc ing universal rotavirus vaccination into countries' national EPI rather than evaluated an actual ongoin g immunization, almost all studies have provided several scenarios under which immunization would be breaking-even, cost-effective, very cost-effective or cost-saving. By evaluating these scenarios, it h elps vaccine manufacturers, the GAVI Alliance and various national governments to seriously consider the feasibility and affordability to introduce rota virus vaccination into countries' routine immunization pr ograms by either providing rotavirus vaccines at a much cheaper price or developing new generations of vaccines at lower costs. All studies followed the WHO's generic protocol in evaluating diarrhea [33], and therefore, the cost- effectiveness analyses were conducted in similar ma nner. Even with two studies developed CHAPTER 5 108 sophisticated and complex Markov models rather than applying decision tree models to capture all manifestation of rotavirus infections (i.e., allowi ng re-infections in the disease transitional model or to consider partial immunization vs. fully immunizatio n) [19,20], all studies came to the same conclusion that universal rotavirus immunization is cost-effec tive. This is in spite of the fact that cost data w ere collected in different way. The perspectives (i.e., either societal or health care), in which CEAs wer e carried out would be appropriate based on the objec tives of the studies. Studies' results showed that for developing countri es, where access to medical services, especially when urgent care is limited, rotavirus immunization appears as the best prevention against severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus. Rotavirus immunizatio n might reduce greatly the number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, deaths as well as a significant amount of treatment cost incurred from rotavirus infection per year. It is notable that th ough rotavirus related diarrhoea is one of the most deadly diseases in children in the developing world , it is also the most preventable disease. Rotaviru s immunization takes effect immediately. This is diff erent from other infectious diseases such as hepati tis B for which the benefits of immunization only becom e apparent in 30-40 years. Hence, rotavirus vaccination is a worthwhile healthcare investment a nd the best prevention against rotavirus-related diarrhoea. However, rotavirus immunization is still a costly intervention for developing and low-incom e countries where the cost of the vaccine is a major challenge for its introduction. All studies in this review concluded that without the financial support from i nternational health organizations, developing countries would not be able to implement universal rotavirus immunization at least at present or in th e near future. Finally, concerns on inefficiencies in the delivery of a complete course and getting vaccinations on time to all children were raised, a nd these concerns should be considered and addressed. The cost-effectiveness analyses included in this re view were undertaken while many clinical trials wer e still ongoing in Asia and Africa. Therefore, one is sue needing exploration was vaccine efficacy. While rotavirus vaccine efficacy was shown to be very hig h in industrialized countries, it seemed to have mu ch variation in developing countries and heavily depen ding on country-wide situations. One of many features of the rotavirus is that it has various ge notypes and these genotypes differ from country to country. Kim et al also mentioned that the genotype distributions dif fered widely across studies and even within Vietnam, leading to a wide range of adj usted vaccine efficacy ranging between 46% and 81% [19]. Furthermore, even though the incidence of rotavirus infection is similar between developed and developing countries [20,24], the severity of the d isease manifestation differs greatly across countri es. It has been shown that the local case fatality is o ne of the most influential parameters to cost- effectiveness results of the immunization program [ 26]. This is explainable because the quality, accessibility and availability of healthcare servic es differ across and within countries. It is worthw hile to recommend that, in addition to implement rotavirus immunization, developing healthcare infrastructure, nutrition improvements, education for oral rehydrat ion therapy should be considered as a combined prevention and treatment strategy to enhance the co ntrol of diarrhoeal disease. Economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization for developing countries 109 In all studies, vaccine price was the dominant para meter influencing the cost-effectiveness results an d hence the decisions of health policy makers. Even c onfirmed to be cost-effective, this does not imply rotavirus immunization is affordable by developing countries. For low-income countries, this would require the heavy financial support from internatio nal organizations such as the GAVI Alliance's fund. Economic evaluations can provide useful information for the GAVI Alliance in making plans to help eligible countries in introducing rotavirus vaccina tion. The results of these studies also help governments and GAVI to negotiate with vaccine prod ucers to obtain a cheaper vaccine price. Another suggestion is the possibility to develop less expen sive rotavirus vaccines. Many reviewed studies showed that if the vaccine price were US$ 2-3/dose, immunization would become cost-saving and affordable by the countries' healthcare systems. Th is translates in a 50-60% reduction of the current vaccine price. At the moment, the GAVI Alliance is accepting applications from its eligible countries for rotavirus vaccines financing. The subsidized price given by GAVI is budgeted at US$ 0.30 per dose [13,34], which is much lower than the current marke t price of US$ 7 per dose [26]. If developing countries are to benefit from the GAVI subsidized v accine price, rotavirus immunization might become affordable in the developing world. The review points to several limitations faced by t he various studies. First is the lack of epidemiolo gical data. Many studies in this review had to use data i nstead from developed countries in the modeling [18,23,28,34]. Thus, the authors suggested more sur veillance studies on rotavirus epidemiology in countries around the world. Second is the applicati on of disease transitional models. Many studies use d simple static decision tree models, allowing only o ne infection of rotavirus-related diarrhoea. Howeve r, in reality, nearly every child under 5 years of age gets more than one rotavirus infection in his or h er life time[12]. Herd immunity was not considered in any r eviewed study partly because no published data is available. In the same manner, dynamic models were not utilized in any study though a few studies had developed more complex disease progression models t o capture different genotypes, more infections per child, results of partial immunization against rotavirus [13,19,20]. Another limitation is the lac k of data on rotavirus vaccine efficacy in developing co untries. Rotavirus vaccines have been available onl y since 2006, thus many clinical trials are still bei ng conducted. This leads to the applying of data fr om a developed country to a developing country, which mi ght over-estimate the results of cost-effectiveness analyses. Despite various concerns faced by developing countr ies in introducing rotavirus vaccination in their national immunization program, it is obvious that r otavirus immunization is a \"worth-to-do\" interventi on from the healthcare point-of-view. Eventually, deve loping countries have to implement rotavirus immunization as it saves many lives of young childr en, especially in the most marginalized and impoverished regions where living conditions and qu ality of healthcare are still under-developed. To prepare the developing world in introducing rotavir us vaccination into routine immunization, substanti al financial assistance is definitely needed from inte rnational organizations. CHAPTER 5 110 ZConclusion & Expert Commentary Based on the available international peer reviewed literature on the economic evaluations of rotavirus immunization in the developing world, we conclude t hat it is cost-effective to implement universal rotavirus immunization. So far, vaccine price is th e most crucial factor hindering developing countrie s from introducing rotavirus vaccination into their r outine immunization programs. Despite the cost- effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination, the vaccine price appears to be too expensive and unaffordable to all developing countries. It is evident that wit hout the support from international organizations l ike the GAVI Alliance or World Health Organization (WHO), i mplementation of universal rotavirus immunization will be very difficult. In addition, post-marketing surveillance and clinical trials on the efficacy o f rotavirus vaccines should be strengthened to ensure maintenan ce of acceptable cost-effectiveness of the program. ZFive-Year View In 2006, the WHO has recommended that all countries in the world implement universal rotavirus immunization. This is the reason for the GAVI Allia nce to decide on expansion of financial support for rotavirus immunization introduction in Asia and Afr ican and is now reviewing applications from eligibl e countries. If rotavirus vaccines were used in the m ost impoverished and poorest regions in the world, they would potentially prevent roughly 225,000 deat hs per year and save 2.5 million lives in children between 2007 and 2025 [35]. It is obvious that with the GAVI's financial support, more countries in As ia and Africa will be able to implement rotavirus vacc ination in the next 5 years. At present, rotavirus vaccines are still too expensive for developing cou ntries to introduce into their national immunizatio n program. However, several vaccine manufacturers in India, China and Brazil are working to develop promising new rotavirus vaccines candidates at a lo wer production cost, making rotavirus vaccines potentially affordable and available in the market in the near future. If this happens, it will expedi te the implementation of universal rotavirus immunization in the developing world. Furthermore, more clinical trials on vaccine efficacy and high-quality cost-ef fectiveness studies on rotavirus immunization will be accomplished in developing countries in the next fi ve years to confirm the cost-effective of such programs . ZKey Issues Disease burden of rotavirus infection is highest i n Asia and Africa where vaccines preventing rotavirus are not yet widely available and still ve ry costly Rotavirus vaccination appears to be the \"best hope \" for prevention of rotavirus-related diarrhoeal disease, a major cause of mortality for children un der five years age The price of rotavirus vaccines is the main factor restraining developing countries from implementing universal rotavirus immunization Cost-effectiveness studies in the developing world reveal that universal rotavirus immunization is cost-effective but not always affordable (continue d on page 114) Author (publication year) Country Study objective Detailed analysis Type of economic analysis Discount rate Immunization approach Chotivitayatarakorn et al.

CHAPTER 6 118 ZSummary Background: This study aims to critically review available cos t-effectiveness models for rotavirus vaccination, compare their designs using a standard ized approach and compare similarities and differences in cost-effectiveness outcomes using a uniform set of input parameters. Methods: We identified various models used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination. From these, results using a standardized dataset fo r four regions in the world could be obtained for three specific applications. Results: Despite differences in the approaches and individu al constituting elements including costs, QALYs and deaths, cost-effectiveness results of the models were quite similar. Differences between the models on the individual components of cost-effecti veness could be related to some specific features o f the respective models. Sensitivity analysis reveale d that cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination is highly sensitive to vaccine prices, rotavirus-assoc iated mortality and discount rates, in particular t hat for QALYs. Conclusions: The comparative approach followed here is helpful in understanding the various models selected and will thus benefit (low-income) countri es in designing their own cost-effectiveness analys es using new or adapted existing models. Potential use rs of the models in low and middle income countries need to consider results from existing studies and reviews. There will be a need for contextualisation including the use of country specific data inputs. However, given that the underlying biological and epidemiological mechanisms do not change between co untries, users are likely to be able to adapt existing model designs rather than developing compl etely new approaches. Also, the communication established between the individual researchers invo lved in the three models is helpful in the further development of these individual models. Therefore, we recommend that this kind of comparative study be extended to other areas of vaccination and even other infectious disease interventions. Comparative review of three cost-effectiveness mode ls for rotavirus vaccines 119 ZIntroduction Various countries are currently in the process of e valuating whether or not to include rotavirus vaccination in their national immunization programs . Two rotavirus vaccines are currently eur MSD (SPMSD), respectively. Rotavirus vaccines have proven to be efficacious in preventing rotavirus-related disease , gastrointestinal disease and health-care use (GP-vi sits and hospitalizations) in infants and toddlers [1- 3]. Health-economic properties of these new vaccines pr esent one characteristic to be analysed with respect to their inclusion in National Immunization Programs (NIPs). Numerous health-economic analyses already exist regarding rotavirus vaccinat ion, mostly in high-income country settings, some being single-country analyses but a few multi-count ry analyses [4-6]. Also, one critical review of the se existing models has already been performed [7]. Rec ently, some studies have become available targeted at situations in low- and middle-income co untries, involving all regions in the world (for example, Vietnam, China, Kenya and Colombia [8-11]) . A review of these studies in Asia, Africa and South-America is in preparation [12]. Based on the favourable cost-effectiveness profile of many of th e models applied in low- and middle-income countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advises inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in the NIPs [13]. H owever, in general, it is still not always clear wh ich aspects these individual models differ on, what imp act such differences have on the cost-effectiveness outcomes and which model might be preferred over th e others in continental, regional or country- specific situations [14]. This study aims to critically review some of these available cost-effectiveness models for rotavirus vaccination, compare their designs using a standard ized approach and compare similarities and differences in cost-effectiveness outcomes using a uniform set of input parameters. WHO has initiated this study to enable providing guidance to low- and middle-income countries if requested, on the strengths and weaknesses of existing health-economi c models for rotavirus vaccination as a basis for decisions about whether or not to build their own m odels or to adapt existing models to local situatio ns. In particular, our study intends to help WHO to gui de individual countries on rotavirus modelling, specifically national decision makers who may have the interest, research capacity and resources to conduct their own cost-effectiveness analyses in ge nerating evidence for decision making on whether or not to introduce rotavirus vaccination. Therefore, our analysis might be most suited for lower middle income countries that have some capacity to attract global partners for model adaptation, whereas most low income countries may not have sufficient techni cal capacity for building or adapting existing mode ls. Notably, our goal is neither to advocate the use of specific models nor to recommend individual modelling groups over others. ZMethods Review of Models Initially, we searched for existing health-economic models in the literature using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Although the search was not limited to the English language, the relevant papers that CHAPTER 6 120 emerged from the initial search and crude selection were all in English. A further selection was made for those models to be included in the detailed compari son based on various criteria, related to our goals of achieving diversity in terms of provenance (public versus private), methods (single-cohort models, mul ti- cohort models and so on) and specific vaccines to b e incorporated by the model (that is, two individua l vaccines exist that are slightly different). Modell ing groups were selected and contacted, explicitly based on these criteria. However, availability, ease of access, complexity and time investment of the indiv idual research groups appeared to be the strongest criter ia in practice for inclusion in the final compariso n. In particular for those models with a high degree of c omplexity, the time investment required appeared to prevent the groups from becoming involved in our co mparison. Also, for these complex models resource requirements for this analysis presented a strong l imitation, which could not easily be overcome given the limited funds available by WHO for the endeavou r. Comparative Framework As described, various cost-effectiveness models wer e identified by the process described above. Their developers were contacted by a WHO officer (RH) to invite them to participate in the model comparison. Subsequently, the model inclusion was co-ordinated by 2 authors (RH & MP), while 1 author (MP) included his own group's model into the comparison. The process resulted in three models provided to us, including analyses using the standardized datas et specified below (Table 1). From all modelling groups at least one co-author was included in the a uthor list of this paper. These models represented a balanced public-private mix involving one designed by the pharmaceutical industry (Roxanne Rotarix TM Analyses of Economics from GSK), one developed by p ublic financing within a European-Union project (POLYMOD) and one privately financed (Sanofi Pasteu r MSD) but developed by the University of Groningen within the context of an unrestricted gra nt (CoRoVa Consensus Rotavirus model Vaccination). Models included could be applied to m odelling use of either vaccine (Rotarix or RotaTeq) , hence ensuring that the unique features of the two vaccines were adequately represented in our analysis. In addition, both manufacturers were dire ctly (Roxanne) or indirectly (CoRoVa) involved in t he models. Only static models were compared; this pose d both a disadvantage and an advantage. In particular, comparison with a dynamic model, which could explicitly analyze the effect of vaccination on the spread of rotavirus infection using mathematica l modelling, would be extremely valuable. However, our selection of only static models for comparison enhances comparability of the individual models and facilitates understanding the differences that stil l remain between the models' outcomes.

Additionally, during a one-day consultation in 2009 at the WHO he adquarters in Geneva, concepts and draft results were discussed with a large group of experts in epi demiology, immunology, vaccinology, political sciences and health economics. In the end, final ca lculations were performed by the modellers themselves using the most current model versions at the end of 2010 and extensively discussed during the winter of 2010/11. To summarize the way the thr ee models were included in this analysis, we note that all the software for the models was physically available to the coordinating team (MP and RH), at least 2 face-to-face meetings between member(s) of the coordinating team and each research group were organized and final calculations were checked by the coordinating team and cross-checked for face validity by all the 3 individual research grou ps. The standardized approach in comparing these models involved stepwise analysis of the structure, the input parameters required and specific assumptions underlying the models. Details on Available Models As mentioned, during the model selection process th ree models with corresponding results for the standardized input parameters became available to u s. These were the POLYMOD-model [4,15,16], Roxanne [17-20], and CoRoVa [21-23]. The POLYMOD-model was developed in the context of a n EU-funded project with the same acronym [4]. RVGE Rotavirus GastroEnteritis was modelled us ing an age-structured cohort model that followed cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (Table 1). For the first year of life, the cohort w as stratified into monthly age groups, with one-year a ge bands applied beyond (one to five years old). Th e model was initially a single-cohort model; however, it was adapted to a multi-cohort model for the purpose of this exercise to allow a step-up in vacc ination coverage. RVGE was stratified into mild disease with home treatment only, moderate disease with primary care visits (GP and/or hospital outpatient), severe disease with hospital ER-visits and/or admissions, nosocomial infections and death . QALY losses were incurred both by the index infants and their care givers. QALYs were taken from one specific study on the topic [23], which were quite comparable to those used in some other health- economic studies [5]. The model was designed by mod ellers based in England's Health Protection Agency (HPA) with input from modellers based in pub lic health institutions in Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands and applied to model rotavirus epidemiology and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in the five countries of Belgium, England & Wales, Finland, France and the Netherlands. Unlike most static rotavirus models, waning vaccine immunity wa s explicitly incorporated into the model structure. CHAPTER 6 122 Further country-specific models - based on this mul ti-cohort, multi-country model - have been published, for example, for the Netherlands [16]. Roxanne was developed as a Markov cohort process tr ee [17]. It is programmed in Microsoft Excel 2007 using Visual Basic and contains both cost-effe ctiveness and budget impact modules. The model was initially parameterized with data from France [ 18], but allows data from any country to be used [1 9]. A precursor of the model has been used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Rotarix \u00ae in the Netherlands [20]. Besides a comparison of vaccinati on versus no vaccination, the model was designed to additionally allow explicit comparison of two- a nd three-dose vaccination strategies. Obviously, outcomes in such analyses crucially depend on the e xact characteristics and properties applied to the two- and three-dose vaccination schedules. Finally, Roxanne allows extensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using the At Risk add-in for Excel. A spe cial feature of Roxanne involves the explicit inclu sion of the modelling of maternal protection from (sever e) infection through breastfeeding. CoRoVa was initially developed for the specific Dut ch situation and aimed at achieving consensus among various Dutch modelling groups that had previ ously worked on the rotavirus vaccination [16, 20]. An age-structured c ohort model was developed in Excel applying a time horizon of 5 years with time cycles of one month fo r children less than one year of age and annual thereafter [21-23]. Outcomes in the model were cla ssified by severity and included home-treated community-acquired diarrhoea and rotavirus infectio n leading to GP consultations and/or hospital admissions (including emergency department visits), nosocomial infections and death. Specific characteristics of the model are the ability to tak e waning immunity, maternal protection against infe ction through breastfeeding, and herd protection into acc ount. However, the model is not a transmission dynamic model because herd protection is incorporat ed by straightforward calculus only, using a static approximation based on a fixed fraction of the dire ct effects. In the base-case analysis for the Netherlands, QALY losses of caregivers were not inc luded and the QALY decrement for children was based on a combination of two published studies per formed in the Canada and the UK [24, 25]. Similar to the Roxanne-model CoRoVa also used the At Risk s oftware for (probabilistic) sensitivity analyses. Standardized Input Parameters For this study, analyses of the models were provide d regarding their structure and outcomes for 4 hypothetical countries, representative of different continents and income levels (low, middle or high) , respectively classified into the WHO geographical r egions and mortality strata [14]. In particular, se ts of standardized input parameters were provided to the modellers and analysed for a hypothetical Afr E country representing the African region with high c hild and very high infant mortality; a hypothetical Sear D country representing the South-east Asian region with high child and adult mortality; a hypothetical Amr D country representing the South and Middle Ame rican regions with again high child and adult mortality; and a hypothetical Eur A country represe nting developed countries in the European setting. Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 summarize the set of standardi zed input parameters. Rectangular age distributions were assumed, implying that life expectancy decreas es with one year exactly for every one-year increase in the age of infants and toddlers conside red. (For example, if life expectancy is 70 at birt h, it Comparative review of three cost-effectiveness mode ls for rotavirus vaccines 123 would be 69 at the age of 1, 68 at the age of 2 and so on). Simplifying assumptions were justified as our interest concerned the comparison between models ra ther than the exact representation of country- specific demographic, epidemiological and economic impacts. Although the time horizon in the single- and multi- cohort models was lifetime, this effectively produc ed a time horizon of 5 years after the birth of the last cohort, since it is assumed that no rotavirus gastroenteritis occurs beyond the age of 5 years an d vaccination is only investigated in infants in th eir first year of life. Various sources were utilised f or parameter estimates as indicated in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 [1-5, 7, 14, 15, 20, 26-31]. However as the objec tive was comparative rather than to exactly mimic t he situations of specific countries often plausible as sumptions were made rather than exact replications of individual sources. Plausibility of assumptions was primarily based on the expert opinions of two of t he authors (MP and MJ) Afr Sear Ams Eur Notes Total # of life births 1,496,200 3,427,800 140,110 190,000 Life expectancy at birth in years 54 66 73 80 average men & women Population 34,255,722 141,822,276 5,486,685 16,500,000 % of population % urban 42% 23% 62% 100% Infant mortality (< 1 year of age) 64 45 21 4 per 1000 life births Mortality < 5 years 104 57 26 0.5 per 1000 life births /yr Population < 5 years 5,736,373 17,399,197 730,913 1,000,000 Incidence birth 1.4% 1.4% 1.4% 1.4% in % per month 2nd year after birth 0.57% 0.57% 0.57% 0.57% in % per month 3rd & 4 th after birth 0.49% 0.49% 0.49% 0.49% in % per month Incidence of moderate 38.7% 38.7% 38.7% 33.1% in % from mild Incidence of severe 7.9% 7.9% 7.9% 12.1% in % from moderate Incidence of death 18.8% 12.5% 6.3% 0.05% in % infections 33.3% 33.3% 33.3% 25% % from severe (on top) Table 2 Standardized dataset for the cost-effectiveness mo dels in rotavirus vaccination: demography and incidence (Sources: [4,5,7,14,15,20,26,27]) CHAPTER 6 124 Afr Sear Ams Eur Notes Efficacy, assuming a 2-dose schedule at 2 & 3 month s (1 dose only between brackets) Mild of efficacy (annual) Mild & moderate 0.63 0.63 0.63 0.63 multiply each next Severe 0.83 0.83 0.83 0.83 multiply each next Coverage Dose 1 50% 50% 50% 50% Dose 2 40% 40% 40% 40% 20 years after introduction 80% 80% 80% 96% for both doses Coverage improvement linear linear linear linear Per-dose vaccine costs (2 doses) 2009-2014 7.5 7.5 7.5 45 2015 & beyond 4 4 4 45 Table 3 : Standardized dataset for the cost-effectiveness mod els in rotavirus vaccination: vaccine characteristics (Sources: [1-5,7,15,20,28], expert opinions) Afr Sear Ams Eur Notes Average length of hospital stay 4 4 4 4 days Cost per hospital day US$35 US$34 US$122 \u20ac550 Days of work missed for parents Mild 1 1 1 1 Moderate 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Comparative review of three cost-effectiveness mode ls for rotavirus vaccines 125 Severe 2 2 2 2 Also for nosocomial Discount rates 3% 3% \u20ac5 (Note: all mild cases were treated at home, all mo derate additionally in an outpatient setting, such as outpatient hospital, GP or health centre and all severe cases additionally in hospita l; all cases have out-of-pocket costs), plausible a ssumptions based on literature [29-31] and expert opinions (MP GP: general practitioner; comm.-acq: community acqu ired; OTC: over the counter Table 4 Standardized dataset for the cost-effectiveness mo dels in rotavirus vaccination: health-care use and costs Afr Sear Ams Eur Notes Disutility Mild 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 during 4 days Moderate 0.25 0.25 0.25 during 4 days Severe 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 during 4 days Nosocomial 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 during 4 days Death 1 1 1 1 per year Age weighting (primarily considered for DALYs) off off off off Perspective Societal& healthcare Societal& healthcare Societal& healthcare Societal& healthcare Herd effect off off off off DALY: disability adjusted life year Table 5 : Utilities and some remaining issues [4,5,7,20,27] Key parameters for all analyses were the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE), the corresponding risks of rotavirus-related health-car e use, as well as corresponding costs. All cases wi th RVGE were assumed to be treated at home. In particu lar, moderate cases were assumed to involve one additional outpatient visit (GP, health centre or hospital) and severe cases were assumed to involve: home treatment, an outpatient visit and a hospitalization. Some models had the additional option of severe cases not being hospitalized. Base d on data from the clinical trials, vaccine efficac y could be specified for different outcomes and for h igh-income versus other countries. Alternatively to what is expressed in Table 1, inci dence could be expressed as average annual risks over the same 5 years considered in the data and mo delling. In particular, the average annual risks at population level are 10,440, 4040 and 320 per 100,0 00 people in all developing regions for mild, moderate and severe, respectively. Correspondingly, figures for the Eur region are 10,440; 3460; and 419 per 100,000 people. Similarly, annual mortality risks are 60, 40, 20 and 0.21 per 100,000 populati on for the Afr, Sear, Amr and Eur regions, respectivel y. CHAPTER 6 126 Standardized Output Model developers were requested to present a standa rdized set of output variables for one single cohor t (for the multi-cohort model, the coordinating centr e estimated the results for one cohort themselves). In particular, these were: total number of persons and (person-years if available) followed in the model; undiscounted number of mild cases of moderate cases cases of RVGE; undisc ounted number of outpatient visits (GP, outpatient or health centre; typically this would e qual the number of moderate and severe cases); undiscounted number of hospitalizations (typically equal to the number of severe cases); undiscounted number of nosocomial cases (equal to 1/4 or 1/3 of the number of hospitalizations, in the Eur and othe r regions, respectively); undiscounted number of costs; discounted vaccination cost s; discounted and undiscounted QALYs due to deaths (difference between vaccination and no vaccination is equal to the number of life-years gained); discounted and from the societal perspective; a sensitiv ity analysis was requested by varying parameters values through halving and doubling their base case values, except the discount rate which was investigated for alternative values of 0% and 4%. In particular, cost-effectiveness was expressed in net costs per QALY gained by subtracting discounted savings from the reduced need for RVGE treatments f rom (discounted in the multi-cohort model) vaccination costs to provide the numerator and divi ding by the QALYs gained (the denominator). ZResults Results of using the standardized dataset for the v arious regions in different models are shown in Tables 6 through 10 for all three models. In genera l, cost-effectiveness results are broadly similar a nd comparable.

The results for the CoRoVa-model were generally in between those for th e other two. The Roxanne model generally predicts overall higher number of cases, most notab ly for hospitalized cases. This translates into relatively high inpatient savings that are however lowered by discounting and overall dominated by vaccination costs to render similar net discounted costs for all three models investigated. However, t he POLYMOD model gave consistently lower results for t hese discounted net costs; this might be due to the approximation from results for the multiple coh orts to just one. Also, higher vaccination costs in later years in the multi-cohort model were offset by a hi gher number of cases averted in the single-cohort model, resulting in the comparable cost-effectivene ss ratios between the two types of models. Results suggest that rotavirus vaccination could potentiall y be cost-effective in all regions, particularly in low and middle income countries. However, the standardized data set is highly generalised and not specific to any individual country, so conclusions to support p olicy making should not be drawn in the absence of country-specific analyses. CHAPTER 6 130 Figure 1 shows the sensitivity analysis performed o n the model results, with the example of CoRoVa shown here (other models showed similar patterns). From previous work on cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination [5, 7, 15, 19], it is well-kn own that generally these results are highly sensiti ve to the vaccine price, rotavirus-associated mortality and t he discount rate. Our analysis shows the similar pattern for all regions investigated. However, ther e is an interesting shift observed in variables influencing the cost-effectiveness results between EU and non-EU countries. In the EU region the incidence of the disease is a driver followed by ut ility weights whereas in the non-EU region mortalit y is essentially driving the result. ZDiscussion We identified various models used to estimate the c ost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination. From these, results using the standardized dataset could be obtained for three specific applications (the POLYMOD, Roxanne and CoRoVa models). Despite differ ences in the approaches, cost-effectiveness results of the models were quite similar. Differenc es between the outcomes of the specific building blocks of the cost-effectiveness (i.e., vaccination costs, savings and QALYs gained) of the models currently investigated seem to relate to five aspe cts of the models: the multi-cohort nature of the POLYMOD model which assumed a step up in vaccinatio n coverage (and hence in vaccination costs as well as cases prevented); the exact timing of the w aning in the models and in particular the exact modulation of between-dose efficacies in the CoRoVa model; assumptions about the distribution of cases of different severity levels within the one-y ear age groups provided (for example, assuming a Weibull distribution in the Roxanne model); and the possibility in the models of experiencing subseque nt episodes of rotavirus infections and/or experiencin g episodes with multiple manifestations (for exampl e, first moderate progressing to severe) and types of health-care use (for example, inpatient and outpatient, rather than just one of both). Ergo, differences between the models on the individ ual components of cost-effectiveness could be related to some specific generic features of the mo dels with regards to representing vaccine uptake an d pricing, within age-group distributions, waning and between-dose efficacies and inclusion of additiona l groups and episodes in the general design of these models. Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost- effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination is highly se nsitive to vaccine prices, rotavirus-associated mor tality and discount rates, in particular that for effects. This is fully in line with other authors' findings [32]. Unfortunately, we were not able to include a model with a transmission dynamic approach in our model comparison, instead of the cohort approach followed in the three models analyzed. Emerging evidence that herd immunity effects might be relevant for ro tavirus transmission and vaccination enhances the relevance of considering populations and transmissi ons between cohorts [33-35]. Inability to include these models was often related to the complexity of these models and the difficulties to adequately grasp these complexities in the standardized framew ork provided on inputs and outputs. However, for further work it is important to also analyse such d ynamic models given their major advantage of incorporating infection dynamics including herd imm unity effects and potential age shifts in epidemiology [36]. Also, differences in uptake betw een high-, middle- and low-income countries should be analyzed using dynamic models given the differen t impacts of coverage levels on herd immunity. Figure 1. Sensitivity analyses on the base case cost effecti veness ratio using the CoRoVa model for Afr (a), Se ar (b), Amr (c), and Eur (d) regions. Parameters we re varied through halving and doubling, except for the discou nt rates which were 0% and 4% for both costs and he alth effects. Dark bars show the incremental cost e ffectiveness ratio after a 100% decrease in the parameter, whereas lig ht bars show the incremental cost effectiveness rat io after a 100% increase (note that an increase in the incidence or the costs resulted in Graphs D for negative cost effect iveness ratios). Note that when the incidence of RV GE was increased or decreased, the total number of deaths was kept constant to identify the sole effect of incidence. QALY: quality adjusted life year, RVGE: rotavirus g astro enteritis. CHAPTER 6 132 The three models selected for our analysis were all basically developed for high-income countries. For reasons stated previously, other models - inclusive of models developed initially for low- and middle- income settings - could unfortunately not be consid ered in our comparison. As one consequence, all the publications arising from these models involved costs per QALY gained rather than costs per DALY averted. Although not undisputed, for low- and midd le income settings DALYs rather than QALYs are the common metric used [27,37]. We do note that one specific study showed that results only slightly differ if DALYs are used instead of QALYs; in parti cular, it showed slightly more favourable cost- effectiveness for DALYs as the outcome [16]. Howeve r, it has been demonstrated that the decision about whether or not to include caregiver QALYs has a major impact on results [4,7]. The appropriateness of including QALYs beyond the index case of disease is being debated; it could be argued that caregivers' QALYs are particularly impo rtant for rotavirus as they can be measured directl y, and hence may be more valid than QALYs in small chi ldren with RVGE, where proxy measurements have to be used [7,21,22]. Our findings for the regions Afr, Sear, Amr and Eur should not be considered as exact representative results and policy making should not directly be ba sed on this. For example, it is very unlikely that the similarities assumed for the proportion of RVGE cas es that are mild, moderate and severe are valid in real world. This simplifying assumption was made in order to test the models generically and consistently. Nevertheless, our results clearly ind icate a general trend of increasingly more favourab le cost-effectiveness when going from high- to middle and on to low-income countries, respectively. As th e sensitivity analysis shows, this is obviously prima rily related to vaccine pricing and the QALY-impact of averted mortality due to rotavirus infection. Howev er for actual policy making, countries will need to either further consider the results from existing s tudies and reviews, or initiate country-specific co st- effectiveness analyses. For countries that have the capacity and resources to model the cost- effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine, our comparative analysis can help inform the design of new models or selecting existing models to support national-le vel decision making. Hence, although our analysis is not meant to direct ly inform policy making, it offers considerable guidance for design and/or selection of a model for adaptation to individual (low-income) countries wh o want to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses. Scarce resources in these countries may direct the choice towards adapting an existing model rather than init iating the development of a new approach. Reassuringly, our analysis suggests that different models produce similar cost-effectiveness estimates , illustrating that the exact choice of which model t o adapt may not be as crucial as the choice of assumptions and parameter values to incorporate in the model. ZConclusions We conclude that our approach is helpful on two spe cific levels. Firstly, the comparative approach followed here is helpful in understanding the vario us models selected and will thus benefit (low-incom e) countries in designing their own cost-effectiveness analyses using new or adapted existing models. Secondly, we find that the communication between th e individual researchers involved in the three models was helpful in the further development of th ese individual models and will be so in the future. Comparative review of three cost-effectiveness mode ls for rotavirus vaccines 133 Therefore, we recommend that this kind of comparati ve study be extended to other areas of vaccination and even other infectious disease interventions, be yond the three areas that have been explored by WHO (pneumococcal vaccination, human papilloma viru s vaccines and (here) rotavirus) [38-40]. Finally, the models reviewed in the exercise gave s imilar and comparable results which appear to have face validity. Hence it appears possible to recomme nd their use in policy settings, at least for high income countries. However, potential users of the m odels need to consider the specific building blocks of the cost-effectiveness models including the natu re, scope, design and assumptions made and how they affect outcomes. Potential users of the models in low and middle income countries need to consider results from existing studies and reviews. There will be a need for contextualisation includi ng the use of country specific data inputs. However, g iven that the underlying biological and epidemiological mechanisms do not change between co untries, users are likely to be able to adapt existing model designs rather than developing compl etely new approaches. Also, transmission dynamic effects are likely to be important, particularly wh en considering the effect of vaccination (since vaccination can affect other cohorts besides those vaccinated). Hence, we would recommend that future cost-effectiveness tool comparison exercises include dynamic models.

Postma Accepted by Vaccine CHAPTER 7 138 ZSummary Introduction: Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrh oea worldwide. Vietnam is situated in the region of high rotavirus infection incidence and eligible for financial support to introduce ro tavirus vaccines into the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) from the GAVI. This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus immuniza tion in Vietnam, explicitly the use of Rotateq \u00ae and to assess the affordability of implementing universal rotavirus immunization based on GAVI-subsidized vaccine price in the context of Vietnamese healthca re system for the next 5 years. Methodology: An age-structured cohort model was developed for t he 2009 birth cohort in Vietnam. Two strategies were compared: one being the current situation without vaccination, and the other being mass universal rotavirus vaccination. The time hori zon of the model was 5 years with time cycles of 1 month for children less than 1 year of age and annu al analysis thereafter. Outcomes included mild, moderate, severe cases and death. Multiple outcomes per rotavirus infection are possible in the model. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the ac ceptability and affordability of the rotavirus vaccination. All costs were expressed in 2009 US$. Results: Rotavirus vaccination would not completely protect young children against rotavirus infection due to partial nature of vaccine immunity, however, would effectively reduce severe cases of rotavirus by roughly 55% during the first 5 years of life. Un der GAVI-subsidized vaccine price (US$ 0.3/dose), t he vaccine cost would amount to US$ 5.5 million per an num for 3-dose of the Rotateq\u00ae vaccine. In the base-case, the incremental cost per quality-adjuste d-life-year (QALY) was US$ 665 from the health system perspective, much lower than per-capita GDP of ~ US$ 1,152 in 2009. Affordability results showed that at the GAVI-subsidized vaccine price, r otavirus vaccination could be affordable for Vietnamese health system. Conclusion: Rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam would be a cost-ef fective health intervention. Vaccination only becomes affordable if the country receive GAVI 's financial support due to the current high market vaccine price. Given the high mortality rate of und er-five-year children, the results showed that rota virus immunization is the \"best hope\" for prevention of r otavirus-related diarrhoeal disease in Vietnam. In the next five years, Vietnam is definitely in debt to f inancial support from international organizations i n implementing rotavirus immunization. It is recommen ded that new rotavirus vaccine candidates be developed at cheaper price to speed up the introduc tion of rotavirus immunization in the developing world in general. Health economics of rotavirus immunization in Vietn am 139 ZIntroduction Diarrhoea is a leading cause of child mortality. Gl obally, around 1.8 million children under the age o f five die from diarrhoeal-related diseases per year and r otavirus has been identified as the most common cause of severe diarrhea [1,2]. Rotavirus infection has been reported to be responsible for more than 2 million hospitalizations worldwide and roughly 527, 000 deaths annually [3]. A large share of the mortality and morbidity occurs in developing countr ies, such as Vietnam [4]. Vietnam was one of the two countries in Asia, besid es Bangladesh, where the efficacy of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq \u00ae, was assessed in 2009 under a joint partnership be tween the PATH Rotavirus Vaccine Program and Merck [4]. A maj or outcome of this clinical trial was the establishment of vaccine efficacy against severe di sease at 48.3% (95% CI 22.3%-66.1%) in Asia (95% CI 7.6%-90.9%) in Vietnam. This supporte d the WHO's expanded immunization recommendations to promote the global use of rotavi rus vaccines. Notably, Vietnam established sentinel hospital surveillance to assess the burden of rotavirus already back in 1998 [5]. This surveillance network later served as a model for 8 other countries in the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network [5,6]. Up to now, only two cost-effectiveness studies on r otavirus immunization have been conducted in Vietnam [7,8], confirming that implementing rotavir us vaccination in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) would be a cost-effective health -care intervention. However, these studies only evaluated the use of the monovalent Rotarix TM vaccine while ignoring the possible use of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in the EPI. Additiona lly, these previous studies did not account for between-dose vaccine efficacies and used vaccine ef ficacy data, which was done in other countries rather than Vietnam. Considering the limitations of both studies, we per formed a cost-effectiveness analysis on rotavirus immunization in Vietnam focusing explicitly on the use of RotaTeq \u00ae as one of the recommended vaccines to be introduced into countries' EPI. A ma jor advantage of this approach is that it allows us to utilize the most updated and recently released resu lts on RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine efficacy, which was conducted in Vietnam [4]. We applied a cost-effecti veness model developed by University of Groningen, but different from previous studies using this mode l [9,10], we additionally assessed the affordabilit y of implementing universal rotavirus immunization based on the GAVI-subsidized price and market price in the context of the Vietnamese healthcare system for the next 5 years [11]. Finally, as a novel data source we included publications and reports written in the Vietnamese language, thus incorporating literature that is not internationally accessible a nd was not previously applied in the models. ZMethods Model We applied the CoRoVa model (the Concensus Model on Rotavirus Vaccination) developed by University of Groningen for our analysis [10], see Figure 1. This model has been used previously to calculate the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vacci nation for both developing and developed countries [9,10]. We selected CoRoVa instead of other models for the Vietnamese context because of its ability t o CHAPTER 7 140 capture more than 1 infection per child and to acco unt for waning immunity, maternal protection agains t infection through breast feeding, and herd immunity [9]. In detail, we populated the Vietnamese 2009 birth cohort of 1,485,000 [12] in this age-structur ed cohort model and applied a 5-year time horizon w ith time cycle of 1 month for children less than 1 year of age and annually thereafter. Health outcomes fr om this model were classified by the four levels of se verity of rotavirus-related diarrhoea: mild, modera te, severe and death. In particular, severe cases refer to rotavirus-related cases that require hospitaliz ation. Mild and moderate cases are assumed to require home -treatment and outpatient visits to a health clinic , respectively. This classification is in accordance with an earlier published study [2]. The model is programmed in Microsoft Excel 2010. For probabilist ic sensitivity analysis, the CoRoVa model uses the @RISK 4.5.4; Pallisade 2011, Newfield, NY. Figure 1 Decision analytic model for estimating the cost-eff ectiveness of universal rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam Epidemiology We obtained data on the cumulative age distribution of severe cases due to rotavirus gastroenteritis i n Vietnam from the afore-mentioned sentinel surveilla nce study on disease burden of rotavirus carried ou t in the country [5,6]. Since similar data were not a vailable for rotavirus cases rated as mild, moderat e or rotavirus-related mortality, we assumed the same cu mulative age distribution as for severe cases for t he exact computation of the estimated number of mild, moderate, and deaths by age groups. Computation of rotavirus-related deaths The total number of rotavirus-associated deaths amo ng children aged < 5 years in 2009 was estimated by applying the WHO's specific data on rotavirus-re lated mortality among <5-year children to the birth cohort in Vietnam [13], see Figure 2. The number of age-specific deaths was computed by applying the age distribution to the total rotavirus-associated deaths. Age-specific rotavirus-associated mortality was then calculated by dividing the age-specific deaths by the number of children in each different age group, see Table 1. Health economics of rotavirus immunization in Vietn am 141 Calculation of severe cases The age-specific number of rotavirus-associated sev ere cases was estimated by combining the number of deaths and the ratio between rotavirus-related d eaths and hospitalizations of 1:31, according to th e two previous Vietnamese studies [8,14],see Figure 2 . The age-specific rate of severe cases was calculated by dividing the age-specific severe case s by the number of children in each age group, see Table 1. Calculation of moderate cases Numbers of moderate cases among under-5-year Vietna mese children were estimated by applying the ratio between rotavirus-related deaths and visits o f 1:97 according to earlier studies [7,8], see Figu re 2. The age-specific rate of moderate cases was calcula ted by dividing the age-specific moderate cases by the number of children in each age group, see Table 1. Calculation of mild cases No data were available on the number of Vietnamese cases among children under five-years with mild diarrhoea. Therefore, we estimated rotavirus-relate d mild episodes using data from an earlier study [2 ] together with information obtained from the Ministr y of Health in Vietnam and expert opinions of local paediatricians [15]. The rate of age-specific mild cases was calculated similarly as for moderate case s, see Table 1. Figure 2 Scheme for estimation of rotavirus epidemiology in Vietnam CHAPTER 7 142 Age in years Age in months Mild Moderate Severe Mortality rate - 0 0.08830 0.00996 0.00217 rate Vaccine efficacy, waning immunity and between-dose efficacy Clinical trials on RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine efficacy carried out in Vietnam showed tha t vaccine efficacy against rotavirus-related severe cases was estimated to be 63.9% (95% CI 7.6-90.9) in Vietnam after two-year post vaccination [4]. The analysis showed that vacc ine efficacy against severe cases was (72.3% (95% CI -45.2-97.2) during the first full season after v accination and 64.6% (95% CI 47.7-93.9%) during the second full season [4]. Based on the difference in efficacy between first and second rotavirus seasons post-vaccination, we conservatively assumed that va ccine efficacy would exponentially decrease by 11% per year starting after the first year (waning) . No specific clinical data on RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine efficacy against mild or moderate rotaviru s-related cases are available for the population living in Asian de veloping countries. For moderate cases, we used th e RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine efficacy ratio between clinical visits and hospitalizations as published by Ruiz- Palacious et al (86% and 95.8%, respectively) [16]. Using this ratio and vaccine efficacy against seve re cases (63.9%) in Vietnam, we subsequently calculate d vaccine efficacy against moderate cases Vietnam (57.4%) as: (0.86/0.958)*0.639*100%. Vaccin e efficacy against mild cases (52%) was taken from the literature [17-23], see Table 2. We conser vatively assumed that vaccine efficacy against mild Health economics of rotavirus immunization in Vietn am 143 and moderate cases would decrease at the same rate as for severe cases from the first to the second season. To estimate between dose efficacy for a 3-dose Rota Teq \u00ae vaccine, we utilized data from a recent study on this subject, where the rates of combined hospit alizations and emergency visits (ED) between doses 1 and 2, and between doses 2 and 3 were reported at Based on this information, we estimated vaccine efficacy against severe disease between doses 1 and 2 at 52.4% (0.82*63.9%) and between doses 2 and 3 at 53.7% (0.84*63.9%). Again, we conservatively applied the same rate for estimating between-dose efficacies fo r mild and moderate cases. For vaccine coverage, we assumed that RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine would be administered at the same time wit h Diptheria-Polio-Tetanus (DPT) vaccine in Vietnam (a t 2,4 and 6 months). Therefore, the DPT vaccine coverage of 93% would also be applicable for the Ro taTeq \u00ae vaccine [25], see Table 2. QALY losses As there are no data available on quality-of-life l osses in Vietnam due to rotavirus infection, we app lied the QALY losses in affected infants and children pr ovided by a number of comparable studies [17,19,20,26] (Table 2). A under-5-years-old child normally requires at least one care giver (e.g., on e parent) to take care when she/he is infected with r otavirus. In severe cases, even two care-givers (e. g., two parents) would be needed to take care for the s ick child. In the base-case analysis, we did not include the QALY loss of caregivers. In sensitivity analysis, the QALY losses by caregivers were taken from earlier work [10]. Sensitivity and scenario analyses We performed several sensitivity analyses in the st udy including univariate, multivariate, scenario- analytic, probabilistic approaches and affordabilit y analysis. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to e xplore impacts of different model input parameters on cost and health outcomes of rotavirus vaccinatio n. We selected several parameters for examination by varying the value of one parameter by 25% while other parameters remained constant at their base- case value. Several scenario analyses were analysed, including (i) base-case analysis where no QALY losses of care-giver is considered, (ii) inclusion of QALY lo sses of one care-giver and (iii) inclusion of QALY losses of two care-givers were performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were perfo rmed by running 5000 Monte Carlo simulations using @RISK 4.5.4; Pallisade 2011, Newfield, NY. Distribu tions associated with input parameters are shown in Table 2 [27]. The PSA results are subsequently p resented in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) from a societal perspective for all scenari os. We then evaluated affordability (only shown for the base-case analysis) based on the joint distribu tion of simulated incremental costs and health gain s of rotavirus vaccination. The advantage of affordab ility curves is their ability to explain the impact s of CHAPTER 7 144 financial resources on vaccination. The curve visua lizes affordable probabilities for a vaccination program given various budgetary levels while also t aking into account the uncertainty of all parameter s. Affordability analyses were performed under the ass umption that childhood vaccination programs were indivisible, which implies that it could not be per formed for a fraction of infants. This is realistic as in practice all vaccines implemented in the EPI in Vie tnam are given to every child [28]. Costs Direct treatment costs, and indirect costs incurred due to rotavirus-associated mild, moderate and severe cases were retrieved from a cost study previ ously conducted in Vietnam [7]. The analyses were carried out from both the healthcare (including onl y direct medical costs) and the societal (both dire ct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirec t costs) perspectives. These cost items were collected in 2005, and we converted them to 2009 US $ (as reported in Table 2) to reflect current price levels, using the underlying growth rate in consume r prices. Outcome measures We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ra tio (ICER) per QALY for the base-case and various scenarios and sensitivity analyses consistently com paring vaccination vs. no vaccination. Additionally , we examined the impacts of GAVI-subsidized and mark et RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine prices on ICER values. We used the WHO's definition on cost-effectiveness of health interventions to evaluate results of rotavir us vaccination in Vietnam [29].

Assuming 93% coverage, vaccination of a birth cohort of 1,485,000 would re duce rotavirus-related mild, moderate, severe cases and deaths by 44%, 49%, 54% and 54%, respectively. This reduction corresponds to a gain of 25,825 discounted QALYs and a saving of US$ 6.4 million in burden cost-of-illness due to rotavirus infection. At the per-dose-GAVI-subsidized price of US$ 0.3 fo r the RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine, rotavirus immunization would become a cost-saving strategy. Vaccination wo uld always be cost-saving when the RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine price <= US$ 0.9/dose and <=US$ 1.6/dose fr om the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In contrast, at the per-dose market p rice of US$ 5, vaccination is not cost saving and results in an ICER per QALY of US$ 665 and US$ 556 from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. These cost-effectivenes s values are still less than the 2009 Vietnamese GDP-per-capita of US$ 1,159 [12], suggesting that r otavirus immunization is a cost-effective health intervention for the Vietnamese healthcare system a ccording to WHO's definition for cost-effectiveness , see Table 3. Univariate sensitivity & scenario analyses The impacts of parameter changes on the results are presented in a Tornado diagram (Figure 3). Cost- effectiveness results of rotavirus vaccination were most sensitive to vaccine efficacy against severe CHAPTER 7 146 cases, rotavirus-related mortality. In contrast, to tal hospitalization cost and outpatient visit cost have minimal impact on the cost-effectiveness outcomes. Figure 4 shows that up to US$ 3.5 per dose, there were very small changes in the ICER value per QALY from the societal perspective.

The CEACs showed that at the threshold ICER per QALY of US$ 556 (the base-case value of ICER per QALY from the societal perspective), the probabilit y for the vaccination program to be cost-effective would be 67.7%, 70.2% and 73.7% for scenarios with no care giver, one care giver and two care givers, respectively. If a US$ 1,000 threshold per QALY was applied (<1x per-capita-GDP), still >90% of simulations resulted in acceptable ICERs for all sc enarios. If a threshold of US$ 3,000 per QALY was applied (<3x per-capita-GDP), >98% of simulations r esulted in acceptable ICERs for all scenarios. Although the CEACs help to summarize the uncertaint y surrounded the cost-effectiveness possibility of a rotavirus vaccination program, the curve is unabl e to inform the decision-makers regarding resources to fund vaccination programs, which remains a cruci al factor for the Vietnamese healthcare sector and other developing countries. CHAPTER 7 148 Figure 5 Cost-effectiveness (C-E) acceptability curve showin g the probability that universal newborn rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam is cost-effective at different cost-effective threshold values (socie tal perspective) Affordability curve Figure 6 presents affordable scenarios where rotavi rus vaccine is subsidized by the GAVI and when it i s purchased at the market price of US$ 5 per dose. Th e results show that under GAVI-subsidy, rotavirus vaccination would always be fully implementable whe n the budget exceeds US$ 5.5 million. In contrast, vaccination would not be affordable with a budget US$ 1.5 million. Under the market scenario, vaccination would only be implementable at the mini mum budget of US$ 10 million, which is almost 2 times higher than the needed budget for full vaccin ation under the GAVI-subsidy scenario. Rotavirus vaccination would always be implementable when the budget exceeds US$ 22 million. Figure 6 Affordability curves showing the probability that r otavirus vaccination is affordable (for birth cohort of 1,485,000) as a function of budget constr aint (societal perspective and no care giver QALY- losses assumed) Health economics of rotavirus immunization in Vietn am 149 ZDiscussion Our economic analysis indicates that inclusion of r otavirus vaccination in the EPI in Vietnam would be cost-effective or even cost-saving depending on the cost of the vaccine. At the base-case GAVI- subsidized price of US$ 0.3 per dose, rotavirus vac cination would be cost-saving from both analyzed perspectives (health care and societal). Rotavirus vaccination would reduce the number of rotavirus- related cases and deaths by approximately 50%. From the societal perspective, at the current marke t price of US$ 5 per dose, rotavirus vaccination would be a cost-effective intervention according to the WHO's criteria for cost-effectiveness [29]. However, being cost-effective does not automaticall y mean that the intervention would be affordable fo r the Vietnamese healthcare. Indeed, when parameter u ncertainties are taken into account, affordability analyses revealed that there was a big difference i n required funds for rotavirus vaccination in Vietn am under the GAVI-subsidized and market situations. In particular, at the market vaccine price of US$ 5 p er dose, a fully implemented vaccination program would cost US$ 22 million, while it would only cost US$ 5.5 million under the GAVI-subsidized price of US$ 0.3 per dose. Practically speaking, in 2009, total government spending in Vietnam on EPI activities wa s approximately US$ 8 million [30]. Compared to the total government health budget, the required in vestment by the government for universal rotavirus vaccination in case of no GAVI support would be mor e than triple. This implies that if the Vietnamese government has to fully finance vaccination by itse lf, implementation would be highly unrealistic. A possible solution would be to reduce rotavirus vacc ine price either through the development of new generations of less expensive rotavirus vaccines or through subsidy by international organizations for developing countries like Vietnam. Next to possibil ities of GAVI-subsidized programs, in fact, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health is testing a vaccine against rotavirus, which is domestically manufactured. Clinical trials are being carried out in Vietnam [31-36]. Our study confirms that rotavirus vaccination using the Rotateq \u00ae brand is cost-effective in Vietnam from both societal and health system perspectives. This is congruent with other studies in high-endemic and intermediate-endemic countries [8,37-41]. Our study also emphasizes the important role of donors such as the GAVI in financing vaccination programs. Inde ed, Vietnam is still a developing country and relie s heavily on external financial support. To assist a high-endemic country in implementing vaccination programs, financial support is indispensable. Our r esults may be useful to help Vietnamese government to apply for further financial support from the GAV I. Compared to other studies conducted in Vietnam on t he same subject [7,8], our results are similar by concluding that rotavirus vaccination is a cost-eff ective public health intervention. The results supp ort the WHO's recommendations on universal rotavirus im munization worldwide. However, our study also differs from previous studies in Vietnam. Firstly, we used RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine instead of Rotarix vaccine in the analysis. The advantage of this was the util ization of the most updated local RotaTeq \u00ae vaccine efficacy data on severe cases, which was just compl eted in Vietnam. Using these data instead of the general efficacy data from other regions of the wor ld probably gives more reliable estimates. Another difference was the application of an age-structured cohort model. The advantage of this model is its CHAPTER 7 150 ability to capture multiple infections per infected child, waning immunity as well as the impacts of b reast feeding though the latter was not yet considered in our current analysis due to data availability. Additionally, the application of this model was sup portive of another study initiated by the WHO, whic h offers guidance for design and/or selection of a mo del for adaptation to individual (low-income) countries who want to conduct cost-effectiveness an alyses [9]. Finally, our study explored the impact of caregivers by considering scenarios where QALY loss es of caregivers were included. This was not done in any earlier studies on the same subjects in Vietnam. The importance of including QALY losses of caregivers into our study was because a sick chi ld normally is cared by a caregiver (e.g., parents, or family members). Other studies tend to ignore the i mpacts of caregivers. Carrying such type of analysi s, we explored the important role of care-givers. Our study, however, does encounter some limitations . The first limitation is the application of a stat ic, step-wise model of the disease instead of applying a dynamic continuous model. In particular, the latt er type of models allows the inclusion of herd immunit y effects in the analysis. In the lack of data and information, herd immunity was not considered in th e study. However, had herd immunity been included in the analysis, impacts of rotavirus vaccination w ould have been greater and favorable cost- effectiveness or even cost-saving would only have b een further strengthened. The second limitation is the lack of data on vaccine efficacy for mild and m oderate cases. We used data from various studies conducted in developed countries, thus the vaccine efficacy might be overestimated for a developing country. However, if the vaccine efficacy would be lower, rotavirus vaccination would prove to be even more cost effective. The third limitation is the la ck of rotavirus epidemiology data in Vietnam. There was much estimation in different stages of rotavirus in the study. However, even at this high epidemiology , rotavirus vaccination was proved to be cost-effecti ve. The fourth limitation is the utilization of tre atment costs. The treatment cost of rotavirus-related diar rhoea was collected in 2005 and the cost must have changed in 2009. To overcome this, we have adjusted the cost by using the CPI to make it more updated. Indeed, rotavirus vaccination would be mor e cost-effective when the treatment cost of the disease was higher. Our study shows that vaccine price was a crucial fa ctor on the cost-effectiveness results and a heavy burden for any developing country's government in i ntroducing a new vaccine. The current available market price (US$ 5 per dose) appears to be very ex pensive for the Vietnamese government suggesting that new generations of less costly rota virus vaccines be developed or financial supports from the GAVI a decisive factor for the Vietnamese health system at least in the next 5 years. The results of our cost-effectiveness analysis on t he use of RotaTeq \u00ae vaccination in Vietnam should encourage health policy makers as well internationa l donors, who are committed in supporting developing countries in combating infectious diseas es in children as well as of supportive of the WHO' s recommendation on universal rotavirus vaccination.

Two infectious diseases, hepatitis B and rotavirus wer e selected as examples. The former represents the cur rent immunization strategy within the EPI and the latter represents the recommended vaccination strat egy for the future. Adding new vaccines to routine infant immunization schedules is a financial challe nge for Vietnam, requiring institutional and policy changes at the national level. In the context of th e scarcity of resources, there is a need for priori tization of vaccines, planning to secure their sustainable s upply, information on their affordability, assessme nt of their cost-effectiveness, and support from internat ional organizations in providing funding for vaccin ation programs. The research presented in this thesis explores the contribution of economic evaluations and provides tools to address some of the afore-mentioned issues . Analyses of this sort are still limited for devel oping countries and therefore considered valuable for the progress in the field. Hence, findings of this research may be useful for developing countries in formulating appropriate public health policies, mobilizing financial resources for vaccination prog rams and making plans for vaccines sustainability. The detailed findings are summarized and discussed below. Cost-effectiveness analyses In this thesis, the overall emphasis is on the diff erent modeling techniques, which can be used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of (preventive) int erventions against infectious diseases. In particul ar, the cost-effectiveness analyses against hepatitis B and rotavirus consist of both epidemiological and economic aspects and modeling of incidence numbers and costs are discussed in detail in Chapters 4 and 7, respectively. In Chapter 4, a Markov model f or chronic hepatitis B infection was designed and i n Chapter 7, an existing age-structured cohort model was adopted for the Vietnamese birth cohort. Though the applied models were static and did not y et account for the benefit of herd immunity of vaccination, such analyses are very useful in devel oping countries, in particular in view of their cur rent scarcity. In fact, the cost-effectiveness analysis on universal childhood hepatitis B immunization presented in Chapter 4 was the first study ever car ried out in Vietnam. It provides useful information for the Vietnamese health policy-makers on the performa nce of hepatitis B vaccination in the country. The modeling technique applied in that study could even tually be applied for economic evaluations of other vaccination programs within the EPI in Vietnam and in other (neighboring) countries. Chapter 7 present s a comparable assessment for the recommended rotavir us immunization in Vietnam. However, we did not design a disease Markov model ourselves for thi s study but applied an existing age-structured cohort model for the Vietnamese birth cohort that h ad been specially designed by our research group to be applied for developed countries. The overall aim was to explore the benefit for developing countrie s in utilizing existing disease models for their futu re research. This matter has been discussed in a comparative study on cost-effectiveness models desi gned for rotavirus vaccination in developed countries in Chapter 6. One of the strengths of the study in Chapter 7 is the utilization of the most General Discussions and Conclusions 157 updated data on vaccine efficacy, which was actuall y carried out in Vietnam. This enabled us to provid e more rigorous cost-effectiveness results on rotavir us vaccination than other similar studies on the sa me subject ever done in Vietnam (1, 2). Budget impacts and affordability analyses To assist health policy makers in budget preparatio n for various vaccination programs in Vietnam, besides conducting cost-effectiveness analyses of r espective vaccination strategies, we performed budget impact and affordability analyses. The argum ent for doing this was that many healthcare interventions could be cost-effective but might not be affordable due to high expenses (e.g., high vaccine price). Indeed, for a developing country su ch as Vietnam, one of the most crucial factors for the government to decide whether to introduce a new vac cine or to extend vaccination to a larger population depends heavily on the budget availabili ty. Hence, we presented a financial tool to assist health decision-making processes by running Monte C arlo simulations to account for uncertainty of all input factors of a vaccination program. The results of simulated iterations are presented in affordabi lity curves and cost-effectiveness affordability curves based on the theory by Sendi & Briggs [3]. This methodology was applied in the studies described in Chapters 4 and 7. Budget impact and affordability analyses will definitely help inform decision maker s on the level of required budgets for vaccination while facing the scarcity of resources. This method ology was, however, done under the assumption that a vaccination program was indivisible, meaning that vaccination cannot be administered to only a fraction of infants based on the arguments that thi s would be inequitable. This was reasonable in Vietnam as vaccination within the EPI is given free to every child. Results of our analyses will infor m health managers of the minimum required budget for a vaccination program to be implementable and the maximum budget level at which vaccination would be fully implemented. The findings from the affordability analyses will be useful for governmen ts in developing countries in making appropriate financial plans for different vaccination strategie s and applying for additional funds from internatio nal organizations, such as the Global Alliance of Vacci nes and Immunization (GAVI), that are committed to promote universal vaccination in the developing wor ld. Cost-of-illness Treatment cost of a disease is, one of the two most important components for any cost-effectiveness analysis beside epidemiological data. However, data on this issue are still not yet available for almo st all diseases in Vietnam and in most developing countrie s. To overcome this limitation, we carried out a cost-of-illness study to estimate the burden of chr onic hepatitis B in Vietnam as an example, which is the subject of Chapter 3. The overall aim was to pr ovide a methodology in estimating the burden of disease in the context of limited data available an d to inform health policy-makers of the economic burden of the chronic hepatitis B to the Vietnamese society. Indeed, cost-of-illness research on hepat itis B has been done in various Asian countries and diff erent methodologies were introduced [4-7]. However, these studies were conducted in countries, where an established recording system of patients and costs had been developed. In contrast, data rec ording is still an emerging and serious issue in Vietnam due to the poor facilities and infrastructu re. By conducting the cost-of-illness of chronic hepatitis B infection, we tried to provide an appro ach to mitigate the data limitation for the treatme nt cost CHAPTER 8 158 estimation. We also tried to provide plausible expl anations for the uncertainty surrounded cost estimations by conducting various sensitivity analy ses (e.g., one way, two-way sensitivity analyses) t o give a range within which the cost could be varied. This approach could potentially be applied for estimating the burden of many other diseases in cou ntries where there is limited available data like Vietnam. Regarding the treatment cost of rotavirus, we fortu nately could make use of cost data derived from an existing study carried out in Vietnam [1]. However, to make the cost up-to-date, we adjusted the treatment cost of rotavirus infection by using the consumer price index. The role of the GAVI and the international communit y Throughout the research, the important role of the GAVI in providing financial support is indispensabl e. This is mentioned in Chapters 1 and 5 where hepatit is B and rotavirus immunization in developing countries were extensively reviewed. The crucial ro le of the GAVI is furthered explored in the consequential Chapters 3 and 7 where cost-effective ness analyses of vaccination in Vietnam were carried out. In particular Chapter 7 went further t o compare the required budget for rotavirus vaccina tion based on market vaccine and GAVI-subsidized prices. It was concluded that without the GAVI support the government of Vietnam might have to spend up to US$ 25 million for a full immunization program against rotavirus, while under the GAVI support, th is necessary budget goes down to US$ 6 million. This is significant for Vietnam where healthcare pr ograms are competing among limited resources. Indeed, statistical data from the Ministry of Healt h show that in 2009 the total expenditure for all E PI activities in Vietnam was approximately US$ 8 milli on [8]. Budget analyses revealed that the necessary funding for universal vaccination against hepatitis B and rotavirus in Vietnam would exceed the total budget given for all EPI activities. The results of our research would justify the support from the GA VI and provide positive health-economic evidences for international organizations, which are committed to help developing countries. Strength of our research Our research has embarked on different types of eco nomic evaluations such as cohort-based, Markov- based cost-effectiveness analyses, affordability an alyses, which as previously mentioned are still ver y limited in Vietnam. The application of advanced mod eling techniques such as the application of Monte Carlo simulations, one-way or multivariate sensitiv ity analyses in our research helped clarify and understand the uncertainty in health economic evalu ations and provide a reasonable explanation for the results obtained. The techniques applied may become useful tools for economic evaluations of other public health interventions in Vietnam and other de veloping countries, where the epidemiology of diseases is similar. They are discussed in details in Chapters 3, 4, 6 and 7. Notably, health economics is still a new research a rea in Vietnam though it has been well recognized i n developed countries. The embarkment of our research on this topic should provide insightful informatio n for Vietnamese policy makers on assessing current a nd future public health programs and encouraging research institutions to promote health economic re search. It eventually could become a strong and efficient evaluation tool for health care decision makers in evaluating the outcomes and making financ ial plans for health care programs. General Discussions and Conclusions 159 Weaknesses of our research While working on this research, one the most challe nging and difficult issues we encountered was the poor quality and availability of both epidemiology and economic data, which might have affected the outcome of our research. However, this limitation c annot be circumvented, but should be coped with as good as possible. In reality, epidemiological data on hepatitis B infections has not yet been well recorded in Vietnamese hospitals due to the infrast ructure. We could not retrieve data on disease progressions among different stages of chronic hepa titis B, thus, we had to use epidemiological data from other countries, where the hepatitis B epidemi ology is more or less similar to Vietnam [9-13]. Th is is justified because disease progression rates appe ar to be stable across populations. The same situation was encountered for rotavirus disease. Th ough the rotavirus surveillance system was established in Vietnam in 1998 [14], there was no f ormal system to report rotavirus-related cases (e.g ., mild, moderate, severe) nationally or regionally. T hese limitations suggest a better established surveillance system for diseases to be established in the country. This will not only benefit research but also provide the Ministry of Health with more updat ed disease burden information for the purpose of prevention and control. Additionally, better epidem iological surveillance would enable more rigorous estimation of the treatment cost of diseases. The use of static models instead of dynamic models in the modeling studies (Chapters 4 and 7) resulted in the negligence of herd-immunity effects and cons equently leads to the underestimation of cost- effectiveness of vaccination. However, this can be justified by the lack of epidemiological data in Vietnam in particular and in developing countries i n general. It would be arguable that if dynamic mod els were applied for health economic evaluations and he rd immunity were accounted in our studies, vaccination against hepatitis B and rotavirus would become even more cost-effective. ZConclusions In this thesis, various types of economic evaluatio ns were carried out to assess the impacts of vaccination strategies in Vietnam. Besides cost-eff ectiveness analyses to assess the cost and outcomes of universal vaccination against hepatitis B and rotavirus, affordable analyses to estimate t he budget impacts on the implementation of vaccination and cost-of-illness to estimate the burden of disease were also implemented. These types of econo mic evaluations are very important in Vietnam as they are still rarely available especially in the h ealth sector. Overall, our results show that unive rsal childhood immunization in Vietnam is a cost-effecti ve and a \"must-do\" public health intervention for countries, where the epidemiology of hepatitis B an d rotavirus is similar and as high like in Vietnam (Chapter 4 and 7). The results of this thesis are i n line with results that have been carried out in o ther developing countries. These have been discussed and summarized in Chapters 2 and 5. Results of our research also strongly support the WHO's recommenda tion on universal vaccination against hepatitis B and rotavirus [r15]. Additionally, the data genera ted would assist Vietnamese health policy makers in making appropriate financial arrangement and making proper plans on healthcare prioritization. Our research also explored different tools and techniqu es (cost-effectiveness, affordability analyses, cos t-of- illness, static modeling based on Markov- and cohor t-based models) in economic evaluations in order to provide sound and efficient methodologies for evalu ating other immunization programs in the CHAPTER 8 160 Vietnamese EPI (e.g., pertussis, polio, Hib, and so on). This would definitely assist health managers in making financial, management plans for healthcare a ctivities. Moreover, the methodologies we introduced in this thesis may be useful for health researchers in Vietnamese academic institutions, wh o want to conduct health economic research for other healthcare interventions in Vietnam. These techniques have been discussed in detail in Chapter s 3, 4, and 7. Specifically, in Chapter 6 a comparative study of several models for evaluating rotavirus vaccination would enables modelers not only in Vietnam but also in developing countries to apply existing models in their research. It would tremendously save energy, time and resources for re searchers in the developing world in carrying out high-quality economic evaluations and to quickly le arn from experience which has been done in developed countries. Finally, the findings of the thesis emphasize the i mportant role of international donors in continuous ly providing support to developing countries' governme nts in implementing childhood immunization. The important support from the international community, among which the GAVI is an active player would assist developing countries to achieve the Millenni um Development Goals by bring down the under-five mortality rate and in combating against infectious diseases (16, 17). ZFuture perspectives Results of our studies have illuminated new directi ons for future research. Dynamic modeling of vaccination against infectious diseases that provid e more rigorous results of vaccination strategies i s considered to be very important for developing coun tries. In addition to universal childhood vaccinati on, possible cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccination strategies, which are targeted not only at childre n but also at adolescents and at-risk population, wil l show to be very useful for Vietnam. Economic resu lts on targeted vaccination may assist the Vietnamese g overnment to consider extending vaccination to larger populations such as adolescents in the futur e. Finally, the use of the economic evaluation tool s developed in our current research will add values i n the evaluation of other vaccination programs in t he Vietnamese EPI. ZReferences 1.

Currently, nine routine childhood vaccines have been included into the EPI and in the future n ew vaccines will be added to the program. Vietnam has received substantial technical support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and financial support from international organizations such as th e Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) for the EPI activities. Thus far, very few c ost-effectiveness analyses or economic evaluations on childhood vaccination have been conducted in Vietna m despite the importance of health economic evaluations in assessing health care interventions. Motivated by this, we decided to carry out cost- effectiveness analyses on hepatitis B and rotavirus vaccination, representing for under-used and new vaccines, respectively. The former is an existing v accine in the EPI and the latter a newly recommende d vaccine by the WHO. The goal is to provide concrete health economic evidence to the government and to international organizations who commit to provid e support to immunization in the developing world. In-depth and advanced analyses were carried out on hepatitis B and rotavirus vaccination and are described in Part I and Part II of this thesis, res pectively. In Part I, a comprehensive picture of the cost-effe ctiveness of hepatitis B vaccination in developing countries is presented in a review (Chapter 2). Hep atitis B vaccination was found cost-effective and a crucial strategy to prevent hepatitis B infection i n the developing world. Further economic evaluation s on hepatitis B are described in the subsequent two cha pters with the focus on Vietnam. Chapter 3 presents a cost-of-illness study aiming to estimate the dise ase burden of chronic hepatitis B infection to the Vietnamese society. The study presents a methodolog y for the cost estimation of a disease in countries where underlying data are not always readily availa ble. It was shown that the treatment cost of chroni c hepatitis B in Vietnam poses a very high financial burden for an average Vietnamese citizen and for th e country as a whole, where healthcare programs stron gly compete among the limited resources. Challenged by the economic burden of chronic hepati tis B infection, a cost-effectiveness analysis on t he vaccination against hepatitis B in Vietnam was subs equently performed (Chapter 4). We applied a Markov model and advanced modeling techniques in or der to estimate the health impact of vaccination. It became obvious that childhood vaccination agains t hepatitis B is always cost-effective for a high- endemic country of hepatitis B infection like Vietn am. Budget affordability revealed that hepatitis B vaccination is a necessary intervention in Vietnam to hedge expensive treatment costs of chronic hepatitis B and to reduce the morbidity and mortali ty of the disease. In Part II, the possibility of introducing the rota virus vaccine into the Vietnam's EPI was explored. Chapter 5 reviews the results of rotavirus immuniza tion in the developing world. It was concluded that rotavirus immunization in developing countries is c ost-effective and even potentially cost-saving, depending on the rotavirus vaccine price. All count ries had expressed the need for external financial 163 support in implementing rotavirus vaccination. Howe ver, a major limitation (as presented in the review ) was the application of simple decision tree models of rotavirus infection, which underestimate the rea l impact of vaccination. To assist developing countri es with better but more complex and sophisticated models for economic evaluations, we carried out a c omparative study on a number of existing disease models of rotavirus infection, which have been deve loped for use in the developed world (Chapter 6). The overall aim was to assist modelers in developin g countries with adopting adequate existing models in order to obtain more rigorous and robust health economic results. For the purpose of illustration, in Chapter 7 we applied the CoRoVa model as specified in Chapter 6, by conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis on rotavirus immunization for children und er five years of age in Vietnam. The results showe d that rotavirus immunization could even become a cos t-saving strategy in the country, depending on the vaccine price, and a rational prevention against di arrhoea-related diseases among children younger than five years. We explicitly compared the budget impacts on vaccination based on the market prices as well as on the GAVI-subsidized vaccine prices. Overall, vaccination against hepatitis B and rotavi rus in Vietnam is cost-effective and a crucial stra tegy to prevent hepatitis B and rotavirus infection. The analyses also emphasize the important role of the GAVI and other international organizations in exped iting vaccination strategies in developing countrie s such as Vietnam where coping with the limited finan cial resources are a real challenge. In conclusion, cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness and affordability analyses are very useful health economic tools to guide decision makers in where to invest the scarce resources. For developing countries, where healthcare programs even more stro ngly compete for the limited resources, it is important to make choices based on evidence-based c ost-effectiveness analyses. Ultimately, people living in the developing world will benefit from su ch rational decision making. 164 w SAMENVATTING y Vietnam heeft middels het Expanded financi\u00eble ondersteuning van de Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
