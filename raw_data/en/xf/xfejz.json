Advanced Biotic 180-count bottle This formula is a combination of six herbs that support the integrity of the microbiome. It helps maintain balance of the gut microflora and the entire microbiome. It also provides immune system, liver, and antioxidant support.* AP-Bio Andrographis Extract (Andrographis paniculata) Supports the immune system and the gut microbiome. Helps bile flow and liver function to expedite removal of toxins from the body.* Berberine Berberine is active in the gut and supports the immune system.* Cat's Claw Extract (Uncaria tomentosa) Supports immune function in its job of balancing the microbiome.* Japanese Knotweed Extract (Polygonum cuspidatum) Resveratrol and a wide spectrum of that support normal immune function.* Garlic (Allium sativum) New-Gar Garlic is a special form of garlic that has 10,000 ppm of active allicin. This remarkable ingredient supports the immune system in its efforts to promote a balanced microbiome.* Sarsaparilla (Smilax medica) Encourages natural removal of endotoxins and immune complexes to support the immune system and promote a healthy response to inflammation.* 2. Adaptogen Recovery 180-count bottle Adaptogens are herbs that help to maintain homeostasis, improve stamina, and increase physical tolerance to stress by supporting adrenal function. This formula also supports healthy immune function and the integrity of the microbiome.* Chinese Skullcap Extract (Scutellaria baicalensis) A potent synergist that enhances benefits of other herbs. It supports immune function and is a calming herb for supporting healthy sleep and nerve tissues.* Reishi Mushroom Extract (Ganoderma lucidum) An adaptogenic mushroom that promotes stamina, supports immune system functions, and promotes a calm state of mind. It is also neuro-supportive, liver supportive, and supports aerobic physical activity.* Cordyceps Extract (Cordyceps sinensis) An adaptogenic mushroom that promotes stress resistance; supports immune function, supports adrenal function; and improves aerobic activity.* Rehmannia adrenal tonic, this adaptogenic root supports adrenal function and supports a relaxed state of mind.* 3. Mitochondrial Support 180-count bottle The natural ingredients in this formula support homeostasis at the cellular level. It also includes antioxidant support that helps promote cellular function, optimize energy production by supporting mitochondria, and healthy detoxification processes.* Glutathione Glutathione offers antioxidant support that helps mitochondria neutralize free-radicals produced during the generation of energy. The body's need for glutathione is sometimes outpaced by its ability to produce it, which is where a healthy diet and supplementation can play a vital role. Its three primary benefits are: antioxidant support, detoxification, and immune support.* N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) NAC offers antioxidant support and is essential for the formation of glutathione inside cells. NAC supports the immune system, nerve tissue, liver function, collagen formation, and lung tissue.* Alpha Lipoic Acid An antioxidant supporter with the unique property of being both water and fat soluble. Therefore, it is easily absorbed and works with antioxidants already present inside cells to support cells in their fight against free radical damage. It also supports liver function and nerve function. Alpha lipoic acid enhances the antioxidant effects of vitamin C, E and NAC.* Vitamin C Vitamin C provides almost too many functions to list, but most important are its antioxidant properties. When combined with other antioxidants, vitamin C offers a high degree of protection. Vitamin C is an essential collagen supporter. Optimal tissue levels of NAC, lipoic acid, and vitamin C support glutathione in the body.* Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) CoQ10 is a key component of the machinery responsible for producing energy within the mitochondria. CoQ10 also neutralizes free radical damage to cellular and mitochondrial membranes. The highest concentrations in the body are found in the heart, liver, kidney and pancreas.* 4. Daily Multi Plus (Formally Prevention Plus\u00ae) 180-count bottle Daily Multi Plus delivers vitamins and minerals that promote healthy immune function, including vitamin D (500 IU), vitamins C (45 mg) and E (9 mg), and zinc (7 mg) \u2014 all in bioavailable forms for high absorbability. Combined, the nutrients, antioxidants, and herbal phytochemicals in this formula support healthy blood flow, cellular function, and energy production, along with promoting heart, eye, skin, and liver health.* Vitamins D, C, and E The immune-supporting vitamins in this formulation are in activated forms for high absorbability. A single serving of Daily Multi Plus delivers 500 IU of vitamin D, 45 mg of C, and 9 mg of E. Trans-Resveratrol Extract (from Japanese Knotweed) Trans-resveratrol, the most bioavailable form of resveratrol, is well-known for offering cardiovascular support and antioxidant properties.* Pine Bark Extract (PBE) Compounds in Pine Bark Extract are known for their antioxidant benefits and helping the body maintain vascular tissue and support the integrity of blood vessels. PBE is also supportive to the immune system.* Milk Thistle Extract (Silybum marianum) Silymarin, the primary chemical component of milk thistle, offers potent support for the liver. It is the most widely researched of all liver related herbs and is well known for its safety.* Lutein & Zeaxanthin These twin carotenoid compounds account for the yellow color in vegetables. They build up in the retina of the eye and maintain a healthy retina during normal exposure to sunlight. They also accumulate in the skin to support its health.* Astaxanthin Acts and an antioxidant to promote healthy skin and support the skin's natural defenses.* Lycopene Acts as an antioxidant and has been studied mostly for promoting prostate health.* Rutin & Hesperidin Contains bio-flavonoid compounds known to promote a healthy cardiovascular system.* Pomegranate Extract Antioxidant activity that provides cellular support and helps maintain healthy skin.* Hawthorn Leaf Extract Supports the cardiovascular system and healthy blood vessels.* IS THE RESTORE KIT RIGHT FOR ME? GETTING STARTED It is a lot of capsules. Gaining the full amount of the ingredients is an essential part of the kit and we don't want to cut corners. While a \"one-a-day\" vitamin sounds nice, it likely won't move the needle or result in any noticeable difference. Tinctures are another common method of taking herbal supplements. While this works if you only have a few supplements, large volumes of multiple-ingredient supplements contain a significant amount of alcohol and are very bitter in taste. We've found that capsules (while not perfect either) are the easiest way to take herbal supplements. Once you integrate the Vital Plan supplements into your health regimen, they will become easy to take each day. Our team can also provide helpful tips for taking the capsules if you are experiencing difficulty. While it's not a requirement to speak with a healthcare provider before beginning the Restore Kit, we strongly recommend keeping your healthcare provider up-to-date with any new health programs or regimens you want to start. The Restore Kit is not \"one size fits all.\" Every person is different and will likely follow their own pathway. Many people are already taking other supplements when they start the kit, which is fine. The ingredients in the Restore Kit formulas have been carefully chosen for their low potential for harm. That said, we recommend that you consult a qualified healthcare provider before beginning a new program or regimen. This kit is designed to be a foundation; you start with the foundation and build out from there. A large percentage of people will find that the four formulations at the recommended quantities will cover their needs. Others will need higher quantities or a wider range of ingredients. The Restore Kit will help you navigate what you need. If you are taking any kind of prescription drug, do not stop taking it during the Restore Kit without first consulting your doctor. We recommend that you consult with your doctor before beginning the Restore Kit. That said, the ingredients in the Restore Kit formulas have been carefully chosen for their low potential for harm. Consult your doctor before you start the Restore Kit if you are pregnant or nursing, are under the age 18, have cancer, are on medications for bipolar disorder, have an allergy to any ingredient listed, or have Type 1 Diabetes. THE PROCESS Many people notice some changes within a few weeks, but it depends on your baseline condition\u2014where your health is when you begin the Restore Kit. The supplements help your body's natural systems; they don't treat symptoms like drug therapy. Because of this, achieving full results using natural therapy may take several months. That said, how you feel (in terms of wellness) is actually an extremely effective and inexpensive way to monitor progress. If you feel well, you probably are well. Symptoms and health habits will be also be measured monthly through an interactive survey once you start the Restore Kit. While each individual's journey may look a little bit different, our team is here to support you along the way. Our customer service team is available for questions about the Restore Kit, and additional private consultations with Dr. Rawls are also available at [info@vitalplan.com](mailto:info@vitalplan.com). The Restore Kit formulations are potent on their own, but if you are serious about your wellness, it doesn't make sense to flood your body with inflammatory foods and toxins. When you begin the Restore Kit, you will receive the Vital Plan Diet for healthful, clean eating. This guide is intended to help you detoxify your body and support wellness; we highly recommend that you continue this diet for the entire six months, if not longer. We will teach you how to make healthy (and satisfying) swaps to help you transition to a clean diet. You are worth it and your body is worth it! The Restore Kit is a foundational kit that is intended to be used on an ongoing basis. Based on customer feedback, some people experience changes within a few weeks, but report seeing the most significant results in four to six months. Like many holistic approaches, patience and persistence are key. While each individual's journey may look a little bit different, our team is here to support you along the way. Our customer service team is available for questions about the Restore Kit at 800-951-2414 or [info@vitalplan.com](mailto:info@vitalplan.com).

I have been taking these herbs for eight months. I believe they worked in conjunction with other healthy habits and diet to get me back to not only before I started to feel ill (severe fatigue, joint pains, Lyme symptoms, etc...), but I feel like I did 30+ years ago. Energy is better than I can ever remember, joint pain is gone and I have made these a daily ritual and will continue to do so going forward. Love the auto-ship, never run out and don't have to think about it! Thank you Dr. Rawls!!! I've been using the restore kit for about a month and half so far and already feel my symptoms reducing in severity. Excited for the progress to come! Lyme does not determine my life. Lyme disease sapped my energy, fogged up my thought process, and dunked my vision. I've been taking the Restore Kit for almost a year now and my vision and head fog are just about gone, my energy is greatly improved but not like it was before Lyme but then I am 70yo so a nap a day is AOK. Vital Plan Hi Daniel, Thank you for your review of the Restore Kit. I am happy to hear it has helped you with so many of your symptoms! Warmly, The Vital Plan Team I have been impressed with this product for sure. My symptoms have been improving slowly, albeit steadily since I started early march 2021. I am floored by the amount of support and education resources that are offered along with purchasing the restore kit. I am a part of the medical community and can be quite critical of practitioners and health claims. So far I'm impressed with the Vital plan products and information shared. It seems to really correlate with how I've been feeling and the health issues I've been experiencing. It's far too early to know what any of this is working.. so how can I possibly recommend this product at "}
