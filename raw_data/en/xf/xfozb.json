Join us for a special evening of relaxation and restoration with [Yishi Healing](https://www.yishihealing.com). We will guide you through qigong, acupuncture, and sound healing to improve the flow of energy within the body and to promote overall mental tranquility. We will begin the night with a gentle qigong practice. Qigong is a movement meditation that links breath with movement in order to open the energy channels within the body. Qi, translated from Chinese, means vital energy (think spirit/soul in western thought, or prana in yogic and Indian philosophy). Blocked or stagnant qi can cause lethargy or disease, so practices which allow the energy to flow freely can help to bring the body into balance. After qigong, we will guide you into a meditative state with a sound bath. Sound Healing utilizes the therapeutic sounds of tuning forks, crystal sound bowls, gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, drums, rattles and other instruments to lead you into a hypnagogic state - a state between wakefulness and sleep. This offering increases brain wave frequencies, which encourage creativity and overall healing. During the sound bath, acupuncture needles will be used by a licensed acupuncturist to encourage free flowing energy throughout the body. By focusing on acupuncture points that promote an overall calming and grounding sensation, you will be guided into a deeper state of relaxation. No prior experience is required or necessary. Come as you are. Space is limited!
