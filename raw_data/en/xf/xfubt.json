Artigo em Ingl\u00eas | EMBASE of a relevant [animal disease model]and lack of the use of supportive studies have limited the process of rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This study has evaluated how the choice of species selection and study design affected the outcomes of the non-clinical [toxicity]studies of the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine concepts. The study has been focused on [safety]aspects i.e. on the Developmental and Reproductive [Toxicity](DART) and [Repeated Dose] [Toxicity](RDT) studies. [Rat]and preclinical [toxicity]testing. Some [COVID-19 vaccine]candidates show a DART study design suboptimal for antibody transfer during [lactation]. The [toxicity]studies showed no [adverse effects]. [Minor]effectswere expected, local reactogenicity, [immune response]and macroscopic findings at the [injection]site. In addition, comments received during the EMA assessment of the [vaccines]have been evaluated and consisted most frequently of [commentary]on study design, species selection and missing data regardless of the utilized [vaccine]concept. Use of supportive platform studies often substantiated the [commentary]on these main three categories. [Animal model]-based [toxicity]testing has shown limited value in establishing [safety]of the [vaccines], and, more importantly, low translational value in supporting clinical development. From a 3R perspective sponsors are encouraged to focus on products from the supportive platform, both with [respect]to DART and RDT studies. Regulatory emphasis on data obtained from [vaccines]with the same platform [technology]data can be used to support [marketing]approval of new documento: Artigo Similares MEDLINE ... LILACS LIS "}
