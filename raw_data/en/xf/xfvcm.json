Today, in our hurried society, stress is (to quote Don Henley) \"everywhere, all the time\" leaving me with knots in my back and neck. I have found several methods to try to unwind. Music and Massage Obviously, a massage can help a person relax, but what if you combine it with music? The benefits become astonishing. In a study published in the [Journal of Clinical Nursing](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/de-stress-instantly), between 54 and 65 percent of nurses experienced moderate to extreme anxiety. But after they were treated with a quick 15-minute massage accompanied with aromatherapy oils and music, the nurses reporting stress went down to only 8 percent! Eating and Drinking Several years ago, I decided to try drinking green tea. I was surprised how much I liked it. I have always been a \"coffee girl,\" so turning to tea was like taking the side of the Red Coats during the American Revolution. But, by eliminating the caffeine in the coffee with green tea, I discovered that I was not as jittery and able to relax a little bit more. Other changes can be made to your diet, like eating dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate, which will increase the benefits without feeling like you are suffering. If eating chocolate is suffering, count me in! Relax and Meditate Creating a protected space where you can relax and be free from phones, television, computers or other distractions can help a person feel less stress. The key to this type of relaxation is that there is nothing fighting for your attention. Meditation allows you to relax by turning your focus on just one thing. It could be your breathing, a \"happy place\" in your mind, or a beautiful picture on the wall. The key to meditation is not to let any distractions get in the way while you relax your muscles and clear your mind. While you are meditating, you are to \"check in\" with your body from head to toe and be aware of spots that are tense or hurting. After identifying these spots, visit the chiropractors at The Joint. They can help loosen these spots by gently adjusting the spine to provide the body with proper alignment to support the muscles. Regular spinal adjustments, along with relaxation techniques, can remove all of the aches and pains associated with stress leading to a healthier and happier life. "}
