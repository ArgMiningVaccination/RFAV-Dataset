The array of sounds communes with various parts of the body, bringing healing and balancing. The gongs aid in aligning the body into its natural rhythm.] In these ceremonies we begin with an invocation, meditation, and setting of intention. We call on Spirit to join us as we go inward, and determine what we are working on shedding or calling into our lives. I begin by playing the gong over and around people who are lying in a comfortable and relaxing setting, and then move to the larger gongs for a deep and impactful vibrational experience. I incorporate the drum (the sacred heart beat), condor feathers and the chakapa (Amazonian plant rattle) into the ceremony also. The ceremony closes with giving thanks for our experience, our time together, and for each other. Ceremonies last for approximately two hours.
