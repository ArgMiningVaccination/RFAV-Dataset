Task PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO E-1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction The Army Surgeon General LTG Eric B. Schoomaker chartered the Army Pain Management Task F orce (TF) in August 2009 to make recommendations for a MEDCOM comprehensive pain management strategy th at was holistic, multidisciplinary, and multimodal in its approach, utilizes state of the art/science mo dalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldiers and other patients with acute and chronic pain. TSG appo inted BG Richard Thomas, Assistant Surgeon General for Force Projection, as the TF Chairperson. Tas k Force membership included a variety of medical specialties and disciplines from the Army, as well as representatives from the Navy, Air Force, TRICARE Management Activity, and Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Task Force conducted its review and analysis utilizing site visits, interviews w ith clinical subject matter experts and medical staff, and data collection through Regional Medical Commands, as well as through a review of medical literature, and policies and regulations of U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and the Department of D efense (DoD). The Task Force conducted 28 site visits from October 2009 through January 2010 at Army, Navy, and Air For ce Medical Centers, Hospitals and Health Clinics, as well as VHA and civilian hospitals. V isits outside of Army Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) were scheduled based on recommendations from Service represe ntatives, while also taking into account the facilities' reputations for innovative and state of the art approaches to pain medici ne. During site visits, leadership and staff were asked to assess pain management capabilities, strengths, weakness es, and best practices at their respective facilities. National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 Section 711 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010 tasked the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a comprehensive policy on pain management by the military health care system, n o later than March 31, 2011. Overview of Pain in the United States and the Milita ry Health System Pain is the most frequent reason patients seek physician care in the United States, and more than 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. The annual cost of chronic pain in the U.S. is estimated at $100 bi llion, including health care expenses, lost income, and lost productivity. Back pain alone is the leading cause of dis ability in Americans under 45 years of age. The failure to adequately address pain in the health care system conti nues to result in unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of other medical conditions, and huge financial and pe rsonnel costs. The variability that characterizes the practice of pain management in the U.S. health care system is a result o f several factors. To begin with, each medical provider's understanding and approach to pain management is unique and variable, as it is significantly influenced by each physician's academic medical tr aining, mentors, cultural beliefs, and personal experiences with pain. In addition, there is a lack of clear ownership of pain m edicine by any one medical specialty. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, \"pain medicine\" is a relatively new medical specialty that is evolving along with its place in the medical hierarchy. TFFinalTFFinalEXECUTIVE SUMMARY E-2 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Although there are many treatment modalities for pain management, one of the major components for the treatment of pain continues to be the use of Over-The-Counter and prescription medications. The use of medications i s appropriate, required, and often an effective way to treat pain. However, the possible overreliance on medications t o treat pain has other unintended consequences, such as the increased prevalence of prescription medication abuse and diversion throughout the United States. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescri ption opioid analgesics are the most commonly abused prescription drugs in the U.S., with the highest rat e of abuse occurring among those ages 18-25. For patients interested in treatments other than, or in addition to, medication, Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a popular option. Though CAM is increasing in popularity among patients, this popularity has yet to result in a parallel increase in acceptance and use within traditional medicine. There is a wide range of these ther apies and treatments, such as acupuncture and yoga therapy, that have proven valuable in reducing an overreliance on use of medications to treat pain. Many of the Military Health System's (MHS) challenges with pain management are very similar t o those faced by other medical systems, but the MHS also faces some unique issues because of its distin ctive mission, structure and patient population. For example: xThe nation expects the MHS to provide the highest level of care to those carrying wars' heaviest burdens. xThe transient nature of the military population, including patients and providers, makes continuity o f care a challenge for military medicine. xPain management challenges associated with combat polytrauma patients require integrated approaches to clinical care that cross traditional medical specialties, not all of which ar e universally available across the MHS. MEDCOM and MHS lack a comprehensive pain management strategy that addresses current deficien cies. As a result, pain management initiatives are fragmented - often driven by local champions and subject to reti rements, changes of command, and annual budget priorities for their continued existence. Finally, the MHS care for Warriors is rooted in a military culture that praises selfles sness, toughness, and willingness to accept pain. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and thei r leadership. This attitude often causes delays in seeking treatment, as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines attempt to work through their pain and \"tough it out.\" This frequently results in relatively minor acute issues later becoming har der-to- manage chronic conditions. Pain Management Task Force Recommendations The Pain Management Task Force developed 109 recommendations that lead to a comprehensive pain man agement strategy that is holistic, multidisciplinary, and multimodal in its approach, utili zes state of the art/science modalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldiers and other patients with acute and c hronic pain. The recommendations rely heavily on an education and communication plan that crosses DoD and VH A medical staff and patients. The Task Force also placed an emphasis on linking to existing Service and MHS initiative s (e.g. Patient Centered Medical Home, Comprehensive Soldier Fitness) that support the pain management strategy. The requirement to synchronize both effort and approach to pain management across the MHS and VHA is an essential first step in combating the variability that plagues pain management across the MHS. This r equirement was the driving force behind many of the other TF recommendations. TFFinalTFFinalEXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO E-3 Recommendations are divided into four areas: 1. Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Practice and Research Advancements in P ain Management 2. Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Continuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence 3. Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Force 4. Synchronize a Culture of Pain Awareness, Education, and Proactive Intervention All recommendations support the TF vision statement of \"Providing a Standardized DoD and V HA Vision and Approach to Pain Management to Optimize the Care for Warriors and their Families.\" The Way Ahead Improving pain management across the DoD will require a significant reorganization, education, and training effort that will be most effective if pursued as a part of a DoD and VHA partnership. The Uniformed Services boast an impressive group of pain medicine physician subspecialist but th ey are relatively few in number when compared with the mission. In addition to ensuring there are continued efforts to grow and retain pain medicine specialists, the MHS must develop a supporting team of clinicians and staff to ass ist specialists in addressing the pain management needs of their patients and staff. Pain medicine should be managed by integrated care teams which employ a biopsychosocial model of care. The standard of care should have objectives to decrease overreliance on medication driven solutions and create an interdisciplinary approach that encourages collaboration among providers from differing specialties. The DoD should continue to responsibly explore safe and effective use of advanced and non-traditional approaches to pain management and support efforts to make these modalities covered benefits once they prove safe, effecti ve and cost efficient. MHS Leadership must establish pain as a priority, with an urgency that leads to practice changes. The fo cus should be on prevention, followed by prompt and appropriate treatment that seeks to relieve acute pain and eliminate progression to chronic pain when possible. Including the VHA in this strategy is essential. DoD and VA should cooperate and share common educational materials, venues, protocols, and formularies. A common standard would demonstrate the power of a unifie d effort and expedite achievement of the common goal: providing a standardized DoD and VHA vision and approac h to pain management to optimize the care for Warriors and their Families. TFFinalTFFinalEXECUTIVE SUMMARY E-4 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Task Force Recommendation Objectives Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and E ncourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management Establish common pain taxonomy across the DoD and VHA.

TFFinalTFFinalTASK FORCE REPORT TFFinalTFFinalPRELUDE TO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 1I. PRELUDE TO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE In May 2008 the Health Policy and Services (HP&S) Proponency Office for Rehabilitation and Rei ntegration (PR&R) at Office of The Army Surgeon General (OTSG) began an examination of \"Pain\" as a distincti ve issue for the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM). Around the same time, Congress proposed a \"Military Pai n Care Act\" in the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2009. The legislative langu age included an assessment that stated: \"Comprehensive pain care is not consistently provided on a uniform basis throughout the systems to all patients in need of such care.\" Although the Military Pain Care Act was not included in the NDAA for 2009, the Services were informed by Congress that the issue would be revisited in the NDAA for 2010. Subsequently, PR&R formed the MEDCOM Pai n Management Work Group, consisting of local military pain management specialists from Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as a few OTSG staff officers. The group concluded that MEDCOM's pain management strategy w as focused on complying with the Joint Commission (JC) pain standards. Although this was a worthy objecti ve and MEDCOM appeared to be successful in meeting the JC standards for pain management, the work group was convinced that this goal was not sufficiently ambitious. During a PR&R-sponsored strategic summit in December 2008, participants shared informati on about local pain care initiatives, including the Walter Reed-based Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia & Analgesia (MARAA) program that focuses primarily on the analysis of: xAcute pain management techniques for the battlefield, and ways to make improvements. xPain management clinics that utilize a wide variety of integrated medicine approaches. xThe Veterans Administration's (VA) very mature pain management initiative. At the 2009 Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) Conference, one of the four new medical issues presented to Arm y Senior leadership was \"overmedication of Service Members and Families.\" Senior le aders at the MEDCOM Behavioral Health Summit singled out pain management as a priority for the organization. Several months l ater, the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force (ASPTF) tasked MEDCOM to develop recommendat ions to provide alternate approaches to pain management. The ASPTF concluded there was a possible overreliance on pain management medications, while certain complementary approaches for pain management were being underutiliz ed. Although the Pain Management Work Group members concurred with the need to expand available treatment modalities, they were also convinced that no new approach would have the desired effect unless it was part of a comprehensive pai n management strategy for MEDCOM. Despite some successes, such as establishing a requirement for a Pain Consultant to The Surgeon G eneral (TSG) and increased recognition of the ongoing efforts of many local pain management champions around MEDC OM, there continued to be insufficient progress toward the development of an effective comprehensive pain management strategy. The Pain Management Work Group determined that: xSignificant improvement in pain management would require a course correction for the organization. xPain management would need to be redefined for MEDCOM. xMEDCOM would require a reorientation and an updated approach to a new definition of pain management. The PR&R and HP&S leadership supported the assessment that an increased amount of command attention and resources would be required to develop and implement an effective strategy for an organization as large as MEDCOM. Following a briefing from the MEDCOM Chief of Staff, TSG elected to charter a Tas k Force (TF) to address the pain management challenge under his command. TFFinalTFFinalTASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS 2 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCEII. TASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS Charter Army Surgeon General LTG Eric B. Schoomaker established the Pain Management Task Force in August 2009 to make recommendations for improving clinical, administrative, and research processe s for the provision of pain management care and services at MEDCOM facilities. The primary objective of the TF was to develo p a template for a MEDCOM comprehensive pain management strategy that is holistic, multidisciplinary, and m ultimodal in its approach, utilizes state of the art/science modalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldiers and other patients with acute and chronic pain. A copy of the signed Charter is attached as Append ix C. LTG Schoomaker appointed BG Richard Thomas, Assistant Surgeon General for Force Projection, as the T F Chairperson and later appointed the remainder of MEDCOM TF members, ensuring representation from t he continuum of clinical specialties involved in pain management. Because pain management challenges are not unique to MEDCOM, and a joint solution is required to ensure a uniform continuum of care is provided for Warriors and other Beneficiaries, TSG invited the A ssistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA); Acting Under Secretary for Health for the Veterans H ealth Administration (VHA); Surgeons General of the Air Force and Navy; Deputy Director, TRIC ARE Management Activity (TMA); and United States Army Reserve (USAR) and United States Army National Guard (USNG ) to nominate representatives for the TF. All of these organizations nominated individuals who were subsequently appointed to the Task Force. Structure and Member Selection Because relieving pain and suffering is an objective that is organic to all specialties acro ss the health care continuum, there was an extensive list of stakeholders to be considered for inclusion on the TF. MEDCOM Regi onal Medical Commands submitted nominations for the TF with the understanding that TF activities would require an estima ted 25% of representatives' duty time. The TF Chairperson selected the number of members as well as the cros s section of specialties required to adequately represent this complex issue, while ensuri ng a manageable TF size. The TF member list follows in Figure 1. Chairperson BG Thomas requested that those specialties not specifically represented on the Task For ce be provided the opportunity to offer feedback on the TF recommendations prior to release of the Final TF Report. Their feed back has been solicited and integrated, as directed. A list of the medical specialties and stakeholders is attached as Appendix D. TFFinalTFFinalTASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 5The second day TF members were divided into three facilitated breakout sessions focused on identifyi ng Policy and Performance Management, Service Delivery, Warriors in Transition, and Program Integration iss ues related to pain management. The TF focused on these tasks in its initial evaluation of MEDCOM pain management and began to develop a comprehensive pain management strategy. TF members decided to invite representativ es from Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), and Army Guard and Reserve to ensure full representation. Following the initial meeting, the TF held monthly in-person meetings and weekly or biweekly tele phone conferences to provide updates, conduct issue discussions, and coordinate future TF activities. Additionall y, ad hoc meetings were held among TF members while working on their assigned issues. Site Visits The Task Force conducted 28 site visits from October 2009 through January 2010. The TF visited Army, N avy, Air Force, and VA MEDCENS, MEDDACS and Health Clinics as well as civilian facili ties, which were chosen based on their reputations for innovative and state of the art approaches to pain medicine. Civilian facilities outside of MEDCOM were selected based on input from TF representatives. The TF developed a standardized site visit template that was used to conduct interviews and report finding s on the site visits (Appendix F). Interview questions asked leadership and staff to assess pain management capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and best practices at their respective facilities. The TF found a variety of best practices and confirmed the wide variation in existing practices and available resources, further substanti ating information provided through the MTF data call. Findings from the site visits, and other activities of the Task Force, ar e presented in this Task Force Report. Figure 2: Task Force Site Visit Map TFFinalTFFinalTASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS 6 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCELimitations and Caveats for the TF Report The Army Surgeon General chartered the Army Pain Management Task Force to evaluate MEDCO M pain management, and although the TF membership and charter were naturally \"Army-centric,\" The Surgeon General recognized the importance of including Navy, Air Force, and Veterans Health Administration in this effo rt. At the start of the process, all TF members concluded that achieving significant pain management improvemen ts in their respective organizations would require developing recommendations that could be applied to a larger D oD and VHA approach to pain care. As such, all recommendations in this report were developed with the intent of being part of a DoD and VHA comprehensive pain management strategy. Representations in this TF Report were made as part of the TF mandate to provide recommendations regardi ng the DoD and VHA programs, initiatives, and projects. The Task Force understands that the Services and the Veteran's Health Administration, while having representation on the TF, have not had the opportunity to officially review and staff the recommendations within their organizations. While the TF Report appears to focus on the inadequacies of pain medicine in the military and VHA health c are systems, there was no intention to leave an impression that standards of care are not currently being met. In fact, the DoD and VA facilities continue to deliver exceptional health care within accepted standards of care. During the site visits and interviews, the TF identified numerous best practices for pain management that were later used to develop the recommendations in this report. The TF members determined that there was both a need and an opportunity to push the MHS and VHA beyond meeting the current standards of care. The Pain Task Force conducted its evaluation and analysis over the course of six months. Wi th the exception of scheduled monthly meetings and site visits, the appointed members continued working at their regu larly assigned places of duty and positions. The Task Force leadership continually balanced the desire to leverage th e synergy of gathering TF members with the competing reality that these were leaders in military medicine with clini cal responsibilities. Lastly, with the limited time available, the Task Force was not able to fully evaluate and make specifi c recommendations for Pediatric and Palliative Care pain management. The consensus from the Task Force m embers was that a thorough evaluation of these areas would require further expertise and time, neither of which were available to the TF. TFFinalTFFinalPAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 7III. PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Introduction Treating pain is one of medicine's oldest and most fundamental responsibilities. Yet modern medic ine continues to be challenged in its efforts to understand pain mechanisms and to relieve pain and suffering. Pain is an enigmatic issue that places significant burdens on patients, families, medical providers, and employer s. Pain is the most frequent reason patients seek physician care in the United States and it affects more Amer icans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pain Medicine). When including health care expenses, lost income, and lost pr oductivity, the annual cost of chronic pain in the U.S. is estimated at $100 billion (National Institutes for Health). Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability in Americans under 45 years of age. The variability in pain management practice throughout medicine is partially due to the lack of a congr uent pain curriculum in the academic preparation of various medical professionals. The topi c of pain management is often poorly presented and inadequately developed in the curricula of many U.S. medical, nursing, pharmacy, and other medical professional schools, as well as in their respective continuing education. A medical provider's understanding and approach to pain management is unique and variable. It is significantl y influenced by academic medical training, currency of pain curriculum, medical m entors, cultural beliefs, and personal experiences with pain. Considerable variation in the management of pain currently exis ts also, in part, due to a lack of clear ownership of pain medicine by any one medical specialty. This has resulted in m edical turf-wars as diverse specialties battle for reimbursement and workload credit. The failure to adequately address pain in the health care systems continues to result in unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of other medical condi tions and huge financial and personnel costs. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, \"pain medicine\" is a relatively new m edical specialty that is evolving in conjunction with advances in pharmacology and interventional procedures. Its plac e in the medical hierarchy is still developing. There is much variability in what constitutes a \"Pain Spec ialist\" or \"Pain Clinic.\" This creates uncertainty for patients and providers. The perception of many patients and providers is that pain management specialists fall within one of two categories: intervention-centered (e.g., needles) or medi cation- centered (e.g., pills). Neither of these unitary approaches to pain management completely meets the needs of patients, who often present complicated causes and reasons for their pain. Therefore, a comprehensive and integrated approach to pain management across several medical specialties is required. Although there are many treatment modalities for pain management, one of the major components for the treatment of pain, whether in primary care or by \"pain specialists,\" continues to be the use of Over-the-Counter (OTC) and prescription medications. Using medications to treat pain is appropriate, required, and often effecti ve. In some cases, an increased reliance on prescription medications for pain treatment appears to be influenc ed by the fact that most pain medications are relatively inexpensive, patients readily accept their use, and they requi re minimum time expenditure on behalf of the provider and patient. The possible overreliance on medications to treat pain has other unintended consequences, however, such as an increase in prescription medication abuse and div ersion throughout the United States. According to the Office of National Drug Policy, prescription opioid analgesi cs are the most commonly abused prescription drugs in the U.S., with the highest rates of abuse occurring among those betw een the ages of 18 and 25 (Wilson, 2006). These medications are often diverted from family members or friends and are viewed as \"legal,\" less shameful to use, and safer than illegal drugs (NIDA, 2008). FinalTFFinalPAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 8 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE For patients seeking a treatment plan that includes more than just medication, Complementary Alternative Medic ine (CAM) is gaining popularity, though this has yet to result in a parallel increase in the acceptance an d use of these complementary modalities within traditional medicine. There is a wide range of these therapies and treatments, such as acupuncture and yoga therapy, that have proven valuable in reducing an overreliance on use of medications to treat pain. There are many reasons individuals may seek the option to use CAM, not the least of which is the failure of current treatment to relieve their pain. Current research indicates that part of the appeal of CAM includes the opportunity for greater personal involvement in health maintenance, holistic health beliefs and, for th ose with chronic conditions, an active coping mechanism (Bishop, Yardley and Lewith, 2007; Sollner et al., 2000). Understanding that pain is not just a symptom of disease but at times, is a disease process in itself, is a fundamental change occurring in modern medicine, explaining the new emphasis on effective pain control. Regardless of th e treatment setting, inadequate acute pain control is associated with a myriad of physiologic changes that can significantly increase patient morbidity and possibly mortality (Dubois, 2009). Evidence suggests that untreated or poorly treated acute pain, and the pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive responses associated wi th it, may result in deleterious health effects for months or even years after the initial onset of pain (Meiler, 2006). P ain is a disease state of the nervous system and deserves the same management attention given to any other disease states. Pain in MEDCOM, MHS, and VHA The Military Health System's (MHS) challenges with pain management are very similar to t hose faced by other medical systems. However, there are some unique issues faced by the MHS because of its distinc tive mission, structure and patient population. The MHS's mission to take care of Service Members and their Families extends beyond the usual relati onship between a health care system and its patients. Providing world-class medical care is alway s an imperative, but during a time of war, its importance is heightened. The nation expects and demands that the MHS provide th e highest level of care possible for those carrying the heaviest burdens. Doing any less than this is unacceptable to the military leadership, Congress, and the American people. The likelihood that patients have their medical care coordinated by a single Primary Care Manager (P CM) remains very low in the MEDCOM. The transient nature of the military population, including both patients an d providers, creates extraordinary challenges to providing continuity of care, something very important to pain manag ement. Ongoing access to a PCM is often limited because of provider deployments, Temporary Duty (TDY) for training, or Permanent Change of Station (PCS) moves. Patients are also subject to many of these same variables. The inability to provide continuity of care is extremely problematic when attempting to develop and implement l ong-term treatment plans for pain management and other chronic medical conditions. This often exposes patients to duplicative appointments, laboratory tests, and medical procedures, along with inconsistent treatment approache s that can cause confusion, frustration and in some cases unnecessary suffering. Modern military medicine is unparalleled in its ability to save Wounded Warriors. B ody armor and improved delivery of battlefield medicine have increased patient survival from wounds that were fatal in previous conflicts. This, however, has resulted in pain management challenges for combat polytrauma patients. One such challe nge is the need to provide pain control for potentially medically unstable Warriors immediately foll owing injury and then continuously during transport to secondary and tertiary care facilities. Other challenges incl ude the management of comorbid conditions, such as post concussive syndrome, mild-Traumatic Brain Injur y (TBI) and PTSD. These latter conditions require integrated approaches to clinical care that cross traditional medi cal specialties, not all of which are universally available across the MHS. Overall, both MEDCOM and MHS lack a comprehensive pain management strategy, exacerbating sever al patient- provider continuity challenges. The MEDCOM and MHS are responsible for patient care throughout the world. TFFinalTFFinalPAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 9However, no widely disseminated pain management philosophy is currently in place and speci alty care services, personnel, and treatment modalities are neither standardized nor predictable across MTFs. The MED COM and MHS have no published standards for pain management structure, capabilities, or personnel for their clinic s, hospitals, or medical centers. As a result, MEDCOM and MHS pain management initiatives are fragmented, driven by local champion s and subject to retirements, changes of command, and annual budget priorities for their continued existence. A PCS m ove for a Service or Family Member can result in loss of access to certain treatment modalities that have proven successful for pain management. Losing access to multimodal treatment options frequently results in an overrelianc e on medications, associated complications, decreased quality of life and, eventually unnecessa ry burdens on both the health care system and Families. Another complication is that the MHS care for Warriors is rooted in a military culture that praises selflessness, toughness, and a willingness to accept pain. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and their leadership. This attitude often results in delays in seeking treatment as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines attempt to work through their pain and \"tough it out.\" This frequently results in relatively minor acute issues becoming harder -to-manage chronic conditions. Additionally, the military faces complex pain management challenges d uring a time of war when the patient population is sustaining levels of physical and emotional trauma unparalleled in civili an medicine. Veterans Health Administration Pain Management Initi ative The Veterans Health Administration initiated a national pain strategy in 1998 in an effort to develop a system- wide approach to pain management, with an ultimate goal of reducing suffering among Veterans with acute a nd chronic pain. The strategy aimed to establish consistent pain management understanding and expectations among the patients, providers, and support staff in a medical system that cares for more than 5.8 Million patients in 153 Medical Centers, 134 Community Living Centers (NH Care), 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 783 Community Based Outpatient Clinics across the U.S. \"Pain as the 5th Vital Sign\" was promoted in all inpatient and outpatient clinical settings in order to ensure consistency of pain assessments throughout the VHA. One of the elements the plan addressed was the complexity of chronic pain management, which is often beyond the expertise of a single practitioner, especially for patients whose pain problems are com plicated by PTSD, combat injuries, and substance abuse. Primary care providers' ability to effectively de al with pain management challenges requires additional education and access to resources, such as pain medicine speci alists and behavioral specialists, as well as interdisciplinary pain clinics in order to effectivel y evaluate and manage these complex patients. The VHA pain management strategy was strengthened in October 2009 with the publication of VHA Directiv e 2009-053 for Pain Management (Appendix B-9). This directive provides policy and implementation procedures for the improvement of pain management consistent with the VHA National Pain Management Strategy and in compliance with generally accepted pain management standards of care. It also defined the \"Stepped Care\" model for pain management. This model serves as the framework for developing organizational capabilities that support tim ely access to providers, treatment modalities, and specialty referrals commensurate with patient pain management needs. Stepped Care balances a focus on managing pain as early as possible in a primary care setting while pro viding access to pain medicine specialty consultation, and interdisciplinary and multimodal pain managem ent resources when required. It also emphasizes optimal pain control, improved function, and increased quality of life. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and their leadership and this frequently results in relatively minor acute issues becoming harder-to-manage chronic conditions TFFinalTFFinalPAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 10 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Patients and Families are encouraged to be active participants in their pain management plans of ca re. Lastly, the national strategy promotes standardized education and training of medical staff appropriate to their clin ical settings and role. Pain Care Legislation Section 711 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10 NDAA) tasked the Secr etary of Defense to develop and implement a comprehensive policy on pain management by the MHS, no later than March 31, 2011. This policy will cover: 1. The management of acute and chronic pain. 2. The standard of care for pain management to be used throughout the Department of Defense. 3. The consistent application of pain assessments throughout the Department of Defense. 4. The assurance of prompt and appropriate pain care treatment and management by the Department when medically necessary. 5. Programs of research related to acute and chronic pain, including pain attributable to central and peri pheral nervous system damage characteristic of injuries incurred in modern warfare, brain in juries, and chronic migraine headache. 6. Programs of pain care education and training for health care personnel of the Department of Defense. 7. Programs of patient education for Members suffering from acute or chronic pain and their Families. The Secretary of Defense was also directed to revise the policy on a periodic basis in accordance wit h experience and evolving best practice guidelines. Not later than 180 days after the implementation date of the policy and on October 1 each year thereafter through 2018, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Serv ices of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report on the policy that will include: 1. A description of the policy implemented, and any revisions to such policy. 2. A description of the performance measures used to determine the effectiveness of the policy in improv ing pain care for Beneficiaries enrolled in the military health care system. 3. An assessment of the adequacy of Department pain management services based on a current survey of patients managed in Department clinics. 4. An assessment of the research projects of the Department relevant to the treatment of the types of acute and chronic pain suffered by Members of the Armed Forces and their Families. 5. An assessment of the training provided to Department health care personnel with respect to the diagnosi s, treatment, and management of acute and chronic pain. 6. An assessment of the pain care education programs of the Department of Defense. 7. An assessment of the dissemination of information on pain management to Beneficiaries enrolled in the mi litary health care system. The Pain Task Force was nearly half-way into its evaluation of pain management in the MED COM, MHS, and VHA when this legislation was signed in October 2009. At that time, a comparison between the NDAA language and the Task Force's charter, ongoing analysis, and the pain management strategy under development validate d the current direction of the Task Force. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 11IV. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1 Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encou rage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management One of the major observations realized during the Pain Task Force site visits was a general feeling am ong medical providers that they were ill-prepared to manage the full continuum of pain management responsibilities for the ir patients. With the exception of those with advanced training in pain management, providers almost univers ally communicated that they did not have the necessary training, time, support staff, modalities, or avail able consultative services in their \"pain toolkit\". Pain care tools, clinical orientation, and capabilitie s varied greatly between MTFs, even those with a similar size and mission. There was also significant variation in the orienta tion, documentation, and understanding of pain management responsibilities within individual MTFs. It was difficult to find consistency in either the MTF capabilities or the expectations of their clinical staffs. Although most primary care providers felt they could adequately provide pain care for their ac ute pain patients, most would qualify this statement by adding that the available modalities were largely limited to medic ation and possibly Physical Therapy (PT). MTFs with pain management specialty care are frequently only able to provide that care to small segments of the facilities' patients, many times for Warriors in Transition (WT) or Ac tive Duty only. Patients unable to access specialty care at the MTFs are referred to network care of varying perceived quality and value. It is clear that any first step in improving pain care should consist of developing a system of tools and capabilities for provider \"toolkits.\" Developing and deploying a uniform approach to pain care that includes common ta xonomy, tools, technologies, medical capabilities, and data collection across DoD and VHA will have w ide appeal and the potential to make significant improvements in the practice of pain medicine. The tools, education and pai n structure will create a common language, standardize measurement of pain, and facilitate enhanced data collec tion, treatment outcomes reporting and analysis. After establishing each Service and MTF baseline, the pain management infrastructure and tools must be integr ated into the medical practice, pain care must be optimized across the continuum, and a valid and strategi cally informed research agenda must be developed and resourced. The MHS should build on lessons learned from the VHA pain initiative. Finally, initial priorities should focus on Wounded Warriors and their Fam ilies by ensuring that future pilot projects target areas with large WT and Veteran populations. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 12 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Standards and System Improvements Figure 3: A Summary of Categories for Standards and System Improvements Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and E ncourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management Standards and System ImprovementsxStandardized Pain Taxonomy xStandardized Pain Assessment Tool xPain Management Survey Role Pain Management xStandardized Credentialing xProductivity Measures xDoD Joint 4.1.1 Standardized Pain Taxonomy Objective: Establish common pain taxonomy across the DoD and VHA. The Joint Commission's 2001 pain management standards state that every patient has a right to have their pain assessed and treated (Joint Commission Web site). Any effective pain assessment is predicate d on a clinician's understanding of \"pain\" and pain-related terms, yet there is no standardized DoD, much less DoD and V HA, pain taxonomy to use as a foundation for this assessment. Even among clinical experts in the field of pain medic ine, it is challenging to come to a consensus on the exact definition of pain, let alone the many subsets and types of pai n. A common pain vocabulary is fundamental to the creation and proliferation of a common understanding and approach to pain management among providers and patients throughout DoD and VHA. Figure 4: Fundamental Pain Words PainPain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is always subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute PainAcute pain is a normal physiologic response, usually time-limited, to a noxious stimulus t hat enhances survival by warning the individual of impending or potential injury or progressio n of disease. If the noxious stimulus persists, changes in the peripheral tissues and both the central and peripheral nervous systems can lead to sensitization that worsens and prolongs the pain from noxious stimulation. Appropriate management of acute pain may prevent the onset of the pathophysiologic processes that change the spinal cord and brain and lead to chronic pain. Chronic PainChronic pain continues beyond the normal time expected for healing and is associated with the onset of pathophysiologic changes in the central nervous system that may adversely affect an individual's emotional and physical well-being, cognition, level of function, and quality of life. Chronic pain serves no apparent useful purpose for the individual and may be diagnostically and therapeutically approached as a chronic disease process. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 13The military and VHA deliver care around the world to a population of providers and patients that is constantl y on the move. Standardization across the DoD and VHA is necessary to ensure continuity of care across the continuum , as well as a common understanding and framework for providers and patients. Standardization allows for impro ved Provider-Provider and Patient-Provider communication, better interpretation and implementati on of practice guidelines, and higher quality of data. As an example, the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Task Force developed a list of DoD and VH A TBI related terms and definitions. This proved to be a key step for further development of DoD and VHA benefits, care coordination, and transition between the variety of DoD and VHA health care settings, from in-theater to stateside. Furthermore, i t helped establish and synchronize a uniform language for TBI-related research coming from bo th the DoD and VHA. A common pain taxonomy must be defined and integrated into the organization. The TF reached consensus on a list of definitions, including three fundamental words - pain, acute pain, and chronic pain - in the pain taxonomy. These definitions were developed using accepted resources (International Association for the Study of Pain - IASP) and are recommended for integration into MHS policies and regulations. The entire list of pain taxonomy is included in Appendix B-1. The list should be distributed to all DoD and VHA health care sites, posted internally, and made available to providers and patients online. A readily ava ilable list of standardized pain terms will not only enhance user satisfaction but also promote uniformity when disc ussing pain care throughout the DoD and VHA. Recommendation 4.1.1.1 Establish a uniform understanding and use of key pa in-related terms in the vocabulary of the DoD and V HA health care systems. Recommendation 4.1.1.2 Identify a process to Review, Revise, and Approve D oD and VHA definitions for pain, acute pain, and ch ronic pain. Recommendation 4.1.1.3 Integrate DoD and VHA definitions for pain, acute p ain, and chronic pain into existing training, polic ies and regulations, and standards throughout DoD and VHA. 4.1.2 Standardized Pain Assessment Tool Objective: Describe a common language DoD and VHA pai n assessment tool with visual cues and a common set of measurement questio ns. The most commonly used tool to measure pain in both civilian and military medicine settings is an 11-point, 0-10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS). During site visits, the TF received a great deal of negative feedback rega rding the use and perceived value of the VAS Pain Scale. A majority of the doctors, nurses, physical therapists, medi cs and other clinicians who were interviewed reported similar negative feelings about the VAS Pain Sc ale, including: xThe VAS Pain Scale is inconsistently administered. xThe VAS Pain Scale is regarded as very subjective and had no functional anchors. xThe VAS Pain Scale assessments recorded in patient medical records are considered to ha ve little value by clinicians at all levels. These findings were of great concern to the Task Force. In the MEDCOM alone, there are approximately 42 ,000 outpatient visits per day, the majority of which include a pain assessment (Army Medicine Web si te). These pain TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 14 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE assessments are subsequently recorded in the patients' medical records. TF findings indicate that because of the noted VAS Pain Scale failings, this information is of little value and represents a missed opportunity to capture useful, consistent, and actionable information about a patient's pain. When factoring in the impact of these shortcomings across the rest of DoD, the imperative to improve and standardize this pain assessment is clear. The Pain Task Force determined that a new DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool was needed to obtain actio nable information at every patient encounter across the MHS. The new Pain Assessment Tool must be : 1. Validated: A. Able to measure pain intensity, mood, stress, biopsychosocial impact, and functional impact; 2. Objective and useful in evaluating treatment effectiveness: A. Practical and adaptable to multiple clinical settings and scenarios throughout the continuu m of care (e.g. battlefield, transport, combat support hospital, primary care, medical center, pain medicine s pecialty services); B. Easily adapted and integrated into DoD and VHA computer medical databases; C. Standardized into all levels of medical training across all roles of care (e.g. useful for t he medic, the ward nurse, the primary care provider, the pain researcher, and the pain management specialist); and 3. Consistent with current validated pain research tools. Using these attributes as a guide and pairing them with the best available pain scale research, the Task Force selected references and expert opinion, to develop a new Pain Assessment Tool for testing and refinem ent with the goal of achieving its widespread use in the DoD and VHA (Appendix B-2). Figure 5: Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale In the MEDCOM alone, there are approximately 42,000 outpatient visits per day, the majority of which include a pain assessment FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 15This new tool combines the validated 11-point pain scale used by clinical researchers wi th a simple green, yellow, and red scale suitable for combat medical conditions. Furthermore, this tool anchors each numeral on the 11-point scale with standardized ' experiential' and ' functional' language, greatly enhancing clarity for both patients and providers when discussing pain levels and treatment effectiveness throughout the care continuum . The new Pain Assessment Tool requires additional resources, including: xLinguistic and graphic support; xAHLTA / VISTA / Essentris integration: - Enterprise-wide patient and provider re-education efforts in both DoD and VHA, - DoD and VHA multicenter research study to validate the tool (see Appendix B-2), - Establish metrics for training success and practice that are evaluated annually, driven by researc h from a central pain management advisory board, and used to update and continuously improve the Pain Assessment Tool. The tool also includes four supplemental questions for clinicians at all levels to evaluate the bi opsychosocial impact of pain. Questions include the impact of pain on general activity, mood, level of stress and sleep. Thes e supplemental questions, when combined with the functionally anchored 11-point scale, will provid e a potentially powerful clinical tool in evaluating a patient's pain, considering treatment goals, and establishi ng the most appropriate treatment plan. Figure 6: Defense and Veterans Pain Supplemental Questions The impact of this tool on patient care is likely to be very significant. By approving, val idating, and implementing this tool, the DoD and VHA health care systems should improve both the quality and quantity of objective pain data in what is currently considered to be a mostly subjective and difficult to interpret part of medicine. Thi s tool will impact every aspect of clinical medicine and increase the quality and consistency of pain evaluati on and outcomes TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 16 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE measurement. The reduction in variability of pain evaluations should greatly enhance patient care and exc eed the spirit and intent of the Joint Commission's 2001 pain standard. The current lack of standardized pain assessments, pain data collection, and pain coding throughout DoD and VH A adversely impacts pain management along the entire care continuum and impedes the effort of military, VH A and civilian research to identify the most effective pain management strategies. As a result, DoD still does not possess large databases that would enable medicine, through large prospective blinded clinical trial s, to test the effectiveness of many of the pain medicine interventions used routinely today, particularly the effectiveness of combine d treatments. Without actionable data, it is more difficult to determine best practices or the most effective treatments for reducing specific types of acute and chronic pain. Any movement toward a common DoD and VHA pain strate gy should begin with a common pain assessment and the eventual development of a de-identified data registr y. Recommendation 4.1.2.1 Review and approve the new DoD and VHA common Pain Assessment Tool validation plan. Recommendation 4.1.2.2 Validate Pain Assessment Tool in DoD and VHA facili ties. Recommendation 4.1.2.3 Integrate the Pain Assessment Tool, upon validation , into training, clinical practice, and data collec tion of pain management in DoD and VHA. 4.1.3 Pain Management Survey Objective: Establish a common baseline of pain care capabilities across DoD and VHA by creating a modified version of the 2009 VHA Pain Management Survey to distribute to all DoD MTFs. It is very difficult to make accurate comparisons between MEDCOM MTF pain management capab ilities. The MTF data call survey conducted by the Task Force at the start of its evaluation indicated that there was no common baseline for understanding pain management concepts, approaches, and capabilities. It is even more co mplicated to attempt to compare MTFs across DoD, and another level of complexity is added when making comp arisons with the VHA. Collaborating on future pain management priorities and initiatives will require commo n assessments of pain management capabilities. The VHA administered a pain management capability survey to 100% of its MTFs in 2009. The creation of a modified version of this survey for DoD facilities would leverage the data already collected by the VHA and standardize measurement across the DoD and VHA continuum, enabling the identification of best practi ces across care settings and identifying future research topics. Representatives from each of the Services reviewed the VHA survey and assisted with revision s to make it more applicable to DoD, replacing VHA-specific data elements with DoD data elements. Each Service repres entative will be provided the opportunity to include Service-specific questions. This approach will help identify common capabilities across DoD and VHA and assist with the measurement of progress when implementing pain management strategies. Task Force-recommended definitions should be incorporated into the sur vey to ensure its future validity following implementation of TF recommendations on standardizing DoD and VHA orientati on to pain. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 17Recommendation 4.1.3.1 Administer a modified VHA pain survey across DoD MT Fs to establish a baseline of pain care capabilitie s. Recommendation 4.1.3.2 Continue to periodically administer the survey to t rack improvements at DoD MTFs to ensure a standardi zed measurement of pain longitudinally and across organ izations. 4.1.4 Nursing Role in Pain Management Objective: Evaluate the utilization, potential roles , and certification requirements for Nurses in the DoD pain management strategy. The American Nursing Association defines Nursing as : \"The protection, promotion, and optimization of hea lth and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, allevi ation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatm ent of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations.\" Nurses comprise the largest health care profession a nd have been the traditional bearers of the patient advocacy torch. Pain is the most frequently used nursing diagnosis in all delivery of care models, and the a ssessment and management of pain is significant to every professional registered nur se. Their unique qualifications and relationships with patients make nurses an essentia l component of any pain management strategy. Nurses provide hospitals and patients with a capable, professional workforce adept at measuring, monitoring, evaluati ng, and documenting pain interventions and outcomes. Nursing staff interviewed during TF site visits inc luded Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Advanced Practice Nurses, and Nursin g Assistants. Their responses to the interview que stions paralleled those from other health care professional s. The most common observation made by nurses conc erned their inability to identify any rationale behind th e variability in pain management practices among pro viders. Nurses are most often the ones responsible for assessing pain, administering pain medications, and communicating p ain management issues to a patient's provider. They fr equently expressed an inability to understand the u nderlying principles that would explain the lack of a standar dized approach to pain care amongst providers. Ther e were similar percentages of nurses concerned about the over- and under- medication of patients. Pain is only one of many areas where the use of Nurs ing Case Management would be very appropriate and b eneficial. Warrior Transition Unit (WTU) case managers have de monstrated their value in locations with integrated pain management teams. The Task Force recommendation to adapt a disease management approach to pain care wi ll require a corresponding assessment of the impact on nursing education, staffing, and utilization. As with other advanced-practice nursing specialties, the scope of practice may be broadened to provide a wider appro ach to optimal care and outcomes in pain management, with increasin g levels of education, certification, and licensure . The MHS executes its health care mission with a comb ination of military and civilian nursing profession als, and they are present in virtually every patient care setting . A revision for the utilization of advanced-pract ice pain nurses, Clinical Nurse Specialists, Nurse Practitioners and in some cases, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthet ists needs to be part of the DoD pain management strategy. The TF m embers concurred with the need to refer this issue to the Senior Nursing Executives in DoD and VHA for comments and recommendations on the expanded and redefined roles and utilization of nurses in pain management across the health care continuum. Additionally, these recomm endations should be referred to the DoD multidisciplinary adv isory board for evaluation and integration into the DoD pain management strategy.Pain is the most frequently used nursing diagnosis in all delivery of care models TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.1.4.1 Request that the Federal Nurse Advisory Board evalu ate the impact of certified pain nurses on patient outcomes and satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.4.2 Request that the DoD and VHA Nurse Executives evalu ate the role of certified pain nurses in patient ca re delivery (military and civilian). Recommendation 4.1.4.3 Determine the future role and potential use of cert ified pain nurses across the care continuum. Recommendation 4.1.4.4 Build the population of certified pain advanced-pra ctice nurses (graduate education, board certificati on, short courses, and career field designation) to maximize the value and utilization of their critical skill s ets. Recommendation 4.1.4.5 Integrate approved TF recommendations into Core Nurs ing Competencies, Clinical Transition Program (CTP) , and other Nursing training programs. Recommendation 4.1.4.6 Utilize the DoD multidisciplinary pain management a dvisory board to evaluate and integrate recommendat ions from the Federal Nurse Advisory Board into the DoD pain management strategy. 4.1.5 Standardized Credentialing Objective: Establish a process to standardize a Milit ary Health System credentialing process for pain medicine. The Task Force found that minimum training, certifi cation, and skill requirements for providers delive ring procedural pain care were not consistent between MTFs or across hea lth care professions. Examples of procedural pain ca re include, but are not limited to, fluoroscopically-guided epidura l steroid injections, fluoroscopically-guided invas ive treatments of spinal arthritis, spinal manipulation, and acupuncture. T he expansion of treatment modalities, to include in tegrative medicine approaches to pain management, necessitate an MHS-wi de process for standardizing the credentialing for these modalities. Establishing MHS-wide credentialing gu idance for these treatment modalities and providers would provide a uniform standard of quality across the MHS and elim inate the burden on local commands to develop these credentialing standards. A credentialing document that features a three-tier ed certification scheme is currently used in creden tialing some physicians to match training and skill levels to th e complexity and risk of approved procedures. This document or a system with similar detail should be used for all professi onals offering procedural pain care, including physi cians not currently credentialed under the tiered document. Training a nd skill of providers should be confirmed or measur ed. Examples of measurement would include documented co mpletion of an approved fellowship, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) board certification, or experie nce and skill as confirmed by observation of a provider credentialed at that level or higher. Sta ndards regarding minimum training, certification, s kill requirements, and scope of practice for providers delivering procedur al pain care should be consistent across the MHS and developed with assistance from both the physician and non-physicia n Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for these areas, us ually the Consultants to the Uniformed Service Surgeons Gener al. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 19Support for the TF recommendations regarding expand ed availability of multimodal and interdisciplinary pain care will require additional credentialing by MHS facilities. Standards need to be developed in order to ensure the growing number of acupuncturists, massage therapists, and other integrative medicine practitioners are safe, effectiv e, and qualified to practice in hospitals and clinics. It is impractical to place the burden on individual commands to develop credentialing criteria for this exp anding number of integrative medicine practitioners and procedures. The MHS needs to develop standards for credentialing integrative medicine providers and procedures for use at local MTFs. This standardization would support the recommendations to decrease variation between MTFs and Services. Recommendation 4.1.5.1 Use specialty consultants to determine procedures t o standardize MHS pain credentialing. Recommendation 4.1.5.2 Standardize minimum training, certification, skill requirements, and scope of practice requirements fo r providers delivering procedural pain care across MHS. Develo p requirements with assistance from both physician and non- physician subject matter experts. Recommendation 4.1.5.3 Consolidate specialty consultant recommendations in to standard credentialing documents and approve DoD - wide. 4.1.6 Productivity Measures Objective: Reexamine the use of productivity measure s (Relative Value Units) in evaluating primary care. A common contention among clinicians in the MHS is the perceived \"disconnect\" between what they are as ked to do and how they are assessed on performance. Clinicia ns feel process-oriented measures of their \"product ivity\" are not compatible with the highest quality of patient care espoused by leadership. In fact, the resource-base d Relative Value Unit (RVU) is a reimbursement tool that does not co nsider outcomes. Clinicians are convinced that thi s process-based approach to productivity measurement is a barrier t o the integrated, multimodal, interdisciplinary mod els that will yield the best outcomes in complex chronic diseases, such as chronic pain. The barrier to quality presented by RVU-based produ ctivity metrics is most visible in the primary care setting. RVU metrics r eward high throughput of acute minor illnesses but punish the holistic appro ach needed to sort out the complex and nuanced needs of chronic disease patien ts, particularly chronic pain patients with biopsychosocial complexity, inclu ding comorbidities. The critical outcomes of quality chronic pain management - return to work; improved quality of life; satisfaction with care; d ecreased Emergency Room visits; decreased unschedul ed admissions; decreased medication misuse, abuse, and diversion; decreased adverse domestic issues - pla y no role in assessing the quality and effectiveness of the MHS primary care practice. Moreover, an integrated tea m approach to chronic disease management in primary care that inc ludes appropriately trained nurse case managers, be havioral health providers, and clinical pharmacologists gene rally fails to generate the RVUs necessary to justi fy their use of resources. For example, a group of clinicians acti ng as part of an integrated care team to evaluate a patient's treatment plan can only claim workload credit for o ne of the team members. This is a huge disincentiv e to providing integrated patient care.A common contention among clinicians in the MHS is the perceived \"disconnect\" between what they are asked to do and how they are assessed on performance TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 20 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Another area of RVU 'disconnect' is in pain medicine specialty practice. Selective integrated biopsysc hosocial rehabilitation, which has a comparatively strong ev idence basis in terms of outcomes effectiveness amo ngst all treatments for chronic pain, is given little value, where as interventional procedures are accorded ve ry high RVUs. Thus, pain medicine specialists and institutions are incentivized (consciously or unconsciously) to per form procedures while indirectly discouraged from using other effec tive clinical modalities. This will likely not cha nge unless a greater emphasis is placed on outcomes. One approach to fixing this issue is to de-emphasiz e the role of RVUs in favor of adopting outcomes-ba sed metrics in assessing a clinical practice. Forward thinking co mmands within the MHS have already suspended the us e of the RVU metric of productivity while transitioning to a patient-centered medical home model of delivering health care. Evidence-based models can be used to resource primar y care practices and drive delivery of safe, integr ated coordinated care to yield the best patient-oriented clinical outcomes. The TF believes a patient-centric, outcome-based me asure of productivity can decrease resource utilizat ion and improve patient and provider satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.6.1 Establish patient-centric clinical outcome measures of productivity. Recommendation 4.1.6.2 Modify the Relative Value Units metric to include a patient-centric outcome standard. 4.1.7 DoD and VHA Pain Care Standardization Objective: Develop a patient-centric approach to rec overy, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and pain control, with greater attention to opioid control and minimizing abuse. Enhancing standardization of pain care between the DoD and VHA has the potential to revolutionize the way patients perceive and receive their health care. Pain permeates every discipline of medical care an d is a complaint of many patients. There is currently a lack of coordination between DoD and VHA pain services at both the i npatient and outpatient levels of care. Better institutional patient coordination may lead to decreased medication us e (particularly opioids) and transition to an effective pain treatment plan. The majority (>52%) of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Service Members report experiencing a myriad of pain symptoms as they move between the DoD and VHA or retire into the VHA system for care (Office of Public Health and Envi ronmental Hazards, 2010) Presently there is no mechanism to communicate patient pain issues throughout the care continuum. An e lectronic pain record of care is essential to provide DoD and VHA providers with a common communi cation tool that would assist physicians in the care of patients during the transition from the DoD system into the VHA health car e system. One possible solution in development is the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking S ystem (JRAATS - see section 4.1.15). The JRAATS electronic pain record would provide DoD and VHA clinici ans with a detailed pain management history of the patient while that patient was under the Federal health care system. This database would also provide a powerful tool to evaluate treatment trends and outcome measures. One example of the existing disconnect involves DoD patients who have had to discontinue an effective regim en of acute regional anesthesia to maintain pain control prior to air evacuation to a VHA site. Ins tead of continuing the proven and effective treatment method, patients are often forced to rely on \"as needed\" IV morphine or short-acting oral opioids for the flight. It is difficult to gauge the onset of pain and the need for these medications during trans fer. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 21Most patients end up taking higher doses of opioids than they need, when greater benefit would have been derived from continuing their peripheral pain catheters of local anesthetic. Similarly, patients transitioning from one inpatient facility to another may be forced to change their or al medications because the new facility does not have the same medications available on formulary. This may cause an unnecessary wait time, resulting in an undue spike in pain. Then the patient must adapt to a different pain medication, resulting in pain, potential complications, and new side effects throughout the transiti on. Finally, individuals transitioning from the outpatient DoD facility to the outpatient VHA upon retirem ent may have to wait for an examination prior to obtaining refills at the VHA. Once again, justification for a medication that is not on the VHA formulary may be required and the patient may experience unnecessary wait times, resulting in undue pain. Differences in DoD and VHA formularies and pain management capabilities make the transition of these pati ents especially difficult from a pain perspective. Better discharge planning and care coordination would opt imize the adjustment of pain medication regimens and outpatient recovery. An individual who has been medically retired from DoD may face special challenges, including inconsistencies in follow-ups, pain care coordination, management, transition, and prescription renewals. Standardizing pain care between the DoD and VHA will require project management along with policy and pr ocess decisions coordinated through a central pain management advisory board, and must address: xCoordinated discharge pain care planning for those patients with documented pain management issues, those with polypharmacy combinations requiring pharmacist consultation, and those identified as \"at r isk.\" This is necessary for inpatient-to-inpatient transfers, inpatient-to-outpatient discharges, and outpatient-to- outpatient transfers. This will require case managers and better provider-to-provider communicat ion. xEstablishing DoD and VHA joint formularies to maintain effective treatment plans during transitions to a new facility. xEnsuring availability of successful therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy, behavior al health, medication, regional anesthesia) at the new facility. xDeveloping acute pain service capabilities at the Polytrauma VHA sites. This ensures that patients with effective regional pain control are able to air evacuate with their pain under control, enabling earlier trans fers with significantly less patient anxiety. xEstablishing a pain medications transition policy for individuals on pain medications tran sitioning from Active Duty to Retired. By implementing a standardized line of pain care for the DoD and VHA, patient rehabilitation, recover y, satisfaction, and pain control will likely be enhanced. Improved care standardization will lead to better opioid control and will minimize abuse. Improved care standardization will also lead to higher provider satisfaction. Pilot projects should be established at DoD and VA facilities that share a high flow of Active Duty and Retirees, such as Tampa or Richmond and Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), or Palo Alto and Balboa. An outstanding example of policy changing to meet Warrior needs has already been developed. As a result of inadequate pain control during transfers, patients transitioning from inpatient DoD sites on the east coa st to the Palo Alto VA Medical Center on the west coast now air evacuate through Travis Air Force Base. Based on pati ent and Family complaints about poor pain control throughout the transfer, and the difficulty regaining pain control upon arrival to the VHA, the patients are now required to spend the night at Travis AFB to regain and maintain pain contr ol. These transfers are now coordinated via video teleconferences, phone calls, and emails. Since the ch ange in policy, there have not been any serious complaints about pain care or management during transfer. FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 22 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.1.7.1 Establish a uniform DoD and VHA formulary. Recommendation 4.1.7.2 Integrate specific pain management \"at risk\" criter ia into existing discharge planning coordination fo r transitioning patients. Recommendation 4.1.7.3 Establish similar pain care capabilities at DoD and VHA sites of similar size. Recommendation 4.1.7.4 Conduct pain management pilots to measure improveme nts in transfers. 4.1.8 DoD and VHA Joint Formulary Objective: Establish a joint formulary to facilitate smoother transitions and minimize pain throughout the continuum of care. One specific area of standardization between the Do D and VHA is the formulary. About 90-95% of pain me dications are formulary to both the military and VHA. Pain manag ement issues arise with restricted drugs and those w ith criteria for approval. When pain regimens are properly titrated to the patient's satisfaction, the outcome is optim al. Sub-optimal care occurs when the regimens are changed and providers a nd systems do not communicate and coordinate, resul ting in increased pain, dissatisfaction, poor continuity of care, increased opportunity for drug diversion, mi suse or abuse, increased patient safety risk, and excessive costs. Both the VHA and the DoD have formulary decision-ma king committees. They operate independently of eac h other and sometimes drugs approved for DoD will not be found on the VHA formulary for continued therapy. Both d ecision-making committees may have drugs in non-formulary status w ith criteria that must be approved prior to a patie nt receiving the drug. The problem has been that the criteria for approval was different in each system, which resulted in a Service Member who was already approved for the drug in the DoD system having a delay in continuing the drug in the VHA s ystem because a subsequent approval in the VHA system was required. Formulary findings identified during site visits: xService Members incurred at least a 2-3 month wait time between leaving the military and their first appointment within the VA medical system. As a res ult, Service Members and Veterans may run out of the ir maintenance pain medications. Military MTFs do not have consistent medication discharge planning practices nor do they communicate with VHA liaisons to create care transition plans. xService Members stabilized on pain medications withi n the military MTFs sometimes have their pain regime n changed due to formulary inconsistencies between th e VHA and the military. The VHA has criteria for u se of medications through the \"medical necessity\" or \"prior authorization\" approval requirement within the MTF system and are transferr ed to the VHA system are required to re-submit paperwork for the approval of the same drug or drug s (e.g., duloxetine and pregabalin). xService Members admitted to the VA Polytrauma Cente rs are discharged on pain medications that are non- formulary under the Uniform Formulary system. A Me dical Necessity Form requesting continuation of the medication can be submitted to the MHS, but there a re inconsistencies among MTFs. Service Members have had their pain regimen changed to conform to th e formulary agent(s) available, medical necessity aside. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 23xService Members have been transferred from military MTFs to VA medical centers on epidurals, PCAs or pain balls and have been unable to continue their pa in regimen because of a lack of medications, staff education on the devices, and equipment. xThe lack of uniformity in pain practice exists throu ghout the DoD health care system and into the VHA. Pain plans established at one facility are often changed for no other reason than lack of familiarity with the pain medication or technology used at the transfer facil ity, resulting in unnecessary patient discomfort. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of a clear understanding of who is responsible for managing pain at each nod e of care. For example, it is very common for continuou s peripheral nerve block catheters to be removed du ring evacuation because providers at the next treatment node are either unfamiliar with the technology or d o not have personnel responsible for pain management. There are several groups coordinating on DoD and VH A joint formulary issues: xPain Management Task Force xDoD Pharmacoeconomic Center xDoD Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee xDefense and Veterans Pain Management Institute (DVPM I) xHealthcare Executive Committee (HEC) Pharmacy Workgr oup xVHA and DoD Chronic Opioid Therapy Clinical Practice Guidelines Panel xVA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) xVA Medical Advisory Panel (VA MAP) xVA National Formulary (VANF) The TRICARE system allows Service Members with prio r authorization or medical necessity approval to co ntinue their pharmacy care wherever they go, in any of the three points of service - MTF, retail or mail order - en abling continuity of care. When patients transfer to the VA system, VA policy that stable pain regimens for military members should not be changed unless medically necessary. Recommendation 4.1.8.1 Standardize pharmacy benefits between DoD and VHA, and make them reciprocal, without delay or challeng e. Recommendation 4.1.8.2 Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prescripti ons renewals process for Service Members transition ing to VHA care. Recommendation 4.1.8.3 Establish a common DoD and VHA policy to support st ate of the art and science practices, such as the u se of non-narcotic pain balls, PCA pumps, and epidurals, with associated common education content.

There is a lack of data within the United States health care system concerning the appropriateness and effec tiveness of many pain management procedures and techniques. Additionally, the exceedingly complex nature of the pain disease process requires pain medicine providers to delve into all the biopsychosocial a spects of a patient's pain issues. This can be remarkably difficult in the limited time allotted for provider and patient inter action that is characteristic of modern medicine. The lack of a DoD and VHA pain data screening and outcomes repository causes difficulty in maki ng responsible decisions on the myriad of possible treatment modalities. This lack of pain data makes counseling patients on pain procedure efficacy a challenge. It also presents barriers to greater patient involvement in decisions about care, makes longitudinal comparison of changes in pain difficult, and may limit availability of opti onal pain management techniques and medications. This situation inhibits DoD and VHA pain specialists fr om providing outcomes- and evidence-based clinical pain medicine solutions to Warriors and Families. At i ts core, the lack of a shared interagency pain data repository impacts patient safety and pain care quality, and contributes to variab ility throughout the care continuum. The Task Force has determined that the DoD and VHA health care systems require a Pain Assessment Scr eening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) clinical information and data system. This informati on technology solution will gather information from patients and provide summaries for providers, leaders, and researche rs to use for decision support. This information will be vital in minimizing clinical variation in pain care delivery among providers and medical treatment facilities. The University of Washington (UW) health care system has developed a computer-based patient pain information and diagnostic system called \"My Pain Profile\" (MPP). The UW computer system guides pain patients through a series of questions concerning patient demographics, pain characteristics, medication use, substanc e abuse, and other pain variables. Information is provided by the patient prior to the clinical visit and is summari zed for the TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 25provider in a computerized form. Efficient for both patient and provider, the system generates information that can assist the provider in enhancing care by providing indicators of real or potential pain-rel ated health problems. Traditionally, this level of patient information could only be obtained after a long series of clinical visits using inefficient paper-based surveys. MPP has also provided UW a unique tool for outcomes assessment, resear ch, and program self-assessment. The UW solution will be one system that guides the development of the DoD and V HA PASTOR system. PASTOR will incorporate military-specific demographic and diagnostic inform ation to enhance the value of the information for Warrior and Beneficiary pain issues. The PASTOR system will also integrate with other Task Force recommendations, such as the DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool, Pain Centers of Excellence, and the establishment of a central pain management advisory board. Additional resource requirements: xA computer-based system that facilitates self-reported patient data entry from both the clinic and the patient's home using the Internet. xFull integration with the Medical Home concept of care. xFull-time IT personnel and equipment support. xFull integration with existing and future DoD and VHA medical information systems (within a year, or an interim standalone system will be adopted). xA central pain management advisory board to define and develop PASTOR content and maintain data repository. xLarge educational component for use by primary care providers and pain specialists throughout the DoD and VHA health care systems. The DoD and VHA PASTOR will serve as the primary source and an international model for outcomes-dri ven pain research and resource allocation decision support. PASTOR will collect and provide the necessar y data for determining best pain practices, determining DoD and VHA pain care standards, and enhancing patient pain care. The opportunities for population-based research on pain treatments and safety-related issues are enormous an d hold great potential for improving pain medicine. Recommendation 4.1.9.1 Jointly fund the development of a Pain Assessment S creening Tool and Outcome Registry under the direct ion of a central pain management advisory board. Recommendation 4.1.9.2 Integrate and mandate a Pain Assessment Screening T ool and Outcome Registry with DoD and VHA IT system s. Recommendation 4.1.9.3 Implement and mandate a Pain Assessment Screening T ool and Outcome Registry across DoD and VHA. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 26 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 4.1.10 Battlefield Pain Care Continuum Objective: Incorporate scientific advances in battle field surgery and medical technology to improve the delivery of pain care acr oss the continuum. The TF did not conduct any interviews or site visits in Iraq or Afghanistan. The following findi ngs and recommendations were developed with assistance from TF members with recent deployment experienc e, as well as from interviews with returning providers and clinicians from the current theater of operation. While battlefield medicine has experienced significant advances and outcome improvements over the last 20 years, these have not always been accompanied by equivalent advances in battlefield pain management. The variation in practice and capabilities that is evident in the care provided in MTFs is mirrored, to some extent, on the battlefield. Many Warriors do not receive the most advanced pain care due to a lack of equipment and inadequate provider training in pain management. There is no \"Theater Pain Management Practice Guideline,\" resulting in an overreliance on opioid-based pain solutions, from point of injury throughout the care continuum. This em phasis on opioid pain therapy at all levels has likely factored into the improper use of these medications among W ounded Warriors. Military medicine prides itself on investing in the prevention and treatment of many combat injuries, as well as disease and non-battle injury conditions. The recent increase in the number of behavioral health provi ders deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was planned after an assessment by senior leadership indicated that behavioral health issues on the battlefield were better handled by specialty providers further forward. Simi larly, pain should be recognized as a disease process that, if poorly managed, adversely impacts every aspect of a Warr ior's recovery and rehabilitation. Successful pain management on the battlefield demands a pain medicine champion far forward.

Recommendation 4.1.10.1 Adopt the Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Prac tice Guideline as policy for pain management. Recommendation 4.1.10.2 Establish acute pain medicine services across the c ontinuum of care, consisting of pain-trained provid ers who are responsible for pain consultation and management wi thin the MTF. Recommendation 4.1.10.3 Establish a DoD central pain management advisory bo ard as the battlefield pain management proponent an d consultant organization. 4.1.11 Tele Pain Objective: Expand telemedicine capabilities to incor porate pain management initiatives. Advanced pain management expertise is often limited on the battlefield and in remote MTFs. Patients being treated for chronic pain conditions often travel long distances to be seen, at a considerable expense. Man y pain follow-up visits do not necessarily require the physician and the patient to be in the same physical space to chec k on treatment plan progress, answer patient questions or concerns, and plan for future physician-patient interactions. Telecommunication technology is available and would enhance patient and health care provi der access to pain consultation regardless of geographic location. Pain consults can be performed by pain managem ent experts using video conferencing technology. With the establishment of Tele Pain clinics as part of Regional Pain Centers of Excellence (RPCoE - see section 4.4.4), distant sites within the TRICARE region would have r outine access to specialty pain consultation. Primary care physicians could conduct initial consultations without having to send the pati ent to the RPCoE, enhancing communication between primary care and pain specialists, increasing efficiency, and p otentially reducing the number of unnecessary or improper patient specialty visits. From a personnel perspective, Activ e Duty pain patients using this service will be absent from their mission for shorter periods of time and travel costs should be less for the command. Several VA hospitals have ongoing telemedicine initiatives to assist with the management of patients wi th chronic diseases. The VHA has been able to use technology to improve the remote management of patients with diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive lung disease. The VA Medical Center (V AMC) in Salisbury, North Carolina uses telemonitors to monitor patient blood pressures and oxygen levels. P atients are also able to communicate how they are feeling or if they are having problems with medication via an elec tronic device. Without the patient having to come into the hospital, Primary care and specialty providers are often able to adjust patient appointments, alter treatments, and communicate with the patients. This technology has great potential for the management of chronic pain or complex acute pain. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 28 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Additional resources would be required: xEstablish RPCoEs within each TRICARE region and Pain Departments at medical centers thr oughout the DoD. xCreate Tele Pain sites within the RPCoE and participating MTFs. xResolve issues from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). xLeadership commitment to develop new policies governing primary care support and produc tivity metrics xReallocate personnel and resources. xCommit information technology support and expand DoD Internet bandwidth infrastructure. xLeverage existing DoD and VHA telemedicine infrastructure to include pain management programs. This approach will likely improve pain consultant access, reduce physical patie nt clinic visits, reduce health care costs, and improve patient satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.11.1 Establish Tele Pain sites at Regional Pain Centers of Excellence and MTFs throughout DoD and VHA. Recommendation 4.1.11.2 Develop an enterprise strategic communications plan on the availability and benefits of telemedicine. Recommendation 4.1.11.3 Develop metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and c osts of providing enhanced telemedicine for pain me dicine. Recommendation 4.1.11.4 Develop new telemedicine technology applications fo r pain management uses. 4.1.12 Joint Theater Trauma Registry Objective: Add a Joint Theater Trauma Registry modul e to capture, define, and characterize Wounded Warrior pain issues throughout the care continuum, from the battlefield to MTFs. The Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR) is the primary military combat casualty car e data collection repository. Currently, the registry does not collect any information on casualty pain. After eight years of confl ict, this has been a tremendous missed opportunity to define and characterize Wounded Warrior pain issues throughout the care continuum. Theater-specific and longitudinal information would improve the understanding of the pain care needs of Wounded Warriors. It would enable the measurement of treatment effectiveness across facilities and settings, the de velopment of pain care policy, and the identification of pain care resource gaps, as well as offer the opportunity to establish pain research priorities. The new DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool will provide a unique way of defining a patient's pain in terms of function. Combined with the four supplemental questions on activity, mood, stress, and sleep, the P ain Assessment Tool will provide a powerful research and outcomes measurement tool when incorporated into the JTTR s ystem. Additional resource requirements: xInclusion of the 11-point DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool into the JTTR database. xA central pain management advisory board to be responsible for routine analysis and trend modeling. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 29This database will serve as the source for objective, population-based information on pain management outcom es and will guide pain management decision making and resource allocation for the battlefield and evac uation chain. The database will be important in evaluating the success of new pain medications, Task F orce recommendations, and technologies deployed far forward. Recommendation 4.1.12.1 Establish the Standardized Pain Assessment Tool as an integral part of the Joint Theater Trauma Regist ry database. Recommendation 4.1.12.2 Maintain routine analysis, management, and reportin g of pain data through a central pain management ad visory board. 4.1.13 Electronic Pain Order Set Objective: Develop an electronic pain order set to a ssist health care providers in selecting evidence-based, individually tailored pai n management plans. The majority of patient pain issues are handled by primary care providers. As discussed earlier , there is wide variability in health care provider pain management training based on the health care provider's specialty and experience, leading to variability in pain management. Because pain is not a main focus for the primary p hysician writing the orders, medications are often based on the physician's residency experience and not on the lates t evidenced-based pain recommendations. The DoD and VHA need to establish guidelines to assist health care providers in delivering a more consisten t approach to pain management for their patients. The guidelines should be integrated into the DoD and VHA medical information systems. Such guidelines are not intended to prevent or replace physician judgment in develop ing patient pain orders, but rather to influence provider practice patterns with DoD- and VHA-wide guidance based on best current evidence on pain management. Additional resource requirements: xDevelopment and inclusion of pain order sets in all DoD and VHA medical information syst ems (AHLTA, Essentris and VISTA). xA central pain management advisory board to be responsible for development and maintenance of all pain order sets and policies. xAnnual review of pain guidelines. Upon completion of the pain order set, the physician or prescriber will have created an effective plan for each patient that is consistent with the best DoD and VHA evidence-based data for pain treatment. While these rec ommendations do not preclude a provider from exercising his or her own clinical judgment, they do ensure that all prescribers of pain medications at least consider DoD and VHA recommendations for best pain prescribing. It i s likely that this policy will result in a de-emphasis on opioids in pain management plans. Electronic pain order sets will al so prompt primary care physicians when specialty pain management consultation is needed. Additionally, co mmanders should be able to monitor providers who consistently practicing outside of the recommended guidelines. An example of pain medication orders developed for the WRAMC Essentris system is provid ed in Appendix B-4. Variations of this theme could be developed through a central pain management advisory board for all le vels of MTFs within the DoD and VHA systems. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 30 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.1.13.1 Establish DoD and VHA electronic pain order sets in all electronic medical records. Recommendation 4.1.13.2 Conduct an annual review and update electronic pain guidelines. 4.1.14 Standardized Medical Equipment and Personnel in the Deployed Setting Objective: Standardize medical equipment, personnel s upport, and training across the continuum of pain care. There is no current standard equipment or personnel requirement for pain management throughout the continuum of care. Wounded Warriors are often not given advanced pain management technologies far forward due to unavailability of advanced pain management medications and equipment. Battlefield pain control is euphe mistically discounted as a non-issue because pain management is considered to be everyone's responsibil ity. In actuality, responsibility for pain management is highly uncertain. This issue is presently most conspicuous at OIF and OEF Level III facilities. Level III e quipment lists do not include standard supplies needed for routine pain management procedures. Personnel are often willing and available to manage trauma pain but are ill equipped to do so unless the medical officer brings his or her own supp ly. Wounded Warrior care depends on who is present and what supplies are available at the Combat Support Hospita l (CSH). Therefore, MEDCOM must deploy a uniform set of advanced pain management medications and equipment. A proposed CSH pain medication set is included in Appendix B-5. Beyond having the appropriate supplies and equipment, successful pain management on the battlefield requi res dedicated personnel assigned to the unit pain mission. A Level III facility, for example, w ould have a medical officer assigned the duty of pain consultation and management within the facility. This officer, usually an anes thesiologist, would coordinate pain management plans with assigned pain nurse representatives from each CSH ward. The number of personnel required for acute pain services will be dictated by the size and scope of a facilit y's health care mission. The establishment of an acute pain service at every Level III facility and also throughout the care continuum w ill greatly enhance Warrior pain care. Pilot programs in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the success of Level III acute pain services. Additional resources requirements: xDevelopment of acute pain services and inclusion of pain equipment sets in all Level III facili ties. xAdoption of the tier system of pain care throughout the care continuum that defines medical officer responsibilities, resource requirements, and equipment for pain management at all levels of c are. xExtensive education and training effort and policy generation at all levels of care. Warrior and Beneficiary care will be positively influenced throughout the care continuum. A standardized equipment set is required to deliver uniform pain management throughout the care continuum.

Recommendation 4.1.14.3 Establish requirements and authorizations for pain management specialists across DoD to identify and i mplement best practices from the VHA. Recommendation 4.1.14.4 Develop training program modules to support pain ma nagement in the deployed setting. 4.1.15 Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Trac king System Objective: Leverage advances in regional anesthesia techniques by integrating the data through an existing, sanctioned joint tracking data system. During the course of OEF and OIF, many Service Members have been severely wounded and their pain car e has been a challenge. The military anesthesiology community developed regional anesthesia techniques and oth er advanced pain care technologies that have revolutionized pain management. Advanced pain care technol ogies, such as continuous peripheral nerve blocks, epidurals, patient-controlled analgesia, and k etamine infusions require close management at all times, whether the patient is in a hospital bed or in the evacuation system. Leadership quickly recognized that an electronic system for following patients and transmitting vital pa in information to their accepting physicians was needed if these important techniques were to be used safely throughout the care continuum. In response to this need, Army anesthesia specialists working through the DVPMI developed a Regi onal Anesthesia Tracking System (RATS) to monitor patients using advanced pain technologies as they travel ed through the military health care system. RATS is a stand-alone information system that allows medical provider s to document pain management notes on a central server and notify receiving providers about patients in transit with regional anesthesia. It does not connect to or share data with any of the MHS electronic health record systems, s uch as the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) or AHLTA. The military medical community has recognized the i mportance of the data collected in RATS and has requested that RATS functionality be incorporated into a MHS ele ctronic health record system. The Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System (JRAATS) is under development to meet this medical information requirement. Once integrated into the TMDS, this system will give pain medicine provi ders at all Levels of care a key communication tool for the safe and effective implementation of advanced pain care throug hout the care continuum. The JRAATS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) document is provided in Appendix B-6. Additional resource with JRAATS.

Recommendation 4.1.15.3 Assign program, data, and content responsibility fo r the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Track ing System to a central pain management advisory board. 4.1.16 Standardize Identification of Substance Abu se Patients Objective: Identify substance abuse patients in Warr ior Transition Units by embedding the necessary resources to develop and implement a coordinated care and monitoring plan. Substance abuse disorders are not uncommon in society or the military. According to the Substance A buse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA), an estimated 20.1 million Americ ans aged 12 or older were illicit drug users in 2008 (SAMSHA National Survey on Drug Use and Health Report, 2008). The Nati onal Institute of Drug Abuse 2008 study, \"Monitoring the Future,\" found that 9.7% of 12th graders in the U.S. abused Vicodin in the past year and 4.7% abused Oxycontin. Drug abuse in the military has paralleled the civi lian sector. The 2005 Pentagon Health Survey found that 15% of Service Members admitted to prescription drug abuse in the previous year, with 4% in the past month. The 2008 survey reported 22% admitting use in the previous year and 13% in the previous month. Prescription drug abuse is increasing. The risk of opioid abuse and dependence increase s for those who are receiving controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain. Opioid dependence in chronic pai n patients is often associated with poor outcomes, including occupational difficulties, disciplinary problems , social problems, disability, and death. OIF and OEF have placed tremendous strains on military personnel and their Famili es. The number of prescriptions written for pain medications has increased and the correlation between suicide and prescr iption pain medication abuse is of deep concern to DoD. As such, a two-day meeting with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and VA was held in January 2009. The meeting focused on addressing substance abuse and associated mental health problems in military personnel, Veterans and their Families. More than 20 years of research has identified many of the biological variables and social circumsta nces that foster or protect against drug abuse and addiction. NIDA is actively supporting research that strives to help people, across the lifespan, develop and apply the skills and resources they need to stop problem behav iors before and after they begin. The issue is two-fold for military medicine. While there is an increased risk of addiction in p ain patients who are receiving controlled substances for the management of pain (or not receiving controlled drugs and i nstead self- treating with illicit drugs), there is no routine or standardized screening for those at risk, nor i s there a system to TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 33share this information, when known, throughout the health care continuum. In other words, there is no reliable means of connecting the dots. Many barriers make it difficult or impossible to share information among health care provid ers: xSystems do not communicate. xWithin the military, there are intra- and inter-Service restrictions on the release of certain infor mation. xUnder a new test program in select locations, soldiers can, without the commander's knowledge, self- refer to Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). xSome Soldiers seek treatment outside of the military establishment and some deliberately seek to not disclose this information, making it difficult for health care providers to be fully informed. For these reasons, screening is critical, as it represents a fail-safe way to identify thos e with, or at risk for, substance abuse disorders and initiate early intervention efforts. Currently, the Drug and Alcohol Management Information System (DAMIS) tracks those enrolled i n ASAP, but the system is closed to military medical providers. It is estimated that 45% of patients who are pr esent for care are affected by substance abuse disorders that are routinely unrecognized by health care providers (Mili tary Health System, 2009). It is imperative that addiction risk be assessed as early as possible, prefer ably at the very first encounter with the health care system, irrespective of whether controlled substances are being con sidered or not. This is the proverbial \"golden time\" for substance abuse prevention and/or detection. Undoubtedly, the best approach to reducing substance abuse is prevention. Early and effective screening for substance abuse patients would save untold direct and indirect costs and suffering. It is a proven fact that research-based drug abuse prevention programs are cost-effective. Each dollar invested in prevent ion achieves a savings of up to $7 in areas such as substance abuse treatment and criminal justice system costs (NIDA, 2007), not to mention their wider impact on the trajectory of young lives and their Families. Eac h year, drug abuse and addiction cost taxpayers nearly $534 billion in preventable health care, law enforcement, crime, and other costs (NIDA, 2007). Early detection and intervention would reduce societal costs and prevent the adverse personal consequences of substance abuse. WTU patients often have complex pain issues that require pain specialty consultation and c lose pharmacologic monitoring. Many have co-existing disorders, such as PTSD, TBI, depression, insomnia, and sub stance abuse. Obtaining an appropriate history and understanding the impact of these co-existing disorders is nec essary to formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Evaluating these patients in close collaboration with the primary care physician allows for a coordinated care plan that can reduce the length of time a patient is held in the WTU, re duce the risks inherent in fragmented care, and facilitate the early detection of aberrant pain behavior in this high r isk population. The Task Force recommends that a tri-service and VHA working group, representing subject matt er experts from primary care, behavioral health, and pain management, make a recommendation for a standardized su bstance abuse screening tool. The tool would monitor the development of problems for individuals and identify those individuals who are either with, or at risk for, substance abuse. This tool should allow for initi al intake evaluation and periodic follow-up rescreening in both a paper form (that can be quickly implemented) and Web-based. This tool, when added to pain assessment and outcome registry tool, would give providers a comprehensive view of the individual, including their proclivities. Knowing this information from the outs et would enhance care and management. After analysis, the working group would make a recommendation that would then go to the VHA and the Service Surgeons General for final review. The best approach to reducing substance abuse is prevention TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 34 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A standardized screening tool for substance abuse along with a standardized informed consent that explains ri sks, benefits, and alternatives to chronic opioid therapy for the treatment of chronic pain conditions are ne cessary. Poor access to pain subspecialty care and lack of a widely accepted tiered or stepped model of pain c are has resulted in an overreliance on opioid medication which contributes to the increase in opioid abuse and dependence. Recommendation 4.1.16.1 Establish a tri-service and VHA working group that will recommend a paper form and Web-based interacti ve tool, designed for general medical settings, as the stand ardized tool to identify substance abuse patients. Recommendation 4.1.16.2 Incorporate the screening tool into the Pain Assess ment Screening Tool and Outcome Registry. Recommendation 4.1.16.3 Implement use of the tool during the initial patien t visit to obtain a baseline assessment. Recommendation 4.1.16.4 Enhance the communication of the patient's plan of care among primary care, specialty care, and substa nce abuse providers. Recommendation 4.1.16.5 Develop a strategic communications plan on the use of a standardized substance abuse screening tool. 4.1.17 Risk Management in Chronic Pain Medical Mana gement Objective: Mitigate the risk of prescription drug ab use and dependence in pain patients, with a focus on those receiving controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain. Current accepted treatment for opioid dependence includes both an abstinence-based approach and a pharmacologic approach. While an abstinence-based approach is clearly ideal, there is a signif icant relapse rate with the abstinence-based approach that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Early r ecognition of patients with risk factors for abuse and dependence will lead to closer monitoring and consultatio n with a pain specialist and behavioral health specialist when considering the use of opioids for the treatment of c hronic pain. Once opioid dependence has been identified, appropriate treatment can be arranged. There has been limited success with the use of naltrexone in patients who have completed detoxif ication, but the long term compliance rate is low, much as compliance with Antabuse is low among patients with alcoho l dependence. Until the Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000), the only opioid agonist treatment availabl e for opioid dependence was methadone. When used for opioid dependence, methadone can only be obtained from a licensed methadone clinic. Opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased comp liance, reduced criminal behavior, increased social and occupational functioning, and reduced morbidity and mortality. DATA 2000 allowed for office-based opioid agonist treatment using the medication buprenorphine/naltrexone (Suboxone) in a tightly regulated manner. Although buprenorphine/naltrexone is being used in the treatment of patients with opioid dependence within several military medical treatment centers and is prescr ibed for some patients receiving treatment in the network, buprenorphine/naltrexone is not a covered benefit under TRICA RE. Thus, it is extremely difficult for patients to continue therapy following discharge from the network treatment facili ty. The patients referred to civilian inpatient treatment programs and started on buprenorphine/naltrexone are often the TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 35patients with the most severe forms of opioid dependence and are at the highest risk of relapse. Failure to conti nue the therapy used to stabilize their opioid dependence increases their likelihood of relapse after dischar ge. In addition, there are some high functioning patients who have been on opioids for the treatment of chronic pain for a long period of time but for whom the medication has ceased to provide benefit. Some of these patients have trouble stopping secondary to withdrawal symptoms that result in protracted discomfort, difficulty sleepin g, difficulty with concentration, and irritability. These patients often have a stable home life, function well at work , do not experience disciplinary problems, and may not need a formal substance dependence treatment program. It is acceptable to treat these patients in an office-based setting with close monitoring and appropriate pain medicine, behav ioral health, and primary care support. Over time, these patients may be successfully tapered off the opioid agonis t therapy. The TF recommends implementing standardized screening tools, using a stepped care approach to pain management, increasing access to specialized pain care, offering alternatives to chronic opioi d therapy, and implementing pain education programs to address and reduce the reliance on opioid medications . For patients who have developed prescription opioid dependence, there should be ready referral for appropriate substance abuse treatment and the use of office-based opioid agonist treatment should be available as an option for selected patients who would benefit. Recommendation 4.1.17.1 Implement a stepped care model for pain care. Recommendation 4.1.17.2 Develop a strategic communications plan on DoD and VHA guidelines for chronic opioid therapy and the V HA Opioid Pain Care Agreement. Recommendation 4.1.17.3 Educate providers and chronic pain patients on the signs and symptoms of opioid dependence, addiction treatment options, and stigma issues. Recommendation 4.1.17.4 Ensure that appropriate treatment for opioid depende nce, including the use of office-based opioid agoni st therapy, is available for those patients who have developed an opioid dependence as a result of pain treatment. Recommendation 4.1.17.5 Ensure that patients with chronic pain who demonstr ate, or are deemed at risk for, aberrant behavior h ave access to structured pharmacy management programs that sup port opioid and medication pain management. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 36 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Research Figure 9: A Summary of Categories for Research Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and E ncourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management ResearchxDoD and VHA Pain Research Strategy xResearch Strategic Communications xClinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management 4.1.18 DoD and VHA Pain Research Strategy Objective: Develop collaborative pain research strat egies that advance Warrior pain care and rapidly translate effective findings into practice. The theoretical criteria for selecting analgesics for pain procedures and other treatment include xEfficacy xOverall effectiveness xSide effects and complications xOnset of symptoms xDrug interactions xAbuse potential xPractical issues such as cost and availability of the drug, as well as the severity and type of pain Social and cultural issues, such as the time and location of the provider's training, mentor preferences, and the influence of pharmaceutical marketing and advertising also play a role. There are still other factors r elating to prescribing medication, including availability of the compound and cost. At any given time, the order of c hoice in the decision-making process can change. Wide variation in the treatment of pain is the result. Qualitative and quantitative evidence-based research is the best way to inform the pain management process and translate new information (e.g., techniques) into clinical practice. Data analysis yield s the most unbiased results and informs the selection of future lines of research. This is the best way to advance pain care and s tandardize clinical variation, while minimizing patient pain and suffering. Research can inform pain treatment modalities, de crease cost, identify ways to prevent addiction, and ensure the research priorities match the actual need. Currently, research information outcomes are not widely available and there are inadequate proces ses for the implementation of knowledge in the form of transfer to clinical practice. There is insufficient funding for pain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE). Research productivity must be increased, with a goal of hi gher quality, improved patient care. Battlefield pain care drives the DVPMI agenda. The field of pain c are would be advanced if the same need-based approach were adopted across the enterprise and sufficient resources provi ded. It is critical to communicate issues of systematic evaluation and ongoing care of chroni c or persistent pain, and provide information about the scientific basis of recommended procedures in order to eliminate v ariation and improve care. Research and guidelines could be expected to increase patient compliance, dispel miscommun ications among providers and patients, manage reasonable patient expectations, and form the basis of a therapeutic partnership between the patient and the provider. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 37The MHS must leverage TF discoveries to ensure research in pain management addresses current med ical knowledge and the technology needs of the MEDCENs and VA hospitals to care for Wounded Warriors. Pai n management is one of the most costly medical care functions MEDCENs perform. Developing better m edicines and techniques to manage pain more effectively has the potential to significantly decrease costs and re sult in better health care overall. The Surgeon General's lead for conducting medical research and development under the Army's RDTE program, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), maintains organizations and c ore funding for pain management. In 2008, MRMC established the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Progra m (CRMRP) to focus investments on Wounded Warrior care. Pain management RDTE is assigned to CR MRP. CRMRP identifies objectives and priorities for pain management research through a joint, interdisc iplinary clinical panel - the Pain Management Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) - of stakeholders from all Serv ices, appropriate DoD elements, National Institute of Health (NIH), and VHA. The Pain Management SSC established res earch objectives and priorities in April 2009 but discoveries of the TF regarding technologies, tech niques, and guidelines applied to pain management indicate a need to reexamine those issues and communicate revision s to CRMRP for incorporation into its RDTE strategic plan. CRMRP accomplishes research objectives by leveraging other research programs, laboratori es, and the global medical science base, including academia and industry. Once objectives and priorities are kno wn, CRMRP issues solicitations. CRMRP uses an interdisciplinary team to review proposals from these solic itations for scientific merit, programmatic compliance, and affordability. Selections are then funded by CRMRP. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2010, the RDTE Core Program includes funding for the DVPMI's science programs. This core funding establishes the first organization solely focused on pain management and enhances DoD's capability and capacity to conduct RDTE specifically for pain management. Pain Management RDTE competes with all other research and science needs for the medical care of Wounded Warriors. The Pai n TF found that of all DoD Medical RDTE investments over the next 5 years, pain management research is programmed to receiv e < 2%, or $54.6M. However, in CRMRP's portfolio, pain management is presently ranked second, behind muscul oskeletal injury rehabilitation. Pain management investments are seriously underrepresented in DoD's research investment strat egy, given the high cost of pain management in Wounded Warriors, and the ubiquitous nature of acute and chronic pain in trauma patients. Widespread patient dissatisfaction with pain control and other outcomes measures sugg est an urgent need for a change in strategy. The organization must leverage TF recommendations and the core RDTE organizations to validate pain management research objectives, recommend priorities, and reset as needed. The DVPMI is asse mbling the best pain management expertise available in the DoD and VHA. This body of expertise appears tailor-made to e nable CRMRP to establish strategic objectives and priorities for pain management RDTE . Next, the organization must widely disseminate knowledge and technology objectives through the Research Strategic Communications initiative and resource the implementation of strategic communications (STRATCOM). CRMRP will ev aluate risks in meeting critical pain management research outcomes and propose right-size funding for Fiscal Year 2012 and beyond. Pain management RDTE priorities are established at high levels within DoD and Army. Significantly i ncreasing investments in pain management will require approval at the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health A ffairs and Assistant Secretary of the Army Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology level. Thus, a s trong statement by the Services Surgeons General will be important in right-sizing investments in pain management RDTE.Pain management investments are seriously underrepresented in DoD's research investment strategy, given the high cost of pain management in Wounded Warriors, and the ubiquitous nature of acute and chronic pain in trauma patients TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 38 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.1.18.1 Develop a pain medicine research strategy to ensure evidence-based medicine guides clinical decisions. Recommendation 4.1.18.2 Ensure research in pain management incorporates eme rging medical knowledge and technology needs to car e for Wounded Warriors. Recommendation 4.1.18.3 Implement proposed solutions to ensure pain managem ent research objectives, priorities, and resources enable MRMC to satisfy current, validated medical technolo gy and information needs. 4.1.19 Research Strategic Communications Objective: Improve military pain research strategic communications. The MHS can improve STRATCOM related to military pain research opportunities and research out comes to improve translation of innovative pain management practices and technologies into clinical practice. The DoD's research and development (R&D) businesses use a formal process (prescribed by D epartment of Defense Instruction 5000) to develop and then communicate and translate new materiel innovations into Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) (i.e., battlefield) military operations. DoD's Medical R &D businesses follow these same processes to translate new medicines and medical equipment onto the battlefield. Pr ocesses used to broadcast progress and outcomes (i.e., technologies and knowledge) to battlefield military medical users are managed by the United States Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Center and School or other Service Com bat Developers and Logisticians. Historically, medical R&D businesses within DoD have focused on battlefield technology development. In 200 8, the MRMC established CRMRP to focus R&D specifically on \"resetting\" care for severely Wounded Warr iors to enable their reintegration into society or reintroduction into service. CRMRP is responsible for dev eloping new technologies, including pain management technologies, to treat Wounded Warriors. The CRMRP differs from other m edical R&D programs by having, as its principal customers, clinicians within the Table of Distributi on and Allowances (TDA) (i.e., sustainment base) MEDCENS and VHA, instead of those in TO&E MTFs. From a military m edical R&D perspective, this difference is a game changer. Many of the established TO&E processes for preparing the user s and then translating innovations into practice do not apply to the TDA base. Therefore, future pain management innovations that focus on MEDCEN and VHA care for Wounded Warriors may not reach the right audience(s) unless a new STRATCOM plan is developed and implemented. New pain management knowledge and technologies are acquired by CRMRP using a formal process that i ncludes an objectives definition, solicitation for proposals, and awarding funds to perform scientific w ork. To enable CRMRP to satisfy its objectives, pain management researchers must be aware both of the unmet needs (i.e., objectiv es) and of funding opportunities (i.e., solicitations). They must then have the ability and resources to prepare high quality proposals judged through a competitive, formal process. When solicitations fail to reach the bes t researchers, or if the best researchers are not able to prepare a high-quality proposal, then advancement of knowledge and technologies in pain management will falter. Formal mechanisms for communicating pain-related research opportunities and outcomes (i.e., te chnologies and knowledge) to researchers, care providers, and policy-makers in the military health car e sustaining base and in the VHA are needed. Mechanisms must be created that ensure awareness and action by MEDCEN and VHA care providers in defining requirements, assist in relevant research, and translate research innovati ons into practice. FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 39Creating an Army and Joint Forces approval process for acquiring, translating, and sustaining new tech nologies for TDA use would greatly enhance opportunities for success. Recommendation 4.1.19.1 Encourage collaboration among MRMC, CRMRP, and the AMEDD Center and School to institutionalize strateg ic communications and dissemination of innovation in p ain management technologies and knowledge. Recommendation 4.1.19.2 Secure funding to support the acquisition of inform ation system technologies. Recommendation 4.1.19.3 Secure funding for a central pain management adviso ry board. Recommendation 4.1.19.4 Task MRMC and CRMRP to provide a central pain manage ment advisory board access to shared information platforms acquired by MRMC to fill research informa tion needs. 4.1.20 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Manage ment Objective: Standardize the practice of pain medicine w ith pain management clinical practice and clinical management guidelines. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are documents developed to guide the diagnosis, treatme nt, and management of specific diseases and conditions. Based on best available evidence, CPGs are educational tool s and can be used to align medical practice patterns with the available evidence. Many CPGs have been developed through co llaborative efforts between DoD and VHA. Three out of the twenty-three CPGs available on the Therapy xLower Pack Pain xPost-Operative Pain Providers interviewed during site visits consistently expressed a need for improved cli nical guidelines for pain management. It was often explained that providers would be less likely to refer pain patients for specialty car e if they felt more comfortable that they were doing the right thing for these patients in their respective clinics. Addi tionally, they further explained that it is difficult to determine what \"right\" looks like when evaluating the wide var iance in treatment plans used by other providers across the medical continuum. There are pain management guidelines available for providers but the Task Force analysis indicated several variables lim iting their influence and use within the current practice of pain management in the MHS and VHA: xLack of provider awareness of CPGs related to pain management. xCurrent format of CPGs not easily used or integrated into provider practice. xNeed for new CPGs developed to specifically address requirement to standardize practice of pain medicine in DoD and VHA health care systems. A majority of the providers interviewed were unaware of the existence of these CPGs. This is r egrettable because these VA and DoD CPGs were developed through an extremely resource-intensive process involvi ng multiple senior clinicians and researchers and a rigorous examination of the medical evidence. Addition al efforts are required to expand their visibility and use throughout the MHS and VHA and should be a focus of the DoD comprehensiv e pain strategy. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 40 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Of the providers who stated that they were aware of CPGs, specifically the VHA and DoD CPGs, many felt that in their current format, they were too long, cumbersome, and difficult to integrate into their daily practice. For example, the length of the CPG for chronic opioid therapy is 111 pages for the full document, 32 pages for the summar y, and 4 pages for the \"pocket card.\" In addition to expanding provider awareness of CPGs, current and future CPG s should be evaluated for ease of use for providers. Where possible, they should be integrated into the computerized pati ent medical record to provide an automated decision support tool to providers and ultimately an increased standardization of pain management practice across the enterprise. New CPGs should be developed to incorporate the best available medical evidence in pain med icine that will address the unique needs of military patients. The triad of comorbid pain, post-concussive syndrome (mTB I), and PTSD require additional clinical guidance and support for providers. A central pain management advis ory board should develop a list of priorities for pain related CPG development. As stated earlier, these new CPG s should be developed in a format that encourages provider utilization and is integrated into the computerized medical rec ord. All future CPGs should be developed as a part of the larger DoD comprehensive pain management stra tegy. Recommendation 4.1.20.1 Incorporate Clinical Practice Guidelines into STRAT COM plan to ensure maximum awareness of pain relate d Clinical Practice Guidelines by DoD and VHA provide rs. Recommendation 4.1.20.2 Integrate Clinical Practice Guidelines into compute rized medical record. Recommendation 4.1.20.3 Utilize a central pain management advisory board to develop priorities for future pain-related Clinica l Practice Guideline development. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 414.2 Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Continu um of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence The second objective calls for building a full spec trum of best practices for the continuum of pain car e, from acute to chronic, which is based on a foundation of the best available evidence. This can be accomplished thro ugh the adoption of an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to man aging pain. Despite the best intentions of clinicians, pain and symptom control is often sub-optimal because the entir e health care system has been designed around cure of disease rather than palliation (Max, 1990). There hav e been many demonstrations of major improvements in pain treatment within health care organizations, but programs tha t institute such improvements must redesign many aspects of the way care is delivered (Jacox et al., 1994). Essential ingredients in such improved programs include the following: xPhysicians, nurses, patients, and Families must be educated about pain treatment, and materials to guide treatment must be readily available to assist clinicians in writing orders. xThe organization and all of its professionals must make themselves accountable to all of their patients - ranging from newborns to the elderly - for attentive treatment of pain. xPain must be made \"visible\" in the organization - routinely charted as a \"fifth vital sign\" so that unrelieved pain triggers a prompt response. xQuality improvement activities should be used to encourage steady improvement in the treatment of pai n in the organization. xExpert consultants and \"high technology\" pain treatment interventions, such as patient-controlled a nalgesia and epidural catheters, must be available (either within the health care organization or by referral) for the minority of cases in which simpler measures do not suffice. xPolicies on reimbursement for health professionals, medications, and other palliative treatm ents (e.g., counseling, cognitive treatment for symptoms, and other supportive care), and controlled substan ce regulations must be designed so that they do not create barriers to symptom treatment. xPatients' and Families' values and preferences regarding care must be respected. Implementation of program components such as these will require an organizational commitment to i dentify opportunities for improvement and offer guidance to close organizational gaps across the enterprise, incl uding deficiencies in: xInterdisciplinary staffing, training, and education xSpace and workflow organization xCoordination of care and support services xClinical practice standardization xTechnology xCommunication barriers to effective and efficient service Such an organizational reset will require an examination of program capacity, effective non-traditional services, and resources needed for enhanced pain management services. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 42 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE An Integrative and Interdisciplinary Approach Figure 10: A Summary of Categories for an Integrative and Interdisciplinary Approa ch Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Con tinuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence An Integrative and Interdisciplinary ApproachxComplementary and Integrative Pain Treatment Medicine xOsteopathic Manipulation xPrimary Care Pain Management xStepped Care Model xMusculoskeletal Action Plan 4.2.1 Complementary and Integrative Pain Treatment Me dicine Objective: Incorporate integrative and alternative t herapeutic modalities into a patient centered plan of care. The etiology of pain is multimodal and complicated, affecting every aspect of the individual: phy sical, emotional, and spiritual, as well the Family and community. There is no simple solution to this comp lex problem. Thus, the treatment needs to be interdisciplinary and multimodal in its approach. But more than that, it needs to incorp orate all the aspects of the individual, Family, and community and not just focus on the etiology itself. One way to achieve an interdisciplinary, multimodal and holistic approach to pain management is by incorporating complementary and alternative therapies into an individualized pain management plan of care. The current medical model is a provider-to-patient relationship. This is known as provider-based care where the team leader is the provider. This model is often one of \"doing something to the patient\" instead of having the patient participating in his or her own care. In the case of pain management, the patient presents a complaint of pain to the provider. Many times the treatment is a prescription for a medicatio n and a brief description of precautions, limits, and possibly some exercises. Rarely does the patient do an ything other than take the medication and return for a refill. The patients become devoid of ownership of the condition when they are a passive participant in their own care. This leads to recurrent cases of poor outcomes, problems wi th multiple prescriptions, and some patients' disillusion with the medical system. Stress is a significant contributor to pain conditions. In fact, by definition, pain has an emotional component. Further, chronic pain leads to increased stress which leads to a vicious cycle. Therefore, pain canno t be managed without addressing its relationship to stress. Research is showing that our thoughts and perceptions i nfluence our ability to heal. Mindfulness or the ability to be in the moment brings a greater awareness to the unconscious and its affect on emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Mindfulness focuses the mind's ability to heal the body. This interaction is often missed in the disease based treatment model. The terms complementary medicine and alternative medicine are often used interchangeably, but they do i n fact differ from each other. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy is using aromatherapy (the scent of essential oils from flowers, her bs or trees) to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventiona l medicine. An example of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a conventional doctor. The patients become devoid of ownership of the condition when they are a passive participant in their own care TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 43The Integrative model emphasizes the patient-centered care model of treatment. In this model, the patient is the team leader with the providers acting as consultants and guides to the patient. Taking this a step further, Integrativ e Health and Healing teaches the importance of self: self-care, self-responsibility, and self -awareness. In February 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) acknowledged patient-centered care as one of the five critical dimensions of high-quality care. Further, research shows that focusing the health care system around the patient can improve patients' satisfaction with care, as well as their clinical outcomes. Patient-centered care empowers the patient to be responsible and participatory in his or her health and healing process. However, the change from the current model will require a significant paradigm shift. Over the past twenty years, patients have led this shift. They are seeking out \"alternative medicine\" to help address their individual needs. They often do this without the guidance of professionals. In fact, sometimes the patients withhold the fact they are using other treatments from their conventional health care providers. The medical community needs to be part of the patient's journey, promoting each patient's individual health goals. To best address the goal of patient-center ed care, providers must work in partnership with patients and Families in providing health promoti on options while maintaining efficacy and safety standards. This integration needs to be methodical, appropriate, and evaluated throughout the process to ensure the best potential outcomes. Just as patients can be active or passive participants in their treatment, that treatment can be active or passive as well. The difficulty with all treatment, regardless of whether the treatment is conventional or integra tive, is that it can allow the patient to remain a passive participant. For example, weekly acupuncture performed on a patient can allow the patient to return each week without taking ownership and responsibility for the pain. Thus, it is imper ative that one of the end goals of any treatment is patient participation. Clearly a patient with significant diabetes needs medications for control; however, evidence shows that the patient also needs to maintain a proper diet, exercise regimen and self-care. If the patient only takes medications for the diabetes, the outcome will not be op timal. Likewise, teaching the patient the points for self-directed acupressure, while performing acupuncture for a pai n condition, incorporates the patient into the treatment. This changes the treatment from passive to active and improves the outcome, decreases provider dependent care, and empowers the patient with a sense of control over his or her condition. The Task Force site visits included an assessment of the scope of CAM modalities offered at each MTF. C AM experts, if they existed, were interviewed, as were providers and, where practical, patients and/or Famil y members. The literature on Complementary and Alternative Medicine was reviewed, along with the MHS polici es and procedures. Various experts in the field of Mind Body and Complementary and Alternative Medicine were also visited or interviewed. Additionally, the Task Force consulted with the Samueli Institute, a non -profit research organization that supports the scientific investigation of healing and its role in medicine and health care. The Sam ueli Institute has been working on several research projects related to military and Veterans' pain man agement. In 2005 the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military included ques tions on CAM usage among Service Members. These data, reflecting 19 CAM types in the five recognized CAM treatment catego ries are reported in a manuscript currently under review for publication (Samueli communication). The CA M subgroup of the TF studied the issues surrounding credentialing and licensing of CAM providers. The tiered structure represents a hierarchy of implementation based on current accepted literature support ing efficacy, safety, and widespread use or acceptability. Additionally, licensing and credentiali ng concerns were taken into consideration in the development of the recommendations. Within the tiers, active and passive treatments ar e identified to allow for an understanding of how passive treatments can become active treatments to avoid the pitfalls of passive patient participation. Most passive treatments require a provider to perform the treatment or guide the participant in the activity. On the other hand, active treatments typically require some level of patient education up front to ensure patients are using the modalities correctly and safely; only then should the treatment become pati ent self-directed. Some active treatments are portable with individualized equipment. The TF recommen ds adopting a tiered approach for the effective integration of Integrative Modalities to augment pain management.

Medical science acknowledges that there are many accepted practices that are utilized without evidence from well-designed research and data in both complementary and traditional western medicine. CAM practices, in particular, are often debunked as ineffective or merely effect ive due to the placebo effect. Exciting research in neurobiological imaging is showing that the placebo effec t is indeed a \"real\" one to be clinically exploited, given its efficacy and safety margin. Many of these gaps in e vidence for CAM therapies remain since funded research on these therapies is one of the newest areas recognized by National Institutes for Health. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) s tarted as an Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992 and expanded to a center in 1998 with a current budget of $122 mil lion (NCCAM Web site).

Manual medicine or manipulation is well accepted by patients, has proven successful for treating many musculoskeletal pain syndromes, and is well suited f or integration into the primary care and physiatry workflows. The goal of manual medicine is to restore the entire bo dy to a state of homeostasis. Manual medicine empl oys palpation using the providers' hands to detect sources of pai n and dysfunction within the skin, fascia, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Once these areas of dysfunction are ident ified, manual medicine should be used to decrease m uscle spasms, neural facilitation, improve local circulat ion of blood and lymph, improve range of motion, an d decrease pain. There are several barriers to widespread adoption o f manual therapies; however most of these barriers can be overcome with adequate command support: xInadequate clinic set up: - requires flat treatment tables, not lithotomy tabl es - preferably two rooms per provider to improve patie nt flow - inability of the RVUs (productivity metrics) to tr ack success of manual therapies - inability to have flexible appointment lengths TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 46 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE The AMEDD has a significant number of Osteopathic p hysicians on staff and in Graduate Medical Education (GME) training programs. However, there is inconsistent application of osteopathic modalities and continuin g training at the GME and Continuing Medical Education (CME) level. Physical therapists ar e also trained to perform manual therapies and could provide them under a structure similar to wha t the TF is suggesting for Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). The Army should take the initiative to use and cont inue training their embedded (wearing the uniform) resources. Many Active Duty Medical Corps Officers and Physica l Therapist in the Medical Specialty Corps have bee n previously trained to provide manual medicine. These Active D uty assets are able to provide comprehensive medica l care in addition to their manual manipulation skills. The TF recommends using these organic resources, rather than outsourcing and spending money, amongst other resou rces, on hiring chiropractors who are only trained to provide manipulation. GME training and program implementation policies wi ll be required to implement manual manipulation pro grams at the MTF level. A GME level training program must be de veloped and implemented. This will enable resident s to continue using and improving upon the skills they learned in medical school and increase their efficiency with treatment. Once these residents become staff, they will be able to succes sfully incorporate manual medicine into their daily clinic flow. A GME OMT training program should include a GME Manipulat ion Clinic with staff oversight, an education serie s on OMT, and a \"hands-on\" review of manipulative therapies. For n on-osteopathic residents and staff, the GME program will serve to teach them improved diagnostic skills, educate them on wh ich patients are appropriate for referrals for manu al medicine, and teach them hands-on manual medicine they can use in their own clinics. A GME manual medicine program will also enhance the comprehensive care that all participati ng physicians provide to their patients. Additiona lly, GME OMT clinics would need longer appointment slots to encourage ed ucation and oversight by staff physicians. Staff physicians who have training in manual therap y will usually be able to see their patients in the course of their normal appointment slot lengths when indicated. On occasi on, they may need to bring a patient back for a lon ger appointment slot to address more complicated and involved pathology. Staff physicians should be encouraged to use manu al therapies as part of their comprehensive care process. Their su ccess has the potential to be measured in patient s atisfaction, decreased medications dispensed, decreased profiles written, improved return to duty, less referrals f or musculoskeletal complaints, and decreased office visits for the sam e complaint. The main resource requirement for a s taff physician to employ manual medicine skills is a flat exam table. There are some relevant best practices within the A rmy and these should be studied as possible best pr actices to replicate in other facilities. There are scattered training programs with various successes across the AMEDD. Figure 13: OMT Practices Training Programs Selected Best Practices GME xFt.

The resource requirement for this is minimal. Essentially, any individual provi der with manual therapy knowledge would be able to provide presentations and hands-on demonstrations and review of the manua l therapy techniques. In addition to these present ations, a room in which to provide the training is necessary. Provid ers should be encouraged to attend annual CME train ing provided by professional organizations to enhance their knowled ge and skill sets. An example is a young Active Duty patient who has m id and low back pain who is seen for back pain afte r wearing gear and carrying large loads. Figure 14: OMT Options for Active Duty Patients Option 1 Option 2 The patient receives a profile, a referral to physical therapy, quarters or convalescent leave, medication, and possibly, consults for more invasive procedures. These all lead to decreased productivity for the military from this active duty patient (lost work days, decreased productivity when at work, potential interaction of medications with ability to work). In addition, resources are needed to track this patient's profile and medical care.The patient has an appointment with a primary care pr ovider for the back pain and receives OMT during his visit. The treatment takes less than twenty minutes. The pati ent then leaves and returns to duty, without a profile, no m edications, and no referrals. This option costs less money ini tially and subsequently less money is lost in productivity and use of assets. When you look at the many brigades full of young active duty soldiers only experiencing back pain, usi ng OMT to treat musculoskeletal conditions could result in a significant cost savings to the military in addition to improve d satisfaction and function for the patients. Resource requirements are minimal and include use o f existing space for training clinics, two patient exam rooms per provider with OMT (simply flat or adjustable) table s. IT requirements include documentation and codin g solutions (recommended AHLTA AIM forms, SOAP templates (Subjective, Object ive, Assessment, Plan), Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) encounter templates, and Evaluat ion & Management (E&M) dispositions documentation) and training and use of MAPS (MEDCOM AHLTA Provider Satisfaction ) tools (such as Dragon and As-U-Type). An extende d list of OMT related issues can be found in Appendix B-7. Potential research pilot projects might include: xOMT Clinic (GME) which tracks the residents to see which residents continue to use OMT in their comprehensive practice once they are staff physicia n and tracks the number of residents. xSurvey of Osteopathic Physicians and Physical Thera pists who are Active Duty to establish those who us e manipulative therapies in clinic /hospital / deploy ed setting, what the barriers to use are, amount of CME in manipulative therapies available at their site, int erest in participating in a clinic specific for man ipulation with other providers or why they chose not to use their unique skill set. xAuricular (battlefield) acupuncture pilot program in the WTU clinics. xImproved clinic resources with an adapted workflow - to accommodate in-clinic OMT visits: - Two rooms per provider for patient flow. - Manipulation tables. xAHLTA business processes. xQualitative and Quantitative examination of the imp act of OMT on acute and chronic pain syndromes. xDown range use of OMT down range to prevent chronic complications from acute problems. It is ideal for the military to facilitate benefici aries having their musculoskeletal concerns address ed by OMT during the course of an office visit. Referrals to other prov iders (either civilian network care or to other mil itary providers) have their costs, such as time for providers and patient s, lost patient work productivity in their military jobs, and availability of TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 48 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE appointment slots for other patients. By facilitat ing osteopathic manipulation in primary care clinic s, some of these costs could be minimized and recouped (especially i f the civilian network referrals are decreased). Validation and measurement should focus on reduction of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, as meas ured on the 0-10 point Pain Assessment Screening Tool, and prevention of chronic pain syndromes through the rou tine application of osteopathic manipulative therapies. Patient satisfaction could be measured using the ne w Pain Assessment Tool and analyzing for trends, reduced m edication utilization, prevention of chronic pain sy ndromes, and improvement in the provider utilization rate. Reduction of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain and prevention of chronic pain syndromes through the routine application of osteopathic manipulative therapies are achievable goals.

According to the American Academy of Pain Managemen t (AAPM) Web site, pain is the number one reason pati ents seek medical care. One out of two Americans is in pain a nd one in four has persistent or chronic pain with t he leading cause being low back pain. One hundred billion dollars i s spent annually on pain care, yet very little progr ess has been made in treating pain and suffering. In managed organizatio ns, pain affects more people than heart disease, hyp ertension, diabetes, or cancer. The majority of pain care is delivered by primary ca re practitioners because they are often the first p oint of contact. Further, there are insufficient numbers of pain specialists t o manage the millions of people suffering from chro nic pain. Primary care providers are experienced in providing comfort and disease management for conditions that have no cure . Primary care providers have a strong, sustaining patient relatio nship. With the proper training and system support , primary care FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 49providers are in the best position to longitudinall y coordinate pain management from early intervention to long-term continuity of care, on to end-of-life care. A patient-centered approach to pain management with an integrated pain team or clinic in primary care will impact the grea test number of patients. Utilizing both medications and non-drug therapies w ithin a biopsychosocial model that emphasizes self-management will lead to the best results. Both chronic pain as a disease and the suffering of the p atient must be addressed. Early education, early risk stratificat ion, and early interventions to improve outcomes and safety will result in a gre ater relief from pain, a decrease in suffering, inc reased function, and safe prescribing of opioids for a greater number of pati ents. The goal is to prevent pain from becoming a d isabling disease. The demand for effective pain treatment is growing a mong patients in the United States. Despite advanc es in the treatment of pain, the quality of pain care remains far below the potential for optimal care. Fragment ation of pain care is perpetuated by the consecutive, and even concurr ent, lack of integrated evaluation and management o f complex pain disorders. Primary care often promotes fragmen ted care for patients with chronic pain conditions b y utilizing a succession of referrals to specialists and subspeci alists rather than implementing the biopsychosocial model of best- practice pain management. Multiple physicians may c ontribute to a patient's \"pain management\" with limi ted focus or goals, duplication of testing or unnecessary invasi ve testing, and with either limited interventions, or large variance of interventions available. This compartmentalized ap proach makes it difficult to identify a single prov ider to advocate for the patient's overall care by treating the patient as a whole human being with often multiple chronic conditions - all affecting each other. The overall quality of treatment of pain is unaccep table for patients with acute and persistent pain l eading to suffering, abuse, addiction and sometimes even more serious co nsequences. For example, abuse of prescription dru gs is now the second leading cause of accidental death. Deat h caused by prescription pain drugs is higher than deaths caused by cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine combined and health care costs are eight times higher for opioi d abusers than non-abusers (SAMSHA, 2008). Clinicians are faced with a dilemma - how to safely incorporate opioids into treatment plans that maxi mize the possibility of successful pain control while minimi zing the risk of misuse or abuse. The dilemma is h eightened for primary care providers who shoulder most of the bur den of pain management, despite having received lit tle specific training in pain medicine or substance abuse, and g enerally being constrained to brief visits for eval uating and managing complex problems. Opioids are not the onl y answer to treatment of moderate or severe pain, b ut in the current system, often this is all that is offered. Providers find it much quicker to write a prescrip tion than to manage the pain appropriately. The opposite may also occur, a s pain may be undertreated due to provider's discom fort, or even fear, of using opioids because of possible legal sa nctions. Also of concern is the practice of provid ing opioids for chronic pain without following standard practice gu idelines regarding assessment and monitoring, which can lead to negative outcomes. There are other barriers for pr oviders to practice good pain care: xLack of training for primary care providers to mana ge pain xThe wide variance of provider beliefs about pain tr eatment xLack of timely access to comprehensive pain medicin e consultation xPoor monitoring of care for patients with chronic p ain, who may receive treatment from multiple provid ers, without a coordinated care plan, including multiple prescribers of opioids Providers who prescribe opioids to treat pain are o ften caught between their professional obligation t o relieve suffering and their desire to avoid contributing to the publi c health problem of non-medical consumption of cont rolled substances (i.e., prescription drug abuse). The ch allenge is to curtail the abuse and diversion of pr escription opioids while ensuring their availability for patients who benefit from their use. The key to managing a pati ent's opioid intake lies in screening for abuse potential and carefully monitoring the progress of treatment. In the mobi le military Pain is the number one reason patients seek medical care and there are insufficient numbers of pain specialists to manage the millions of people suffering from chronic pain TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 50 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE population, strategies for optimizing pain manageme nt need to address military medicine's challenges w ith continuity of care, oversight of medication, enhanced physical functioning, and promotion of return to duty (see s ection 4.3.1). The solution to this issue begins with a health car e organization that is designed to provide a compreh ensive, integrated, patient-centric approach to the full sp ectrum of primary care, including - and most especi ally - care of patients with chronic disease, such as chronic pain . In addition to the Primary Care Manager and appr opriate support staff, it seems clear that a successful organization al design will include, at a minimum, organic behav ioral health providers and clinical pharmacologists, with additi onal assets based on population needs. The MHS is currently piloting the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH), which provides a comprehensive, integrated approach to primary care. PCMH incorporates a number of princi ples that facilitate a holistic approach to patient s with simple and complex medical needs and also facilitates partners hips among individual patients, their personal phys icians, and when appropriate, the patient's Family. These prin ciples, adapted from Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC), can be found in Appendix B-8. Interdisciplinary pain clinics have the strongest ev idence for improved pain outcomes. This is best imp lemented into pain management by developing a pain team or clinic i ntegrated into primary care that is accessible and provides face- to-face coordination and communication with the pri mary care managers. Interdisciplinary pain team mem bers may include: xPrimary Care Provider xMedical Director xMental Health Clinicians (psychologists, social wor kers, chemical dependency) xRehabilitation Clinicians (physical therapists, occ upational therapists, exercise physiologists) xNurses xCase Manager xPain Educator xVocational Counselors xPharmacist Consultant, and access to consultant spe cialty physicians in pain medicine and other special ties as indicated (neurology, physiatry, psychiatry, add iction medicine) This primary care pain clinic would benefit all invo lved, especially the patient. The goals of the clinic: xReduced pain intensity and suffering xEnhanced physical functioning xImproved access to pain treatment xControlled medication usage (safe use) xImproved psychological functioning xPain education for patient and Family xPromotion of meaningful life such as return to work Most patients with chronic pain should have a clinic al evaluation that would include establishing their functional status, identifying comorbid conditions, evaluating psychos ocial factors, setting goals, developing a goal-ori ented management plan, and determining when to consult or refer. Before initiating long-term opioid therapy , a psychological evaluation should also be completed, which would include an opioid risk assessment, scree ning for potential drug abuse or addiction, identification o f comorbid mental health issues, and determination of the patient's readiness to engage in self-care behaviors. The be nefits of increased integration and coordination be tween the pain clinic and primary care will enhance patient and pr ovider satisfaction, improve patient outcomes, and decrease health care costs. It would also provide an opportunity t o identify and intervene in many problems to preven t development of significant pathology. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 51Using the chronic care model as a framework, optima l pain care requires an interdisciplinary pain care c linic integrated in primary care with a stepped-care pain treatment a pproach similar to the VHA program (see section 4.2 .4). In an integrated pain clinic the patient will feel like so meone is listening to him, his symptoms are explain able and controllable, and someone cares. The primary care model will provide timely and appropriate access to pain management services for all Beneficiaries. The cli nic will provide early intervention, including educ ational programs that may reduce the likelihood of disability, impro ve the under-treatment of pain, provide individual tailoring of treatment plans, and serve as a liaison for patient s transfers between MTFs or VA facilities. It will also provide access to pain-trained medical expertise and deliver a saf e, effective, and evidence-based continuum of care. The MHS should move forward briskly with implementi ng a Patient Centered Medical Home, fully resourced with adequate support staff and IT, with embedded Behavi oral Health and Clinical Pharmacology. The MHS sho uld simultaneously move to outcomes-based performance m etrics that recognize and capture the quality and s afety benefits of a holistic, patient-centric approach to health care. The next step is to establish interd isciplinary pain care clinics, integrated in primary care, with a stepped -care pain treatment approach similar to the VHA pro gram. Recommendation 4.2.3.1 Implement a fully resourced Patient Centered Medica l Home. Recommendation 4.2.3.2 Develop outcomes-based performance metrics that rec ognize and capture the quality and safety benefits of a holistic, patient-centric approach to health care. Recommendation 4.2.3.3 Identify a workgroup from DoD and VHA to ensure tha t DoD interdisciplinary pain care clinics, integrat ed with primary care, correctly adopt a stepped care pain t reatment approach. 4.2.4 Stepped Care Model Objective: Adopt the VHA Stepped Care Model to ensur e timely access to collaborative care, reduce pain and suffering, and improve qualit y of life for Warriors and their Families. A continuum of effective pain care for Warriors, from the moment of injury on the battlefield or the onset of disease, to recovery or chronic pain management back home, is a core principle of the military's p ain management strategy. Effective implementation of this strategy presumes competent care at every level of need, regardless of the setti ng, whether emergency management far forward on the battlefield and during transport, definitive treatment at military medical facilities, or an open-ended commitment to provide continuity of care in mili tary and VA facilities back home as Service Members and Veterans reintegrate with their Families and communities. Establishing competency of care at each level of need in this continuum and in each setting present s the following organizational challenges for the MHS and VA: xEstablishing an organized and systematic process of care with clearly delineated responsibi lities and a chain of command xAssuring a systematic method of monitoring and continuously improving quality of care through outcomes measurement and patient feedback xProviding appropriate staffing at each level with adequately trained and skilled personnel to meet the needs of Service Members, Veterans and their Families FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 52 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Lessons can be learned from organizational models in both civilian and Veterans' health systems . As previously discussed, the Veterans Health Administration initiated a National Pain Management Strategy in 1998 to establish Pain Management as a priority in the VHA's national health system. The overall objective of the national strategy was to develop a comprehensive, multicultural, integr ated, system-wide approach to pain management that reduces pain and suffering and improves quality of life for Veterans experienc ing acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of injuries and illnesses, including terminal i llness. Quality of life is now accepted by the medical field as a standard outcome measure of effectiveness of treatment, incl uding treatment of pain, and includes such factors as level of physical and psychosocial functioning (e.g., in rol es at work and home) and treatment satisfaction. However, implementing such a strategy to improve pain management in a large health system proved challenging due to the way health care is organized to manage pain. A new model for the VHA was proposed that emphasizes early, evidence-based biopsychosocial treatment in primary care, supported by pain medicine specialty treatment and community support (Gallagher, 2008; Gallagher, 1999). Support for implementing such a model increased with documentation of the high rates of pain in returning OIF and OEF veterans entering the VHA (43% in 2007; 52% in 2009); the increasing rates of chronic pain (>50%) and increasing pain-related costs and disability in older Veterans' cohorts, as they accrue ri sk for diseases and conditions causing chronic pain; and the high rates of comorbidities, such as PTSD, depression, substance abuse and persistent post-concussive syndrome (Kang et al., 2007; Gironda et al., 2006; Schneiderman et al., 2008; Clark et al., 2007; Kerns et al., 2003; Lew et al., 2009). Figure 15: VHA Stepped Pain Care Model TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 53On October 28, 2009, the VHA published DIRECTIVE 2009-053; Appendix B-9), which dir ects the medical treatment facilities and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISNs - regional health s ystems) of the VHA to establish an integrated, biopsychosocial Stepped Care Model of Pain Management that provides for the care of m ost pain conditions in the primary care setting. The Biopsychosocial Model in pain takes the position that the causes and outcomes of many illnesses, including pain, often involve the interaction of physical and p athophysiologic factors, psychological traits and states, and social-environmental factors (Engel, 1980; Gallagher, 200 4). Effective treatment planning accounts for the salience of these factors in the precipitation and perpetuation of illness and illn ess-related disability (Gallagher, 1999). This model includes, and is supported by, timely access to secondary consultation and collaborati ve care from pain medicine and when indicated, mental health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and other specialties (D ubois, 2009). Access to palliative care may ultimately be needed; access to tertiary care advanced diagnostic, m edical management and rehabilitation services might also be required for complex cases involving com orbidities, such as mental health disorders and traumatic brain injury (Lew et al., 2009). The Pain Task Force believes the principles of Stepped Care apply to the military's pai n management challenges, beginning in the field. Evidence from studies of trauma indicates that early and aggressive pain intervention i n animal models and in emergency room patients reduces the incidence and morbidity of chronic pain (Gallagher, 2006; Castillo et al., 2005), and experience in the current OIF and OEF conflict indicates that aggress ive pain management in the theatre, after injury, lessens care burden and stress (Stojadinovic et al., 2008, Bucken maier et al., 2009). Thus, the military should implement a Stepped Care model that incorporates field-based management added to the primary care and secondary and tertiary care consultation model in the medical home. Figure 16: VHA Continuum of Stepped Care TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 54 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Stepped Care is instituted as a strategy to provide a continuum of effective treatment to a population of patients suffering from acute pain caused by injuries or diseases to longitudinal management of chronic pain diseases and disorders that may be expected to persist for more than 90 days, and in some instances, for the patient's lif etime (Dubois, 2009). Components of Stepped Care have been implemented in VA settings for several populations in primary care including chronic low back pain with and without depression and patients with chronic pain at risk for substance abuse (Dobscha et al, 2008; Dobscha et al, 2009; Ang et al., 2007; Meghani et al., 2009; Trafton et al., 2010). The challenge for any health care system, including the military and VHA, is the development of standardized, cost-effective care through a competent provider wo rkforce and effective health care system support. The First Step in implementing an adapted model of Stepped Care in the MEDCOM and MHS is appropriate Emergency Care and primary care. This calls for embedding the resources to provide pain care far for ward in the war zone and potentially remote sites where military personnel are operating, and transport to med ical facilities appropriate for the level of need is contingent. The care destination might be a field hospital or clinic, and in som e cases a tertiary care facility in the Unites States. This requires: 1. The development of competent field-based emergency care (including behavioral health and primary car e provider workforce to manage injuries and common pain conditions); 2. Consultation with pain medicine with competency in managing complexity, severity and ris k, as well as other specialties as needed; and 3. Advanced pain medicine diagnostics and procedures and severe comorbidities requiring inter disciplinary, intensive pain rehabilitation services, including inpatient settings as required. Recommendation 4.2.4.1 Implement the VHA Stepped Pain Care model. Recommendation 4.2.4.2 Leverage the VHA Directive Action Plan as a templat e for better coordination between MEDCOM and MHS. 4.2.5 Musculoskeletal Action Plan Objective: Integrate the prevention, early identific ation, and treatment of injuries as a component of the comprehensive pain management stra tegy. Effective pain management will require efforts across the vast and complex pain continuum. The im portance of injury prevention and early intervention efforts to minimize the adverse effects of pain on the Armed Forces is di fficult to overstate. The TF recognizes the Musculoskeletal Action Plan (MAP) as another critical pi ece of a comprehensive pain management strategy. In 2008, there were 2,697,597 medical encounters, including hospitalizations and outpatient visits but exc luding any visits to the Battalion Aid Stations. Of those, injuries accounted for 30.6% of all medical encounters (n=825,429), more than twice as many encounters as the second leading cause, mental disorders (n=370,233 or 10.8%). Furthermore, injuries affected 242,478 Soldiers (21.7%), over two times more individuals than the secon d leading diagnosis group, ill-defined signs and symptoms (n=121, 078) (OTSG Decision Support Cel l). According to the Brigade Combat Team Physical Therapy Guide, six of the top ten reasons for a medical ev aluation board are musculoskeletal, with the top one being degenerative arthritis. In a deployed setting, musculosk eletal non- battle injuries account for 87% of all combat injuries. Non-combat related musculoskeletal injuries are estimated to occur 6.5 to 7 times more frequently than combat related injuries. More than 75% of all medical evacuations fr om the TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 55OIF and OEF Theater of operations were due to non-combat musculoskeletal injuries associated w ith back, knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, hand, wrist, and neck pain. The typical Soldier medically evacuated from O IF and OEF was a 29-year-old Soldier in need of additional musculoskeletal care, resulting in a negative impac t on operational capabilities. Injuries not only place an enormous drain on the medical system, but adversely impact the operational readines s of the force. Without an increased emphasis on prevention, early identification and management, and proper rehabilitation and reintegration, the Army and DoD will continue to expend enormous amounts of money on Servi ce Members with acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries and related pain. Leadership within PR&R at OTSG, in collaboration with partners inside and outside of DoD, developed the Musculoskeletal Action Plan (MAP). The MAP consists of three initiatives: injury prevention, early identification & management, and rehabilitation & reintegration. Over the course of the last year, the MAP working group developed several products to mitigate the impact of injury on Soldiers. In a move very similar to that seen with behavioral health providers, the Army has decided to move physical therapists into the brigade combat teams in order to ensure that injury prevention and treatment capabilities are forward on the battlefield. To support the Brigade Combat Team Physical Therapists (BCT PT), the group developed the Building the Soldier Athlete (BSA) program, as well as a reconditioning program designed for Soldiers on profile. In addition, the group developed a BCT PT short course that provides information on how to conduct injury prevention, along with human performance optimization programs and information on how to collect meaningful metrics or outcomes that commanders can use to assess the fitness level of their unit. Other products include development of a functional capacity evaluation that better correlates to the Soldier's military occupational specialty. This is an ongoing project between PR&R and those involved with the disability system. The ongoing Aquatic Pilot program standardizes aquatic rehabilitation and Warrior exercise and will pr ovide valuable feedback on pain and function of Soldiers enrolled in these programs as part of their rehabilitation and recovery fr om injury. The outcome of this program evaluation will determine the funding required for these programs across the enterprise. Future initiatives include a project with Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) on the best utilization of either athletic trainers or the Musculoskeletal Action Team (MAT) to decrease injuries, optimize perform ance, and ultimately decrease attrition in initial military training. Another initiative between Forces Command (FOR SCOM) and MEDCOM looks at how augmenting the BCT PT with a MAT impacts readiness and deployability by decreasing injuri es and optimizing performance in garrison, and how that carries over into the deployed environment. The paradigm shift from a disease model health care system to one centered on wellness and preven tion is no small matter. It requires hard work and proper resourcing.Without an increased emphasis on prevention, early identification and management, and proper rehabilitation and reintegration, the Army and DoD will continue to expend enormous amounts of money on Service Members with acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries and related pain TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 56 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.2.5.1 Develop an education and STRATCOM program focused on musculoskeletal injury prevention and human performance optimization, early identification, and management, rehabilitation, and reintegration. Recommendation 4.2.5.2 Integrate the Musculoskeletal Action Plan education program and concepts into the pain education and t raining program. Recommendation 4.2.5.3 Create an organizational structure, culture, and cl imate for awareness and execution of the Musculoske letal Action Plan by collaborating with DoD and stakehold ers within the Army (includes FORSCOM, TRADOC, MEDCOM, USUHS, AMEDD C&S, etc). Recommendation and treatment programs that emp hasize evidence-based practices. Capture relevant and available data to identify trends, cost, and return on investment. Utilize data to assist in the priori tization of resources. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 574.3 Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the F orce The third objective requires a renewed emphasis on sustaining the Force by focusing on Warrior and Fam ily Member pain care and management. This is at the heart of the w artime medical mission and it must be a primary obj ective to which all necessary resources are applied. In fact, it's und erstood in all the other objectives that taking car e of the Warrior is the primary mission of military medicine. The organiza tion must serve Active Duty military, their Benefic iaries, and Veterans with acute and chronic pain due to injury through st ate of the art clinical care, innovative clinical r esearch initiatives, and educational programs. It is easy to make the connection between improving care to Warriors and sustaining the force. Howeve r, the connection between improving care for Families and sustaining the force is not as universally understood. Family Members with significant pain management issues can be a constant source of stress and distraction for a Soldier and can interfere with duty performance while at home station or while dep loyed. Providing improved care to Family Members c an be the difference between a Service Member deciding to sep arate from the military or to reenlist. Healthcare professionals need to monitor and assess each patient for opioid compliance to ensure the safety a nd efficacy of the pain treatment. The focus should be on pain relief and improving physical function and quality of life. Regional pain centers of excellence, a standardized pain care approach throughout DoD, and educational p rograms will improve pain care to Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. Those in the WTU often have complex medic al issues, are taking multiple medications, and experience pain man agement challenges. Embedding or co-locating pain m anagement specialty care and support services and collaborati ng with the Warrior Transition Command should be pr iorities. Pain management plans should be incorporated into the Co mprehensive Transition Plans. Warrior and Family Care Figure 17: A Summary of Categories for Warrior and Family Care Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Fo rce Warrior and Family CarexThe Safe Use of Opioids xEmbed Pain and Pharmacy Resources xWTC Pain Survey Collaboration 4.3.1 The Safe Use of Opioids Objective: Implement a drug abuse assessment strateg y to ensure the efficacy of pain treatment and reduce aberrant behavior, abuse and ad diction with opioids. In the early 1980's opioids began to be used in the treatment of nonmalignant chronic pain, not just cancer pain. By the 2000's, increased prescribing, the availability of new opioids, and the failure to teach about chroni c pain and addiction, along with a zeal to do good, created a backdrop for the growing problem of prescription drug abuse. T he increase in the illegal diversion of prescription pain medication is a threat to public and personal heal th that must not be ignored. It is necessary to take any and all steps to help block the flow of opioid painkillers into the hands of nonmedical users, many of whom are young people and first-time abusers. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 58 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Trauma-induced anxiety, whether conscious or unconscious, is a powerful stimulus to seek reli ef from disturbing memories and often may lead to abuse of drugs and alcohol. The highest risk patients for unsafe behaviors have a \"trio diagnosis\" of psychiatric disease, substance abuse, and pain. These factors are interr elated and mutually reinforcing. This often describes many of our Soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. In som e studies, the prevalence of comorbid PTSD, TBI and pain exceeds 40% in the VA (Clinical Practice Guide line for Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain, 2010). When a trio diagnosis is present, all three conditions m ust be treated simultaneously. These patients are complex and need multidisciplinary evaluations. People living with chronic pain have increased rates of attempted and completed suicides, especially duri ng times of stress and loss. Patients receiving higher doses of prescribed opioids are at increased risk fo r overdose, which underscores the need for close supervision of these patients (Unintentional and undetermined poisoning deaths, 2004). Often patients, especially with a history of impulsivity or medication misuse, will choose to use lethal medication as a means of suicide. Suicides may be caused by poorly treated severe pain, intentional or unintentional overdose of opioids usually in combination with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other pain medicat ions. Misuse of opioids may be classified as aberrant behavior, abuse or addiction: 1. A behavior is considered aberrant if it deviates from the accepted medical treatment plan. Forty perc ent of the general population may exhibit aberrant behaviors (Webster and Dove, 2007). 2. Abuse is the use of any substance for a non-therapeutic purpose or the use of medication for purposes ot her than those for which the agent is prescribed. Approximately 50% of patients with at least one aberrant behavior can be classified as abusers (Webster and Dove, 2007). 3. Addiction is a primary chronic neurobiologic disease influenced by genetic, psychosoci al and environmental factors. The development of addiction requires a predetermined genetic framework with repeated exposures. This leads to impaired control over drug use, compulsive drug use, and continued drug use despite harm and because of craving. Only 1-2% of patients who abuse opioids are addicted to the drug and will engage in multiple aberrant behaviors (Webster and Dove, 2007). Failure to treat addiction when it is present can encourage a person to continue destructive and potentially deadly behavior. Abuse can usually be managed and addiction can usually be predicted. Knowing in advance whether a patient possesses these risk factors can assist a clinician in monitoring the progress of treatment and prevent abuse. The early recognition and treatment of mental disease are vital to the prevention of prescription opioid abuse. However, physicians, nurses, psychologists and others frequently report that they had little formal teaching about pain and even less teaching about addiction. Training on pain and addiction is almost non-existent. Medical pr oviders need two sets of skills to use opioids safely and effectively - prescribing opioids and minimizing the risk of abuse. Most problematic opioid use does not stem from the disease of addiction but from several other caus es including uncontrolled pain, fear of withdrawal symptoms, an untreated mental disorder, or recreational use to achieve a 'high.'

Each patient must be monitored and reassessed at each visit for his or her response to opioid treatment, including meeting goal s that are personal to the patient. The focus should be on: xPhysical function xPain relief xQuality of life A full list of safety proposals can be found in Appendix B-10. Figure 19: Increasing the Safe Use of Opioids Early InterventionAppropriate early intervention in the treatment of acute pain, such as physical therapy, will help decrease the need for narcotics. Utilizing physical therapy in troop medical clinic s, primary care clinics, and the emergency room will improve the treatment of acute pain and decrease its translation to chronic pain. Research is needed to determine the risk factors that influence this transition from acute to chronic pain, such as genetics, environment and behaviors. ScreeningComplete an assessment of drug-abuse risk in all patients on chronic opioids or preferably before initiating opioids. Knowing in advance whether a patient possesses risk factors can assist a clinician in monitoring the progress of treatment. Awareness will result in better clinical outcomes and fewer instances of drug abuse. The goal is not to deny pain treatment to any patient but to set and maintain a level for monitoring that is proportionate to the individual's risk. Recognize and Treat Substance- use DisordersCurrently, the poor continuity of care is a barrier to identification of problematic drug use. The visibility of patients with aberrant behaviors or previous history needs to be documented longitudinally. The number and persistence of aberrant behaviors is likely to be indicative of greater problems with managing opioid intake. If pain treatment with opioids is to be successful, prescription misuses must be managed. To accomplish this, it is necessary to monitor, chart over time, and address a patent's aberrant drug-related behaviors. Prescription Monitoring ProgramsApproximately seventy percent of DoD prescriptions are now filled in the civilian community (Joint Forces Pharmacy Seminar, 2009). Military Medical Facilities and VAs should uti lize state prescription monitoring programs for additional safety monitoring. DoD needs to encourage states to provide this information to practitioners to help identify high-risk patients, \"doctor shopping,\" and compliance. Urine Drug ScreeningUrine drug testing is part of the effort to monitor the clinical efficacy of treatment, determine compliance, evidence of unsafe illicit drug use, and to serve as a deterrent to inappropriate drug taking. An abuser of street drugs is at increased risk for abusing prescription medications. As a clinical monitoring tool, urine drug screenings confer significant be nefits as long as the limitations in interpreting results are well understood. Screening is recommended when aberrant behavior is suspected or confirmed, when changes in treatment are being made, and when pain persists despite aggressive treatment. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 60 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Recommendation 4.3.1.1 Implement a drug abuse assessment strategy in primar y care as part of routine practice to set a level o f monitoring proportionate to the individual's risk. Recommendation 4.3.1.2 Use a written opioid treatment agreement that outli nes patients' rights, expectations, and specifies t he consequences of noncompliance, and informed consent for all chronic opioid patients. Recommendation 4.3.1.3 Mandate that only one provider and his or her surro gate may prescribe for patients on chronic daily op ioids and that the program is supported by the pharmacy depar tment (Sole Provider Program). Recommendation 4.3.1.4 Mandate that all MTFs and VA Hospitals become activ e in the state prescription-monitoring programs to facilitate medication reconciliation and the safe prescribing of opioids (standard of care). Recommendation 4.3.1.5 Educate providers on pain and addiction, contraindi cations to opioid therapy, and the goals of a treat ment plan. 4.3.2 Embed Pain and Pharmacy Resources Objective: Provide appropriate pain management and cl inical pharmacy oversight in Warrior Transition Units. Pain management is a primary issue for the Warrior T ransition Unit patient population. WTU patients of ten have complex pain issues that require pain specialty consultation and close pharmacologic monitoring. Many of these patients have co- existing disorders, such as PTSD, TBI, depression, insomnia, and substance abuse. Obtaining an approp riate history and understanding the impact of these co-existing disor ders is critical to formulating an appropriate trea tment plan. Evaluating these patients in close collaboration wi th the primary care physician allows for a coordina ted care plan that can reduce the length of time that a patient is held in the WTU, reduce the risks inherent in fragmented c are, and facilitate the early detection of aberrant pain behavior in this hi gh risk population. Embedding pain and pharmacy res ources in the WTU on a periodic basis will also lead to improved pain management skills among primary care physicians in the WTU as a result of close collaboration over time. Pain patie nts who would benefit from interventional pain manag ement or other techniques can be referred directly for that care b y the embedded pain physician. WTU patients, especially those with other co-existi ng disorders (PTSD, TBI, etc), are at higher-than-average risk for adverse ou tcomes, including accidental overdose and death. Pain is the primary issue for many patients in the WTU. It is critically important to address pai n issues quickly, which can in turn facilitate return to duty or transition to the VHA system for care. Embedding pain and pharmacy resources can be expecte d to result in faster delivery of pain care, early identification of aberr ant pain behavior, and reduced length of stay in the WTU. Pharmacists' value to the health care delivery team is evidenced throughout the literature by the wide variety of in novative Medication Therapy Management Services (MTMS) currently being delivered at both local and regional levels. It ha s been demonstrated that MTMS, appropriately employed, can lead to a reduction in overall health care expenditu res through optimizing therapeutic outcomes, reducing adverse m edication events and reducing emergency room visits and hospital stays. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) is a pa rtnership of the pharmacist, the patient or their c aregiver, and other WTU patients, especially those with other co-existing disorders (PTSD, TBI, etc), are at higher-than-average risk for adverse outcomes, including accidental overdose and death FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 61health professionals that promotes the safe and eff ective use of medications and helps patients achiev e the targeted outcomes from medication therapy. If a pain physician and a pharmacist were embedded i n the WTU on a periodic basis they could see patien ts referred by primary care physicians. The schedule frequency of working in the WTU would be determined by the numb er and complexity of patients to be seen. Patients with u rgent pain issues that could not wait until the next scheduled WTU pain clinic would be seen in the regular pain clinic. For facilities that do not have a pain medicine subspec ialty trained physician, a primary care physician or other specialist with a n interest in pain and additional training in evalua ting pain patients may serve this purpose. That physician should have rea dily available consultation from a Regional Pain Cen ter of Excellence. MTM encompasses a broad range of professional activ ities and responsibilities within the licensed phar macist's scope of practice. These services include, but are not limi ted to, the following, according to the individual needs of the patient: xPerforming or obtaining necessary assessments of th e patient's health status xFormulating a medication treatment plan xSelecting, initiating, modifying, or administering medication therapy xMonitoring and evaluating the patient's response to therapy, including safety and effectiveness xPerforming a comprehensive medication review to ide ntify, resolve, and prevent medication-related prob lems, including adverse drug events xDocumenting the care delivered and communicating es sential information to the patient's other primary care providers xProviding verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and appropriate use of their medications xProviding information, support services and resourc es designed to enhance patient adherence with their therapeutic regimens xCoordinating and integrating medication therapy man agement services within the broader health care- management services being provided to the patient Recommendation 4.3.2.1 Provide access to a Pain Management Provider at all WTU clinics. Recommendation 4.3.2.2 Provide a clinical pharmacist capability to all WTU s based on each WTU's individual need for clinical consultation and medication reconciliation. 4.3.3 WTC Pain Survey Collaboration Objective: Collaborate with the Warrior Transition Command to revise the satisfaction survey to incorporate pain metrics. The Army's Medical Holdover (MHO) Satisfaction Survey Program began in August 2006. In February 200 7, issues at WRAMC resulted in a modification and expansion of this survey instrument. In June 2007, the MHO survey transitioned to the WTU Survey, with the goal of providing current, actionable data to leadership. The survey included questions about the Case Manager, Provider and Platoon Sergeant, as well as detailed questions about Medical Care, the Medical Evaluation Boards (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Boards (PEB) pr ocess, and living quarters. One of the trends in these surveys has been relatively low satisfaction among the WTs with their \"pain control.\" No other details about pain control or pain management were available from these sur veys. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 62 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE The WTC is revising the WTU survey. Task Force members met with representatives from the WTC and developed some additional questions regarding pain management. These additional questions (Appendix B- 11) will provide WTC leadership and MEDCOM with an increased amount of actionable information to improve deliver y of pain management services to the Warrior population and will assist the TF with measuring impact of i mplementation of Task Force recommendations. Recommendation 4.3.3.1 Incorporate recommended Task Force pain questions i nto the WTU Satisfaction Survey. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 634.4 Synchronize a Culture of Pain Awareness, Education, and Proactive Intervention The organization must synchronize a culture of pain awareness, education, and proactive intervention. This requires a unified approach to content, education, and trainin g, as well as leadership and organizational adaptio n on issues of pain management into the future. Patients and providers do not typically stay in one place for their caree rs. In the course of receiving their medical care, patients are treated in a variety of clinics and hospitals that cross re gional, Service, and network boundaries. Likewise, many providers are a s mobile as their patients. To the extent possible , the military should aim to standardize the orientation to and understan ding of pain and pain management in order to manage t he expectations of patients, providers, and leaders. The resources involved in synchronizing the pain ori entation of providers and patients will likely be s ignificant. Realigning existing efforts into one larger and more effective education program under a STRATCOM plan is a logic al first step in this process. The likelihood that this would transform the DoD and VHA into a model organization for pain m anagement that influences the practice of medicine, decreases unne cessary suffering, and improves overall readiness m akes this a worthy investment. Strong leadership is required to develop a new visi on of organizational pain management with new goals . The organization must examine all viable options for improving acute and chronic pain care, implement proven treatment modalities and process changes, measure results - learning from bo th successes and failures - and communicate the mis sion's new priorities through the chain of command across the enterprise. A major organizational reset with rega rds to acute and chronic pain care will require the following: xStandardization of pain management capabilities at e very level, as well as care from medical education to pain care delivery xHigh level integration and prioritization of pain m anagement recommendations that complement issues id entified in other Task Force reports and initiatives xDevelopment of an interagency pain management educa tional campaign that comprehensively addresses pain care issues among a wide variety of stakeholders xEstablishment of integrated, interdisciplinary and appropriately resourced pain medicine departments a cross the enterprise xStandardization of requirements for Pain Medicine C onsultants to the Surgeons General at the highest l evel xCreation of a DoD and VHA central pain management a dvisory board to drive policy and curricula develop ment, analyze data and coordinate research, as well as in form practice and establish future lines of inquiry to advance the field of pain medicine. The importance of this last recommendation - creati on of a central pain management advisory board - ca nnot be understated. An evidence-based, analytical approach to measuring treatment efficacy that leverages sta ndardized pain assessment tools, patient registries and a wealth o f longitudinal patient data, holds the potential to advance pain research and unify pain care well into the 21st century. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 65This requires leadership, including deans of medical and other health professional schools, directors of residency training programs in specialties and subspecialties that provide primary care, pr ofessional societies, and other stakeholders to ensure every trainee and health practitioner has the skills to assess and treat pain effectively, including chronic pain. Pain permeates many aspects of patient care and every medical discipline including medics, nurse s, anesthesiologists, neurologists, emergency physicians, physiatrists, pediatric and a dult primary care providers, pharmacists, psychologists, physical therapists, social workers and others. As heal th professionals graduate and treat patients of their own, they should know how to assess, diagnose, triage, and treat pain. This education should start in the health professionals' schools and continue through their post-graduate training (residencies and fellowships) into clinical practice with ongoing, staff educational opportunities. The DoD and VHA are involved in the medical training of many of those providing the patient care in DoD and VHA medical facilities. The Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS), AMEDD Center and School, and DoD GME programs are responsible for training everyone from combat medics to battlefield surgeons. Upon completion in 2011, the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) led by tri-service leadership will centrali ze all Army, Navy and Air Force basic and specialty enlisted medical training. The VHA trains health professionals in man y different specialties, both at undergraduate and post-graduate (GME) levels. These trainees may end up in the VHA, DoD, or civili an sectors as employees. In addition, the VHA routinely develops educational CME programs to advance the medical and clinical knowledge of their providers. The TF determined that existing DoD-controlled education and training programs lacked a consiste nt approach and orientation to teaching our providers about pain. The education curricula fell short in structuring the didactic content in a manner that allowed the students to integrate a comprehensive understanding of pain into their clinical practice. One exception noted by the TF was the U.S. Army-Baylor University D octoral Program in Physical Therapy. This program's curricula exemplified several of the concepts reco mmended by the TF. The Army-Baylor PT program successfully relates the pain-related content in its didacti c training (e.g. pathophysiology, anatomy, and pharmacology) to its clinical practicums. In addition to \"connecting the dots\" for in their pain-related curriculum, the PT doctoral program placed a special emphasis on patient involvem ent in the effective management of pain. Synchronizing the pain education and training within DoD- and VHA-managed institutions is an essenti al step in implementing a comprehensive pain management strategy. The pain-related curricula for all of the D oD and VHA education and training programs should be structured to create an enterprise-wide group of providers an d staff with a similar vision, orientation, and understanding of pain. This common orientation should be re inforced at every level of medical training and at every point on the vast continuum of medical care managed by the military and the Veterans Administration. Recommendation 4.4.1.1 Establish a core curriculum specific to pain manage ment to be integrated into all DoD graduate medical education and advanced medical training programs. Recommendation 4.4.1.2 Integrate core pain education and training content into AMEDD training courses (68W, Office Basic Cour se, Combat Casualty Care Course).Pain permeates many aspects of patient care and every medical discipline including medics, nurses, anesthesiologists, neurologists, emergency physicians, physiatrists, pediatric and adult prima ry care providers, pharmacists, psychologists, physica l therapists, social workers and others FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 66 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 4.4.2 Integration of Pain Management Recommendations Objective: Integrate TF recommendations and STRATCOM with other related DoD and VHA programs. The Pain Task Force is only one of the many programs or initiatives undertaken to improve qualit y of life and maintain readiness of the Armed Forces. Examples of the programs and initiatives that appear to share a common interest with the Pain TF are: xComprehensive Soldier Fitness xBehavioral Health Task Force xArmy Suicide Prevention Task Force xTraumatic Brain Injury Task Force xBehavioral Health Campaign Plan xMusculoskeletal Action Plan xPatient Centered Medical Home The Pain TF invited representatives from these initiatives to its working meetings and/or consulted with their representatives when developing recommendations. Continued collaboration and coordination between these v ery complementary processes are paramount to reducing duplication of effort, minimizing confl icting messages, and maximizing effectiveness of the Pain TF recommendations. The Pain TF recognizes the synergy involved in synchronizing related messages across a continuum of programs. For example, the Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) program's mission is to \"d evelop and institute a holistic fitness program for Soldiers, Families, and Army civilians in order to enhance performance and build resilience.\" The Pain TF evaluated pain management along a continuum of care from prevention to early identification and treatment to resolution. Resilience certainly plays a role in success ful pain management, therefore the prevention components in the education and training plans developed for the comprehensive pain managem ent strategy should echo the messages from CSF. The effort to \"connect the dots\" between programs with simi lar interests should lead to more effective and efficient communication of the respective program message s. Recommendation 4.4.2.1 Develop pain management STRATCOM in collaboration w ith DoD and VHA programs with related interests. 4.4.3 Pain Education Campaign Plan Objective: Develop a pain management education plan that addresses the full spectrum of stakeholders and issues. The sweeping changes recommended in this report will require the MHS and VHA to undertake an extens ive re- education and training initiative for medical staff, patients, leaders, and Family Members. The cur rent variation in orientation, understanding, and practice of pain management throughout DoD and VHA will not easily be corrected. In fact, the TF members have described the required action as essentially performing a massive \" re-boot\" on the military and VHA health care system's orientation to pain management. While certainly a chal lenge, it is well within the capabilities of these organizations to make this happen. The first step in this process will require the Uniformed Services and VHA to agree on a series of common core approaches, standards, and messages that will become the key to standardization across DoD and VHA. Ideally, th e Task Force recommendations will be the template for this strategy. The starting point is th e Task Force's goal of TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 67providing a standardized DoD and VHA vision and approach to pain management to optimize the care for Warriors and their Families. The core components of the pain management strategy should support, reinforce, and complement the existing pain- related strategies and initiatives in DoD and VHA (e.g., Comprehensive Soldier Fitness and A rmy Suicide Prevention Task Force). This will require a complex series of continuing coordination and staffin g among the Uniformed Services and VHA. Careful attention should be made to ensuring proper \"handoffs\" and continuity of m essages and strategies that are related but external to medical commands (e.g. resilience, safety, addiction). Conver sely, these non-medical but related initiatives should complement and reinforce the core messages from the pain strategy. Standardizing the core messages and organizational orientation to pain management across DoD and VH A will not only better manage the expectations of patients and staff, but also drive improvements in satisfaction and outc omes. Because of the overwhelming amount of variance in the understanding, approach, and practice of pain management across DoD and VHA, the \"re-boot\" necessitates an aggressive and highly visible campaign and edu cation plan. This will require resource-intensive STRATCOM, marketing, and education efforts that cr oss all organizations. Again, while efforts are undertaken to reorient and educate medical staff to this strategy and approach, a simultaneous effort must occur to educate patients, Families and leaders. This will involve more than diss emination of new policies or presentations and should be given the attention and emphasis commensurate with the seriousness of the iss ue to DoD and VHA. As organizations implement this new strategy, it will need to be supported and sustained by a robust education and training program. Under the guidance of a central pain management advisory board, a curriculum s hould be developed that addresses the full scope of pain-related education and training needs of patients, staff, Family Members, and leaders. The minimal requirements for the Pain curriculum are outlined in Figure 2 1 and a detailed curriculum can be found in Appendix B-12.

While there is variability in pain services between the DoD and VHA health care systems, ther e is also no consistency in pain management from MTF to MTF. This lack of consistency results in c onsiderable patient and provider frustration and a disruption of pain care plans as the highly mobile patient populatio n moves from facility to facility. MTF commanders are given no guidance on what pain services they should be providing or what r esources they should be obtaining. Many pain providers believe this lack of a consistent approach to pain care at all levels within the DoD and VHA systems has negatively impacted many Soldier health issues, such as opi oid abuse and misuse, patient suicide, PTSD, and TBI, among others. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 69A consistent approach to pain management throughout the continuum of care is vital to the health and safety of the Beneficiary population. This pain policy must start at point of injury, continue throughout the levels of car e, and persist at all Contiguous United States (CONUS) MTFs. The policy must also extend into the V HA and community health systems to enable continuity of care as patients move outside the MHS. To begin the process of developing this consistent approach, issues in battlefield pain management s hould be prioritized. Next, CONUS MTFs should implement a tiered system of pain medicine. In support of the pro posed tiered system, each TRICARE region will have at least one Regional Pain Center of Excellence (RPCoE) to serve as the pain consultation center for the region. Each RPCoE will work with the central pain management advi sory board on coordination of pain care policy among TRICARE regions. RPCoE services are outlined in Appendi x B-13. The creation of pain departments in MEDCENs will support a coordinated system of pain management services, including most of the RPCoE services except the Pain Rehabilitation Center. Tier I and II services are outlined in Figure 23. The Tier System corresponds to the VHA Stepped Care Model (see section 4.2.4), which conceptualizes the process of care based upon patient need for intensity and additional expertise. B y providing a consistent structure linked to the VHA Stepped Care Model, the tiered system will ensure consis tent delivery of pain medicine services throughout the DoD and serve as a model for integrated pain care in the nation.

This issue is central to the success of all other Task Force recommendations. Change of this magni tude will be difficult but DoD and VHA commitment to and leadership in this endeavor will likely be the benc hmark for pain management in the United States for the rest of this century. Recommendation 4.4.4.1 Adopt the tiered system of pain care.Many pain providers believe this lack of a consiste nt approach to pain care at all levels within the DoD a nd VHA systems has negatively impacted many Soldier health issues, such as opioid abuse and misuse, patient suicide, PTSD, and TBI, among others TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 70 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 4.4.5 Interdisciplinary Pain Management Departments Objective: Establish interdisciplinary pain manageme nt services to oversee optimum patient-centered, integrated pain care. The field of pain medicine encompasses patients with acute, chronic, cancer-related, and other forms of pain. Pain treatment services are provided by clinicians from various specialties including prim ary care physicians, anesthesiologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, pain medicine subspe cialists, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapist s, complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, and other allied pain-related specialties. The body of medical knowl edge representing the field of pain medicine is beyond the focus of any one of these contributing specialties alone. Fragmentati on of pain care is common without interdisciplinary collaboration and care coordination, and was a co mmon theme reported to the Pain Task Force during site surveys. Many sites were attempting to address pain needs in a subset of pain patients through a multidisciplinary pa in committee. Such committees typically meet periodically to review care plans for high risk pati ents who came to command attention as a result of difficult-to-treat pain, high utilization of health care resourc es, and/or high risk pain- related behavior. These multidisciplinary committees serve an important function by identi fying and tracking high risk patients and making a concerted effort to treat and refer them appropriately. Many members of these multidisciplinary committees expressed disappointment with the quality of pain care resourc es available for referrals within their respective TRICARE region. Only a small minority of sites had co-located pain care clinicians providing interdisciplinary pain care. MEDCENs are tertiary referral medical centers resourced to provide advanced medical se rvices above the services provided at the MTF level. Effective pain management within the MEDCEN requires an interdis ciplinary Pain Medicine Service that draws from multiple specialties but is philosophically independent and w orks collaboratively to provide integrated pain care. Co-location of these services in an Interdisciplinary Pain Center faci litates better communication and provides optimum patient-centered, integrated pain care. Poorly integrated pain services and fragmentation of care was a primary and consistent finding of the P ain Task Force. The risks inherent in not having pain providers co-located include the following: xDelays in establishing treatment plans xIncreased risk that aberrant pain behavior will not be detected in a timely manner xIncreased risk of losing patients to follow-up xUnnecessary variation in care provided xDecreased efficiency of pain specialists Individually and collectively, these risks lead to a decreased total number of pain patients treated with in the MEDCEN and an increased overall cost to the MHS. Command leadership must be responsible for ensuring that the Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Ser vice is appropriately resourced to meet its vital mission. This requires balancing inter-specialty competition for resources that may arise as the MEDCEN is tasked to meet the dual tertiary medical care and operational medical missi ons inherent in the MHS. The integration afforded by this consolidation and co-location of pain assets will allow for improved outcomes-based metrics for determining best practices. Development of a consistent pain c linical structure will reduce variability between DoD facilities and improve patient transitions into the VH A or community health systems. This approach will improve provider satisfaction, expand outcomes data collection, enha nce patient safety and, most importantly, improve patient care and satisfaction. Failure to appropriately address and res ource these requirements will increase fragmentation of pain care and risk of adverse outcomes in patients . FinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 71The TDA for each MTF should recognize the need for pain care appropriate to facility size, with each ME DCEN resourced for an Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service. One medical center in each TRI CARE region should be designated a TRICARE Regional Pain Center of Excellence (RPCoE). The RPCoE will represent the fulles t expression of the Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service concept (including co-lo cation of pain care specialists into an Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Center), serve as the regional pain consulting activity (Ap pendix B-13), and provide telemedicine pain support for the entire TRICARE region. Each RPCoE will coordinate with the c entral pain management advisory board on DoD- and VHA-wide pain issues and research activities. Additional resource requirements: xCreation of a new Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service within each MEDCEN. xDesignation of one Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service within each TRICARE Region as the RPCoE. xEstablishing an interdisciplinary pain committee at each MTF and establishing a telemedic ine link to the RPCoE for that TRICARE region. xStandardized credentialing. xUpdated productivity metrics that support the integrated model for delivery of pain care. xReallocation of personnel and resources to staff pain RPCoE. Recommendation 4.4.5.1 Establish TRICARE Regional Pain Centers of Excellen ce networked to every MTF in that region. Recommendation 4.4.5.2 Establish an Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Servic e at each major DoD MEDCEN. Recommendation 4.4.5.3 Define local capability requirements in establishin g the tiered system of pain care delivery. 4.4.6 Pain Medicine Consultants to Military Leadersh ip Objective: Develop requirements for Service pain con sultants to reflect an interdisciplinary, integrative approach to pain man agement. Army, Navy, and Air Force Surgeons General have consultants from the wide spectrum of medi cal specialties to assist them in making informed decisions. MTF commanders rely on subject matter experts withi n their commands for advice. Most recently, Army and Navy have added the position of Pain Consultant to their respective S urgeons General and the Air Force is considering a similar addition to their group of Surgeons Gener al Consultants. The current Army and Navy Pain Consultants are Anesthesiologists and graduates of pain medicine fellow ships. The TF recommends transforming pain management in the MEDCOM and MHS into an interdisciplinary and integrated specialty. It is essential to transform the current selection criterion of the Service pain consul tants to reflect this expanded perspective of pain management. This recommendation should not be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the qualifications of this essential consultant position. Pain Medicine is currently a recognized medical subspecialty with board certificati on through the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Board certification requires successful completion of an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) interdisciplinary pain medicine fellowship, demons trated expertise in the evaluation and treatment of acute, chronic, and cancer pain, and the achievement of a passing score on the board examination. Although the intellectual background and clinical practice of pain medicine is d erived from several traditional specialties (e.g., anesthesiology, neurology, psychiatry, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), and neurosurgery), entrance into pain fellowships was initially restricted to anesthesiologists. A s a result, these TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 72 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE fellowships have traditionally been focused on training in pain procedures and the vast ma jority of fellowship-trained specialists are anesthesiologists. The American Board of Pain Medicine (ABPM) was formed in 1993 to provide a standardized credential , and has credentialed more than 2,000 physicians who now practice pain medicine. The standardized credenti al for pain medicine specialists with ABMS board certification from these other specialties was based on a broa der examination that was more representative of the practice of comprehensive pain medicine. Beginning in 2001, ACGME fellowships began opening to Neurologists, Psychiatrists, and Physiatrists. More recently , in recognition of the weaknesses of the current training emphasis on procedures, fellowships have attempted to become ev en more comprehensive and integrated in their approach to pain medicine, despite the limitations of a one- year experience. Recently, at an American Medical Association-sponsored Summit on Pain Medicine Pr actice and Training, representatives from all medical specialties reached the consensus that training was inadequate and that in or der to provide more uniform standards in pain medicine care, training needed to be lengthened to at least tw o years with eventual development of separate residency training as a specialty. Pain Medicine Consultants should represent the integration concepts identified by the TF as critic al to the success of pain management. The Pain Medicine Consultant should: xPractice comprehensive pain care xHave up-to-date knowledge of the expansive field of pain medicine xBe involved in and/or knowledgeable about current pain research xHave experience leading an interdisciplinary pain team Completion of a Pain Fellowship is a significant accomplishment in the field of pain medicine, but i t should not be the sole discriminator for pain consultant selection. The Pain Medicine Consultant should be Board Certi fied in their primary medical specialty and be the most qualified person for that position. The VHA has established a National Program Director for Pain Management, and a Deputy National Program Director for Pain Management, in the VHA National Pain Management Program Office at the VA's Central Office (similar to the Service Surgeons Generals Offices). Illustrating the diverse nature of the field of p ain medicine, the National Program Director is a clinical Psychologist (PhD) and the Deputy National Program D irector is a certified Pain Medicine Specialist by both the ABMS and the ABPM from a background of primary care and Psy chiatry (MD). The American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain Society, and the International Assoc iation for the Study of Pain are all examples of large professional organizations dedicated to the practice, educatio n, and research of interdisciplinary pain medicine. All of these organizations choose their leadership from a variety of the disciplines involved in comprehensive pain medicine. The formation of a Pain Medicine Department (as discussed in Section 4.4.5) will ensure that the com prehensive and interdisciplinary nature of Pain Medicine maintains the ultimate goal of effective patient care . It will encourage Pain Medicine specialists to focus on goals of the Pain Medicine Department and not be obligated to the departmental needs of their individual parent specialties. The Chief of each medical facility's Pain Medici ne Department will not be from the same specialty, but will be a strong leader in the field of pain medicine. This varia bility is secondary to the diverse field of pain medicine but also to the diverse nature of the military. Given the tiered structur e of military medical facilities, not every facility will have the same specialties represented. For exampl e, the Chief at one facility might be a fellowship trained interventionalist while at another facility the Chief might be from Behav ioral Health. Recommendation 4.4.6.1 Develop pain medicine consultant selection criteria to identify the candidates who best represent the integrative and comprehensive nature of pain medicine. TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 734.4.7 Central Pain Management Advisory Board for Do D and VHA Objective: Establish an effective pain management ad visory board for DoD and VHA. The scope and magnitude of changes recommended by the DoD Pain Task Force require a central pain management advisory board to ensure effective implementation and stewardship of all pain care impro vements throughout the care continuum. The TF identified numerous critical tasks that should be managed by a c entral pain management advisory board (see Figure 25). The board will provide the necessary policy d evelopment, research, and curriculum development to move pain care for all DoD and VHA Beneficiaries forward to a new , more patient- centric level. It will also establish a pain continuum of care from onset of pain (battlefi eld or at home) through DoD health care centers to VHA centers and the community. The central pain management advisory board will operate as a center of excellence and will provide a \" central point of contact\" for establishing and maintaining pain care clinical standards, managing pain provider educati on programs, and providing recommendations for pain research priorities. No current DoD program is tas ked with this responsibility despite the correlation of pain with PTSD, suicide, and other mental and physical health issues identified in virtually every task force report since the beginning of OIF and OEF. Figure 24: Proposed Central Pain Management Advisory Board Structure The Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative (DVPMI) currently exists as a Congressionally- sponsored program that has historically focused on battlefield anesthesiology-related acute pain issues. F ormally known as the Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia & Analgesia (MARAA) program, DVPMI has func tioned as a tri-service collaborative group of anesthesia providers focused on battlefield pain management. They have spearheaded many recent battlefield advances in pain care, such as the military pain infusion pump, epidurals and continuous peripheral TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 74 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE nerve blocks in theater and on military evacuation aircraft, as well as the use of novel battlefield p ain infusions such as ketamine. The Pain Task Force recommends that the DVPMI, after expanding its membership to reflect the interdis ciplinary and integrated nature of pain medicine, becomes the DoD and VHA central pain management advisory board. Based o n recommendations of the Task Force, the DVPMI will have a greatly expanded mission for the Serv ices and the VHA in representing all medical specialties involved in acute and chronic pain management for Warriors and other DoD Beneficiaries. Figure 25: Responsibilities of a Central Pain Management Advisory Board Establish metrics for training success and practice impact that are evaluated annually and used to update and continuously improve the Pain Assessment Tool, driven by research Validate the Pain Assessment Tool Make policy and process decisions for Standardizing Pain Care Develop PASTOR content and maintain data repository Serve as the Battlefield pain management proponent and consultant organization Maintain responsibility for routine analysis, trend modeling, and the management and reporting of the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR) Develop and maintain all electronic pain order sets and policies Develop variations of the pain medication orders for all levels of MTFs within the DoD and VHA sys tems Maintain responsibility for program, data, and content responsibility for the Joint Regional Anesthesi a and Analgesia Tracking System (JRAATS) Fill research information needs by using shared information platforms from MRMC and CRMRP Develop priorities for future pain-related Clinical Practice Guideline developm ent Ensure that any recommendations complement existing initiatives and collaborate with all relevant orga nizations and initiatives on development of future recommendations Develop a curriculum that addresses the full scope of pain-related education and training needs of patients , staff, Family Members, and leaders Coordinate with the RCPoE on DoD- and VHA-wide pain issues and research activities Ensure effective implementation and stewardship of all pain care improvements throughout the care continuu m Provide the necessary policy development, research, and curriculum development to move pain car e for all DoD and VHA Beneficiaries forward to a new, more patient-centric level Ensure that clinical interventions are well-aimed and based upon proven methodology, and that current researc h findings can be rapidly translated into clinical practice Implement, monitor, measure outcomes, and sustain Pain Research STRATCOM initiative as part of its Operations and Maintenance responsibilities Review and update all electronic pain guidelines annually TFFinalTFFinalFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 75The reorganized DVPMI will serve as clinical advisor on the best integrated pain medicine pr actice, the foremost pain medicine educational resource, and the DoD and VHA pain research and outcomes evaluation focal point. As the Defense Pain Center of Excellence (DPCoE), the DVPMI will be responsible for assessing the effectiveness and safety of pain care. This initiative will seek to improve pain care communication among h ealth care providers throughout the care continuum, particularly as it relates to the control of opioid use and prevention of abuse. The DVPMI will provide a research foundation to study how current and future pain care technologies a nd medications impact Soldiers from battlefield injury to evacuation and throughout recovery and rehab ilitation. The interdisciplinary program will examine the influence of pain on PTSD, Soldier suic ide, social re-integration, trauma rehabilitation, disease progression, and other interrelated issues. The DVPMI will provide an administrati ve structure for a Military Pain Medicine Board of Directors (MPMBD) consisting of Air Force, Arm y, Navy and VHA senior expert clinicians and researchers experienced in the management of acute and chronic pain. The proposed DV PMI charter is provided in Appendix B-14. Additional resource requirements: xThe DVPMI will require an annual budget to support its DoD-wide clinical, educational, and resear ch mission. Personnel requirements for the DVPMI are outlined in the DVPMI Charter. DVPMI goals ar e consistent with established goals of the DCoE. xThe strategic pain mission of the DVPMI, which encom passes both the DoD and VHA health care systems, necessitates placement of the DVPMI at the level of the MHS. The Services Surgeons General would have to recommend placement of the DVPMI through the Sen ior Military Medical Advisory Council. xPossible \"homes\" for the DVPMI include: Uniformed Services University; Defense Centers of Excellence, Institute for Surgical Research. Establishing the updated DVPMI will greatly enhance pain care throughout the continuum and help break down inconsistencies in pain care delivery between the Services and MTFs. Partnership with th e VHA in pain management will contribute to a seamless transition of patients from DoD facilities to VA hospitals and bac k into their community. The DVPMI will reinforce the DoD Medical Services' leadership role in cli nical pain management, education, and research and will ensure that Pain Task Force recommendations result in lasting impr ovements in pain care. The DVPMI will continue to advance the care that DoD Beneficiaries are receiving, ensuring adoption of the latest and best pain management techniques and modalities from military and VHA health car e facilities. This effort will positively impact all aspects of a patient's care, recovery, rehabilitation an d return to a productive life. Recommendation 4.4.7.1 Establish the Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative (DVPMI) as the DoD and VHA central pain management advisory board for pain medicine issues. Recommendation 4.4.7.2 Task the DVPMI with the responsibility to establish pain care clinical standards, manage pain provider education programs, and provide recommendations for pain rese arch priorities. TFFinalTFFinalTHE WAY AHEAD 76 FOUO ARMY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCEV. THE WAY AHEAD Pain management has essentially changed very little since the discovery of morphine in 1805. Morphine r emains the battlefield pain management standard, despite identification of significant side effects in the most adva nced medical setting, much less a field environment. The military should continue to focus on improving the delivery of pain medicine by increasing the support and investment in research and technology efforts. It is imperative to minimize the current variation in pain management structure, practice , and orientation across the MEDCOM, MHS, and VHA. Overcoming these challenges will require a significant r eorganization, education, and training effort that will be most effective if pursued as a part of a DoD and VHA partnership. The Uniformed Services boast an impressive group of pain medicine physicians who received training in a variety of pain fellowships and training programs, both inside and outside of the military. These pain subject matter experts have been integral in ensuring that military pain medicine keeps pace with advances in practice and technology. Unfortunately, there are relatively small numbers of these specialists in the MHS therefore demand for their services will likely continue to exceed supply. In addition to ensuring ther e are continued efforts to grow and retain pain medicine specialists, the MHS must develop a supporting team of clinici ans and staff to assist specialists in addressing the pain management needs of their patients and staff. Pain medicine should be managed by integrated care teams which employ a biopsychosocial model of care. The standard of care should have objectives to decrease overreliance on medication driven solutions and c reate an interdisciplinary approach that encourages collaboration among providers from differing specialties. Efforts should be undertaken to eliminate stove-piping of pain care. The DoD should continue to responsibly explore safe and effective use of advanced and non-traditional approa ches to pain management, conduct ongoing research, and provide ongoing education for providers and patients. Onc e integrative medicine approaches to pain have been piloted and documented as safe, effective, and c ost efficient, they should become covered benefits for beneficiaries. There has been a systemic failure to establish pain as a priority beyond the narrow scop e of the JC 2001 directive. The MHS and VHA are in a position to exceed the standard. Leadership must establish pain as a priority, w ith an urgency that leads to practice changes. The lack of a common understanding of, and orientation to, pain among providers and medical staff prevents a unity of effort, resulting in suboptimal care as well as lost syn ergies and missed savings. The focus should be on prevention, followed by prompt and appropriate treatment that seeks to reliev e acute pain and eliminate progression to chronic pain when possible. The MHS can never keep up with the demand for specialty pain care unless it optimizes the pain management in primary care. Although there are many recommendations specifically targeting pain, the TF is convinc ed that one of most effective ways to improve pain management care and outcomes would be to improve health care delivery in the pr imary care setting. The medical home model allows for improvements in primary care, diagnosis and treatment managem ent, early identification of injuries and disease, rapid and appropriate follow up, and specialty re ferrals. The VHA Stepped Care model should be adapted for use in DoD.Pain management has essentially changed very little since the discovery of morphine in 1805, and morphine remains the battlefield pain management standard, despite identification of significant side effects in the most advanced medical setting, much less a field environment TFFinalTFFinalTHE WAY AHEAD ARMY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO 77Finally, the TF believes multiple synergies can be realized with the incorporation of a joint DoD and VHA str ategy. Warriors and Beneficiaries need and deserve a unity of effort across MHS and VHA. A synergistic a pproach provides for practice improvement and outcome management research, which uses data to inform best pract ices and create the next generation of clinical practice guidelines. With this approach, there is no Army, Nav y, or Air Force pain. Including the VHA in this strategy is essential and obvious. In addition to the number of MHS patients who eventu ally qualify and elect to receive care at VA facilities, there are many active duty Service Members who ar e in and out of the VHA system prior to separating from the military. The two organizations should cooperate and share com mon educational materials, venues, protocols, and formularies. A common standard would demonstrate the power of a unified effort and expedite achievement of the common goal: providing a standardized DoD and VHA vision and approach to pain management to optimize the care for Warriors and their Families . This goal can be realized.

TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-12 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE Appendix B: Supplement to Findings and Recommendations B-1 Standardized Pain Taxonomy Figure B-1.1: Pain Definitions PainPain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is always subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute PainAcute pain is a normal physiologic response, usually time-limited, to a noxious stim ulus that enhances survival by warning the individual of impending or potential injury or progression of disease. If the noxious stimulus persists, changes in the peripheral tissues and both the central and peripheral nervous systems can lead to sensitization that worsens and prolongs the pain from noxious stimulation. Appropriate management of acute pain may prevent the onset of the pathophysiologic processes that change the spinal cord and brain and lead to chronic pain. Chronic PainChronic pain continues beyond the normal time expected for healing and is associated with the onset of pathophysiologic changes in the central nervous system that may adversely affect an individual's emotional and physical well-being, cognition, level of function, and quality of life. Chronic pain serves no apparent useful purpose for the individual and may be diagnostically and therapeutically approached as a chronic disease process. Figure B-1.2: Extended Taxonomy List AddictionAddiction in the context of pain treatment with opioids is characterized by a persistent pattern of dysfunctional opioid use that may involve any or all of the following: xLoss of control over the use of opioids. xPreoccupation with obtaining opioids, despite the presence of adequate analgesia. xContinued use despite physical, psychological, or social adverse consequences. CentralCentral pain is a result of a primary lesion or dysfunction in the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord). Examples include pain from stroke, spinal cord injury, mult iple sclerosis, or fibromyalgia. DependencePhysical dependence on an opioid is a physiologic state in which abrupt cessation of the opioid, rapid tapering (e.g. when a patient forgets to take the medication), or administration of an opioid antagonist results in a withdrawal syndrome. Physical dependency on opioids is an expected occurrence in all individuals in the presence of continuous use of opioids for therapeutic or for non-therapeutic purposes. It does not, in and of itself, imply addiction. NeuropathicNeuropathic pain is a result of a primary lesion or dysfunction in the peripheral and/or central nervous system(s). Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, burning, sharp, shooting, and/or aching. (continued on next page) TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-13PeripheralPeripheral pain is a result of a primary lesion or dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system (peripheral nerves - nerves outside the brain or spinal cord). Examples include direct nerve trauma, post herpetic neuralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, or diabetic neuropathy. PhantomPhantom pain may be categorized as phantom pain or phantom sensations. Phantom pain is experienced as pain, tingling, itching, or numbness in the place where the amputated part used to be. Phantom sensation is the feeling that the amputated part is still there, but the sensations felt in the amputated part are not uncomfortable or painful for the individual. PseudoaddictionPseudoaddiction describes patient behaviors that may occur when pain is undertreated. Patients with unrelieved pain may become focused on obtaining medications, may \"clock watch,\" and may otherwise seem inappropriately \"drug seeking.\" Even behaviors, such as illicit drug use and deception, can occur in the patient's efforts to obtain relief. In contrast to true addiction, in pseudoaddiction, the behaviors resolve when the pain is effectively treated. Misunderstanding of this phenomenon may lead the clinician to inappropriately stigmatize the patient with the label 'addict.' In the setting of unrelieved pain, the request for increases in drug dose requires careful assessment, renewed efforts to manage pain, and avoidance of stigmatizing labels. PseudotolerancePseudotolerance is defined as a need to increase dosage due to factors other than tolerance (a diagnosis of exclusion), such as disease progression, new disease process, increased physical activity, lack of compliance, change in medication, drug interaction, or deviant behavior. RadicularRadicular pain is radiating pain and paresthesias (neuropathic pain) in the distribution of a specific nerve root. It may be associated with sensory loss or motor dysfunction in the distribution of the same nerve and paraspinal muscle spasms. ReferredReferred pain is pain that is felt at a location different than that of the injured or diseased part. The area where the pain is felt is usually innervated from the same spinal segment as that of the injured or diseased structure. Examples include angina (felt as left shoulder, arm, or jaw) or gallbladder (felt as right shoulder pain). SomaticSomatic pain is a well localized pain (\"pin point\") which results from acti vation of nociceptors located in the skin, deep soft tissues, muscles, bones, and joints. This pain is often described as aching or nagging and examples include pain associated with bruises, fractures, or wounds. ToleranceTolerance is a form of neuroadaptation to the effects of chronically administered opioids (or other medications), which is manifested by the need for increasing or more frequent doses of the medication to achieve the initial effects of the drug. Tolerance may occur both to the analgesic effects of opioids and to some of the unwanted adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, sedation, or nausea. The appearance of tolerance is variable in occurrence, but it does not, in and of itself, imply addiction. VisceralVisceral pain is a poorly localized pain which results from activation of nociceptors l ocated in the thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic viscera. This pain is usually poorly localized a ching or cramping, which may be referred to cutaneous sites, increasing the difficulty of localization.

Sample A total of 400 patients would be a good target. Eligibility criteria should include: 1) ability to read an d understand English, 2) newly combat injured Soldiers, 3) older Veterans who have military-related i njuries or other pain issues (e.g., chronic nonmalignant pain including a range of conditions [e.g., peripheral neuropathi es, lower extremity arthritis, non-specific LBP], cancer-related pain, post-surgical pain, and other acute pain), 4) inpatients, and 5) outpatients. The sample should include a balance of those with acute pain and chronic pain and inpatient and outpatients. Of these patients, every 10thpatient should be asked to participate in the descriptor validation (need about 40). 2. Setting Walter Reed Army Medical Center and selected VA Medical Centers (if willing to participate). 3. Design Cross sectional, one-time pain assessment. Patients will be asked to complete the DoD and VH A Pain Assessment Tool and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 7 interference items. Items 1, 2, and 4 are duplic ative of the BPI. Written instructions on completing the tools should be provided to participants. Every 10thpatient (forms should be numbered) should be given the DoD and VHA pain intensity scale without the descriptors a nd be asked to select the number corresponding to their pain, and then match scrambled descriptors to the numbe rs. 4. Demographic Data Age, gender, ethnicity, war veteran (e.g., OIF / OEF, Gulf War, Korean War, WWII), military statu s (e.g., active duty, retried, honorable discharge), type of pain (acute, chronic), cancer-related pain, inpatient vs. out patient, length of hospitalization at the time of the interview, and duration of pain, as well as occupational status and marital status. 5. Statistical Analyses Measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) will be calculated for subgroups (e.g., acute pain, chronic nonmalignant pain, cancer-related pain, newly injured OIF and OEF, inpatient vs. o utpatient. Correlational statistics will be used to demonstrate the magnitude of the relation between the mean BP I interference subscale score and pain intensity for the entire sample and selected variables. Indepe ndent rater content validation methods (qualitative analysis) will be used to validate the ability for respondents to correctly match the intensity descriptors to the pain intensity rating or Adult Faces Rating Scale. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-18 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE B-3 Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Practice Guidelin e 1. Goal Provide standardization of pain care for Wounded Warriors evacuating from Level III faciliti es. Establishment of a physician pain consultant at all Level III facilities in Theater. 2. Background The physiologic response to battlefield trauma and surgery involves a \"sympathetic surge\" or stress r esponse. The stress response involves a well-established sequence of physiologic and molecular events that include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, gastrointestinal ileus, hypercoagulability, prot ein catabolism, and immunosuppression, among other undesirable consequences that delay or prevent a Wounded Warrior's ful l rehabilitation and recovery. Effective pain management requires coordination of all medical providers throughout the evacuation sys tem to provide a multimodal approach to analgesia. The multimodal approach to analgesia involves using sever al different drug mechanisms of action and pain technologies which facilitates dose reducti ons of all pain medications used and therefore increases patient safety.3This approach to pain care requires the establishment of an Acute Pain Service (APS) at all Level III (and above) health care facilities directed by a physician trained in pain management. 3. Evaluation and Treatment A. The Level III facility Commander will appoint a physician (usually an anesthesiologist) to head the facility APS who is trained in pain management. This officer is responsible for managing APS activi ties, delegation of APS responsibilities, and maintenance of APS equipment. The APS physician will serve as the Commander's consultant on all facility issues related to pain management. B. All patients should have their pain assessed upon arrival and reassessed frequently using the DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Screen Tool. C. All patients should have a pain care plan established as part of their routine care. D. The patient's primary physician should consult the guidelines when developing a pharmacologic plan for managing pain. E. The patient's primary physician should consult the APS for complex pain issues or w hen advanced pain care technology or procedures are indicated (e.g. continuous peripheral nerve block, epidurals, pa in drug infusions). F. Pain nursing is a vital component of every APS. Each health care facility patient ward wi ll assign a member of the nursing staff to service as the ward pain nurse. The ward pain nurse will coordinate with the APS physician on all ward pain related issues. G. Effective pain management using multimodal techniques should not inhibit the timely diagnosis of compartment syndrome. In the case of combat trauma patients, if the surgeon is concerned about the possibility of compartment syndrome complicating a wound, the compartment should be surgically ope ned. The APS will work with the patient's primary physician to develop a pain management plan that facilitates early recognition of compartment syndrome. There is no evidence that supports the exclusion of any pain management technique due to concerns of compartment syndrome. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-19H. Use of advanced pain management techniques should be encouraged, including, but not limited to, continuous peripheral nerve block, epidurals, pain medication infusions, and patient controlled anal gesia. The APS physician is responsible for coordinating patient pain care issues and plans with the evac uation flight surgeon and receiving APS physician at the next receiving health care facility. Documentation of all advanced patient pain care techniques into the patient's electronic medical record is mandatory. I. The Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia handbook will serve as the APS reference text for pain care standards and issues ( www.bordeninstitute.army.mil or www.DVPMI.org ). J. Tri-service policies for pain management can be found at www.DVPMI.org . Strategic issues on evacuation pain management should be referred by the health care facility APS physician to the Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative organization ( www.DVPMI.org ). 4. Responsibilities The health care facility Commander is responsible for establishing the APS and effective patient pain care services. FinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-20 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE B-4 Electronic Pain Order Set Pain Medication Orders 1. PURPOSE To provide established guidelines for the safe and effective administration of pain medications at WRAMC and to educate and remind physicians and nurses of the appropriate pharmacological interventions to best manage the different types and levels of pain. Upon completion of the order set, the physician will have c reated an effective plan for each individual and particular patient. This appendix is meant to accompany and not over ride any previous guidelines on medication administration and does not preclude the use of clinical judgment when ordering pain medications. 2. APPLICABILITY This is applicable to all providers ordering and administering medications at WRAMC. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES A. Physician: 1) Identify candidates for Pain Medications. Responsibility lies with the attending physician. 2) Complete orders. 3) Evaluate orders every 72 hours to determine if changes are necessary. 4) Counsel patient and family or significant others on the purpose of the medication. B. Registered Nurses: 1) Provide patient education for selected patients using established patient teaching guidelines and document accordingly. 2) Initiate, maintain, change, and discontinue the medication therapy according to physician orders. C. Pharmacy Service: 3) Provide educational resources for patients, Families, and health care providers. 4) Ensure proper accountability, procurement, and wastage of pain medications, including providing a mechanism to restrict medications for individuals designated as using pain medications inappropriately. 5) Alert physicians and providers to potential drug-drug and drug-food interactions. 6) Ensure appropriate analgesics, including opioids, are maintained on nursing units/wards, as required. 7) Monitor physician orders to ensure that only one long-acting or delayed release opioid is prescri bed at one time and the use of meperidine (Demerol) is limited and appropriate (precautions about meperidine are necessary due to the toxic central nervous system effects of its active metabolite, normeperidine) . 4. PROCEDURE A. Opioids Orders for Surgical or Injury Site Pain / Breakthrough Pain Orders Physicians should consider these recommendations for the initial pain management for al l routine inpatients. For the purposes of this document, mild pain is considered to be a visual analogue scale (VAS - z ero = no pain; 10 = worst pain imagined) score of 1-4, moderate pain is a VAS of 5-7, and severe pain is a VAS of 8- 10.

Purpose During the course of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF and OIF), many Service Members have been severely wounded. Pain management for the severely Wounded Warriors has been a chall enge. However, the military anesthesiology community developed regional anesthesia techniques that have revolutionized pain management of the Wounded Warriors. These regional anesthesia techniques requi re close management at all times, whether the patient is in a hospital bed or being transported to another hospital. This appendix to the Theater Integration CONOPS describes requirements for a Regional Anesthesia Trac king System to allow for the required monitoring of Wounded Warriors who are benefiting from the advanced regional anesthesia pain management techniques. 2. Current Status The Army anesthesia specialists recognized the need to closely monitor Wounded Warriors who w ere receiving specialized regional anesthesia for pain control, especially during transportation. Therefore, they deve loped a Regional Anesthesia Tracking System (RATS) to monitor regional anesthesia patients as they traveled through the military health care system. RATS is a small, ad hoc information system. It allows medical providers to document pain management notes on a central server and notify receiving providers concerni ng patients with regional anesthesia that are being transported. RATS is a stand-alone system. It does not connect to or sh are data with any of the Military Health System (MHS) electronic health record systems, such as the The ater Medical Data Store (TMDS) or AHLTA. The anesthesia community has recognized the importance of the dat a collected in RATS. They have requested that RATS functionality be incorporated into a MHS electronic health record system. 3. Planned Improvements This Appendix includes requirements for incorporating the RATS functionality into TMDS. When inc luded in TMDS, it will be renamed JRATS. 4. Scenario . A. An airman working at a Forward Operating Base (FOB) is injured during a blast caused by a mortar round. The blast severs the airman's left leg at his knee level. The airman is quickly stabili zed at the scene and evacuated to the local Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) hospital. B. Surgeons at the EMEDS stop the bleeding and stabilize the wound. While in the Operating Room, the anesthesiologist installs a Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block (CPNB) catheter in the l eft leg to stop the pain from the traumatic amputation. The CPNB is connected to a Patient Controlled Bolus (PCB) device so that when the airman begins to feel pain, he can add more medication to the CPNB. C. After the surgery and installation of the CPNB, the anesthesiologist logs on to JRATS. The anesthesiol ogist searches for the airman in JRATS using the airman's last name and Social Security Numb er (SSN). After finding the airman, the anesthesiologist completes a Peripheral Nerve Block Procedure note. D. The EMEDS surgeon determines the airman needs to be evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) for more definitive treatment. The evacuation clerk logs on to TRAC2ES and completes a Patient Movement Request (PMR). In a few hours, the EMDS surgeon learns (through TRAC2ES) the airman will be evacuated in two days. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-25E. The next day, after evaluating the airman's condition, the anesthesiologist determines the pain is well controlled with the CPNB. The anesthesiologist then logs in to JRATS, finds the airman's record and documents a Clinical Note. When the anesthesiologist opens the Clinical Note, information from the anesthesiologist's procedure note is \"copy forwarded\" into the Clinical Note. The anesthesiologist completes the clinical note with any changes to the airman's status. F. On the day of the airman's evacuation, the anesthesiologist logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's rec ord and documents a Transfer Note. When the anesthesiologist opens the Transfer Note, the previous day's Clini cal Note is \"copy forwarded\" into the Transfer Note. The anesthesiologist documents any changes in the Transfer Note. Within the Transfer Note, the surgeon clicks the \"New Location\" button which populates the Transfer Note with the airman's receiving location (LRMC). The \"New Location\" button also triggers an email to be sent to the LRMC Pain Management Team notifying them of the impending arrival of the airman with advanced pain management technologies on board. G. The designated member of the LRMC Pain Management Team logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's rec ord, and reviews the pain management notes entered by the EMEDS anesthesiologist and surgeon. LRMC Pain Management Team uses the JRATS pain management notes to prepare for continuing care for the airman. H. After evaluating the airman at LRMC, the LRMC surgeon determines the airman needs to go to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) for further treatment and rehabilitation. The LRMC surgeon and Pain Management Team further determine the CPNB should remain during transport of the patient. I. The LRMC anesthesiologist logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's record and documents a Transfer Note. When the LRMC Pain Management Team clicks the \"New Location\" button, an email is sent to the WRAMC Pain Management Team alerting them to the airman's impending arrival. J. The designated member of the WRAMC Pain Management Team logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's record, and reviews the pain management notes. The pain management notes assist the WRAMC Pain Management Team to prepare for continuing care for the airman. K. Two days after arriving at WRAMC, the surgeon determines the CPNB can be discontinued. When the Pain Management Team member discontinues the CPNB, a clinical note is documented in JRATS with this information. L. The WRAMC surgeon determines the airman should be transferred to a VA Poly Trauma Center for rehabilitative care. The receiving VHA provider is able to view (via Bidirectional Health I nformation Exchange) all of the theater notes documented on the airman, including the pain management notes entered through JRATS. Using these notes, the VHA provider is able to establish a continuing pain management plan during the airman's rehabilitation. 5.

Each patient has an ongoing relationship with a p ersonal physician trained to provide first contact, continuous and comprehensive care. 2. The personal physician leads a team of individual s, at the practice level, who collectively take res ponsibility for the ongoing care of patients. 3. The personal physician is responsible for providi ng for all of the patient's health care needs or taki ng responsibility for appropriately arranging care with other qualified p rofessionals. This includes care for all stages of pain care: preventive care, acute care, chronic care, and end of life care. 4. Care is coordinated and/or integrated across all elements of the complex health care system (e.g., su bspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes) and the patient's community (e.g., family, public and private community-based services). Care is facilitated by r egistries, information technology, health informati on exchange and other means to assure that patients get the indicat ed care in a culturally and linguistically appropri ate manner when and where they want and need it. 5. Enhanced access to care is available through syst ems such as open scheduling, expanded hours and new options for communication between patients, their personal phys ician, and practice staff. 6. Quality and safety are hallmarks of the medical ho me: A. Practices advocate for their patients to support the attainment of optimal, patient-centered outcome s that are defined by a care planning process driven by a comp assionate, robust partnership between physicians, patients, and the patient's Family. B. Evidence-based medicine and clinical decision-sup port tools guide decision making. C. Physicians in the practice accept accountability for continuous quality improvement through voluntar y engagement in performance measurement and improveme nt. D. Patients actively participate in decision-making and feedback is sought to ensure patients' expectat ions are being met. E. Information technology is utilized appropriately to support optimal patient care, performance measur ement, patient education, and enhanced communication. F. Practices go through a voluntary recognition proc ess by an appropriate non-governmental entity to demonstrate that they have the capabilities to prov ide patient centered services consistent with the m edical home model. G. Patients and Families participate in quality impr ovement activities at the practice level. 7. Assessment of practice success appropriately reco gnizes the added value provided to patients who hav e a patient- centered medical home. The productivity metric stru cture should encompass the following in its framewor k: A. Reflect the value of physician and non-physician staff patient-centered care management work that fa lls outside of the face-to-face visit. B. Account for services associated with coordination of care both within a given practice and between consultants, ancillary providers, and community res ources. C. Support adoption and use of health information te chnology for quality improvement. D. Support provision of enhanced communication acces s, such as secure e-mail and telephone consultation . E.

TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-29B-9 Stepped Care Model and VHA Directive VHA DIRECTIVE 2009-053 Pain Management 1. PURPOSE This Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive provides policy and implementation procedures for the improvement of pain management consistent with the VHA National Pain Management Strategy and complia nce with generally accepted pain management standards of care. 2. BACKGROUND A. The VHA National Pain Management Strategy, initiated November 12, 1998, established Pain Management as a national priority. The overall objective of the national strategy is to develop a comprehensive, multicultural, integrated, system-wide approach to pain management that reduces pain and suffering and improves quality of life for Veterans experiencing acute and chronic pain associated with a w ide range of injuries and illnesses, including terminal illness. VHA employs a stepped-care mo del of pain care that provides for management of most pain conditions in the primary care setting. This is supported by ti mely access to secondary consultation from pain medicine, behavioral health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, specialty consultation, and care by coordination with palliative care, tertiary care, advanc ed diagnostic and medical management, and rehabilitation services for complex cases involvi ng comorbidities such as mental health disorders and traumatic brain injury (TBI). B. Definitions 1)Stepped Care. Stepped care is instituted as a strategy to provide a continuum of effective treatment to a population of patients from acute pain caused by injuries or diseases to longitudinal managemen t of chronic pain diseases and disorders that may be expected to persist for more than 90 days, and in some instances, the patient's lifetime. i. Step One, Primary Care. Requires the development of a competent primary care provider workforce (including behavioral health) to manage common pain conditions. To accomplish this, primary care requires the availability of system supports, family and patient education programs , collaboration with integrative mental health-primary care teams, and post-deployment program s. ii. Step Two, Secondary Consultation. Requires timely access to specialty consultation in pain medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, Polytrauma programs and teams, and pain psychology; occasional short-term co-management; inpatient pain medicine consultation; and the collaboration of pain medicine and palliative care teams. iii. Step Three, Tertiary, Interdisciplinary Care. Requires advanced pain medicine diagnostics and pain rehabilitation programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). 2)Quality of Life. Quality of life is now accepted by the medical field as a standard outcome measure of effectiveness of treatment, including treatment of pain. The concept includes such factors as level of physical and psychosocial functioning (e.g., in roles at work and home) and treatment satisfaction. 3)The Biopsychosocial Model. The Biopsychosocial Model takes the position that the causes and outcomes of many illnesses often involve the interaction of physical and pathophysiologic factor s, psychological traits and states, and social-environmental factors. Effective treatment planning accounts for the salience of these factors in the precipitation and perpetuation of illness and illness-related disability. FinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-30 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 4)VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee. The VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee, a multidisciplinary Field Advisory Committee, was established to support the National Pain Management Program Office in meeting its responsibilities . The Committee is comprised of representatives from key clinical disciplines involved i n provision of quality pain care as well as representatives from other VHA offices, including, but not limit ed to, the Employee Education System (EES), Office of Research and Development (ORD), Mental Health, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Primary Care, Nursing, Rehabilitation, and Pharmacy Benefits Management. C. Specific Objectives The updated VHA National Pain Management Strategy aims to: 1) Establish expectations for attitudes, knowledge, and skills in pain management in primary, secondary , and tertiary care. 2) Create system-wide VHA care standards for pain management, appropriate to setting and professional roles that reduces suffering and improves quality of life. 3) Ensure that pain assessment is performed in an appropriately timely, regular, and consistent manner along the continuum of care from acute to chronic pain in all VHA settings. 4) Ensure that pain treatment is prompt and strives to achieve pain management objectives along the continuum of care from acute to chronic pain in all VHA settings. 5) Include patients and families as active participants in pain management. 6) Provide for appropriate level and frequency of monitoring for improvement in outcomes of pain management including pain control, physical and psychosocial function, quality of life, and complications. 7) Provide for an interdisciplinary, multimodal approach to pain management that emphasizes optimal pa in control, improved function, and quality of life. 3. POLICY It is VHA policy that VHA's National Pain Management Strategy and the on-going work of the VHA Nati onal Pain Management Program Office and Coordinating Committee is to be used to guide the development of local policies related to pain management. 4.

FOLLOW-UP RESPONSIBILITY The Office of Patient Care Services (11), Medical-Surgical Services (111) is res ponsible for the contents of this Directive. Questions may be referred to the National Program Director for Pain Management at (203) 937-38 41. 7. RESCISSIONS VHA Directive 2003-021 dated May 3, 2003, is rescinded. This VHA Directive expires Oc tober 31, 2014. STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT The accepted standards of pain management are: 1. PAIN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT Procedures for early recognition of acute and persistent pain and the design of prompt, longitudinal, and effective treatment must be implemented at each medical facility. A. VHA has implemented \"Pain as the 5th NOTE: A toolkit for implementation of this standard is available at the VHA pain management Web site at: Vital Sign\" in all inpatient and outpatient clinical settings to ensure consistent recognition and assessment of pain intensity and pain's effects on function and quality of life. www.va.gov/pain_management . FinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-33B. Routine assessment for the presence of pain is required for non-communicative patients, as well as for patients who communicate well. Assessment in this circumstance requires an approach that invol ves a range of methods including: direct observation by clinical staff, input from family members , and close monitoring of the effects of pain management interventions. NOTE: A consensus statement that provides additional guidance for pain screening in the non- communicative patient is available at the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_ management . C. Once pain symptoms are recognized, a timely and appropriate comprehensive pain assessment is performed, a pain treatment plan is developed and implemented, and reassessment of the effectiveness of the plan is completed. Each of these parameters must be documented. NOTE: To ensure consistency of documentation and to facilitate pain outcomes monitoring, all facil ities are strongly encouraged to use the pain reminders and dialogs sponsored by the VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee. These reminders and dialogs can be downloaded from the Clinical Reminders Web page at: vista.med.va.gov/reminders . D. Patient and family education regarding pain and pain management is included in the treatment plan. NOTE: Patients are encouraged to be active participants in pain management. E. Evidence-based, to the degree possible, pain management protocols are implemented in all cli nical settings. 1) Using guidelines. Published clinical practice guidelines and related resources providing infor mation regarding these pain management protocols are available on the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_management and at: www.healthquality.va.gov . 2) Patient participation in decision-making. Most uncomplicated pain conditions, for whic h the responsibility for assessment and management rests with the primary care provider or team (traine d to implement a stepped care approach, as needed), respond best to one or more of several therapies readily available and coordinated in primary care settings. These therapies emphasize continuing patient participation in decision-making and clinical planning, patient instruction in self -management, and appropriate levels of family participation. NOTE: Standards for training in the use of these therapies in a primary care and other settings is available on the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_management . 3) Implementing stepped, consultative care i. Integrating behavioral health in primary care of chronic pain is essential to optimize clinical outcomes and provide essential support to the medical care of patients. Chronic pain can be a complex, biopsychosocial condition involving cognitive, psychosocial, and substanc e abuse issues as well as medical and mental health comorbidities. The complexity of chronic pain management is often beyond the expertise of a single practitioner, especially for patients whose pain problems are complicated by homelessness, PTSD, cognitive impairment from TBI and other conditions, including depression, combat injuries, Polytrauma, substance abuse, and other complex psychosocial issues. The experience of pain both impacts and is affected by social and fami ly functioning. Veterans with complex chronic pain conditions are best served by a comprehensi ve, interdisciplinary approach within a continuum of care that is informed by a biopsychosocial model. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-34 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE NOTE: The VHA Pain Management Program is presently developing models of pain care through inter-program collaboration with various VHA program offices, as listed below. Educational programs are being planned and executed through Employee Education System (EES) to present such collaborative clinical planning. New program models to achieve the objectives of this Directive will be found on the VHA pain management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_ management as they are implemented. ii. Primary care providers must have access to pain consultative and treatment sources to effecti vely evaluate and manage these complexities. Access must be timely to the needs of the Veteran. These sources include Pain Medicine specialists, interdisciplinary pain clinic s and centers, Hospice and Palliative Care Services, Mental Health services, Social Work services, and Cli nical Chaplaincy services, among others. If such consultative services are not readily available at a specific facility, the facility Director, or designee, is responsible for arranging with the VIS N Director reasonable and timely access to these consultative services through inter-facility collabo rations within the VISN or through community resources, as appropriate. iii. At least one tertiary, interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program must be avai lable in each VISN to manage more complex cases. iv. Acute pain management is expected in every environment, including provision for seamle ss pain management during transportation from primary care and secondary care facilities to tertiary care. F. Effective pain management often requires consideration of the use of one or more of several different classes of medications and other treatment modalities prescribed simultaneously. Treatment may bec ome particularly complex in the context of several causal or perpetuating mechanisms and comorbidi ties. The potential for each modality for improving pain treatment outcomes is weighed against the potential for drug- drug and drug-disease interactions, side effects, and toxicities. Patients with cognitive defici ts from disease or TBI are particularly vulnerable when drug regimens increase in their complexity. Evide nce-based stepped care treatment algorithms for managing different types and complexities of chronic pain an d its comorbidities is readily available to providers as is training appropriate to their practi ce setting. G. The safe and effective use of opioid analgesics for the management of pain, particularly complex chr onic pain conditions, requires special attention to personal and public health risks. 1) Risks include adverse side effects of these medications, development of addiction, and risks to the public through diversion of prescribed medications. 2) The potential for fatal overdose either by accident or in a suicidal attempt in patients suffering from multiple disorders or with polypharmacy must be considered in prescribing opioids and other medications, including prescribing for pain patients on opioid substitution programs. NOTE: Published guidelines for chronic opioid therapy, pain polypharmacy, and management of pa in in the post-operative setting are available to guide the use of these medications. These guidelines are available at www.healthquality.va.gov and on the VHA pain management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_management . Completion of a written opioid pain care agreement is strongly encouraged to document provider-patient discussion of potential risks and benefits of opioids, pro vider and patient responsibilities related to their use, and the parameters for continued use. In this context, other methods such as random urine drug monitoring, frequent clinic visits and opioid renewal clini cs may be useful to ensure adherence and safety. Further information about how to manage opioid treatment agreements can be found at www.healthquality.va.gov and on the VHA pain management Web site, www.va.gov/pain_management . TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-35H. As pain management is an integral part of palliative and end-of-life care, the expertise of hos pice and palliative care clinicians needs to be available to all patients with a serious, life-limiting i llness. I. Patient satisfaction with pain management is monitored on an on-going basis. 2. EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT A. A multidisciplinary pain management committee must be established at each VHA facility t o provide oversight, coordination, and monitoring of pain management activities and processes to faci litate the implementation of the VHA Pain Management Strategy in compliance with evidence-based standard s of pain care and adherence to requirements of external accrediting bodies. In some facilities, this func tion may be the responsibility of an overarching clinical practice committee. In each facility, proces ses will be developed and implemented to evaluate the success of meeting the goals of the VHA National Pain Management Strategy on a regular basis, at least yearly. B. The quality of pain assessment and the effectiveness of pain management interventions must be monitored. Measures may include: adherence to published clinical practice guidelines, timeliness of pain tr eatment, adequacy of pain control, medication safety, appropriate use of stepped care treatment including behavioral health and pain medicine consultation and treatment, and clinical outcomes such as improvements in pain control, patient satisfaction, physical and psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. NOTE: A VHA Pain Outcomes Toolkit is available at www.va.gov/pain_management/docs/outcomes.doc . C. All elements of pain management must be documented in the patient record, often in the initial visit or in subsequent visits as clinically indicated over time. NOTE: For clinical tips, clinicians may want to consult www.va.gov/pain_management/docs/outcomes.doc and www.va.gov/pain_management . Elements of pain management include: 1) Medical History. The patient's prior experience of pain and pain-related diseases, disor ders, injuries and comorbidities. 2) Routine Screening for Pain. Routine screening for the presence and intensity of pain using \"Pain as the 5thVital Sign,\" or a validated alternative tool for special populations, must be documented. This must be accomplished in association with outpatient or home visits and in residential and inpatient s ettings at a frequency that is appropriate to the specific clinical setting and problem. Screening for pain in no n- communicative patients must be documented by the use of the code \"99,\" which indicates the pain assessment occurred in lieu of a verbal assessment. NOTE: It is important to appreciate that the goals of this method include the timely monitoring of pain treatment effectiveness, and the identification of new or previously undetected pain concerns. 3) Comprehensive Pain Assessment. NOTE: Use of pain reminders and dialogs is enc ouraged. 4) Individualized Plan of Care. An individualized goal-oriented, prioritized pain management pla n of care that may include, but is not limited to: i. Pharmacologic interventions, including: a. The use of mechanism-specific and condition-specific treatment algorithms, TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES A-36 FOUO PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE b. Appropriate trials of individual medications to determine effectiveness (pain control and function), and c. Cessation of medication without effectiveness. ii. Prescribing opioid analgesics for regular use, documentation of: a. An opioid pain care agreement, which is strongly encouraged, if not mandated (according to local facility policy), b. Effectiveness, including pain control, function, and quality of life, and c. Safe storage and management in the home. iii. Non-pharmacologic interventions, to include: a. Educational interventions to improve self-management; b. Psychological interventions, including established psychotherapies for chronic pain and associated sequelae (e.g., Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy), in conjunction with other treatments as appropriate, particularly for patients with unremitting chronic pain that demonstrate limited response to other treatment approaches; c. Family interventions and community supports; d. Rehabilitation therapies; e. Complementary therapies as available; and f. Pain medicine specialty procedures, such as injections, nerve blocks, ablations, and neuromodulation. 5) Evaluation. Periodic evaluation of adherence, response to interventions, and achievement of time- limited therapeutic goals in the pain management plan, should include: i. Moderation or alleviation of pain; ii. Satisfaction with current treatment plan; iii. Stabilization or improvement in physical and psychosocial function; iv. Stabilization or improvement in salient comorbidities and overall health status; v. Adherence to opioid pain care agreement, if used; and vi. Adherence to pain management plan of care. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-376) Education. Pain education for family and patient that may include the availability of pain specific programs, such as: formal pain school; pain relevant Web sites; printed pain management patient education materials at or below the ninth grade literacy level; and hospital video networks. Veterans' learning needs, readiness, preferences and barriers should be considered to ensure that messages are presented in an understandable format which the Veteran finds helpful. This education needs to occur: i. During hospitalization, as soon as clinically appropriate and acceptable to the patient. ii. At discharge from hospital or facility. iii. In all outpatient treatment settings when pain is assessed or treated. 3. CLINICIAN COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE IN PAIN MANAGEMENT A. All clinical staff (e.g., physicians, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, therap ists, and chaplains), should have orientation related to the principles of pain assessment and management upon being hired, as well as ongoing education and training. While general principles of pain management apply to all VHA clini cians, each staffing group must clearly delineate its specific pain management responsibilities and abilities and ensure that all its members receive training adequate to meet these responsibilities and to maintain these abilities. Education and training must be relevant to the specific needs of the patient population and cl inical setting that provider groups serve, and should include, as appropriate, pharmacologic (especially opiates and including education regarding physical dependency, pseudoaddiction, tolerance, and potential for addiction, overdose and/or suicide; appropriate titration; side effects and benefits) and non-pharmacologic (including psychological, physical, complementary, and spiritual) treatment modalities. NOTE: Annual pain management education for clinical staff is highly recommended. Such educati on should include: for physicians, PAs, CRNPs, and nurses, 5 hours of continuing education in pain management, which can be obtained by attending continuing medical education (CME) and continuing education unit (CEU) offerings, completing online self-studies for CME and CEUs, or earning the cr edits in other ways and submitting evidence of the credits to the education staff at their facility. When feasible, facilities are encouraged to provide interactive \"workshop\" formats for learning specific cognitive and behavioral skills. Courses and educational tools for facilities can be found on the VHA pain management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_management . It is highly recommended that Pain Medicine Physician specialists obtain and maintain one or more of the following certifications: Pain Medicine speci alty board certification by the American Board of Pain Medicine; Pain Management subspecialty board certifi cation by the American Board of Anesthesiology, the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitati on, or the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology; Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine subspeci alty board certification by one of the various ABMS boards granting this certification. It is recommended that they should also obtain yearly pain-relevant continuing medical education. In addition, innovative training programs are being developed and evaluated to ensure the adequacy of the pain management workforce for providing quality pain management to all Veterans regardless of location. B. VHA standards for pain management will be communicated by training faculty to all medical students, allied health professional students, residents, and interns who provide patient care; appropriate education in pain assessment and management will also be provided to these students and trainees.

Name The Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative (DVPMI). Defense represents all United States Armed Forces personnel and dependents. Veterans represent the organization's commitment to enhancing the continuity of effective pain care of Veterans and retirees into the health care systems of the Veterans Heal th Administration (VHA) and the community. 2. Objective The DVPMI will serve the DoD and VHA as a clinical advisor of best integrated pain medicine pr actice, a pain medicine educational resource, and a pain research and outcomes evaluation focal point. As the Defense Pain Center of Excellence (DPCoE), the DVPMI will be responsible for assessing the effectiveness and safety of pain care for DoD and VHA Beneficiaries. The DVPMI will provide an administrative structure f or a Military Pain Medicine Board of Directors (MPMBD) consisting of Air Force, Army, Navy and VHA seni or expert clinicians and researchers experienced in the management of acute and chronic pain on the battlefield, at sea, in the air, and at home through recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration. 3. Purpose Based on the best available evidence, the DVPMI will develop consensus recommendations for the Air F orce, Army, Navy, and VHA integrated pain management communities for improvements in pain medicine pr actice, education, and research. The DVPMI will be the proponent of world class pain management services for m ilitary and VHA Beneficiaries. The organization will serve as an advisory board (MPMBD) to the indiv idual service pain consultants to the Surgeons General and VA's Undersecretary for Health Director. The DVPMI will contribute directly to pain-related research, development, tests, and eval uations (RDT&E) sponsored by the Services or the Defense Health Program, or by other Federal organizations that spons or research, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. Direct contri butions include proposing and executing clinical and nonclinical trials as a Principal Investi gator and establishing clinical trial resources (e.g., clinical sites, subject recruitment, protocol development and exec ution, Institutional Review Board coordination, and analytical and report-writing capabilities). The DVPMI will s upport the compilation, organization, assessment, and dissemination of pain-related research information and outcomes. 4. History The DVPMI began as a congressionally directed program called the Army Regional Anesthesia a nd Pain Management Initiative in 2000. Upon recognition that pain issues required a tri-service approach, th e organization was re-named the Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia (MARA A) in 2005 to include Air Force and Navy partners in military pain medicine recommendations. Fin ally, the acknowledgment that military and VHA Beneficiaries require an integrated response to acute and chronic pain iss ues throughout the patient care continuum, led to the current DVPMI structure. The establishment year for the organization remains 2005 when it first became tri-service. TFFinalTFFinalAPPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE FOUO A-49ARTICLE II: MANAGEMENT 1. DVPMI Executive Administration The DVPMI Executive Administration serves as the non-voting administrative core of employees for the organization. The Chief Executive Officer will be appointed.
