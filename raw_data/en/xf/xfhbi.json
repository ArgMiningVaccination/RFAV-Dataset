In Phase 3 trials of the vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine proved to be only 62 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 as opposed to Pfizer and Moderna which were found to be nearly 95 per cent effective. The Australasian Virology Society Tuesday had also supported the pause of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but after some internal debate, the president of the society changed his position. AstraZeneca is at the centre of Australia's vaccine strategy and the government has already secured 53.8 million doses of it. Australia has [reported](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/#:~:text=Australia%20Coronavirus%3A%2028%2C647%20Cases%20and%20909%20Deaths%20%2D%20Worldometer) 28,647 cases of Covid-19 and 909 deaths so far.

Several scientists and researchers called out the Bhutanan biomedical centre, a Brazilian biologic research centre, for releasing only partial data that raised the country's expectations of the vaccine and led to premature celebrations. Last week, the researchers had 'celebrated' a 78 per cent efficacy of the Chinese vaccine against mild-to-severe cases of Covid, according to the report. Brazil has [reported](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/brazil/) 81,95,637 cases of Covid-19 and 2,04,726 deaths so far.
