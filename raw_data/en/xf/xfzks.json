Community access to vaccines Many senior living communities provide their residents with access to the vaccine and continue to enforce COVID-19 protocols to keep residents and staff safe. While most communities typically follow CDC guidelines as a baseline protocol, restrictions vary by community and state. It's always important to check the COVID-19 policies in place at your loved one's potential community. For example, Atria Senior Living ended their on-site vaccinations this past spring, [but the company has facilitated off-site vaccinations](https://www.atriaseniorliving.com/covid-19-coronavirus-preparedness/) for employees and residents who would still like to become vaccinated, according to Bill Todd, public relations director for Atria Senior Living in Louisville, Kentucky. Vaccine requirements for residents In many communities, new residents are required to attest that they are either fully vaccinated or will become fully vaccinated within 60 days of their move-in date, unless a state law says otherwise. For example, in most Atria Senior Living communities, current residents are required to provide documentation regarding vaccination records. This requirement is in place even for seniors who have contracted and overcome the virus. \"We do require vaccination, even if a resident has previously contracted COVID-19,\" Todd confirms. Todd and others backing this requirement are looking to CDC guidance which notes that \"experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.\" Visitation policies and procedures Some senior living communities do not require visitors to be vaccinated; however, they may still follow CDC guidelines and require COVID-19 screening, temperature checks, and mask wearing. It is always best to be prepared for such screenings. Furthermore, even if you are fully vaccinated and have proof, you are still required to abide by community COVID-19 rules and procedures. This could mean your loved one may at times have to quarantine anywhere from a few days to a week or more. If you wish to be a regular visitor to a community, it is strongly encouraged you get to know their current visitation policy and are prepared to make use of personal protective measures, such as social distancing and frequent hand washing. Understanding a community's policy and taking personal precautions continues to be essential to ensure the collective safety of everyone within senior living communities.
