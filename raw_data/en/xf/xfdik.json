So, it is very natural for food and waste to accumulate inside the digestive system, including the colon, which is your large intestine. This accumulation of waste is not good for your digestive system. As they say, our digestion sets the tone for the day, hence, it is important to have an effective colon cleanse. It not only improves your immune system by flushing out the undigested food, excess fluid, sodium and toxins out of your body, but it also aids weight loss and can reduce stress. In this piece, we will be looking at a few herbs and what kinds of ingredients you should use to make teas to maintain the health of your colon. What is the work of the Colon? The job of the colon is a vital function of your digestive system. The colon is a tubular organ that is entrusted with the vital responsibility of removing waste from the body. As a part of the digestive system, it works in tandem with the small intestine and the stomach to eliminate stool from the body and keep the balance of fluids and electrolytes in order. In addition, it balances the pH levels in the digestive system, which helps your body reabsorb all essential nutrients, salt and water, which in turn process the waste from the large intestine. It is important to note that colon cleansing might not reap benefits right away, apart from helping you feel re-energized. If you top that up with regular yoga and exercise, the stomach cleanse home remedy helps support and maintain a healthy colon over the long-term. 5 Natural Colon Cleansing Ingredients to Use at Home In this blog, we have listed out a number of natural herbs that you can take with your colon cleansing tea, that can effectively fortify the function of the colon and the overall digestive system. These natural remedies will enrich your overall health. Garcinia Cambogia Garcinia Cambogia is a Malabar Tamarind that may suppress appetite and increase metabolism rate. How it works is that this natural fruit contains a compound called hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA is a derivative of citric acid responsible for inhibiting an enzyme called citrate lyase that interferes with the conversion of unused carbohydrates into fat. In simpler terms, it blocks your body's ability to make fat and puts a brake on your appetite. It is helpful in boosting your digestive system, for a cleanse, and also helps controls your body weight. You can add Garcinia Tea in your daily diet. Here is a comprehensive blog to understand how garcinia cambogia can lead to weight loss.

This wonder fruit is known to work as a natural source for rich antioxidants and Vitamin C, both of which protect the body from free radicals, thereby keeping immunity up. Peppermint Peppermint is an herb extraordinaire that helps with indigestion. It is also known to reduce bloating and avoid spasms in the GI tract. We recommend a refreshing blen of Mint Green Tea that contains refreshing notes of peppermint and spearmint in addition to the goodness of green tea. While mint eases any kind of digestive upset and freshens your breath, spearmint, on the other hand, can fight bacterial infections and improve digestion. Ginger Ginger, both an herb and root, has been used for centuries in cooking and as an herbal remedy to aid the natural digestion process. It contains a compound called gingerol, which is known to have an excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It can play a major role in colon cleansing. Infused Blends Infusions of chamomile, mint, and lemongrass can work wonders for your stomach when consumed in the morning. A hot cup of green tea or herbal tea infused with the following ingredients, steeped for 2-3 minutes in hot water, and consumed every night can be an effective cleanse remedy (not to be substituted with medical advice). While Chamomile can reduce stress, improve sleep quality; peppermint can ease digestive upsets. And, as we all know, green tea is known to be rich in antioxidants. Just note that all the above suggestions are not meant to cure any disease, but to help boost your digestive system naturally. Please speak to your doctor incase you have any health issues.
