But first, a veterinarian needs to pinpoint the problem and diagnose the cause. A variety of options for managing back pain are often used in combination. One of the most common treatments is local injection of a corticosteroid. Oral medications are sometimes used for more generalized nerve pain or muscle spasms. And acupuncture can provide additional pain relief for up to 2 weeks. The next step is increasing a horse's strength to protect it from further injury. This regimen may include core exercises, use of elastic resistance bands and equine \"gymnastics\"\u2014like reversing, circling and stepping over poles. Back pain can be debilitating to horses, but the good news is that it's often treatable. Any amount of exercise is good for you, but new research shows a lack of exercise can put you on a faster track to death from a heart attack. While the relationship between exercise and heart health is well-known, a Danish study focused on a lesser-known aspect: how an active life versus a sedentary one affects the immediate course of heart attacks. Using data about activity among more than 28,000 heart attack patients, the researchers categorized the patients' leisure-time exercise into four categories from none to high. Adjustments were made for age, body mass index, diabetes, socioeconomic status and other factors. About 17% of those in the study died within a month of their heart attack. A strong majority of them died instantly. Overall, exercise appeared to work like a dose of medication: In an escalating fashion, the more frequently people exercised, the less often they died immediately or within a month of heart attacks. Those who did moderate or high amounts of exercise were 33% and 45% respectively less likely to die instantly of a heart attack than those who did not exercise. There was some indication that even small amounts of exercise may be beneficial in warding off sudden heart attack death, although the researchers said more study is needed before drawing any firm conclusions. What is an optimal level of exercise to lower your risk of sudden death from a heart attack? For healthy adults, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of high-intensity activity. Even if you don't live to work out, consider the benefits of working out to live. Whether a patient is sick or is having a regular wellness checkup, a veterinarian may recommend collecting samples of blood and urine to help screen for certain health problems. But why urine? On this show, Dr. Andrew Specht, an internal medicine specialist, will discuss what can be learned from urine samples, and how these can complement the bloodwork. In addition, he will describe some of the key factors that go into a veterinarian's decision about how to collect or interpret these samples. About one-third of cats over the age of 10 have chronic kidney disease, or CKD, which is a progressive loss of kidney function that often leads to other health problems. But over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Veterinarians can now pinpoint risk factors and diseases associated with CKD. This, in conjunction with results of certain routine lab tests, enables them to identify cats likely to develop CKD within a couple of years. CKD is incurable, so treatment focuses on improving quality of life. To that end, kidney care diets are crucial. In addition, anti-nausea medications and appetite stimulants can help with some of the more onerous symptoms. Routine veterinary checkups are also a key part of managing other problems that develop secondary to CKD. For the millions of women in America who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, roughly 10% of all expectant moms, the health risks are real \u2014 both for them and their babies. Typically, gestational diabetes goes away after a mom gives birth, but do the health risks disappear? New research suggests not. Gestational diabetes is a condition in which a woman's blood sugar levels become high during pregnancy. It affects women who have never been diagnosed with diabetes, and can raise a woman's risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. A study involving more than 1,000 women found those with gestational diabetes had a greater risk of developing heart artery calcification, a buildup of calcium that hardens the walls of arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This occurred even if the women maintained normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy. The researchers found, as they expected, that women without gestational diabetes but with high blood sugar levels in the years after pregnancy developed high rates of coronary artery calcification. But, surprisingly, they found those with gestational diabetes had more than a two-fold increased risk for hardened arteries than women without the condition. The findings, published in the journal Circulation, indicate that gestational diabetes may also foretell other health issues such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, dysfunction in blood vessels and inflammation. The team recommends health care providers keep a thorough medical history during a woman's pregnancy and screen anyone who had diabetes during pregnancy for coronary artery disease. The gestational diabetes may have gone away, but other risks may be lurking. If you're a former smoker, consider eating more fresh tomatoes and other fruits. Research shows people who kicked their tobacco habit and ate those foods, especially apples, had a slower natural decline in lung function. According to a study by European researchers who reviewed eating habits and lung function in more than 650 adults in Germany, the United Kingdom and Norway, certain compounds in the fruits may also help restore smoking-related lung damage. They measured the amount of air someone can exhale in one second and inhale in six seconds. Several years later, they repeated the lung-function tests on the same people. For former smokers, there were striking results: Those who ate a diet high in tomatoes and other fruits had a lung-function decline that was about 5 cubic inches slower over 10 years. Researchers said this suggests that edible nutrients are helping to reverse damage done by smoking. The findings appeared in the European Respiratory Journal. There's also some potential good news for nonsmokers: The study suggests that a fruit-rich diet can also slow down the lung's natural aging process. Although a variety of diets and foods were studied, the protective effect was only found with fresh fruits and vegetables. More broadly, the scientists hope the findings will become a way to fight chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disorder that causes poor air flow and long-term breathing problems. The findings also support the need for dietary recommendations for people at risk of COPD. An apple a day \u2014 or perhaps a fresh tomato \u2014 might just help keep lung problems at bay. Did you know that one of the most common reasons cats are surrendered to shelters is human allergies? But if the affected family member is open to all treatment options, this heartbreaking outcome might be avoided. One choice may soon be a new kind of vaccine. The goal of vaccination is to lessen a person's immune response to the offending antigen, which is released in a cat's saliva, skin and urine. Several vaccines are available but the newest one being studied is a peptide immunotherapy that requires fewer injections given less often. So far, vaccination 4 times over 3 months has decreased the classic signs of allergy: sneezing, nasal itchiness and congestion. Blood tests also show a dampened inflammatory response. If the positive results keep on coming, both cats and their allergic companions may have a reason to rejoice. The COVID-19 pandemic sent millions of people home to work unexpectedly over the last year, leading to lots of reconfiguring of garages and dining rooms into home offices. For many displaced workers, poor lighting in these makeshift offices also led to eye strain and discomfort from staring at computer screens. For those who are still working from home or who just need a better work environment, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has some tips to avoid straining your eyes. Eye strain refers to a number of problems that occur after extended reading, writing, or other close work. It can cause headaches, blurry vision and tired or dry eyes. It usually occurs because we tend to blink less when staring at screens or focusing on reading or writing. Here are some simple things you can do to protect your eyes. First, follow the 20-20-20 rule. This is when you look 20 feet away every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. This will reset your focus and remind you to blink. Eye drops and humidifiers are great ways to keep your eyes moist and reduce irritation. Sit an arm's length away from your screen and make sure the positioning and brightness on your device are comfortable for your workspace. Lastly, consider wearing computer glasses. Unlike blue-light blocking glasses, computer glasses are progressive lenses designed for focusing on computer screens. Eye strain can be overcome and typically doesn't cause permanent damage. But it's best to avoid it by giving your eyes a rest as often as possible. Since it looks like many of us will be still be working from home for a while, remember to blink more and take a break from your screen. It'll help keep your vision eye-conic. In January 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved another replacement therapy for canine hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones impact many of the body's functions, and dogs with hypothyroidism don't produce enough of them. Middle- to older-aged dogs and medium to large breeds are affected most often. Common signs of hypothyroidism include fur loss and flaky skin, muscle wasting and lethargy, and weight gain\u2014even without eating more. Some dogs are also more prone to ear infections or become cold intolerant. If your pooch exhibits these signs, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for an exam and blood tests. The good news is that canine hypothyroidism is easy to treat without costing a leg\u2014and another leg. Affected dogs need daily oral medication indefinitely, but it's worth it to see them bounce back to normal. Boxers as a breed are pretty endearing dogs, but they can be heartbreakers, too. One of the diseases they're prone to is a type of cardiomyopathy called ARVC for short, a heart disease that also affects people. In humans and boxers alike, ARVC is often silent\u2014in fact, the first sign may be sudden death. And most boxers with the disease aren't diagnosed until they're at least 5 years old and by then, they could have passed it on to their pups. Diagnosis of boxer ARVC currently includes family history, analysis of data gathered by a heart monitor and findings from a heart ultrasound, or echocardiogram. But now, veterinary cardiologists are researching whether an antibody called anti-DSG2 is as common in boxers as in people with ARVC. If so, screening for that biomarker could enable lifesaving treatment much earlier in a dog's life. "}
