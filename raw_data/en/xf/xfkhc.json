And then pouring the mixture into another clean mixing cup to make sure you are mixing it well. TIP - Mix up a little more than you think you'll need because you want to completely cover your work in one shot and not have to mix more later. MIXING Stir really well for at least 3 minutes. Scrape the sides and the bottom to make sure you're being thorough (unmixed material will leave you with sticky spots that just won't cure). Once you put the resin and hardener together, you'll have about 40 minutes of working time before the resin thickens and cures. POURING After making sure your piece is level, go ahead and pour AmazingResin over your work. Don't be scared! It'll start to level on its own, and you can spread it around into place. Let the resin run over the edges and then just use a brush to tidy it up. You'll notice bubbles will begin to rise to the surface. Many of these will pop on their own, but you can also pop them by torch. TIP - Wooden panels work best for large pieces rather than canvas because they won't sag under the weight of the resin. WAIT AmazingResin needs to sit for several hours in a dust-free space while it cures. In about 8 hours it will be tacky but you will be able to pour a second coat if necessary. In about 12 hours it will be dry to the touch, and within 24 hours it will be 95% cured. It will be fully cured within 72 hours.CLEAN UP - To reuse your mixing tools, wipe them down with a paper towel before the resin dries.Our Package:We accept OEM order.

Our Factory: FAQ:1: Can I mix AmazingResin with Iron Powder? Yes you can mix AmazingResin with iron and other metal powders. 2: What is the shelf life once the containers have been opened? Once the bottles have been opened, the shelf life is reduced to 6 months. 3: Is this resin food safe? AmazingResin is FDA approved as food safe for \"incidental food contact\" which in practical terms means occasional and non-continuous contact. So for example, a cheese board, serving platter or a fruit bowl. 4: Can I use AmazingResin to varnish a canvas ? Yes, certainly. In fact, that is basically what AmazingResin is designed for. It has a slight flexibility which makes it ideal for coating substrates that can move/flex (like a canvas). Just make sure you support the canvas underneath when you pour the AmazingResin so that it doesn't sag and collect in the middle. 5: How can I clean cured AmazingResin pieces? Keeping AmazingResin pieces clean is very simple: just treat it like glass. Use a gentle glass cleaner and a soft cloth and polish as you would glass. 6: How do I know when the AmazingResin is mixed fully and ready to use? Mix for at least 3 minutes, and then mix a bit more just to be sure! Remember to scrape the sides and bottom of the container to ensure thoroughness. Improperly mixed resin will not be able to catalyze and will not cure properly. 7: How can I protect my AmazingResin piece from dust as it cures? Put a protective covering over your resined piece (e.g. a big cardboard box). It helps to have the covering made prior to starting to resin so it's available as soon as you finish. If you are working in a garage, wet the garage floor to keep the dust down. 8: How do I deal with drips? Drips can be sanded off afterwards, or you can use tape to mask off your edges to stop drips before they happen. You can also smooth away drips while they're still wet with a brush or your gloved hand. 9: How do I get rid of bubbles? You can pop bubbles by blowing on them, or with a tooth pick, however the most efficient way to vanquish bubbles is to use an Artist's Torch on them. Our handheld Artist's Torches are fueled by butane and safe for home use. The torch method is most effective because it produces a 2400\u00ba F flame that heats the AmazingResin\u00ae up instantly, thus thinning it out and allowing bubbles to escape very easily. 10: How do I get AmazingResin to dry faster? Resin dries (cures) faster with more heat. You can increase the room temperature or use heat lamps to encourage a quicker cure. Adding more hardener to the mixture will not work.
