Tennessee has a legacy of fiscal responsibility that has allowed our state to flourish, and as a result, our state is leading the nation with the fastest-growing economy of all 50 states. Decades of strong fiscal stewardship displayed by the executive and legislative branches have allowed Tennessee to weather national economic storms, all while cutting taxes for Tennesseans and sustaining a healthy state savings account. I am grateful for your continued partnership to appropriately manage state assets. As a result, this budget provides dedicated funding and reductions to make life better for every Tennessean, including tax cuts for Tennessee families and small businesses, as well as a more competitive business tax structure that will ensure our state remains the best place to invest and create jobs. We'll also maintain our commitment to fiscal responsibility, proceeding with recurring investments, recommending debt and liability reductions and proposing funding to ensure our state's success. As Tennessee experiences unprecedented growth, we recommend funding for a transportation plan to more efficiently deliver road projects and spur economic investment across our state, all without new debt or higher taxes. As companies move to our state in record numbers, we're also dedicating funding to build the strongest workforce in the nation. These strategic investments will prepare our state for the future and provide greater opportunity for Tennesseans across rural and urban communities. Finally, this budget allocates significant levels of funding to ensure Tennessee remains a standard bearer for opportunity, security and freedom, including investments that support strong and healthy families, keep every community safe, spur innovation and preserve our natural resources. Tennessee reminds people that America hasn't lost her way, and I commend your partnership to continue our state's decades of commitment to a balanced budget that also recognizes the priorities of Tennesseans. Serving alongside you is an honor, and I look forward to working with you in the days ahead. Sincerely, BILL LEE GOVERNOR STATE OF TENNESSEE STATE CAPITOL N ASHVILLE , TN 37243-0001 PH: 615.741.2001 www.tn.gov STATE OF TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION STATE CAPITOL NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE 37243 -0285 JIM BRYSON COMMISSIONER February 6, 2023 The Honorable Bill Lee State Capitol 600 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. Nashville, TN 32743 Dear Governor Lee, It is my honor and privilege to present you with the fiscal year 2024 budget. This budget is balanced, assumes conservative yet practical growth rates, incurs no new debt, pays down state liabilities, and reserves funding for future contingencies. The past three years have been challenging and uncertain. However, collaborating with the legislature, we weathered those storms by limiting budget growth and preserving cash. Those decisive actions put us in a strong financial position to propose strategic investments focused on solving problems and improving the lives of current and future Tennesseans. The proposed fiscal year 2024 budget is $55.6 billion, slightly lower than the $56.2 billion FY2023 budget. The lower total budget is a result of an expected decrease in federal funding in fiscal year 2024 due to the expiration of federal pandemic funding. This $55.6 billion budget includes $29.9 billion from state appropriations, $18.8 billion from federal funding, and $6.8 billion from other sources. This budget makes major investments in Tennessee's future while preparing for uncertain days ahead. We consulted economic experts across our state who unanimously counseled caution about the FY24 economy. We have followed those recommendations by applying conservative growth projections, using more than $2.8 billion of recurring revenue for one-time expenditures, paying down liabilities, funding the Rainy Day Fund, and incurring no new debt. Thus, we are in a position to better manage future revenue fluctuations while maintaining our commitment to critical investments. The collaboration between your administration and the legislature has resulted in Tennessee's solid financial position during an extraordinarily uncertain and challenging period. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the legislature on this budget and other critical matters in the months ahead. Respectfully, Jim Bryson, Commissioner Department of Finance & Administration State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2023- 2024 The fiscal year 2023-2024 budget consists of strong revenues from an economy favorable to families and businesses in Tennessee and strategic investments that focus resources on new efforts to improve the lives of Tennesseans. The total recommended state b udget for fiscal year 2023-2024 is $55.6 billion, with $ 29.9 billion from state appropriati ons; $18.8 billion from federal funds ; $4.7 billion from other departmental revenues ; $2.0 billio n from higher education student tuition and fees ; and $83.8 million in bonds. This is a decrease of $618.6 m illion in total funding and a n increase of $ 3.1 billion in state funding from the revised current fiscal year 2022-2023 spending estimates . Federal revenue is decreasing by $3.2 billion , departmental revenue is dec reasi ng by $2.2 million , capital and highway construction bonds decrease by $499.7 million , and higher education s tudent tuition and fees remain the same. Midyear review of state tax collections an d advice from economists and the State Funding Board sugge st that current -year estimates of taxes collected by the Department of Revenue show strong growth. The revis ed recurring current -year growth rate in the general fund is 7.7 percent compared with the actual 2021-2022 Department of Revenue collections. For fiscal year 2023- 2024, before inter -fund reallocations, recurring general fund taxes are expected to grow by $437 million above the revised current -year estimate. This is a 2.25 percent recurrin g general fund growth rate above the revised current- year es timat e. The revised revenue estimates for the current year and estimates for next year are bas ed on strong economic growth in fiscal year 2022-2023 and moderated growth through fiscal year 2023-2024 and beyond. Taxes , Infrastructure, and Business Devel opment The administration is proposing legislation to reduce multiple taxes. Called \"Tennessee Works Tax Reform Act of 2023,\" the legislation proposes changes to the sales tax, franchise tax, excise tax, and business tax. The proposed legislation adopts the single s ales factor apportionment for franchise and excise taxes, conforms with the federal bonus depreciation provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, extends the business tax manufacturing exemption to sales of manufactured goods made from a ma nufacturer's storage facility located within ten miles of the manufacturing location, lowers the business tax rate for industrial loan and thrift companies, establishes a standard reduction from excise tax up to $50,000 of net earnings, exempts up to $500,000 of pr operty from the franchise tax minimum measure, increases the filing threshold for the business tax from $10,000 to $100,000, creates a three -month sales tax holiday on food, and establishes a state paid family leave tax credit against franchise an d excise taxes for a two -year pilot period. The sum of these actions is estimated to reduce tax collections by almost $54,000,000 recurring and $360,000,000 non- recurring. xix xix State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2023- 2024 The fiscal year 2023-2024 budget consists of strong revenues from an economy favorable to families and businesses in Tennessee and strategic investments that focus resources on new efforts to improve the lives of Tennesseans.

This budget allocates $3,000,000,000 into th e fund from the general fund for transportation projects that address congestion in all four of the Department of Transportation's regions. In the Departme nt of Economic and C ommuni ty Development (ECD), an appropriation of $103,000,000 ($18,000,000 recurring) is recommended for the Jobs4TN program in ECD to create new opportunities for Tennessee's workforce and to support the growth and retention of the stat e's traditional job s base. This appropriation is necessary to recruit new businesses and support workforce training, marketing, and education. To supplement the Fiscal Year 2022-2023 Budget, an appropriation of $340,000,000 is recommended for the Jobs4TN program for new devel opment projects. Grants and services to assist rural communities and distressed counties are funded with $45,000,000 non- recurring. This rural development fund helps with site development, community asset improvements, marketing, st rategic planning, dow ntown revitalization, and technical assistance. To encourage investment in the nuclear power supply chain in the state, the administration recommends an appropriation of $50,000,000 non- recurring for a nuclear energy supply chain investment fund. To stren gthen tourism, the administration proposes making a grant to the city of Memphis for tourism- related infrastructure in an amount of $350,000,000 non- recurring for improvements at the FedEx Forum and Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium. Investments in Heal th and Social Serv ices In th e Health and Social Ser vices functional group, the administration recommend s both new services to individuals and increased reimbu rsement for th ose providing services to citizens.

Financial Po licy - The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures and re venues from all sources that are estimated for the ensuing fiscal year, with the corresponding figures for the latest completed fiscal year and the fiscal year in progress, and a budget summary; 2. Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures an d revenues, including all funding sources; program statements; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 3. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and fund s the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are d etailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one and two are included in the Budget D ocument. The format of t he Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part three , the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents. The \"Introduction\" section of the Budget Document begins with t ransmittal letters from the Governor to the General Assembly and from the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Governor. These letters and the following budget highlights summarize the policy and financial recommendations included in the document. The next section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the b udget. The total state budget and the general fund budget are repres ented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each func tional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the m ajority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds K-12 education. The over view schedules clarify and detail the e xpenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget D ocument has several total budget schedules comparing pr ograms by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also included are tables that list, by department, the cost increases proposed for the next fiscal year. A separate table lists, by department, proposed base budget reductions, indicating the percent age of reduction compared with general fund state appropriations and with so- called discretionary appropriations. The discretionary appropriations exclude appropriations from all dedicated taxes and fees, federal aid, and other departmental revenue; and general fund appropriations for the K -12 Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA), pre -kindergarten , constitutionally and statutorily required salaries of judges, 3 2 district attorneys general, 32 public defenders, and certain programs affecting indigent or low -income xxvii xxvii State of Tennessee The Budget Document Introduction Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9 -4- 5106, requires that the financial plan of Tennessee's state government be presented in three parts: 1.

The specific base reductions by program are itemiz ed in a separate table . There are two charts that provide the total fund ba lance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the general fund and education fund revenues and reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education F und, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year and next (or recommended budget) year. The two charts show how the budget is balanced against general fund and education fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. B ecause of its dedicated funding sources, the Department of Transportation's appropriation requirements and revenue sources are stated on a separate chart. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding s ource. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations r equired to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, a su mmary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher educ ation institu tions, and Tennessee characteristics, which include demograph ic and other information on the state. Charts in the overview summarize base budget reductions and base budget adjustments ( or increases). The charts reflect changes from the current -year work program recurring state appropriations. The overview also include s charts summarizing the lottery for education revenue estimates, program requirements funded from the lottery revenue, and lottery reserve fund balances. The se ction entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" presents state tax revenue estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, compared with actual collections for the previous year and the revised estimate for the current year. This section explains the various sources of revenue, by collecting agency, and the statutory appo rtionment among the various funds: the general f und, education fund, highway fund, sinking (or debt service) fund, and cities and counties fund. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparati ve balance sheets fo r the general fund, education fund, and highway fund. This s ection is follo wed by the expenditures and requirements of the debt service fund for the previous, current, and subse quent fiscal years. A debt service fund comparative balance sheet also is incl uded. The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness pre sents the retirement schedule for the state's bonde d debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay and Facilities Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each department impacted, along with capital maintenance. Whether from current funds of the general fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. All of the summary charts and pr ogram statements in this Budget Document include appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Functional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget D ocument, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objec tives are gr ouped, resulting in six functional areas. This enables legislators, policy- makers, and citizens to have a bet ter concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various funct ional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional area presentation is an introduction to the associated agencies; tables that show the total expenditures, funding sources, and personnel of each functional area ; and a list of cost The Budget Document increases that are recommended for that area of state g overnment The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program.

The $18,823,67 3,300 of federal funding is a de crease of 14.5 percent from the 20 22-2023 estimate. Of the total federal funding, $9,037,728,200 (48.0 percent ) is recommended for TennCare expenditures, $4,241,706,000 (22.5 percent ) for the Department of Human Services, $ 1,815 ,874,500 (9.7 percent ) for the Department of Education, and $3,728,364,600 (19.8 percent ) for all other state programs. The Division of TennCare receives funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the state's Medicaid waiver program. The Tennessee Department of Human Services administers mu ltiple federal programs, with the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (formerly known as Food Stamps) being the largest. The Tennessee Department of Education also administers multiple large federal programs, which receiv e funds from the federal Depar tment of Education, for such programs as grants to Local Education Agencies, Special Education, and School Nutrition programs.

In the Te nnCare program, a n upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 201 8-2019 to 20 21-2022 flattens in fiscal years 20 22-2023 and 20 23-2024. The trend s in fiscal years 2022-2023 and 20 23-2024 are largely due to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information systems , and i ncreased costs in the waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees and children in state custody being tempered by expiring pandemic - related federal assistance. The impacts to the TennCare budget are displayed elsewhere in this budget. Pandemic - and Infra structure- related Federal Spending Bills In March 2020, Congress began passing a series of a cts in response to the unfolding public health and economic crisis. The six acts passed were the following: H.R. 6074 Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (CPRSA Act); H .R. 6201 Families First and Coronavirus Response Act (FFCR Act); H .R. 748 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); H.R. 266 Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCE Act); H .R. 133 Consolidated Appropriations Act; and H .R. 1319 American Rescue Plan (ARP). Key provisions of the laws included direct, one -time payments to individuals and families, increased unemployment be nefits, loans to businesses, and direct aid to state and local governments. A chart of estimated allocations to the State of Tennessee from these six acts is found elsewhere in this budget. Within the CARES Act, funding was also provided to establish the Coronavirus Relief Fund. This fund provided a block grant to states for the purpose of addressing costs specific to each state in its response to the COVID- 19 outbreak. The act allowed each state a certain degree of flexibility in determining how those funds could be directed. A chart of allocations from this fund is found elsewhere in this budget. Within the ARP Act, funding was also provided to establish the Fiscal Recovery Fund. This f und provides a block grant to states to continue COVID -19 response, invest s in initiatives that support economic recovery, and strengthen s fiscal stability. To allocate this fund, the executive and legislative branches formed a Financial Stimulus Accountability Group (FSAG) to review and recommend proposals for funding. FSAG's work on allocating this fund is ongoing. A chart of allocations from this fund is found elsewhere in this budget. In November 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to address nationwide energy, power, transportation, broadband, and water infrastructure. Instead of the broad discretion accorded to states in the CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund and ARP Act Fiscal Recovery Fund, the vast majority of IIJA funds are directed to specific programs in the states and localities. Allocations from the IIJA are contained in the various departmental budgets present ed in this document. Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook For fiscal year 2023-2024, total federal aid decreases from the fiscal year 202 2-2023 estimate. This is largely due to the time -limited nature of the funds from the six above- referenced acts. The continuation of the programs in the six above- referenced acts will span multiple future fiscal years . Those funds will be allocated accordingly by recommendation of the executive branch and enactment by the legislative branch.

The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee .\" Both Tennessee and the U.S. saw very strong economic growth in 2021 as the economy reopened, the housing market showed incredible strength, and consumers spent heavily to satisfy pent-up demand. Following incredibly strong economic growth of 9.2 percent in 2021, Tennessee inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (real GDP) is projected to grow by a more typical rate of 2.4 percent in 2022, as consumers continued to spend and the state economy continued to show strength following the pandemic recession. Economic growth would have likely been even stronger but high inflation eroded purchasing power and rising interest rates increased the cost of borrowing and put downwar d pressure on investment spending. By comparison, U.S. real GDP will grow by a slower 1.8 percent rate in 2022. The discussion that follows provides additional background on current economic conditions and the economic outlook for the state and nation t o help frame the state's fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S. and Tennessee, see \"An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" Recent Economic Conditions The U.S. economy experienced a year of mixed results in 2022, as modest economic growth and a strong labor market were overshadowed by historic increases in price levels. U.S. real GDP shrank by annualized rates of 1.6 percent and 0.6 percent in the first and second quarter respectively, but bounced back by 2.9 percent in the third quarter of 2022. For the year as a whole, U.S. real GDP is projected to advance by a modest 1.8 percent. Real GDP growth has largely slowed because of extremely high inflation. In nominal terms (current dollars), U.S. GDP will grow by a very strong 9.0 percent in 2022. However, these strong gains occurred because people were spending more money to purchase goods and services, and not because they were actually purchasing more goods and services. As of November, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is up by 7.1 percent (compared to the same time last year) after peaking at 9.1 percent in July. Thus, after adjusting for inflation, U.S. real GDP will only grow by 1.8 percent in 2022. By comparison, Tennessee real GDP will advance by a faster 2.4 percent in 2022. Despite elevated inflation, total consumption spending will increase by 2.7 percent in 2022, as pent-up demand leads to heavy spending on services. By comparison, spending on goods, which was elevated during the pandemic, will fall as household spending patterns revert to pre-pandemic norms, and higher prices dampen consumer purchasing power. In response to elevated inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively increased interest rates throughout the year. As a result, investment spending had a volatile 2022, with a 5.4 percent increase during the first quarter, with subsequent annualized drops of 14.1 percent and 9.1 percent in the second and third quarters, respectively . This slowdown was driven by reductions in residential investment and business investment in structures, both of which were dampened by rising interest rates. One bright spot for the economy is the continued strength of the labor market. U.S. payrolls finally recovered to pre -pandemic (February 2020) levels as of August 2022, and as of November there are 1 million more U.S. workers than there were prior to the pandemic. As a result, nonfarm employment will grow by a robust 4.1 percent in 2022. By compari son, the Tennessee labor market recovered in December 2021, a full eight months faster than the national recovery. And as of October 2022, nonfarm employment in Tennessee is up by roughly 108,000 jobs compared to pre- pandemic levels . Short -Term Eco nomic Outlook Driven by high interest rates, geo- political uncertainties, and elevated inflation, the U.S. economy will likely enter a mild recession in the near term. U.S. real GDP is projected to fall through the first half of 2023, and contract by 0.2 percent for the 2023 year as a whole. In comparison, the short -term outlook for Tennessee is more promising. In Tennessee, real GDP growth is still expected to slow significantly, but economic growth will remain positive. The state outlook calls for Tenn essee real GDP growth of 0.7 percent in 2023. Compared to the nation, Tennessee's outlook is more favorable due to a strong rate of in-migration into Tennessee , which has led to an uptick in economic activity, as well as a healthy state budget due to strong tax revenue collections coupled with direct state aid through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which has put the state economy on strong footing. As GDP growth slows, job growth will likely follow suit. Nonfarm employment in Tennessee will expand by a r obust 3.9 percent in 2022, but job gains will then slow to 1.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024. This is stronger than the U.S. labor market , which is projected to see no job growth in 2023 and then contract by 0.3 percent in 2024. Finally, Tennessee nominal personal income will advance by 4.9 percent in 2023 and 4.7 percent in 2024. This is slightly faster than the national projections of 4.7 percent and 4.4 percent growth in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Personal income growth in 2023 will be driven by gains in rent, interest, and dividend income, due to higher interest rates. In addition, there will likely be a strong increase in federal transfer payments, as social security benefits checks will see a massive 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2023. Counterbalancing these two positive drivers will be a moderation of total wages and salaries, which is the largest component of personal income, as job growth slows over the next two years. In 2024, nominal personal income will then grow by 4.7 percent, with the expectation that the Federal Reserve slows its pace of interest rate hikes and growth in federal transfer payments normalizes. On a fiscal year basis, nominal personal income will increase by 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2022- 2023 and 4.5 percent in fiscal year 2023-2024.

Despite elevated inflation, total consumption spending will increase by 2.7 percent in 2022, as pent-up demand leads to heavy spending on services. By comparison, spending on goods, which was elevated during the pandemic, will fall as household spending patterns revert to pre-pandemic norms, and higher prices dampen consumer purchasing power. In response to elevated inflation, the Federal Reserve has aggressively increased interest rates throughout the year. As a result, investment spending had a volatile 2022, with a 5.4 percent increase during the first quarter, with subsequent annualized drops of 14.1 percent and 9.1 percent in the second and third quarters, respectively . This slowdown was driven by reductions in residential investment and business investment in structures, both of which were dampened by rising interest rates. One bright spot for the economy is the continued strength of the labor market. U.S. payrolls finally recovered to pre -pandemic (February 2020) levels as of August 2022, and as of November there are 1 million more U.S. workers than there were prior to the pandemic. As a result, nonfarm employment will grow by a robust 4.1 percent in 2022. By compari son, the Tennessee labor market recovered in December 2021, a full eight months faster than the national recovery. And as of October 2022, nonfarm employment in Tennessee is up by roughly 108,000 jobs compared to pre- pandemic levels . Short -Term Eco nomic Outlook Driven by high interest rates, geo- political uncertainties, and elevated inflation, the U.S. economy will likely enter a mild recession in the near term. U.S. real GDP is projected to fall through the first half of 2023, and contract by 0.2 percent for the 2023 year as a whole. In comparison, the short -term outlook for Tennessee is more promising. In Tennessee, real GDP growth is still expected to slow significantly, but economic growth will remain positive. The state outlook calls for Tenn essee real GDP growth of 0.7 percent in 2023. Compared to the nation, Tennessee's outlook is more favorable due to a strong rate of in-migration into Tennessee , which has led to an uptick in economic activity, as well as a healthy state budget due to strong tax revenue collections coupled with direct state aid through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which has put the state economy on strong footing. As GDP growth slows, job growth will likely follow suit. Nonfarm employment in Tennessee will expand by a r obust 3.9 percent in 2022, but job gains will then slow to 1.0 percent in both 2023 and 2024. This is stronger than the U.S. labor market , which is projected to see no job growth in 2023 and then contract by 0.3 percent in 2024. Finally, Tennessee nominal personal income will advance by 4.9 percent in 2023 and 4.7 percent in 2024. This is slightly faster than the national projections of 4.7 percent and 4.4 percent growth in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Personal income growth in 2023 will be driven by gains in rent, interest, and dividend income, due to higher interest rates. In addition, there will likely be a strong increase in federal transfer payments, as social security benefits checks will see a massive 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2023. Counterbalancing these two positive drivers will be a moderation of total wages and salaries, which is the largest component of personal income, as job growth slows over the next two years. In 2024, nominal personal income will then grow by 4.7 percent, with the expectation that the Federal Reserve slows its pace of interest rate hikes and growth in federal transfer payments normalizes. On a fiscal year basis, nominal personal income will increase by 5.8 percent in fiscal year 2022- 2023 and 4.5 percent in fiscal year 2023-2024.

The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forecasts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid- summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee's Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates, Tennessee's largest ta x source, are based on broad estimated retail sales activity trends, which are monitored by the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research and the Department of Revenue. Tax estimates for corporate excise taxes, Tennessee's second largest tax source, include the latest national corporate profit forecasts and are analyzed against the state's October corporate tax returns, which help provide useful information in projecting quarterly estimated tax payments throughout the next year. Estimates for other ex cise taxes are commonly based on long- run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) gross receipts tax estimates from in lieu of tax payments are also based on long-run trend analysis. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles. The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic for ecasts, developing an official revenue estimate, monitoring and reporting on monthly revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, internal staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Boar d. The State Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is charged with the responsibility to prepare a range of revenue growth estimat es for the state to begin developing a budget. In preparing its range of revenue growth estimates , the State Funding Board listens to forecasts from state university economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and the Department of Revenue. The State Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The board's growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration.

However, the recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the A-60 Senate and House Finance, Ways a nd Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included at the end of the state revenues section in the subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions that affect the State Fu nding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the general fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out the agencies' programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as other state revenue. Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years are three individual charts that show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed for actual revenues in 20 21-2022, and as passed by the 2022 G eneral Assembly for the 2022-2023 estimate s and 2023-2024 estimate s. The funds on the di stribution charts, for the Budget Document presentation, are general fund, education (trust) fund, highway (transportation) fund, debt service fund, and cities and counties (local government) fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" section). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, which contain the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, inst itutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non- governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants- in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmenta l revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. The next subsection titled \"Tax Expenditures\" presents two tax exemption charts labeled \"Items Not in Sales Tax Base\" and \"Major Tax Exemptions,\" as required by law. Subsequently, information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law.

This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all exemptions f rom state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year, if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is specified. Tax Exempti ons It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of nonprofit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy . The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2023-2024. Table 1- A presents revenue forego ne on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1- B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double- counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects) .

The board was created by the 45th General Assembly with passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, and Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit is pledged on all general obligations , and all state revenue collected and allocated to the general fund, the debt service fund, and the highway fund is also charged for payment of principal and interest on such debt obligations issued after July 1, 2013. In addition, the state covenants with the holders of general obligation bonds issued after July 1, 2013, that no additional bonds will be issued unless the amount necessary to pay the maximum annual debt service obligation is 10 percent or less of all state revenue allocated to the general fu nd, the debt service fund, and the highway fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $ 1,174,206,020. The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 2023-2024 budget total $ 258,301,000, well below the maximum statutory debt limitation . The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity . Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt ma nagement practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. S uch practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancell ing bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining a Rainy Day Fund to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and adopt ing state statutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong . Tennessee's commitment to conservative and prudent debt management is widely recognized by the nation's leading debt -rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long- term debt are the highest available: Fitch AAA, Standard and Poor's AAA, and Moody's Investor Service Aaa. Tennessee did not issue additional general obligation debt in the first six months of fiscal year 2022-2023. As of June 30, 2022, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $1,379,627,000, excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF). This debt was issued entirely for insti tutional and building construction. The second session of the 112th General Assembly approved new general bond authorizations in the amount of $583,500,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $500,000,000 and highway bonds $83,500,000. The state's practice of using surplus cash to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long -standing policy, the State Funding Board cancelled $ 76,000,000 in highway construction bonds and $291,998,318 in regular general obligation bond authorizations in fiscal year 2021-2022. The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations reduced the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,460,602,300 which includes $616.3 million in capital construction bonds, $836.0 million in highway fund authorizations, and $8.3 million in FRF bonds. The recommended 20 23-2024 capital budget is funded entirely from surplus cash in the amount of $1,711,877,300 and $220 ,283,700 from federal funds and other sources.

capital project begins when an agency or department identifies a need that can be met through the Capital Budget Process. At a designated point in the year, agencies and departments submit these project concepts to the Department s of General Services and Finance and Administration. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, a phased approach of review is undertaken by the Departments of General Services and F inance and Administration . The initial phase focuses on a needs assessment to establish priority and direction. During this phase, feasibility and/or market studies are performed to determine the viability of the project, project risks, and potential routes of implementation. The goal of the initial phase is to generate a recommend ation regarding the disposition of the project. The next phase provides additional planning to develop better cost estimates. The end result of the above phased approach is the development and prioriti zation of a formal capital budget request. The various agencies and departments annually submit both their capital maintenance and capital improvement requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration , Division of Budget . All ca pital budget requests are further reviewed on both a technical and financial basis upon receipt by the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget . The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are re viewed within projected availability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The a dministration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impe tus for all capital outlay, support program , and service requirements . Funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs t o find the best mix of capital improvements and maintenance to sustain and implement programs. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts. When a capital project creates the need for additional operational funding, the operating costs are identified d uring the capital budget review and further re viewed in the develo pment o f the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex- officio members: the Governor, the Secretary o f State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commission, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly reflect projects meeting State Building Commis sion requirements and polic y guide lines. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non- routine repairs and replacements unrelated to new construction and costing $250,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the departments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifica tions for health and safety issues, repairs to improve utility systems, repaving, roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is allocated to the individua l state entities.

Judicial power is vested in trial courts and two levels of appeals courts that comprise the state's court system. The Supreme Court is comprised of five justices elected to eight-year terms. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The intermediate appellate courts are the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts, as well as post-conviction petitions. The state 's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit, and Probate courts. Chancery courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law or statutory law proves inadequate for cases. Circuit courts, which sometimes overlap with the jurisdiction of Chancery courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate courts have primary jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions courts vary by county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties in which the Legislature has established separate Juvenile courts. Municipal courts have jurisdiction in cases involving violations of city ordinances.

THDA was created in response to a need for housing initiatives in rural areas, but it also performs activities in the major urban centers. The agency is authorized to sell tax-exempt revenue notes and bonds to provide funding for making below-market interest rate mortgage loans. Through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 's Section 8 program, THDA provides rental subsidies to assist renters in need and administers project- based contracts. THDA also administers two federally funded grant programs, the HOME program and the Neighborhood Stabilization program. The HOME program assists local housing providers in implementing affordable housing plans. The Neighborhood Stabilization program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and local governments that buy foreclosed homes, rehabilitate, and rent or resell the homes to low- to middle-income families in order to help stabilize the housing market. The agency received proceeds from the national mortgage settlement fund that are being utilized to support activities aimed to prevent foreclosures. Since fiscal year 2013-2014, THDA has administered two federal programs previously administered by the Department of Human Services. The Weatherization Assistance Program enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program helps keep families safe and healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. Activities of THDA include the rehabilitation and construction of rental and homeowner housing. The low income housing tax credit program, administered by THDA, supports acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of rental units for low-income tenants. THDA has a governing board composed of state officials and gubernatorial and legislative appointees who are active and knowledgeable in their respective industries. 2021-2022 2022-2023 2023-2024 2023-2024 2023-2024Actual Estimated Base Cost Increase RecommendedDepartment of Agriculture Administration and Grants The Administration and Grants area coordinates various duties including policy and strategic planning, budgeting, personnel administration, and legal.

THDA was created in response to a need for housing initiatives in rural areas, but it also performs activities in the major urban centers. The agency is authorized to sell tax-exempt revenue notes and bonds to provide funding for making below-market interest rate mortgage loans. Through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 's Section 8 program, THDA provides rental subsidies to assist renters in need and administers project- based contracts. THDA also administers two federally funded grant programs, the HOME program and the Neighborhood Stabilization program. The HOME program assists local housing providers in implementing affordable housing plans. The Neighborhood Stabilization program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and local governments that buy foreclosed homes, rehabilitate, and rent or resell the homes to low- to middle-income families in order to help stabilize the housing market. The agency received proceeds from the national mortgage settlement fund that are being utilized to support activities aimed to prevent foreclosures. Since fiscal year 2013-2014, THDA has administered two federal programs previously administered by the Department of Human Services. The Weatherization Assistance Program enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program helps keep families safe and healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. Activities of THDA include the rehabilitation and construction of rental and homeowner housing. The low income housing tax credit program, administered by THDA, supports acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of rental units for low-income tenants. THDA has a governing board composed of state officials and gubernatorial and legislative appointees who are active and knowledgeable in their respective industries. 2021-2022 2022-2023 2023-2024 2023-2024 2023-2024Actual Estimated Base Cost Increase RecommendedDepartment of Agriculture Administration and Grants The Administration and Grants area coordinates various duties including policy and strategic planning, budgeting, personnel administration, and legal.

B-3 61 State of Tennessee The Budget Process Preparation of the Governor's annual budget for the State of Tennessee is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, w ho is the State Budget Director. Within the Department of Finance and Administration, the Division of Budget is responsibl e for budget development. Preparation, deliberation, and execution of the budget is a continual process throughout the year. This process regularly involves the legislative and executive branches, with occasional counsel from the judicial branch. The fo llowing table indicates the participants in the budgetary process and an approximate time schedule.

Preparation and Executive Review of Strategic Plan s The Government al Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, which requires strategic planning, performance measures, and performance audits. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration annually issues instructions for strategic p lans and performance measures to the executive branch agencies, which are due to the commissioner by August 15 each year . The commissioner reviews the plans and measures, revise s as deemed necessary , approves, and submits the strategic plans to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 of each year. The judicial and legislative branches, the constitutional office rs, and the Attorney General and Reporter submit plans separately to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30. Budget Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans include updating instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting operational and capital budget requests to the Division of Budget. The instructions , which are distributed to agencies in August, include submitting three levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates th e contin uation of cur- rent services, (b) a cost increase request, which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for revenue reduc- tions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services , and (c) a base budget reduc- tion request . A s part of a cost increase request, a gencies may request to use statutory B-357 State of Tennessee The Budget Process Preparation of the Governor's annual budget for the State of Tennessee is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, w ho is the State Budget Director. Within the Department of Finance and Administration, the Division of Budget is responsibl e for budget development. Preparation, deliberation, and execution of the budget is a continual process throughout the year. This process regularly involves the legislative and executive branches, with occasional counsel from the judicial branch. The fo llowing table indicates the participants in the budgetary process and an approximate time schedule.

Preparation and Executive Review of Strategic Plan s The Government al Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, which requires strategic planning, performance measures, and performance audits. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration annually issues instructions for strategic p lans and performance measures to the executive branch agencies, which are due to the commissioner by August 15 each year . The commissioner reviews the plans and measures, revise s as deemed necessary , approves, and submits the strategic plans to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 of each year. The judicial and legislative branches, the constitutional office rs, and the Attorney General and Reporter submit plans separately to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30. Budget Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans include updating instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting operational and capital budget requests to the Division of Budget. The instructions , which are distributed to agencies in August, include submitting three levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates th e contin uation of cur- rent services, (b) a cost increase request, which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for revenue reduc- tions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services , and (c) a base budget reduc- tion request . A s part of a cost increase request, a gencies may request to use statutory B-358 The Budget Process reserves , which are funds held for future needs or special purposes as designated in statute and / or the Appropriations Bill. The legal deadline for completi ng and transmi tting budget requests is the first of October. During the preparation period, the Division of Budget staff meets as needed with agencies' fiscal , capital , and program personnel to answer questions and provide assistance with developing agencies' budget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise , and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9-4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the bud get review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration's and the Governor's staffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 grant s the Governor the authority a nd duty to develop and submit to the General Assembly a recommended budget. The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. After rec eiving agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Di- vision of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Capital budget requests are re- viewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Following analysis of the operational and capital requests and available funding, as well as resolving any questions about the requests with agencies , detailed recommendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with department commissioners and agency directors by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. After these meetings are completed, the Division of Budget staff makes revisions and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Admini stration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the administration's initiatives , activities mandat ed by state or federal statute, day -to-day operations, and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with department commissioners and may direct them to submit plans for furthe r budget adjustments. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget Document must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. Legislative Deliberation The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Division of Budget, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. The various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within the committees' purviews. The departments and agencies often are invited to testify before these committees on budget issues. After these committees report t he committees' reviews, the Finance, Way s and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees The Budget Process include th e fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any recommended amendments. The Appropriations Bill is then sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of the General Appropriations Bill usually occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line-item veto or reduce specific appropriat ions. Th e Governor could veto the entire bill, but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over- ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs and development of allotment controls. Invariably, t here are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes are made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and divi sion using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is provided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal yea r. The approved Appropriations Act also contains overappropriation amounts, or reversion, which is the return of any unused portion of appropriation or revenue overcollection. The Division of Budget estimates the proportion of the total reversion in the Appropriations Act to be allocated to each agency and informs each agency of its target reversion . Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Analysts review the s tatus of the various allotments and reversion targets and advise the Commissioner of Finance and Administration of any problems. Analysts may also receive agency requests for supplemental appropriations for state dollars after the beginning of the fiscal year , which become part of the next year's budget discussions and recommendations to be included in the next Budget Document and Appropriations Bill. Additionally, a nalysts may receive agency requests for new federally or other funded programs, expansions of existing federally or other funded programs , or redirected funds after the beginning of the fiscal year. These requests, known as expansion request s, are reviewed within the Division of Budget, and then sent to the Finance, Ways and Means c ommittees for approval. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on the agencies' own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropri ations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. At B-359 The Budget Process reserves , which are funds held for future needs or special purposes as designated in statute and / or the Appropriations Bill.

At B-360 The Budget Process closing, a gencies may request to carry forward unexpended state appropriations for the specified purpose , provided the agencies have the authority in statute or the Appropriations Act to do so. A gencies may request to use reserve funds, whic h are funds held for future needs or special purposes, with statutory reserve authority. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration can approve agency requests for carry forward s and use of reserve funds. TCA section 4 -3-1016 gives t he Commissioner of Finance and Administration authority to deny carry forwards for and to transfer funds to the general fund to meet funding requirements, subject to specific provisions in the Appropriations B ill. The funds, reserves, and programs authorized for transfer are listed in the above TCA citation. These transfers are known as reserve taking to close the fiscal year. Legislative Review Further legislative review and control is maintained throughout the year through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees review and approve expansion requests of new or existing federally or other funded programs. If the expa nsion request is approved, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional departmental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Additionally, a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate, and the Comptroller of the Treasury must approve a transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated after approval of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Comptroller Audit and Review Post-audit and performance review are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller's Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits and performance reviews of all state departments and agencies, i ntermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds , and other entities receiving state grants. The General Assembly may review the Comptroller's audit reports and performance reviews, and agency personnel may respond to inqui ries about activities and programs under the agency's jurisdiction. State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual Budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modif ied accrual basis of accounting - the method under which revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred. Most appropriations generally lapse at the end of each fiscal year. Appropriations for contractual obligations in the highway fund do not lapse at year end but are carried forward for subsequent year expenditure s. In addition, it is the s tate's budgetary practice to appropriate matching dollars for jointly funded projects in the year of federal apportionment. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a modified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Go vernor to present his proposed B udget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the Budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the progr am level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the Budget , in the form of the Appropriations Act, becomes the state's financial plan fo r the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a Division of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the budget by the Division of Budget on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature, require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in de tail in the \"Budget Process\" section. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (t ransportation, or highway fund), Capital Outlay ( capital projects fund ), facilities revolving fund , debt service (or sinking ) fund, and Cities and Counties - State -Shared Taxes (Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, including the Lottery for Education Account, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the general fund in the presentation of the \" Budget Overview ,\" although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the operating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document , except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget Document , revenue estimates for special revenue, internal service , and enterprise fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the general fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlife Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Public Utility Commission Education Fund B-361 The Budget Process closing, a gencies may request to carry forward unexpended state appropriations for the specified purpose , provided the agencies have the authority in statute or the Appropriations Act to do so.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the general fund, although the tax apportionments for the education fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the Budget . It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the education fund are less than the education appropriations, requiring general fund tax support for education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System , Locally Governed Institutions , the Foreign Language Center , and the dedicated- source appropriation in the Lottery for Educat ion Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document , certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and s ales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the Budget Document easier to understand, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (A CFR) does present the special revenue and other funds separately from the general fund. The Division Basis of Budgeting and Accounting of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Annual Comprehensive Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require tha t the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In the government -wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business -type activities. The government -wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user ta xes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities ; and, State Shared Taxes Fund - used to account for the sharing of state levied tax revenues and certain fees with local city and county governments as authorized by state statutes. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific revenues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long- term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local f unds, and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fe es and fines, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amount is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year -end. The state uses this same six -month availability period for most other measurable revenues.
