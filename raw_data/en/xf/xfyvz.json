Minor: The required calculus courses constitute a minor in Mathematics, and no other minor is necessary. ACS Approved Program The above courses constitute the Chemistry co re of the B.S. degree program. To meet the American Chemical Society (ACS) approved program, two additional Chemistry courses are required from the electives listed below. Electives to satisfy the ACS approved degree are listed below. Graduate courses may be substituted if appropriate. Courses with a C or L suffix are laboratory courses. CHM 4905 and CHM 4906 must include a final written report to be counted toward the ACS approved degree.
