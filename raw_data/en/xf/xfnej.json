In order to develop more targeted and effective therapies, research is mobilizing to better understand the biological and cell mechanisms involved in the onset of allergies. Mast cells - a type of immune cell - is of particular interest to scientists and doctors, but there is little data about them at present. Teams from the internal medicine department of the Henri-Mondor AP-HP hospital, the Institut Necker - Enfants Malades, the Mondor Institute for Biomedical Research, the Institut Pasteur, Inserm, and the Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil University studied immune memory after infection with the Omicron BA.1 variant in patients vaccinated with three doses of the messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine. Some HIV-1 carriers who have received an early antiretroviral treatment during several years are able to control the virus for a long term after treatment interruption. However, the mechanisms enabling this post-treatment control have not been fully elucidated. For the first time, teams of scientists from the Institut Pasteur, Inserm and the Paris Public Hospital Network (AP-HP), supported by ANRS | Emerging Infectious Diseases, have investigated and revealed how... In a study of a cohort of 683 elderly Bordeaux residents followed up over 10 years, researchers from Inserm and Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux at the Bordeaux Population Health research center showed accelerated thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in the participants more exposed to air pollution, especially those who had a greater exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulate matter of a diameter of 2.5 microns or less). This study... To understand the main determinants behind worldwide antibiotic resistance dynamics, scientists from the Institut Pasteur, Inserm, Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay developed a statistical model based on a large-scale spatial-temporal analysis. The summer of 2022 was the hottest ever recorded in Europe, characterized by an intense series of heatwaves that beat records of temperature, drought, and forest fires. Although Eurostat had already reported unusually high excess mortality for these dates, the fraction of mortality that could be attributed to the heat had not until now been quantified. And this is precisely what a study by scientists from Inserm and the... In the face of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, how can we get out of the therapeutic \"dead end\"? The answer could well be found in the genes of the proteasome - an intracellular mechanism that is responsible for removing defective proteins from the cell. Correct immune system function depends on the continuous supply of white blood cells derived from stem cells that reside in the bone marrow. These are known as blood stem cells or hematopoietic stem cells. Researchers from Inserm, CNRS and Universit\u00e9 d'Aix-Marseille at the Center of Immunology Marseille-Luminy have now discovered a new role played by these cells in immune response. One year after its large-scale poster campaign in France's railway stations and Paris subway, Inserm uses its slogan On gagne tous les jours \u00e0 s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 [We always benefit from focusing on health] in a 30-second TV commercial broadcast from June 7 to July 30. CAR T cell therapy is an immunotherapy that is effective in treating blood cancer. By closely investigating some of the immune cells generated during this therapy, known as CD4 T cells, scientists from the Institut Pasteur and Inserm, in collaboration with clinicians from the Paris Public Hospital Network (AP-HP), discovered that these cells are capable of remotely neutralizing tumor cells by producing "}
