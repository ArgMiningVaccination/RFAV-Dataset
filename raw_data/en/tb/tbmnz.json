Subject: Andy protocol or updated pages: Growth Hormone , Progress reports (see 2008) , Cutler protocol , N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) , Cysteine status (sulfur food exclusion) I'm going to answer this and in it, also answer the post of about a week ago to explain why the DAN! and \"Andy\" protoco ls are so different in their use of chelators and sulfury things (thoug h they are quite similar in most other areas). Please note from the post below, and many prior pos ts by others, it is not proper to say there IS a \"DAN! chelation protoc ol\" since it seems to be a point of pride that every single DAN! docto r just HAS to do something different with the chelating agents to pu t his mark on the protocol. This is not at all the same as the \"Andy chelation protocol\" which is extremely well defined, and what parts are or aren't optional are clearly spelled out. --- In Autism-Mercury, MacsM7 wrote: Hi, My DAN doctor, who we have been with for four years , In all honesty, the fact that you still need a DAN! doctor after 4 years is troubling. You should have seen excellent or dramatic improvements in this time if any of the treatments were on target. \"Dramatic\" means things like he didn't used to talk at all and now he speaks in complete and gramatically correct sentenc es. has given me a chelation protocol for my son which is very differe nt from the one you recommend. Since I have been reading your posts wit h great interest and admiration I would like your opinion before I decid e what to do. My son is 11 (100lbs) and tested extremely high in mercury, silv er, nickel and aluminum. www.scienceformulas.com Ads by Google http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 1 of 8The way you put this sounds like it was a challenge d urine test, which has precisely no meaning and no diagnostic utility. A proper test is a hair element profile from Doctor's Data or Trace Elements (the current TEI report is in effect the same, though yo u have to stare at it for a while and think about it if you are used t o DDI reports). Also, does your son have amalgam fillings in place? He can't chelate with them in. They must be removed first. Our doctor suggests a 12-week cycle of: ALA 100mg 3 times a day every day If the only thing I succeeed in doing is convincing you not to do this, it will be worthwhile. One of the great advantages of having years of expe rience with what happens to adults when they chelate this way and th at is that I have a zillion first hand reports of what almost any proto col you can imagine feels like from the inside, and what it does to peo ple who can report how they feel accurately. By selectively concentrat ing mercury into the brain instead of causing its excretion, imprope r use of ALA dramatically increases both neurological and psychi atric problems. DMSA 500mg 3 times a day for 3 days, then 11 days o ff, then repeat this is to be combined with a specially compounded mercury detox combo of C,E,B6,Taurine, zinc, selenium, melatonin This is not a mercury detox combo. I have no idea w hy anyone would call it that. Also I have no idea why it would be \" specially compounded,\" as you can easily get whatever combina tion of those things you want in standard OTC products which are commercially available from many sources. Your kid needs to take appopriate supplements wheth er or not you chelate him. Chelation doesn't change this. Our doctor says he has NOT seen very impressive res ults with this chelation protocol alone, Unsurprising. I am surprised that he considers it o n average to help the patients, rather than hurt them. You might try a proper chelation protocol instead on which most people report somewh ere between noticeable and dramatic progress. Please see the po lls section and the love letters file (if you aren't using the web interface for the listserver, you go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group /Autism-Mercury and click the hotlinks on the left for \"Polls\" and \"Fil es\" and see what is there) for typical reports of progress. I have a suggestion. He says give your kid 1,500 mg of DMSA a day on cycle, and 300 mg ALA every day. Why not just use M Y protocol once or twice and see what happens? Then you can decide whe ther to try his, and can compare them. Use perhaps 50 mg DMSA and 25 mg ALA every 3 hours during the day (and 4 at night to sleep a lit tle more) for 3 http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 2 of 8days. This is 350-400 mg of DMSA and 175-200 mg of ALA. Both MUCH less than Dr. DAN! Protocol prescribes. but adding IV glutathione once a week has been very impressive. What do you think? I am having a hard time biting my tongue. I have ha d a number of \"alternative\" doctors call ME up and ask what the ( @#*&$*( is going on with some of their colleagues saying intravenous gl utathione makes EVERYONE SO MUCH BETTER but when THEY use it on THE IR patients, half get a lot worse. This is confirmed by repeated priv ate reports - and a few on list - by parents who made the mistake of letting their doctor do this to their kid. The worsenings are usu ally long term or permanent, too. What is actually happening is many doctors are not all that perceptive about the effectiveness of thei r therapies (the standard 36 hour shifts with 12 hour rest periods m ost of them worked in residencies during training are one of the more well accepted ways to brainwash people and are considered serious offe nses against the laws of war when committed in POW camps. After thes e experiences they are not always that good at noticing things clinica lly that disagree with what authority figures told them). If you know what your kid's plasma cysteine is you can decide if it is worthwhile to increase his thiol (sulfur) intake, b ut there is no reason to use glutathione IV - if he needs more app ropriate use of oral agents is much more effective and long lasting than the injection. Also, I am curious what rationale he uses for wanti ng to chelate your kid if he thinks the IV glutathione is what helps a nd the chelation isn't very helpful? This makes no sense at all. BTW, if your doc can't tell you what your son's pla sma cysteine is and proposes to shoot him up with glutathione I really would like to spend some time trying to convince you to go elsewhere. T his is THE most basic measurement of \"sulfur\" metabolism, is inexpe nsive and easy to do, and is part of a test most DAN! doctors typical ly order the rest of (the Great Smokies Lab comprehensive detoxificat ion profile - almost all DAN! doc's order either that or the regu lar detox profile which is very similar but doesn't have cysteine). Mary First, in discussing the DAN! protocol I do have to note that it started with a few of the early DAN! doctors follow ing the protocol as laid out in my book Amalgam Illness: Diagnosis and Treatment. They got excellent results with this. However, they also spent a lot of time arguing with parents about the need to get up at night because the doc's weren't all that convinced it was necessa ry (for the most part they had not chelated people before or had use d protocols that don't require the patient to get up). Based on the excellent response achived early on wi th this every 3-4 hour low dose protocol, DAN! decided to use a DMSA and ALA protocol. http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 3 of 8However, based on the fact that nobody at the relev ant meeting understood any pharmacokinetics so they weren't abl e to figure out why 3-4 hour dosing was a crucial part of the protocol, they decided it would make no difference to dose every 8 hours so t hey arbitrarily changed the protocol. They also arbitrarily decided that since one textbook talks about using 10 mg/kg of DMSA every 8 hours and they didn't understand why there was any reason to use l ess, they would also arbitrarily change the dosage because more mus t be better, and using a higher dose must speed things up a lot. So the existing DAN! protocol was made up by a room full of doctors who had never used it clinically and didn't underst and what the important differences were between it and the proto ccol they had heard was successful. Basically, they were arrogant enoug h in their ignorance to believe that their (lack of) understan ding was adequate to change the protocol willy-nilly and still have i t work fine without even doing a trial of the new protocol on people, o r animals, before endorsing it. This is the same combination of arrogance and ignor ance that leads most current pediatricians to continue injecting ch ildren with the thimerosal preserved vaccines they have in the stoc kroom rather than take the economic loss of throwing them away, becau se the doc's don't see how the thimerosal could hurt the kids and are certain they know everything important there is to know about the sub ject. This unfortunately is part of the medical culture and is not unique to the mainstream or alternative medicine communities. So, after that DAN! meeting, a new, randomly modifi ed and untested protocol was emitted. As is easily verified in the polls section of this list and in its archives, what actually happen ed is that a lot of kids who had been getting better on the every 4 hou r protocol were switcched to the every 8 hour protocol and started to get worse again. Once the parents realized that the doc's had gone o ff the deep end and switched back to the 3-4 hour protocol, their kids resumed improving. While informal, this is a \"controlled crossover stu dy,\" which is among the most powerful evidence doctors claim to believe in. It provided conclusive proof that the lower dose 3-4 hour proto col is dramatically superior to the DAN! 8 hour, high dose protocol. Li ke the mainstream, however, DAN! has ignored those results that don't agree with its position. In fact, when using the 3-4 hour protocol, the earl y DAN! doctors were reporting dramatic, rapid improvements in their pat ients. Since switching to the 8 hour protocol they are reporting rough going, some improvement in perhaps 60% of patients, and are get ting really interested in using other interventions (like MT pr omoter) in place of chelation. I believe that the reports of the DAN! doctors actu ally are correct. Dramatic progress in most cases on 3-4 hour chelati on, rough going with modest progress on 8 hour chelation. I believe these are in fact the rule. They are consistent with reports on this list, with what I have heard from many adults, with what one would ex pect from basic pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic considerations, a nd with how things felt when I was very toxic and chelated a few diffe rent random ways at http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 4 of 8first before I figured out what I was doing. The difference in administration frequency between the DAN! protocol (every 8-12 hours for ALA, every 8 for DMSA) and th e \"Andy\" protocol (every 4 hours or more often for DMSA, every 3 hour s or more often for ALA with occasional 4 hour use) are pretty straight forward to explain. First, chelating agents serve two functions. They m obilize toxic metals. They also bind toxic metals. They do NOT \"h old on tight\" and do NOT bind irreversibly. They pick up and drop the metals often. Thus, you need to maintain a rough balance between mobilization and binding so that the chelators grab most of the free toxic metals rather than letting them grab back on to the body. In order to do this, you need to keep the blood level of chelating agents reasonably constant. This is done by giving them roughly a hal f life apart, so that blood levels don't fluctuate by more than a fa ctor of 2. The half life of DMSA (directly measured in human child ren) is 2.5 to 3.5 hours. The kinetics of ALA are much more complicate d but are adequately described as a half life of 1.5 to 2.5 h ours. The peaks get smeared out over a 2 hour period due to it taki ng about 2 hours for the stuff to slowly be absorbed when it is give n by mouth. EXACTLY how long you can wait between doses varies from individual to individual and I have determined my numbers based o n the experience of a lot of people who have done it this way. They are theoretically sound and empirically verified. While I can't reall y tell you exactly why ALA is best every 3 hours or whether DMSA could be stretched to 5 and still be OK, I can tell you with great certaint y that 8 hours is way beyond the bounds of reason. Now please note that everyone is different. Everyon e is a unique individual. This is just as true biochemically as s ocially. Thus while there is perfect certainty that the above app lies to any large group of people, and is best for most people in tha t group, any given individual may need to do it differently and in any large group there will be a few who do better on something other than the \"one size fits all\" average protocol. This leads to the following conditions which I believe any responsible person would adhere to: 1. Try the \"best\" approach on everyone, no matter w hat. Just try it. 2. If some particular person repeatedly does poorly on the \"best\" approach and well on something else, respect their individual needs and do what works for them. Please also note something else covered under \"ever yone is different.\" Not all autistic children have mercury (or a relate d heavy metal) as the root cause of their condition. Good diagnosis i s needed. Any doctor who chelates ALL of the children who come in the door isn't doing it right. The first step is make some attempt to figure out WHAT is wrong, and direct treatment at that. If tre atment is not leading to the expected progress, go back to the di agnostic step. A diagnosis is only an opinion as to what is going on . Opinions can be wrong. As to dosing differences between the \"Andy\" and DAN ! protocols, the important factor is that increasing the dose increa ses side effects rapidly, but does not increase metal removal much. Doubling the http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 5 of 8amount of DMSA or ALA in a dose more than doubles s ide effects. However, it speeds up metal removal by less than 33 %. Once you are using enough chelator to get some response and have some side effects there really is no reason to push things. You can d ouble your dose and go from noticeable side effects to a horrendous , intolerable experience and make it so you can get through a giv en amount of metal in 3 months instead of 4. Also, as the side effects increase, your ability to chelate frequently will decrease so stic king to a lower dose and doing it routinely every weekend or every other weekend will in practice get your kid cleared of metal faster th an using a very high dose and spending weeks or months putting your kid back together after each cycle. This is clearest in the discussio ns regarding all the yeast problems kids have with chelation that ar e in the archives. Summarizing the dosage and administration differenc es: 8 vs 3-4 hour dosing. Why dose more often? It is ne cessary for most children if they are going to get better. This is s upported by the fact that DAN! doctors were reporting dramatic prog ress when doing it this way and no longer are now that they use 8 hour dosing. 1500 mg/day versus 350 mg/day. Why use more DMSA/AL A? There is no real need to use a lot, since it makes the kid dram atically more uncomfortable without really speeding things up muc h. Let me work the arithmetic on this one and you will quickly see what I mean about dosing. The relevant formulae are in the appendix to my book Amalgam Illness: Diagnosis and Treatment (desc ribed at www.noamalgam.com). Each 500 mg dose of DMSA removes (500/50)^0.409 = 2 .56 times as much metal as each 50 mg dose. 3 500 mg doses daily remove 7.69 units of metal. 7 50 mg doses daily remove 7.00 units of metal. The difference in metal removed by DMSA between the DAN! high dose protocol and the Andy low dose protocol is 10% in t his case. If you use 100 mg DMSA every 4 hours versus 500 mg every 8 hours the lower dose protocol actually removes 21% MORE metal than the higher dose protocol. Similarly for lipoic acid, the arithmetic is: Three 100 mg doses remove 5.29 units of metal, whil e seven 25 mg doses remove 7.00 units of metal. Again, the \"lower dose\" protocol actually removes more metal in a 24 hour period. The really important thing to keep in mind is some further human biochemistry as far as heavy metals are concerned. That is, why is it such a bad idea to let the metals bounce around by just giving chelator randomly? Don't the metals come out eventu ally no matter how you do it? The real issue is that the metals do NOT sit where they are until they http://onibasu.com/archives/am/5 ... 1/16/2011 9:30:43 AM Page 6 of 8come out. Chelators ccan move them all over the bod y. The most damaging place they can be is in the brain, and the next most damaging is in the liver. A lot of the metal that is sitting quietly in a muscle, bone, kidney, or ligament and not really ca using much damage there can be moved INTO the brain and liver if it g ets stirred up and there isn't chelator around to keep it company unti l it is excreted. So improper chelation with too long an interval bet ween doses actually can make people MORE poisoned by INCREASING the amo unt of toxic metal in the brain and liver even though the total amount in their body does decline. This has been observed innumerable times w ith adults for many years, and DAN! has now experimentally demonst rated that it works just the same way in children. With proper ch elation everything gets BETTER from the start. With improper chelation some things get WORSE. Then it takes LONGER for those to get better than if proper chelation had been used all along. I hope this rather long post clarifies the differen ces between the DAN! and Andy chelation approaches, and explains wh y I think it is important to do it one way instead of another. What I hope you will consider the \"take home lesson \" here is to just try it both ways a couple of times if you are consi dering the DAN! protoccol or if your doctor insists Onibasu Link: http://onibasu.com/archives/am/53055.html Replies to this message: Andy - Hair Organ correlation research proof \"Scott Sandford\" <scott> Re: Andy protocol matter? \"ak1bruin\" <ak1bruin> Re: differe nce matter? \"tiredmamma18042\" <CFRITCH> This message is a reply to: Re: question for andy protocol MacsM7 Showing slice of current thread: Re: question for andy protocol MacsM7 Andy protocol vs. DAN! protocol, does the difference matter? \"andrewhallcutler\" <AndyCutler> Re: Andy matter? \"tiredmamma18042\" <CFRITCH> Re: bugs \"Terri Hair Organ correlation Find STELARA As A Treatment Option.
