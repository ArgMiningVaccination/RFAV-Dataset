Their color, texture, and overall strength all point to the state of our bones and overall health. With Ayurvedic nail analysis, we uncover the important clues hiding at our fingertips Explore more on the [Saumya Blog](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog), selected top Ayurveda blogs and websites to watch. What Does Ayurveda Say About Nails? According to Ayurveda, our fingernails can show signs of illness and reveal clues to our overall health. Characteristics like the color and texture of our nails can betray underlying concerns like heart and lung issues, nutrient deficiencies, and doshic imbalances - among many other invisible conditions What is Ayurvedic Nail Analysis? Ayurveda uses a comprehensive multi-point assessment with clients. The [ tongue](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/what-your-tongue-says-about-your-health-according-to-ayurvedic-wisdom), nails (Nakha Pariskha), skin, hair, voice, and so forth are all external observable qualities that may indicate issues and conditions occurring inside the body and mind. Ayurvedic nail analysis is part of this multi-point process. Your fingernails provide an indication of your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) and your current condition (vikruti). Fingernail health signs give us insight into many potential imbalances, including: Bone health Lung issues Heart conditions Digestive issues Parasitic and other infections Skin conditions Autoimmune conditions Thyroid function Liver concerns Vata, Pitta, and Kapha imbalances Like all things Ayurveda, Ayurveda nail diagnosis points to different things for different patients. That's because our doshic composition influences all our physical characteristics, including our fingernails. More on this later - first, let's explore the bones of the matter. What's the Connection Between Hair, Nails, and Bones According to Ayurveda? Hair and nails derive from the same source: bones. As the leftover products of the bone formation process (ashti dhatu), our hair and nails are considered malas, or body waste. Thinking of your hair as waste? Now that's something to wrap your head around! As with all bodily waste, our hair and nails are important indicators of our overall health. The quality and quantity of all wastes like [ stool,](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/poop-analysis-with-ayurveda-what-your-poop-says-about-your-health) urine, sweat, nails, and hair are all assessed in the Ayurvedic approach to healing. Using Ayurvedic nail analysis, you can identify and address health issues early on \u2014 as opposed to waiting until your symptoms become conditions and diseases. The fingernails are only one point of the multi-point assessment. A comprehensive [ Ayurvedic consultation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page) is needed to provide proper guidance on herbal remedies, Ayurvedic diet, and lifestyle choices. Now, let's take a look at what our fingernails can tell us about the doshas - and how this ties into our overall health. Ayurvedic Nail Analysis: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha Characteristics Your nails point state of Vata dosha, Pitta dosha, and Kapha dosha overall. Here are a few common characteristics of each dosha, as they show up in our Vata Dosha Imbalances: Pronounced imbalanced Pitta. Ideally the moons are smaller on each respective finger. Large moons indicate excess, high Pitta manifesting as: inflammation; hyperacidity; and loose stools. This client had significant systemic inflammation that at the time of initial consultation, could only eat a few foods and was malnourished. Vata dosha is also aggravated with the longitudinal lines indicating poor nutrient absorption (digestive system is inflamed), compromising the digestive process. The deeper the lines, the more significant the condition. The white spots indicated malabsorption, mineral deficiencies, digestive tract inflammation, toxins/ama, allergenic foods, ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/wild-list-of-vata-imbalances) [The 3 Ayurvedic Doshas and Their Impact on Your Life | The Dance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha Wild List of Common Pitta Imbalances](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/hot-list-of-the-common-pitta-imbalances) Ayurvedic Nail Analysis Might Point to Health Concerns Ayurvedic Nail Analysis: How to Assess Your Health As opposed to a one-size-fits-all approach, Ayurveda recommends assessing your unique constitution (prakruti) and what is currently going for you (vikruti), to nail down what is occurring with your health. How to perform Ayurveda nail analysis: Wash your hands and remove any nail polish Sit down in a well-lit space Grab reading glasses or a magnifying glass if needed Slide your index finger over each nail, feeling for lines, ridges, spoons, or pitting Note the color of the nail bed and the surrounding skin Compare your assessment to the graphic above This simple Ayurveda nail diagnosis may help you uncover warning signs your body is sending you. The sooner dosha imbalances of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha are addressed - the better. How Can I Improve My Nail Health with Ayurveda? Support healthy nails by nourishing bone tissue (asthi dhatu) , balancing the doshas overall, cleansing, Ayurvedic food that's tailored to you, and reclaiming your calm by [soothing the nervous system](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/testimonials). (More on that later in this article.) How to Treat Brittle Nails in Ayurveda Soaking your fingertips in olive oil can help treat brittle nails and improve nail appearance. Rest your fingertips in warmed olive oil for about 15 minutes while you do some [ diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life). When finished, wash in lukewarm water. Follow treatment with our free [ guided practice](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices)s to soothe, balance and restore the nervous system. What are Ayurvedic herbs for nail growth? Ayurvedic herbs such as amla, guduchi, guggulu, and bhringaraj are all supportive for fingernail health and growth. Herbs need to fit one's overall dosha picture, however - a consultation with a [ Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/) can point you in the right direction. \"Veena possesses a wealth of intuitive knowledge about the subtle influences of the natural and psychical forces Ayurveda obtained by years of intensive meditative practice. She has developed a keen awareness of the healing powers of plants, as both food and medicinal herbs. This powerful combination of yoga practice and experience allows Veena to provide an effective path of healing tailored especially for you. You are in good hands with Veena.\" - Hame Persaud, Executive Vice President, HP Ingredients, Florida Ayurvedic Relationship Between Calcium and Bone and Nail Health Ayurveda has long understood the connection between hair, nails, and bone. Ayurvedic nail assessment has been around for thousands of years providing early information about potential health concerns. Now, modern research is catching up - and beginning to take a closer look at the connection between calcium and nail and bone health. According to [ Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/calcium-deficiency-nails#relationship), \"In one [ 2018 review Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023356/), researchers looked at the relationship between nail health and bone density. Nails have a different substance to that of bones, but poor nail health could be an indirect way of assessing the risk of bone conditions.\" Calcium plays several important roles, including healthy nails and bones as well as nerves and cardiac function. What are the White Spots on My Nails According to Ayurveda? In Ayurveda, white spots on the fingernails indicate malabsorption, which means your body is not properly digesting nutrients from your food. White spots also suggest deficiencies in minerals essential to bone health - particularly calcium, zinc, and magnesium. Can Lack of Calcium Cause Nail Problems? Calcium deficiencies may cause brittle nails and bones. This may result from low intake or poor absorption of this critical nutrient. Likewise, too much calcium may also lead to health issues. It is always important to check with your licensed healthcare provider. Other deficiencies or conditions may also be the cause. According to [ Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/calcium-deficiency-nails#relationship), \"people with severe calcium deficiencies may develop symptoms that affect the nails first. For example, the nails can become weak, become brittle, and grow more slowly than usual.\" Dry, brittle nails are not a major health concern. However, they may indicate nutrient deficiencies or other underlying issues. Ayurveda nail analysis can help identify these potential concerns earlier on. Deficiencies such as calcium have no immediate set of symptoms, making it challenging to detect any issues. The lens of Ayurvedic nail analysis may help us detect concerns and support bone, nail, and hair health. Including liver supportive herbs can help with calcium absorption, plus the benefits of the (correct) herbs. Ayurvedic Foods Rich in Calcium If your Ayurveda fingernail diagnosis suggests you're low on calcium, it's important not to worry. Relax and do what you can - like eating tasty, calcium-rich Ayurvedic foods! This includes: Sesame Seed: At least take one tablespoon of sesame seeds daily morning with water, as it is the best source of calcium for the bones. Almonds: Eat five to 10 soaked almonds every day. Soak them overnight and peel off the skin. Add them to your oatmeal, as a snack, or make and enjoy [Saumya Ayurveda's Rejuvenating Almond Beverage](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog/categories/recipes). Spinach: Spinach has loads of calcium, add one cup of cooked spinach cooked any way that is tasty to you and consistent with your Ayurveda food program. Figs: Soak one cup of dried fig overnight and then make a spread or a smoothie and have it with warm milk the next morning. Turmeric: Taken as part of your Saumya Savory Spice Mix, turmeric milk, or as part of your herbal protocol.

Internal Causes: May include chronic diseases such as diabetes, or chronic digestive issues as ama is produced for sub-optimal digestive process. \"When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.\" -- Ayurvedic proverb According the [ Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11303-toenail-fungus), the following may lead to nail fungal infections: Athlete's foot (tinea pedis). Diabetes. Hyperhidrosis (a disorder that makes you sweat a lot). A nail injury. Poor blood circulation due to peripheral vascular disease. Psoriasis Weakened immune system, such as from an autoimmune disorder or HIV. How common is nail fungus? The [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11303-toenail-fungus) reports, \"Toenail fungus is very common, especially as people start to age. Medical experts estimate that onychomycosis affects 1 in 10 people overall. That number jumps to 1 in 2 (50%) for people older than 70.\" External Causes: Unhygienic condition, chemical applications, nail injury, skin injury around the nail, moist fingers or toes, wearing closed-toe shoes, swimming in a pool, wearing artificial nails, and more.

How To Know If a Nail Fungus Afoot? Signs include discoloration, detaching from the nail bed, thickened, brittle, ragged, crumbly, and an unpleasant or even foul smell. According the [ Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nail-fungus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353294), you should see your doctor if: \"Diabetes and think you're developing nail fungus Bleeding around the nails Swelling or pain around the nails Difficulty walking\" Check with your doctor for a diagnosis. Different infections can mimic fungal infections Nail Fungus Among Us? Try an Ayurvedic Treatment. It happens, we get busy and sometimes can't pay attention to our nails, or sometimes we get run down and deeply out of balance and fungal (and other) infections make their move. It's possible for ama (\"toxins\" or undigested, unassimilated food debris) to build up and for the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha to go out of balance. Whether the doshas are out of balance, Vata has been aggravated for an extended period leading to depletion, and/or, ama is present, a comprehensive Ayurvedic approach is the treatment.

Ayurvedic Nail Analysis and Adrenal Health What Are the Adrenal Glands? There was a time, not too long ago, when people did not talk about their adrenal glands. Today, many folks are both interested in and concerned about these small but mighty organs. Why the sudden interest? People are tired, exhausted, and at the end of their tether. They feel older than they are, flat as a pancake, and at a loss as to what happened to their enthusiasm, motivation, and vitality. In a nutshell: they're suffering from chronic stress. The main purpose of the adrenal glands is to protect us from stress. These powerhouses, in addition to regulating blood pressure and sugar, regulate the hormones that influence our flight fight response. Today, we are well aware of adrenal glands, and we talk about adrenal fatigue in casual conversations. WOW! That says a lot, doesn't it? Life today is stressful and anxiety-provoking, and that stress leads to depletion, exhaustion, and burnout. To regain and maintain balance, most of us benefit from a comprehensive yet manageable [ Ayurveda plan](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page). What do Half Moons on Nails Mean in Ayurveda? In Ayurveda, the small half moons on our nailbeds (called lunalu) are reflective our agni, or digestive fire. If you notice tiny or non-existent lunalu, this indicates a weak digestive fire. A Certified Ayurvedic Practioner can help get your digestive system back on track through diet, herbs, and supportive lifestyle practices. Ayurveda Fingernail Health Signs and Adrenal Health We've talked about nail biting as a sign, acute or chronic, of high Vata dosha - of stress, anxiety, worry, and fear. This fingernail health sign hints at a troubling cycle: our anxiety affects our adrenal glands and, in turn, our adrenal glands affect our anxiety. Yikes! This cycle needs to be rebalanced. How do we begin to shift from being in a near constant state of fight- flight-freeze into a rest, restore, and relax state? In a word: breath, or pranayama. There is a saying, \"The mind is more in the body, than the body is in the mind.\" The Saumya 3 Step Meditation Process shifts us from fight-flight-freeze mode, to rest-restore-relax mode. Give it a try for forty days and observe the changes. The more grounded and relaxed we are, the smoother life flows. \"The breath is the connection between the mind and body, so by training the breath, we become calm, focused, and grounded, we slow down the aging process by decreasing stress. These practices are so simple and easy to have as part of our daily life. We actually feel and look younger.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda 1. [Learn Diaphragmatic Breathing and Change Your Life](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life). When we re-learn to breath diaphragmatically, we move from the flight-fight-freeze mode, to rest, restore, relaxation mode from where we want and need to live. 2.

Imbalanced vata disrupts apana vayu which such as elimination, urination, and birthing. When Vata is out of whack, apana reverses and flows upward. It does a complete reversal and that is how constipation and anxiety tend to occur together. So, when the energy is flowing up, put yourself upside down to restore pranas direction. Yes, inverted yog-asana, and specifically legs up on the wall (viparita karani). Sit on the floor near a wall. Use a yoga mat or blanket on the floor if needed. Swivel your body to face the wall and raise your legs slowly with awareness. How close your butt will be to the wall depends on your flexibility. There is no award for being closer, so go within your comfortable capacity. Now, lie down on the floor. Use any support you need for your back so that you are comfortable. Settle into the pose surrendering the body to the support of the floor. Place your arms with the elbows slightly bent and allow your chest and heart region to open. Close your eyes. Hang out here as long as you are comfortable. During an Ayurvedic consultation, we not only assess fingernail health - we assess the nails themselves. Each finger corresponds to one of the [ five elements](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/the-3-ayurvedic-doshas-and-their-impact-on-your-life) (earth, water, fire, air, and ether). Learn more about Ayurveda principles: [What is Ayurveda? A Beginner's Guide and Beyond](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/what-is-ayurveda-anyways) Take a close look at your ring fingers. They correspond to the element of water, which naturally relates to the kidneys. No surprise there, right? Think of urination and the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys. What do you notice about the nails on the ring fingers? Look at them compared to the other nails - are there lines, ridges, or white spots? Does that finger move more than the others? If you see differences, it may mean your adrenal glands are working too hard, and it is time to take care of yourself with a comprehensive, [customized Ayurveda plan ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page)that weaves naturally into your daily life. If you see differences in the nails, feel stressed, exhausted, [burnt out](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/pitta-burning-out-and-burning-up), have poor [sleep](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/ayurvedic-sleep-remedies-to-help-you-rest-easy), have [ digestive ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/ayurveda-and-heartburn-acid-reflux-and-gerd-cooling-heated-pitta-digestion)issues, and just don't feel like yourself anymore, read and watch our client [ stories](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/testimonials) and see how you may benefit from a [consultation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/services-page) with Saumya Ayurveda. \"When I first met Veena, I had been chronically tired for a few months and I also had increased anxiety despite taking an SSRI for years.

Oftentimes it is too much - and our anxiety cup overflows. The continual presence of stress directly impacts the adrenal glands, often keeping us in fight, flight, freeze mode, which perpetuates stress, anxiety, and poor sleep. It's a vicious cycle that shows on our faces and our nails - and it intrudes on the sense of inner peace we long for. When you do an Ayurvedic nail analysis, think of bone, hair, and fingernail health as all connected. Thinning hair and thin, brittle nails, may mean thinning bones.
