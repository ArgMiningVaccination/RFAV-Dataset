Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)This program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and provides the only programmed research funds received by the University. In addition, this program facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty; supports unique research training for military medical students and resident fellows; and allows the University`s faculty researchers to collect pilot data in order to secure research funds from extramural sources (estimated $25-$30 million annually). Eighty to 100 intramural research projects are active each year, including 20-25 new starts. Projects are funded on a peer- reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the fund of knowledge intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense Science and Technology (S&T) programs. (U)The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Combat Casualty Care (CCC), Infectious Diseases (ID), and Military Operational Medicine (MOM). The portfolio of research projects will vary annually because this research is investigator-initiated. Examples of typical research efforts are: Combat Casualty Care: Ischemia and reperfusion injury, traumatic brain and peripheral nerve injury, neural control of pain, endotoxic shock, malignant hyperthermia, inflammation and wound healing.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA UNCLASSIFIEDInfectious Diseases: Immunology and molecular biology of bacterial, viral and parasitic disease threats to military operations.

Emphasis currently falls on the roles that inflammatory mediators play in these processes. Investigation of endotoxin sensitivity at the cellular level has characterized the cascade of activation and influx of inflammatory cells in gram-negative sepsis in response to LPS, an important step in identifying targets for controlling sepsis-based inflammation. Work toward mapping the activation mechanism of opioid receptors led to identification of specific G proteins responsible for diminishing the ability of opioids to relive pain. Investigation of transcriptional control of differentiation in neural cells established that Myt-1 proteins may facilitate repair in the central nervous system.

Militarily relevant biological threat agents such as E. coli and its toxins, influenza A, typhoid and HIV all garnered significant resources. A study comparing neutralizing antibody responses to HIV and VEE completed its first phase, where in vivo safety tests elicited no adverse reactions to intracerebral administration of the replicon vaccine. Results from an ongoing investigation of lactobacillus as a possible pro- biotic agent against gonorrhea suggested that, during infection, N. Gonorrhea generates high amounts of an enzyme that can combat the H2O2 produced by lactobacilli. Work on a family of protocols investigating the transmission of Bartonellosis in Peru expanded to include a newly discovered epidemic population, a useful model for the experience of a military population entering an infectious region. A protocol to develop a candidate vaccine for HIV-1, new in FY00, generated HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins for in vivo testing in a mouse model during FY01. ($ 0.653 million) (U) Military Operational Medicine: The forty-one projects in the MOM program included on-going work on identifying the causes of stress fractures, particularly among active women, and the response of endocrine function to (1) emotional stress and (2) strenuous physical exertion. A study of the role of melanopsin in regulating circadian rhythm showed that polarized and non-polarized light are equally effective in controlling acute pineal melatonin suppression. Investigation of the role of neuromodulators in the amygdala in rats with elevated basal level of endogen-ous norepinephrine suggested that beta-blockers can help diminish formation of traumatic emotional memories. A cultured-cell study of glutaminergic processes found preliminary indications that NMDA protects against neuronal cell death. Investigation of pituitary responses to dexamethasone and disulfiram in vivo found that the regulation of PHM`s expression and catalytic efficiency serve as coordinated physiological mechanisms for maintaining appropriate levels of alpha- amidating activity, although the response to the two drugs occurs via different mechanisms. ($ 0.996 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA FY 2001 Plans: (U) Infectious Diseases: Work continues toward development of vaccines for HIV, gonorrhea, and other STDs; understanding of the pathogenesis of VEE, HTLV-1, and influenza A; and effective management of infections by H. pylori and Bartonellosis. New studies include the next stage of an investigation of shiga-like toxins of E. coli; neutralizing antibody response to VEE and HIV replicons; and identification of a new possible transmission vector for Bartonellosis. ($ 0.725 million) (U) Military Operational Medicine: New projects supported in FY00 include analysis of the circadian photoentrainment pathway in a murine model; regulation of peptide amidation; and immediate early gene requirements for long-term potentiation and learning. Studies of stress in relation to eating disorders, nicotine use, physical exertion, and immunosuppression will all continue, as will investigation of transcriptional control of neural cell differentiation, the role of AP-1 proteins in synergistic signaling, and the role of neuromodulators in neuroplasticity in the amygdala. ($ 0.841 million) (U) Combat Casualty Care: Ongoing projects include a family of studies of malignant hyperthermia, aimed primarily at developing a reliable genetic marker; investigation of signal transduction; and endotoxins. New projects in FY01 will pursue a noninvasive diagnostic test for malignant hyperthermia and investigate the mechanism of liver failure in a disulfiram-based model. ($ 0.423 million) (U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) Efforts will continue in all of USUHS`s major research areas (CCC, ID, and MOM) in FY01. Since specific, investigator-initiated projects compete for funding each year, no detailed description of the research is possible at this time.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) P103, University Research Initiative (URI). The URI has three primary objectives: (1) to support basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining the U.S. military technology superiority; (2) to contribute to the education of scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to defense needs; and (3) to help build and maintain the infrastructure needed to improve the quality of defense research performed at universities. Paralleling these objectives, this project competitively supports programs at universities nationwide in three interrelated categories: Research . The main thrust of the URI is multidisciplinary research. Multidisciplinary efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high -priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline; for many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approach serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to application. Two multidisciplinary thrusts beginning in FY 2001 are university research for the National Nanotechnology Initiative and for critical military infrastructure protection. The URI also supports the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single -investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers. Education . The URI promotes graduate education in science and engineering for U.S. citizens through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program. UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Infrastructure . Through the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP), the URI contributes to the university research infrastructure that is essential for the performance of cutting -edge defense research. The DURIP allows researchers to purchase more costly items of research equipment than typically can be acquired under single -investigator awards. Through FY 2001, the URI also includes the URI Support Program (URISP), which broadens the base of academic institutions participating in defense research by involving institutions that historically have not received much defense funding. These programs complement the infrastructure building of the Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research that was in project P104 of this program element through FY 2000. (U) P 104, Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DEPSCoR). The DEPSCoR helps build research infrastructure at academic institutions in states that historically have not received much Federal research funding. In FY 2001, the DEPSCoR moved from project 104 within this URI program element into a new program element (PE 0601114D8Z). (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY2000 Programmatic accomplishments: Research . The FY 2000 multidisciplinary research competition conducted by the Services resulted in 20 new awards in high -priority basic research areas of multi -Service interest related to: data fusion in microsensor arrays; adaptive learning technology; decision making in the presence of uncertain information; battlespace electronics and optoelectronics; ultracold atom optics; functional materials; and prime reliant coatings. New knowledge and understanding resulting from basic research related to these technology areas will lead to applications relevant to a broad range of future military systems. The multidisciplinary nature of these areas, and their multi -Service relevance, make them ideally suited for inclusion under the multidisciplinary element of th e URI. In addition to the new multidisciplinary research efforts, multidisciplinary and PECASE programs begun in prior years continued, with new competitive awards for PECASE programs. ( $139.574 millio n) Education . Under the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program, 108 new graduate fellowships were competitively awarded for study leading to advanced degrees in science and engineering fields of importance to national defense. ( $13.848 millio n) UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Infrastructure . More than 220 new awards were made under the FY 2000 DURIP competition, enabling the purchase of research instrumentation needed to sustain universities' capabilities to perform cutting -edge defense research. Under the URI Support Program, efforts initiated in prior yea rs continued in areas such as electronic and magnetic materials, image analysis, micromanufacturing, and neurodynamics. The FY 2000 competition under the DEPSCoR program resulted in 81 new awards. ( $69.944 millio n) (U) Selected technical accomplishments: Researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, in partnership with Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, Boston University, Iowa State University, Arizona State University, and Manhattan College, developed a comprehensive computer model to simulate and improve understanding of crystal growth processes. The model is unique in that it covers globally the entire system involved in crystal growth (e.g., the heat transfer from the various heaters, the dynamics of the liquid phase from which the crystal grows, the growing solid phase and its interface with the liquid phase). The increased understanding permits growth of crystals with fewer defects, leading to increased yields and usable crystals of larger diameters. One advance concerns indium phosphide (InP) crystals needed for high frequency satellite -to-ground and satellite -to-satellite links. For InP, the team used simulations, crystal growth experiments (in collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate) and characterizations of resulting materials to understand how the density of crystal defects twins and dislocations are linked to material stress and thereby to growth conditions (e.g., temperature, temperature gradient, pressure, and rotation rate of the sample during growth). Using this knowledge, they controlled growth conditions to reduce twins and dislocations, producing usable crystals with twice the diameter (4\", rather than 2\") and 25% greater yields. Another advance is for silicon carbide (SiC) crystals used in solid -state devices for high-power microwave applications, particularly where higher operating temperatures are needed. By simulating the vapor growth of SiC and using the new understanding to improve control of the process, the researchers reduced the size of \"micropipes,\" microscopic holes that make the crystal surface unusable for electronic devices, and reduced their density from over 1000 to as little as 2-3 per square centimeter. With this reduction in micropipe density, 75% more chips can be placed on a wafer of a given size. In a third area, the researchers developed the first model of the hydrothermal synthesis process that is used to grow high-quality quartz crystals for timing in the Global Positioning System and other space -based applic ations. Resulting improvements in that process can enable 30-40% higher growth rates for advanced nonlinear optical materials, such as bismuth silicate and zinc oxide that are used to process and store information.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Scientists and engineers at the University of California at Los Angeles and University of Southern California (USC) synthesized a new electro-optic polymer with an exceptionally high electro -optic (E-O) coefficient. The new material enabled USC researchers to demonstrate an E -O modulator for o ptical communications that has lower optical loss than lithium niobate and operates at high frequencies with significantly lower applied voltages. The high E -O coefficient in the polymer stems from inclusion of highly polarizable molecules called chromophores. Based on their theoretical analysis, the scientists modified the chromophores' shape in a way that allowed the molecules to better align with each other, thereby yielding E -O coefficients comparable to those observed in an inorganic modulator material like lithium niobate. With the polymer, however, the light wave that is being modulated moves at a speed that more closely matches the speed of the applied, radio -frequency (RF) voltage that does the modulating, allowing the modulation to occur over a longer interaction region within the polymeric material than it would in the inorganic material. Consequently, the polymer needs less RF driving voltage at any given modulation frequency and can operate at higher frequencies before the gain of the link falls off or the noise level becomes too large. The researchers have demonstrated a modulator at about 100 gigaherz with good thermal stability to temperatures near 100 degrees Farenheit, drive voltage near one volt, and low insertion loss (less than 8 decibels from the input to output optical fiber). This advance is important to high -bandwidth data transmission for the digitized battlefield, network -centric warfare (e.g., using a secure, internet -based, common tactical picture), and many other military ap plications. A team of aerospace engineers and materials scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made a number of strides toward developing piezoelectric actuators capable of larger mechanical displacements, or strokes. Longer -stroke actua tors are important for military applications such as twisting helicopter rotor blades or rotating their trailing edge flaps, to reduce harmful blade vibrations and blade -vortex interaction noise. The team grew for the first time single -crystal fibers of h igh-strain piezoelectric oxides (e.g., sodium bismuth titanate, or NBT), using an edge -defined film -fed growth method. The NBT's maximum strain is larger than the maximum strain for what is now the leading piezoelectric ceramic material, lead zirconate titanate (PZT). With the added advantage of the single crystal fibers, as opposed to polycrystalline PZT fibers, the researchers demonstrated actuators with eight times the stroke of conventional PZT actuators. Switching to crystalline oxides from PZT, which contains lead, also will reduce toxicity. Another accomplishment was the development of a micro -molding technique to form interconnected mats of polycrystalline fibers. This technique offers two advantages over current methods. It produces higher quality fibers, with fewer voids or other defects, to increase the length of the stroke obtainable with polycrystalline materials. More importantly, it produces interconnected mats of fibers current methods generate single fibers of 130 micron diameter and building an actuator is a labor -intensive process that requires alignment of hundreds of fibers, one by one, into a sheet. This is an important step toward increasing production and reducing the cost of an actuator from about $1,000 currently, with the goal being to reduce it to $20-25. In parallel with these efforts, the team developed a mathematical model to gain an understanding of the transient behavior, under slow loading conditions, of active fiber composites and other highly insulating devices; this understanding is needed to help optimize piezoelectric actuators for defense applications.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin developed a new approach for detecting low concentrations of chemical and biological warfare agents. The approach identifies specific agents and does so quickly, allowing personnel to protect themselves or take medical countermeasures. The new system is a major advance over current methods for detecting low concentrations of biological agents because it is compatible with a portable device that troops could use in the field; current methods require bulkier laboratory equipment not always readily accessible to troops in combat situations. In their new approach, the researchers developed multiple types of sensors and achieved rapid production of them in quantity (hundreds of uniquely responsive detectors can be fabricated within a week). The sensors include: solutions that change color in the presence of specific disease -causing organisms; highly specific proteins tha t produce a measurable signal in response to toxins in the environment; nucleic acids that read the DNA of organisms and are able to detect unique genetic markers for anthrax bacilli and other biological agents; and antibody sensors that detect specific components of the spore coats of bacterial agents. The extremely sensitive sensors can detect concentrations of agents in the range of parts per million to parts per billion. The researchers attach the sensors to beads that they put into discretely separated wells that can be micromachined in large numbers in a silicon substrate. Because the sensors are in wells, rather than on a chip surface, the approach can use solution -phase reactions to detect agents. Troops would use the combined responses of differ ent types of sensors in a single, portable microarray to recognize a wide range of known agents and to detect previously unknown threats.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) FY 2001 Plans: Research .

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program element funds basic research aimed at developing fundamental scientific knowledge to support future DOD high- energy-laser (HEL) systems. HEL weapons systems have many potential advantages, including speed-of-light time-to-target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazine depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no need for stocks of munitions or warheads. As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions, including some that are impossible, or nearly so, for conventional weapons. These include interception of ballistic missiles in boost phase, defeat of high- speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with no collateral damage. Research conducted under this program element develops the technology necessary to enable these and other HEL missions. (U) This program element is part of an overall DOD initiative in HEL science and technology being conducted by the recently formed HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). The goals of this HEL JTO funded research are to provide the technology to make HEL systems more effective and also to make them lighter, smaller, cheaper, and more easily supportable on the battlefield. In general, efforts funded under this program element are chosen for their potential to have major impact on multiple HEL systems and on multiple Service missions. As a result of this focus and of close coordination with the military departments and defense agencies, this program element complements other DOD HEL programs that are directed at more specific Service and agency needs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Initiative PE 0601108D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) A broad range of technology is addressed in key areas such as chemical lasers, solid-state lasers, beam control, optics, propagation, and free-electron lasers. Research is conducted principally by universities, but also by Government laboratories and industry. The program element funds theoretical, computational, and experimental investigations. In many cases, these three types of investigations are combined under a single effort, thereby creating synergistic effects between various scientific approaches, and greatly enhancing the potential for making important breakthroughs in HEL-related technologies. DOD intends to translate the knowledge developed under this program element into proof-of-concept solutions to broadly defined HEL-related military problems as part of further laboratory experiments and field-testing.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Initiative Millions) FY 2000 FY Element High Energy Continuing Continuing (U) Project Number and Title: P108 High Energy Laser (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2001 Accomplishments: (U) None; this program element is a new initiative as of FY 2002.

Each research topic will be investigated by one or more teams of researchers representing different academic disciplines. The projects will be closely monitored by the military departments and defense agencies for breakthrough advances that can be rapidly transitioned to DOD HEL applied-research and advanced-technology-development programs. Using a competitive process designed to select only the highest payoff proposals, DOD intends to fund six topic areas:UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Initiative PE 0601108D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Fundamental research in solid-state lasers. This research will seek to develop the scientific knowledge needed for revolutionary advances in fieldable high-brightness and high-power diode-pumped solid-state lasers. Over the long term, solid state lasers, because they run on electricity, promise to greatly simplify logistics requirements. Achieving this promise, however, requires that cost, power, and efficiency barriers be breached. To enable these developments, research areas of interest include laser materials with large fluorescence lifetime and cross-section and the ability to operate at high temperatures, athermal laser gain media, modular and scalable architectures for laser power scaling, means of increasing efficiency to in excess of 20%, operation in harsh environments, and corrections for thermally induced distortions in gain media. (U) Fundamental research in affordable HEL fiber-laser modules. This research will examine the scientific concerns involved in developing and producing low-cost, manufacturable modules in the 100 Watt to kilowatt range and in developing methods to combine modules to achieve the weapons power levels. The focus on affordability could lead to drastic reductions in acquisition cost for future HEL systems. Areas of interest include laser materials and devices, nonlinear optical phenomena at high power levels, reliable and low-cost design techniques, and integrated optics and beam/pulse forming. (U) Fundamental research in modeling, design, and simulation of beam-control systems for military HEL applications. This research will examine the scientific concerns associated with atmospheric beam control, to include characterization efforts in aerial, battlefield, and maritime-like environments. These efforts could lead to substantial increases in the lethality of HEL systems without the need for ever-higher power levels. Areas of interest include improved theoretical and computer-based analysis of propagation effects, advanced wavefront sensing and reconstruction (especially in the presence of thermal blooming), the effects of extended reference sources used for wavefront correction, and new concepts for effective wavefront sensing and correction, especially under high-scintillation conditions. (U) Fundamental research in high power, lightweight optics. This research will attempt to establish a multidisciplinary program that addresses advanced technological elements and concepts relevant to the development of lightweight optics for HEL systems. This research will be aimed at greatly reducing weight while simultaneously improving performance and reducing cost, issues of importance to all potential military HEL systems, particularly space-based systems. Areas of interest include basic materials and fabrication techniques, large optics lightweight structure and deployment concepts, HEL optical coatings, multipurpose materials (e.g., wavefront correction combined with aperture adjustment), and control mechanisms.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Initiative PE 0601108D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Fundamental research in chemical lasers. This research will focus on improved understanding of the processes necessary for the realization of truly closed cycle, lightweight, high-power, continuously operating chemical lasers. A completely closed cycle chemical-laser HEL weapon would require only electrical power and not expensive, heavy exhaust systems or chemical supplies, thereby capitalizing on the high efficiencies inherent in the chemical-laser process, while enhancing supportability. Areas of interest include studies of chemical processes and reactions for a closed-cycle chemical-laser system, new sources of the high- energy chemical species needed to produce the lasing event, and novel recovery systems for regeneration of the laser fuels. (U) Fundamental research in high-average-power ultra-short-pulse free-electron lasers (FELs). This research will advance the average power obtainable by ultra-short-pulse FELs significantly over the current state-of-the-art, while increasing efficiency and lethality and decreasing relative size and cost, thus enhancing opportunities for eventual weaponization of FELs for military applications. Areas of interest include high-current devices and control methods, higher damage threshold resonator optics, advanced optical cavity designs for high power and compact spaces, design methods for scaling FELs to reach multi-megawatt class average power levels. (U) Funds from this program element will also support research on specific HEL-related problems for which fundamental scientific research promises to offer innovative and revolutionary solutions, and which are amenable to solution by a small team from a single academic discipline. The areas of interest include, but are not limited to: beam-control theory, propagation analysis and measurement, chemical-laser mixing and diagnostics, solid-state-laser materials and design concepts, modeling and simulation of HELs, and education and training of HEL scientists and engineers for public and private-sector service.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Program Change Value 0.000 0.000 0.000 Continuing 0.000 11.877 Summary Explanation : (U) Funding : PE 0601108D8Z is a new PE established for FY 2000-2007 to better balance research in new revolutionary laser technology with large demonstration programs.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) A shared commitment between industry and Government continues to be created via the Government/Industry Co-sponsorship of University Research (GICUR) program. It will capitalize on university based research, education and training in technologies of strategic importance to national defense and also to industry. It provides an emphasis on ground-breaking research with a long- term horizon, and education and training in selected research areas which are vital to advancement of technologies. The ommitment is a jointly formed pool of funding and a shared management structure for sponsoring this sort of long term basic research at universities. This will provide the military with leading-edge technologies as well as reducing vulnerabilities of industries involved, increase long-term technical growth in these areas, infuse new ideas and approaches, all of which are important for national security. Industry and government share responsibility for research focus area selection and overall direction. This program will also employ advances in information technologies and telecommunications to provide extensive connectivity among the partners and research performers from the outset. Thus, strengths of individual investigators can be effectively linked, taking advantage of geographically disbursed national resources. Mechanisms will be established for personnel exchange and interactions to provide for continuing education of highly qualified researchers already working in leading edge and emerging S&T. One program area implemented is on Complex Adaptive Networks. It meets the program criteria and is vital to DoD needs. The high priority thrust in this area is providing powerful mathematical and computer modeling methods to steer technology such that cascading effects and rapid, catastrophic failure of networks (e.g., battlefield communications, electrically powered ships, multisensor surveillanc/integration) are avoided.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program element funds High Energy Laser (HEL) applied research aimed at translating fundamental scientific knowledge into proof-of-concept solutions relevant to HEL systems. HEL weapons systems have many potential advantages, including speed-of- light time-to-target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazine depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no need for stocks of munitions or warheads. As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions, including some that are impossible, or nearly so, for conventional weapons. These include interception of ballistic missiles in boost phase, defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with no collateral damage. Research conducted under this program element develops the technology necessary to enable these and other HEL missions. (U) This program element is part of an overall DOD initiative in HEL science and technology being conducted by the recently formed HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). The goals of this HEL JTO funded research are to provide the technology to make HEL systems more effective and also to make them lighter, smaller, cheaper, and more easily supportable on the battlefield. In general, efforts funded under this program element are chosen for their potential to have major impact on multiple HEL systems and on multiple Service missions. As a result of this focus and of close coordination with the military departments and defense agencies, this program element complements other DOD HEL programs that are directed at more specific Service and agency needs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Research PE 0602890D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) A broad range of technology is addressed in key areas such as chemical lasers, solid-state lasers, beam control, optics, propagation, and free-electron lasers.

These devices have the potential to eliminate the need for munitions resupply on the battlefield in key mission areas such as tactical strike and air defense. Solid-state-laser technology development emphasizes combining fiber-laser modules, scaling up power in diode-pumped lasers, and testing new systems concepts. Results of these activities are key to developing solid-state lasers with weapons-class power levels. Examples of FY 2001 solid-state- laser technology-development activities include the following: Developing 1 kilowatt-class fiber-laser amplifiers and designing and experimentally testing methods for coherently phasing groups of fiber-laser amplifiers to increase total output power to the 10 to 100 kilowatts level Developing new high-power, high-reliability diode-pumped laser power supplies for fiber lasers and amplifiers, to withstand the thermal and material stresses of sustained high-power operation at powers in excess of 1 kilowatt, thereby providing a cornerstone for the development of future lighter, more lethal, more affordable, and more supportable solid-state-laser HEL weapon systems Developing, fabricating, and demonstrating a design for a thin-disk (as opposed to bar-like) solid-state laser at a 300 to 500 Watt power level, as a step toward the future development of 8 kilowatt disk-based laser devices, thereby potentially easing thermal- management problems on future high-power solid-state lasers Developing, fabricating, and demonstrating amplifiers and correcting mirrors as a means of mitigating the thermal distortions on 300 Watt average power/5 kilowatt peak power solid state lasers, thereby taking an initial step towards scaling the technology to 100 kilowatt and enabling extremely high-power solid-state lasers (U) Beam-control technology development centers on those technologies directly applicable to surface, air, and space mission areas, as well as development of supporting technologies. Results of these activities will be transitioned to near-term HEL systems and will also serve to enhance the HEL-related technology base and industrial capability. Examples of FY 2001 beam-control technology development activities include the following: Developing high-power coatings and substrates, thus reducing the weight and increasing the affordability of HEL subsystems Conducting ground-to-space compensated laser beam propagation from a weapons-class aperture (e.g., several meters), thereby demonstrating key Ground Based Laser technologies for future space and missile-defense applications Developing advanced adaptive-optics component-level and subsystem-level technologies and control methodologies, thereby contributing to increasing the effective range of future HEL weaponsUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Research PE 0602890D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Designing, fabricating, and testing novel concepts for adaptive optics, which promise to greatly decrease complexity and weight and increase affordability while still allowing HEL weapons to compensate for atmospheric turbulence Designing and fabricating new optical wavefront sensing devices that operate even in conditions of extremely high turbulence, thereby allowing beam-control subsystems to operate effectively even at low altitudes (e.g., for tactical laser systems) (U) Chemical-laser technology efforts concentrate on developing improved predictive and design capabilities, new chemical-laser concepts, and higher performance and more supportable chemical-laser technologies. Despite the fact that chemical lasers are the most mature of the HEL laser device technologies, further technology development has the potential to greatly enhance their viability as weapon systems. Results of these activities will result in chemical lasers that are lighter and more affordable. Examples of FY 2001 chemical-laser technology-development activities include the following: Developing more sophisticated computational models for accurate performance prediction, thereby greatly improving design capabilities for future Hydrogen Fluoride/Deuterium Fluoride (HF/DF) and Chemical Oxygen Iodine (COIL) chemical lasers, particularly in the critical area of mixing nozzle design Designing, testing, and fabricating advanced mixing nozzles on HF/DF laser devices, thereby improving performance, reducing weight, and increasing effective magazine size on future space-based and ground-based HEL weapon systems Installing and testing a 20 kilowatt closed-cycle (sealed exhaust) COIL device as a means of assessing closed cycle COIL performance and supporting design of future closed-cycle chemical lasers, thereby offering the potential for chemical lasers that can reuse their chemical supplies, which greatly improves their supportability Designing, fabricating, and testing a novel means of delivering iodine chemicals to a COIL laser system in a way that eliminates the need for complex chemical tanks, thereby reducing weight and increasing reliability of future airborne chemical-laser-based HEL weapon systems, as well as simplifying iodine-associated logistics requirementsUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Research PE 0602890D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) This program element funds two detailed studies that examine potential military missions for which HELs present unique solutions because of their inherent characteristics (i.e., speed-of-light, possibility of graduated effects, precise target selectability, nearly unlimited magazine size, reduced logistics requirements, etc.) as compared to today's conventional weapons. These studies are being used to focus the investment strategy for technology development.

Specifically, the FY 2001 FEL activities included the following: Designing and testing new technology for using permanent magnets on FELs, which simplify FEL design and increase affordability because permanent magnets eliminate the need for costly electromagnets (U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) Pursuant to Congressional direction the DOD is developing a comprehensive, prioritized investment plan for HEL science and technology. This investment plan is being developed by the HEL JTO, in coordination with the military departments and the defense agencies. The plan, which will be completed by the end of FY 2001, will form the basis for the expanded work to be conducted under this program element in FY 2002 and beyond. Although the plan is not yet completed, the broad outlines of plan are becoming clear. Work will be conducted in solid-state lasers, free-electron lasers, chemical lasers, lethality, atmospheric propagation and compensation, lightweight deployable optics, beam control, chemical lasers, optical components, and modeling and simulation. (U) Solid-state-laser work will focus on phasing of fiber lasers, the design and manufacture of reliable diode lasers as pump sources, and the thermal control of laser media. (U) Free-electron-laser (FEL) work will focus on technologies to scale to high power and technologies to permit FELs to be fielded on military platforms. (U) Chemical-laser research will include efforts to develop COIL lasers appropriate for space-based and tactical applications and efforts to improve the wavefront quality of HF/DF lasers.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 2R-1 High Energy Laser Research PE 0602890D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) Lethality work will develop a firm scientific understanding of the relative advantages of repetitively pulsed and continuous-wave lasers for defeating different targets of interest. (U) Atmospheric propagation and compensation will concentrate on understanding atmospheric limitations in low-altitude tactical scenarios and on developing advanced adaptive-optics technology to increase lethal range in these scenarios. (U) A new effort will be initiated in lightweight, high-power deployable optics to reduce system weight while increasing laser intensity on target for space-based and other HEL systems. (U) Beam-control efforts will focus on developing novel techniques, such as phased-array beam control and electronic beam steering, to reduce system size and weight and enable new system configurations (e.g., a conformal configuration on an aircraft). (U) Advanced components\u2014detectors for tracking systems, high-power coatings, optical substrates, wavefront sensors, deformable mirrors\u2014will be developed to improve HEL system performance and to help protect and enhance the fragile manufacturing base in this critical area. (U) Modeling and simulation efforts will be increased with the goal of providing a fully realistic model of end-to-end system performance, from birth of photons in the laser to their death at the target, thereby improving the design of HEL systems and reducing the need for expensive field testing. (U) It is expected that many of the 30 projects begun in FY 2001 will continue in FY 2002, as will mission-analyze efforts.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)This program supports efforts in advanced technology development to provide biomedical strategies for preventing, treating, assessing and predicting casualties from ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with biological warfare (BW)/chemical warfare (CW) agents. It is directed at the need for the Department of Defense (DoD) to be prepared to execute military missions within radiation environments, to manage radiation crises associated with terrorist activities, and for consequence management in the event of nuclear weapons detonation. The DoD is ethically committed to protection of Service members from the adverse health effects of ionizing radiation to the fullest extent consistent with operational requirements. The program incorporates findings from basic and applied research into highly integrated and focused advanced technology development studies to produce: (1) protective and therapeutic strategies, (2) tools to measure radiation and depleted uranium (DU) exposure to military personnel, and (3) accurate models to predict casualties, particularly in combined nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) environments. The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), because of its multidisciplinary staff and exceptional laboratory and radiation facilities, is uniquely qualified to executes the program prescribed by its mission. Because national laboratories operated by the Department of Energy no longer support advanced research relevant to military medical radiobiology, AFRRI is currently the sole laboratory in existence with the combined capabilities needed to conduct this research.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Medical Advanced Program Millions) FY 2000 FY Cost Total Program Element (PE) Cost1.986 2.025 2.086 Continuing Continuing Risk Assessment and Biamedical Applications/P5061.986 2.025 2.086 Continuing Continuing (U) Project Number and Title: P506 Risk Assessment and Biamedical Applications (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) Demonstrated efficacy of combined cytokine (IL-11 and G-CSF) treatment for chronic radiation exposure of the hematopoietic system.($ 0.165 million) (U) Distributed pre-beta version of the biodosimetry assessment tool (BAT) software program to selected laboratories and clinical colleagues for initial review and comments.($ 0.100 million) (U) Demonstrated safety of 5-androstenediol in preclinical trial using the canine animal model.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This R&D program is a cooperative, jointly funded effort between DoD and DOE to pursue new and innovative warhead, explosive, and fuze technologies in order to bring about major improvements in non-nuclear munitions. This program supports the development and exploration of new munitions concepts and technology preceding system engineering development. Through our funding arrangement with DOE, DoD resources are matched. More importantly, this relatively small DoD contribution effectively taps the annual billion-dollar DOE RDT&E investment by accessing the specialized skills, scientific equipment, facilities and computational tools not available in DoD. (U) The effort exploits the extensive and highly developed technology base resident in the National Laboratories relevant to achieving the goal of developing capable, cost-effective conventional munitions, and leverages DoD investments with matching DOE investments. The current program supports 37 projects in warhead technology, energetic materials, advanced initiation and fuze development, munitions lifecycle technology, and computer simulation. A specific Service laboratory sponsors each of these projects. The program is administered and reviewed by a Joint Technical Advisory Committee composed of members from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OSD, and DOE. Projects are peer-reviewed semi-annually by DoD Service Laboratory/Technical Center personnel in order to monitor technical excellence and ensure that the technologies under development address priority DoD needs. The program is integrated with Service efforts through the Project Reliance Weapons Panel and participation in the Defense Technology Area Plan for Conventional Weapons. The program is reviewed under the Technology Area Review and Assessment process.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Title: P225 DoD/DOE Munitions (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments:UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) Advanced initiation is an enabling technology for the next generation of warheads. It supports the development of advanced aimable warheads, target-adaptable warheads, and survivable high-velocity hard target penetrators. This program continues to provide improved component options and new architectures for use in advanced electronic safing, arming and firing systems. The objective is to provide a set of characterized, qualified, generic components (and suppliers) and to demonstrate their use in prototype designs. In FY1997 an effort was initiated to reduce the size and cost of electronic safing and arming devices (ESAD) by a factor of 10 over currently fielded technology. Utilizing newly developed and qualified all-commercial components, a low-energy prototype ESAD was demonstrated this year that represents a factor of 10 reduction in size and a factor of 4 reduction in cost. While this technology enables significant improvement in weapon design and capability, cost remains a barrier to utilization in low-cost, mass-produced munitions. An analysis of the cost drivers shows that we are close to the limits with the current component designs and architectures. Therefore, the focus of the component effort was shifted this year to exploit recent advances in microelectronics, micro- electromechanical systems, micro-lasers and optical initiation. These new technologies offer opportunities for increased operational capability from micro firing systems along with a further order-of-magnitude decrease in size and reduced cost. Efforts continued on component shock hardening and packaging in support of Service initiatives in high-velocity penetrators. Chip slapper detonators, ceramic capacitors, and the new MCT semiconductor switches were tested in a single axis at representative shock levels with no performance loss. A divided Hopkinson bar apparatus is under development to simultaneously test ESAD components in multi-axis shock environments as defined from instrumented high-velocity penetration tests. To preserve and transition the advanced electronic initiation technology base developed under this program, a computerized knowledge base is under development on design, manufacture, test and surveillance. Sections on slapper detonator technology were completed this year. This classified tool will ensure experience retention in archives and support government laboratories and contractors.($ 2.810 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) DoD and DOE have very similar requirements for energetic materials. Both agencies desire high explosives with increased or tailored performance and decreased sensitivity, and recent accomplishments have benefited both agencies. Like advanced initiation, improved energetic materials are enabling technology for the next generation of weapon systems that will be safer, smaller and more lethal. Under this program a combination of evolutionary and novel technologies are under development. Conventional chemistry has been used to develop more powerful, less sensitive explosives. Nano-structured and engineered materials are being explored to increase energy density and energy on target by factors of three or more. Higher risk efforts are also underway to explore the possibility of metastable High Energy Density Materials (HEDM). Using conventional chemistry a number of new candidate molecules have been synthesized, characterized and formulated. The development of new materials is based on theoretical molecular design. The structure, performance and sensitivity of new molecules are predicted computationally, then synthesis is attempted. The focus is in two areas: molecules with significantly increased energy over current materials and very insensitive materials with reasonable energies. A new molecule, LLM-121, with a predicted energy density greater than CL-20 has been made. Characterization work is pending the crystallization of the material in pure form. As reported last year, another new explosive under development is LLM-105. It is dense, thermally stable and very insensitive. With 30% more energy than TNT it has possible detonator and booster applications and is an alternative to TATB in special purpose weapons such as hard target penetrators that have to survive high shock loadings. The characterization of this material is essentially complete and formulation work is underway for possible weapons applications. Metastable Intermolecular Composites (MIC) developed under this program were the first successful examples of nano-structured energetic materials with significantly enhanced performance. They demonstrated that tailored, ultra-fine reactant particles could dramatically increase the energy release rate of thermite-like materials and provide twice the total energy of high explosives. The first application of this technology is for lead-free percussion primers for small arms ammunition, and this program is now in engineering development under SERDP funding. A new bulk process for manufacturing nano-structured energetic materials using sol-gel chemistry has now been developed with the promise of precise control of material homogeneity, properties, and geometry. Additional applications of the material are under evaluation including reactive warheads that better couple energy to the target and applications that require very high thermal loadings. Extended solid HEDMs are also under development. This work uses intense pressure and temperature to force elements into highly energetic bonding states that can be recovered to ambient conditions. Current synthesis techniques have produced CO-derived solids and a family of novel nitrogen materials, but in very small quantities. These materials are expected to be highly energetic, but characterizing them, and particularly verifying the energy content, has been difficult due to the microscopic quantities of material available. The two principal activities this year have been in improvingUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDthe diagnostics used to characterize the new HEDMs and the design of a new bulk quantity synthesis capability. The creation of the thermochemical code Cheetah represents a major accomplishment of this program. The code predicts the performance of energetic materials including high explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics and reduces the number of tests necessary to develop a new material. Cheetah 3.0 will be released this year to more than 300 DoD, DOE and DoD contractor users. This version includes new equations of state resulting in greatly enhanced stability and accuracy of the code. A major effort is also underway to develop a suite of codes for use in predicting the response of energetic materials in weapon systems subjected to thermal and mechanical insult. The objective is to reduce the number and cost of the current go/no-go insensitive munitions test protocols required to qualify a new system for military use and to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms and safety margins. First-generation tools for use in analyzing cookoff accidents have been developed. During this year a collaborative effort with the Navy was initiated to experimentally assess and validate these codes for use in predicting the response of weapon systems including the violence of reaction in cookoff accidents. Quantitative data on cookoff violence have been generated by both the Navy in small-scale experiments and by DOE in the scaled thermal explosion experiments. Data on both HMX based explosives and PBX-109 have been obtained for use in establishing the accuracy and range of validity of the predictive models. ($ 3.960 million) (U) Lagrangian and Eulerian hydrocodes, coupled code systems, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) codes, and supporting materials models and constitutive relations developed at the nuclear weapons laboratories have been improved and adapted to DoD problems and transitioned to the DoD user community for use in warhead design and evaluation. This program provides prompt and direct access to the substantial investments in computational mechanics and materials modeling by the DOE and acts as the conduit for transition. Specific activities supporting the technology transition include distribution of computational tools to the DoD community, support of DOE codes on centralized DoD computing systems, training of the user community, and consulting as needed. ($ 2.307 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) A major thrust of this program is hard target defeat. A new concept for hard target weapons, the Monolithic Ballasted Penetrator, has been developed for high-velocity delivery that significantly increases penetration into concrete and payload volume. A 2/3-scale prototype was designed, built and tested at 3350 fps. The penetrator successfully penetrated 15 feet of concrete. Although erosion and nose recession occurred, the penetrator nose remained sharp and symmetrical, and the penetrator maintained a stable trajectory. Differences have always been observed in predictions from different hard target design codes. Global parameters such as penetration depth are tending to converge, but differences in important details such as the maximum deceleration and trajectory remain. The results can be contradictory predictions about penetrator survival or weapon effectiveness at conditions near the design envelope. To address this issue an experimental test-bed program was initiated to collect high-quality data on well-characterized targets for use in code comparisons and validation. The first series of tests has been completed that is expected to resolve questions about the effect of target strength, nose shape, penetrator scale, and penetrator velocity. Advanced materials were evaluated for high- velocity applications. Collaborative studies are underway on an Air Force identified low-alloy steel that holds promise as a low-cost replacement for current ultra-high-strength steels being postulated for future high-velocity penetrators. Metallography, mechanical property, and chemical and processing tests indicate that the material has good potential and further study is warranted. Payload survivability during high-velocity impacts was studied in a joint program with the Navy. A mid-scale penetrator loaded with LX-17, an extremely insensitive explosive, was tested at the end of FY1999. Both the penetrator and explosive survived the impact intact. The penetrator has been remotely disassembled and visual inspections and small-scale safety testing completed. No change in the properties of the explosive and no cracking or other impact related deformities were observed. These results demonstrate that a viable baseline payload exists for high-velocity penetrators. In an alternative approach to hard target defeat, work is underway on developing the concept of using a multiple shaped charge array as a precursor warhead to increase the penetration into concrete of a follow- through penetrator. In tests conducted at China Lake, multiple shaped charges fired simultaneously were shown to increase the mass of concrete removed from a target by a factor of four over that from the multiple shaped charges fired individually. This verifies the hypothesis that jet interactions can augment structural damage. Relating warhead performance to material properties requires a detailed knowledge of material properties under dynamic conditions and is considered a fundamental issue in computationally based design of future weapon systems. Additional progress has been made in demonstrating how impurity levels and grain size combine to affect the material behavior in shaped charge liners. New processing techniques were developed that produce an exceptionally fine grain structure in shaped charge liners and result in increased jet ductility. This work is important for developing long-standoff warheads for application to counter active protection systems. Our understanding of the effects of surface finish, microstructure andUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Ta explosively formed penetrators (EFP) is improving, resulting in designs with more consistent performance. An experimental test-bed program was initiated to examine important material properties and processing variables in Ta liners and to validate advanced materials models. For the first time, a highly time-resolved measurement was made of infrared emission from a shocked metal surface. This information provides a valuable test of the accuracy of material models used in design codes for advanced munitions.($ 3.370 million) (U) DoD and DOE efforts toward munitions lifecycle technologies including stockpile aging, surveillance, demilitarization and disposal are coordinated under the auspices of this program. As the focus for demilitarization and disposal in DoD turns from open-burn and open-detonation to resource recycle and recovery, alternative technologies are required to turn waste materials into useful products. The potential for cutting explosives both bare and encased in steel has been demonstrated using a femtosecond laser. Unlike conventional cutting lasers that melt and vaporize material, the femtosecond laser ablates material with no evidence of heating. It offers unique capabilities for use in munitions demilitarization and manufacture. A dedicated femtosecond laser has been built in conjunction with a small blast chamber for use in scoping experiments. Work was also initiated to prepare a 10-kg explosive tank for use with laser cutting to allow exploration of demilitarization operations on full- scale munitions. The laser was used to demonstrate the defuzing of the Multiple Launch Rocket System grenade to allow its re- use. To provide automated remote capability for munition demilitarization activities a robotic workcell for disassembling 155- mm projectiles was designed and assembled. High-level software was written for remote disassembly of artillery shells to expose the submunition layers for handling and safing. When completed next year, it will provide the capability to completely disassemble the M483A1 rounds containing 88 bomblets. Age-related degradation of materials within high value weapon systems is studied in order to understand and predict changes in munition safety, performance and reliability during long term storage. Predictive models for materials and system aging are under development with a focus on solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics with an emphasis on plastic encapsulated microcircuits, the aging of propellants, and the aging and fracture of adhesive joints. In the solder reliability task physical models were completed that calculate the evolution of microstructure deformation due to thermomechanical fatigue in Sn-Pb solder interconnections and validated using laboratory test samples and fielded test hardware. The goal of the task is to develop a computational tool that predicts the overall reliability of Sn-Pb solder interconnections of any geometry from physically-based calculations of deformation and crack damage ($ 1.790 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense 2001 Plans: (U) Improvement of electronic safing, arming and firing systems will continue with a focus on miniaturization, cost reduction and shock survivability for hard target penetrators. The development of a micro firing system will continue with a design goal of a further factor of 10 reduction in size over the recently demonstrated low-energy systems (and a factor of 100 over currently fielded technology.) Activities will include component development and evaluation, improved system integration, and demonstration of manufacturing technologies. Fabrication of nano-structured capacitors and micro-electromechanical transformers and other safe and arm components will be demonstrated, and system tests will be initiated. Chip slapper detonators were recently qualified for fleet use by the Navy. To provide continued support for system applications a reliability study on performance as a function of electrical input will be defined and conducted jointly with the Navy. In addition an extensive program of detonator testing across the range of required environmental conditions, including cold, temperature cycling and humidity will be initiated to evaluate long-term reliability of the low-energy chip slapper assemblies in realistic military environments. Component testing in shock environments and the development of packaging technology will continue in support of Service initiatives in hard target munitions. A unique experimental capability for testing component response to simultaneous multi-axis shocks was developed and will be used to simulate realistic system shock environments. Multipoint detonator arrays are used in advanced aimable and target-adaptable warheads, and arrays of 4 to 112 detonators have been successfully produced and fired. However, large multipoint firings must be conducted at voltages well above the predicted threshold values for individual detonators to ensure reliable performance of all of the points. Severe current oscillations have been observed in physically large multipoint circuits and appear to be responsible for the anomalous behavior of the detonators. An experimental effort has been undertaken which should confirm the mechanism responsible for the oscillations and provide a path for developing mitigation schemes and more robust multipoint designs.

They expressed concern over the decline in DoD core investments in energetic materials and recommended a national initiative in high energy density materials to maintain weapon lethality as weapon and platform size decrease. They specifically emphasized the need to exploit opportunities in nano-energetics. Efforts sponsored under this program are consistent with their comments. The development and characterization of new insensitive and new high-energy, high-power materials will continue with synthesis based on theoretical molecular design. The predicted performance and material sensitivity properties of the new high- energy molecule LLM-121 will be confirmed, and detonator and booster applications of the very insensitive LLM-105 will continue to be developed. The investigation of sol-gel chemistry as a bulk manufacturing process for nano-structured energetic materials will continue with a focus on material consistency, material characterization and process scale-up. Of particular interest is the development and evaluation of engineered pyrotechnics using this process. Samples materials will be provided to others in the DoD energetics community for weapons evaluations. The creation of new HEDMs will continue, along with the development and implementation of accurate techniques for determining the crystal structure and energy content of the newly synthesized materials. The new bulk quantity synthesis capability will be established with the installation of a special press designed to produce sample sizes of 100 mm3. At this scale the energy content can be measured using standard techniques with great reliability and accuracy. With the release of Cheetah 3.0 the emphasis in Cheetah development will turn towards implementing more sophisticated kinetic models into the code that can account for differences in explosive microstructure including explosive particle morphology and towards generating more accurate equations of state for detonation products. To support this work a new impulsive stimulated light scattering spectrometer will be used to conduct measurements in a diamond cell to monitor the onset of chemical reactivity at extreme conditions with great accuracy. Efforts to develop and validate computational tools for predicting munition system response to operational threat and accident environments will continue. The joint experimental program with Navy to measure the violence of reaction in cookoff accidents will be expanded from simple to complex geometry tests. The simulation tools will be exercised against these data to validate the models and expand their ability to predict weapon system performance and response in accident situations. The response of energetic materials to low strain-rate deformations, where the mechanical properties of the materials control the energetic response, is also under investigation. Experimental data on the dynamic stress-strain response of both the crystalline energetic material as well as the non-energetic binders used in currently fielded explosives will be generated to support the development of predictive computational tools.

Data from the small-scale experiments performed in FY2000 on oblique entry into rock targets will be evaluated and used to improve the modeling of target entry dynamics and in-target trajectories. The experimental test-bed program for code validation will continue. The data package from the first instrumented test series will be provided to the community for benchmarking and validating the various hard target penetrator design tools. The objective is to identify and resolve differences in the models and calculations. Evaluation of the Air Force experimental steel will continue with measurements of its dynamic properties and further studies of processing variables that contribute to its strength and toughness. As follow-on to the Navy payload survivability study, the program will support further testing to gather data useful to fuze designers. On-board instrumentation will be provided to the Navy for use in gathering realistic penetration environments during hard target penetration events. In the study of precursor charges for hard target weapons, the use of multiple simultaneous shaped charge jet impacts has been shown to significantly increase target damage. The concept will be further explored in tests against full-scale targets at China Lake where precursor designs, charge arrays, and liner materials will be evaluated. The study of dynamic material properties will continue with a focus on the role of processing, impurities and microstructure on the dynamic behavior of warhead liner materials. The objective of this work is to understand and exploit the effects of processing. To evaluate the accuracy of the current materials models, an experimental Ta liner test-bed program was undertaken. In this study Ta EFP liners have been fabricated to a generic design by four different process routes resulting in four well-characterized microstructures.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems improve the capabilities of our armed forces by enabling them to make better use of the information provided by such military sensor systems as radar, laser, infrared (IR), hyperspectral, identification friend or foe (IFF), and electronic signal measurement (ESM). ATR enhances the combat capabilities of our forces by increasing the lethality and survivability of our weapon systems and decreasing the time required to acquire and identify potential targets. ATR technology reduces our risk of fratricide by augmenting combat identification systems to improve our ability to distinguish between friend, foe, or neutral forces under high stress conditions. ATR technology provides significant workload reduction for the intelligence forces by aiding the image analyst to exploit imagery rapidly and accurately. In an era of decreasing military manpower, improved ATR will enable our forces to handle an ever increasing load of sensory information in the complex situations to be encountered in the military missions of the future. ATR capabilities are becoming essential to the Warfighter, as the Services pursue `network-centric` concepts for exploiting sensor imagery and information acquired through large arrays of sensors at all echelons. An OSD initiative, Smart Sensor Web (SSW), seeks to exploit this concept even further by providing greatly enhanced situational awareness for the Warfighter at the lower echelons, such as the battlefield commander. SSW will leverage on-going Service investments and will critically depend on application of ATR technology to achieve its goals.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Automatic Target Recognition PE 0603232D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) Increasing ATR operational effectiveness requires research and development to enhance sensors and algorithmic image processing. Additionally, improved, more efficient procedures must be developed for measuring and demonstrating ATR effectiveness. This is very important as the utility of ATR is highly dependent on the quality of the information provided by the sensor system(s) and the ability to process that information effectively to provide reliable decisions with operationally acceptable false alarm rates. Service and Agency ATR efforts have concentrated on algorithm development for conducting post-processing comparison and decision making which exploit improved digital computational capability. This program will focus on determining effectiveness of ATR, establishing benchmark metrics, and conducting and collecting single and multi-sensor data for potential reuse in Service and Agency algorithm development and objective evaluation. Consistent with the 1997 report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on ATR, this program will establish standard tests and procedures to provide an `honest broker` assessment of current leading candidate ATR's, as well as emerging ATR technology for the next generation of ATR systems. (U) The ATR program funds the integration and demonstration of advanced technology for field experimentation and assessment. The result of the ATR program efforts is the integration of the demonstrated technological capabilities and the capability to assess algorithms and various technologies. This leads to greatly improved understanding of the Joint Warfighting utility when assessed in realistic operational contexts. The Military Services provide air, land, and naval technological superiority, respectively, and ACTDs rapidly prototype and transition technological solutions to specific threat scenarios. This program provides timely resources and flexibility to horizontally integrate technology solutions across Services and Agencies and identify new and emerging `best-in-class` ATR systems with confidence so that this critical technology can be fielded more quickly.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Automatic Recognition FY 2000 FY Number and P232 ATR (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U)`Best Pr actices` for standardized ATR evaluation and assessment will be established and promulgated through the Automatic Target Recognition Working Group (ATRWG). Standard metrics to describe ATR performance and associated problem sets will be adopted which cover surveillance, weapon and attack applications of ATR's. The Problem Set generation and ATR evaluation effort to determine `best in class` will be expanded to include more complex ATR functions such as scene analysis, and new sensor types to include hyperspectral and multi-mode sensors. These data sets will be distributed and made available via the VDL. A closer technical relationship will be established between the ATR and Hyperspectral communities, with increased emphasis on technology issues dealing with the assessment of Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imaging for ATR. Initial taxonomy will be defined for hyperspectral algorithms and a preliminary performance assessment will be established and used to refine a system level performance model. A report will be issued comparing optical and digital correlator processing. The first Problem Sets will be delivered and used to evaluate ATR algorithms for SAR imagery, The Services` synthetic image generation capabilities will be applied to multi-spectral ATR's as a means assessing ATR performance over a wider range of operating conditions. During this time period more extensive subsystem technology effectiveness demonstrations will be conducted which support the transition efforts begun in FY99.

These models and simulations will be used to expand the range of tests and provide greater confidence in ATR field tests, which are limited in scope and duration, to facilitate transition to production programs. An assessment of hyperspectral performance and operational utility will continue as a basis for future investment decisions. The timing of these assessments will be consistent with the current schedules for ASRP flight demos and launches of Warfighter -1 and the Navy Earth Map Observer. Additional efforts will be launched for the development of experimental testbeds by the Services to evaluate advanced `smart` sensor technology for enhancing the situational awareness of the battlefield commander - Smart SensorWeb (SSW). Initial SSW experiments will be conducted at selected test sites.($ 7.488 million) (U) FY 2001 Plans: (U) Robustness of selected ATR's will be assessed over a wider range of challenging operating conditions using innovative applications of real, hybrid and synthetic imagery. This effort will support the validation of using multi-spectral synthetic imagery generated `on-demand` for the selected ATR in its operational scenario. The application of such multi-sensor synthetic imagery in High Level Architecture (HLA) simulations will be assessed as a technique to determine dynamically ATR effectiveness. In the hyperspectral area, an end-to-end performance model, incorporating sensor and processor models, will be validated. The end-to-end model will be used to conduct performance and subsystem trade off analyses between hyperspectral sensors and their ATR's. Service models developed to predict ATR performance will be refined to include evolving high fidelity multi-mode sensors.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) was established by Congress in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns. It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia. SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness by providing new knowledge, cost-effective technologies, and demonstrations in the areas of environmental cleanup, compliance, conservation, and pollution prevention. SERDP does this by (1) addressing high priority, mission- relevant, defense environmental technology needs necessary to enhance military operations, improve military systems` effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents; and (2) enhancing pollution prevention capabilities to reduce operational and life-cycle costs, as well as reducing the cost of necessary cleanup actions and compliance with laws and regulations. As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems. The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively to these priority defense needs; the pursuit of universal, world-class technical excellence; emphasis on constant technology transfer to field use; and sound fiscal management.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE JUNE 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program PE 0603716D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDCOST (In Millions) FY 2000 FY Number and P470 SERDP (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) General: Solicited proposals from industry, academia, and Federal R&D organizations.

A project using a physical vapor deposition technology for the application of environmentally safe coatings for gun barrel bore protection; completed the design, fabricated, and assembled bench-level cylindrical magnetron sputtering demonstrator for 25mm diameter and 6\" long gun barrel specimens. Using the materials by design approach, in less than eight months of effort one project has designed and prototyped a corrosion resistant structural stainless steel alloy that meets the primary design objectives of strength for aircraft landing gear applications (equivalent to today's 300M steel) and is likely to eliminate the need for cadmium and chromium coatings. ($ 17.982 million) (U) Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) (8 projects): Efforts focus on improvement of UXO detection capability, including: innovative methods to identify UXO using acoustic and electromagnetic sensors; and data interpretation/ integration research. The primary contributor to the high cost and time associated with remediating a UXO contaminated site is the high false-alarm rate. Researchers have made advances in the development of algorithms that substantially reduce false alarm rates associated with individual detection sensors. Advances also have been made to optimally combine information across detection sensors to further reduce UXO false alarm rates. ($ 2.988 million) (U)Conservation (20 projects): The Conservation Thrust Area supports land managers and natural/cultural resource managers to effectively support military training and testing operations through research in assessment and mitigation of military impacts; ecological modeling and simulation to assess error and uncertainty; and ecosystems management to permit sustainable use of these lands.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE JUNE 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Strategic Research and Development Program PE 0603716D8Z UNCLASSIFIEDDuring FY00 SERDP researchers made significant advancements in the assessment and prediction of the effects of military noise on marine mammals, including the completion of the first-ever predicted audiogram for the humpback whale. To enable installation managers and planners to avoid the potential future impacts on training and testing activities on local communities, SERDP has developed computer models that assess the probability and characteristics of future urban development within the vicinity of military installations. Significant advances were made in the development of models to predict habitat probabilities as well as the effects of ecosystem fragmentation on animal populations at military testing and training ranges. When complete, these models will be used to manage threatened and endangered species and their habitats on military installations while minimizing any disruptions to testing and training activities. ($ 11.414 million) (U)Cleanup (43 projects): Cleanup is focused on the remediation and restoration of past actions. The detection and remediation of DNAPLs remains a ubiquitous and technically challenging problem. The development of risk assessment tools and standards to help determine `how clean is clean` is vital to reducing cleanup costs. Efforts to develop field implementable, cost-effective, in-situ biotreatment processes for remediation of predominant DoD contaminants continue to show promise. The National Environmental Technology Test Sites (NETTS) that facilitate the demonstration and validation of technologies prior to commercialization continue to play a vital role in transitioning technologies to the field. In FY00 SERDP researchers demonstrated that many organic contaminants (PAH's) can be bound or sequestered on sediments, rendering them immobile in the environment. To address the growing issue of groundwater contaminated with energetic materials at DoD facilities, researchers have made significant advances in the development of innovative methods to remediate compounds such as TNT, RDX and HMX. SERDP is attacking the widespread problem of determining the extent of and treating dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in groundwater. SERDP researchers have developed methods for the integrated geophysical detection of sources of DNAPL contamination and are pursuing a variety of in situ treatment technologies.

The reduction of air emissions continues to be a significant driver as many DoD facilities are in air quality non-attainment areas. The development of technologies for the detection and treatment of regulated air pollutants is a key focus. Emerging issues that are addressed include the fate and impact of energetics on DoD training and testing ranges as well as heavy metal contamination in harbors. During FY00, significant progress has been made in the development of emissions control technologies. An innovative alternative technology was developed to replace Open Burning/Open Detonation of energetics by reacting a bulk energetic material with a chemical that neutralizes the energetic materials in a controlled manner. Another project is using a biofiltration system to control hazardous air pollutant (HAPs) and volatile organic chemical (VOCs)air emissions from DoD painting facilities. Progress has also been made in the development of field-portable environmental monitoring technologies, including two continuous emissions monitors (CEMs), one for gas-phase pollutants and another for metals emissions monitoring. Additionally, developments have been made with respect to advanced methods for the measurement of the size distribution and the chemical composition of fine particulate matter emitted from mobile and stationary DoD sources.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) In May 1998 the Secretary of Defense appointed Commander-in-Chief, United States Joint Forces Command (formerly the US Atlantic Command), as the Defense Department's Executive Agent for Joint Experimentation. Subsequently, the Department realigned resources to support the Joint Forces Command's new role. In FY 1999 funds from this Program Element were redirected to support the initial stand-up of Joint Forces Command's Joint Experimentation Directorate. Funding for joint experiments was transferred to Joint Forces Command through the Navy. Funding to support the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program concept development, the digital network infrastructure, and technology feeder support for joint experimentation was retained in this PE. Program Element 0603727N was established to provide Joint Forces Command with their own funding source in FY 2000. (U) The Joint Warfighting PE supports three related activities: the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP), the Information Technology Backplane (ITB), and technology feeder support for joint experimentation. While these activities strongly support Joint Forces Command's joint experimentation efforts, a separate program element has been retained since the activities support other organizations in addition to Joint Forces Command, and they require a degree of independence from Joint Forces Command to function as envisioned. (U) The JAWP was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), with the support of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to serve as a catalyst for innovation and change. This program's focus is on assisting in the formulation and assessment of advanced concepts and capabilities, plus identifying enabling technologies and integration options for the Department. These concepts drive changes in the doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, leadership and facilities (DOTMLF) of the Services. The JAWP serves a key role in identifying, exploring and evaluating breakthrough warfighting capabilities. It builds on the lessons learned from earlier Service experiments that have underscored the importance of having a firm conceptual basis upon which to build experiments. The JAWP concentrates on joint, vice Service-unique, revolutionary concepts. In identifying and elaborating innovative joint concepts and capabilities, and associated enabling technologies, the JAWP will not only take into account Service efforts, but those of CINCs and Defense agencies as well. The JAWP promotes integration, conducts experiments and assists in implementation. The JAWP's work complements and supports the activities of Joint Forces Command, the Joint Staff, and the OSD. It provides an independent source for formulating advanced concept candidates for joint experimentation. The JAWP isUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint of both civilian analysts and technologists. The JAWP Analytical Project Office (JAWP-APO), a jointly manned activity established by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, consists of military personnel from the four Services. The civilians provide a level and quality of expertise not generally available in the Department of Defense. The active duty military members provide a current operational perspective to concepts under investigation and serve as a vital link to ongoing relevant activities in the Services. (U) The Information Technology Backplane provides an advanced network infrastructure that extends commercial capabilities to provide capabilities needed to meet JV2020 needs. Information Superiority is a key JV2020 building block and the ITB provides the means to experiment with the digital transmission capabilities that will be available in five years. The ITB is not a new physical network. It is a virtual network that capitalizes on existing physical networks such as the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)-Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Leading Edge Services Network (LESN), the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and the experimental Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) net. The ITB has many users from sites served by existing networks but the funding included in this PE is the incremental funding needed to support joint experimentation. For example, this PE provides the circuit costs to extend the ITB from the experimentation site to the nearest point on the backplane (where no other network exists), and only the \"extra\" backplane costs generated by the Joint Warfighting Experiments. Since joint experiments are very dependent on advanced distributed simulation, or on limited, live, command post exercises that are being driven by simulations, a robust network is needed to interconnect the various sites. These simulations press the state of the art in networking capability, including that of requiring Type-I encryption for protected communications. The ITB also supports new bandwidth intensive applications such as video teleconferencing and high definition television. (U) The third effort supported by this PE is technology feeder support for joint experiments. There are many Technology Demonstrations (TDs), Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), and Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) that can provide advanced technologies to support joint experiments. For example, the Joint Staff has prepared 72 desired operational capabilities based on JV2010 concepts and 21st Century Challenges. For each Challenge, the Joint Staff has prepared roadmaps that provide opportunities to assess each Challenge. The roadmap for the battlefield awareness challenge shows 42 ACTDs that have the potential to demonstrate some aspect of a desired operational capability supporting battlefield awareness. This effort provides technology managers the resources to expand the scope of a test or demonstration to collect data for the joint staff or JFCOM, thereby leveraging the OSD and Service ACTD investment. The Technology Feeder Support effort is also being used to initiate a Red Team Pilot Project for Joint Forces Command. This Red Team will participate in Joint Forces Command Concept Development and Experimentation to provide an independent assessment that will ensure that product quality stays high and credible. A source of funding like this, which is separate from other Joint Forces Experimentation funding, will provide the necessary independence.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, AND PLANS: (U) Accomplishments: (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP), working for the OSD, the Joint Staff, the Joint Forces Command and their subordinate activities in support of Joint Warfighting Experimentation: (1) identified key elements of a joint experimentation process; (2) developed candidate advanced concepts for joint experimentation including the Rapid Decisive Operations (RDO) concept which serves as the integrator for all JFCOM concepts; (3) developed a near-term Joint Strike Force concept that supports the evolution of the overarching RDO initiative; (4) assisted the Pacific Command (PACOM) in its development of a Joint Mission Force concept; (5) developed, organized and executed a follow-on experiment to Joint Forces Command's FY 1999 attack operations experiment (J9901) that captured experiences and lessons learned from the pursuit of time critical targets in Kosovo; (6) developed prototype experimentation plans; (7) conducted research and seminars to classify works on future operational concepts and future security environments that are relevant to joint experimentation; (8) assisted in the planning, design coordination and execution of Joint Forces Command's Millennium Challenge 00 experiment; (9) developed a framework and initial set of metrics to help gauge progress of warfighting transformation efforts for the Director, Joint Staff; (10) led an effort with the Joint Staff Urban Operations Working Group that looked at ways to improve capabilities to conduct operations in urban environments; (11) supported a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff initiative to describe concepts of operations for future joint forces that elaborate on the objectives of JV2020; and (12) planned for and conducted seminars and workshops with other government organizations to identify complementary and supporting technology programs and activities.

Advanced engineering support from NRL was given to maintain the network functionality required by JFCOM experiments (Unified Vision 00 and Attack Ops 00). This included the monitoring and tuning of critical network performance parameters. In the area of network management, work on extending Kerberos authentication into Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) and other protocols continued and were submitted to, and favorably received by, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as proposed standards. Interoperability with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) protocols began. The testing of the advanced network features of Release 3 of the KG-75 FASTLANE continued. Issues which were identified were fed back to the vendor who incorporated them into software updates. Initial testing of the interoperable KG-175 TACLANE began. The results of these tests were fed back to NSA and the vendor for incorporation into released products. A Linux-based distributed network monitoring and test tool, ATM Network Test Software (ANTS), was developed for use in both the testing of network devices, as well as the monitoring of live, local and wide-area networks. This tool is now available in the public domain. An H.323 voice application has been extended to directly support native ATM clients with direct Quality-of-Service contracts. This application also interoperates with non-ATM connected clients. Efforts in support of JFCOM continued, focusing on assisting in the development of a local infrastructure to extend the ITB to multiple sites/users within JFCOM. ($1.400 million) (U) The technology feeder support effort created an ACTD milestone document to track the status and life cycle phases of each ACTD. It will provide an effective planning tool to crosscheck future joint experimentation against planned ACTDs, event participation and military utility assessments. This effort also facilitated the integration of ten ACTDs into the primary FY 2000 joint experiment, MILLENIUM CHALLENGE 2000. These ACTDs are: Global Hawk, Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination (BADD), Extending the Littoral Battlespace (ELB), Integrated Collection Management (ICM), Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Rapid Terrain Visualization (RTV), Joint Continuous Strike Environment (JCSE), Theater Precision Strike Operations (TPSO), Theater Air and Missile Defense Interoperability (TAMDI), and HUMINT CI Support Tools (HICIST). This activity also initiated an effort to introduce coalition involvement in joint experimentation. ($2.234 million) (U) FY 2001 Plans: (U) The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) will continue its support of JV2020 implementation and the Joint Experimentation work in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the Joint Forces Command and subordinate elements. Efforts will include both front-end identification and elaboration of concepts and capabilities, plus support for the conduct of experiments. The JAWP will continue to build on its FY 98 through FY 00 experiences with joint operational concept development and experimentation, focusing on enhancing joint operational-level command and control, enabling rapid expeditionary operations and refining the implementation process for lessons learned from joint experimentation. It will continue to mature and expand on the adaptive command and controlUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Joint 0603727D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(C2), plus intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), concepts developed during the Attack Operations experiments. It will leverage the experiences and lessons learned during Joint Forces Command's J9901 and Attack Operations 00 experiments, to include the investigation of innovative command and control applications and expanded, more robust sensor suites. It will continue to develop and refine candidate advanced warfighting concepts and capabilities using wargames, and modeling and simulation. It will identify promising and enabling technologies. It will collect and analyze data to support the formulation of the Department's overall Joint Experimentation efforts. Prior to that, however, it will develop a definition and an operational framework for effects-based operations. FY 01 experimentation will focus on laying the foundation for subsequent experimentation with Joint Forces Command on the Rapid Decisive Operations (RDO) concept in FY 02 through FY 04. The JAWP will continue to evaluate these concepts and systems through simulation, wargaming and analysis. It will conduct vulnerability assessments using \"Red Teaming\" techniques to identify weaknesses and avoid surprises. It will use the transparent wargaming approach, which it developed to assist in the conduct of the J9901 and other experiments. It will also complete its development of a DoD Roadmap for Urban Operations and continue its participation in the NATO Urban Working Group efforts. The JAWP will begin to identify programs, systems and methods to improve and expedite the process of executing and implementing the recommended changes, which result from the joint experimentation process and the development of new technological capabilities. Included in these latter activities, the JAWP will evaluate the systems and products developed in ACTDs for use in the Department's overall joint experimentation program. The JAWP will also seek and develop partnerships among related clusters of ACTDs, DARPA projects, Service Battle Labs, and JT&E activities to participate in related joint experimentation. ($4.500 million) (U) The base ITB support for wide-area network connectivity for joint warfighting experimentation will continue, as will the ongoing task of transitioning emerging technology from advanced research network testbeds. Specifically, Unified Vision 01 will be supported and executed while Millennium Challenge 02 will be designed. Initial implementation of secure (Kerberized) network management protocols (SNMPv3) across selected ITB sites is expected. Development and evaluation of advanced security/information assurance devices and tools, such as ATM and host-based layered firewall technologies, will begin in the lab. Distributed applications, such as collaborative tools, will continue. Efforts in support of JFCOM will continue. Connectivity to key sites (JFCOM, TEC, etc.) will continue with selected circuits upgraded as required. Significant hardware upgrades to end-sites will occur. ($1.400 million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support: JFCOM's Campaign Plan 01 identifies 31 major exercises and experiments in FY 2001. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems and Concepts), in coordination with JFCOM and the Joint Staff, will assist in determining which ACTDs, ATDs, and/or Technology Demonstrations best support JFCOM's experimentation events. This funding will be provided to the selected technology managers to support a joint experiment. Funding will be provided for efforts such as system integration, and logistics and test support. Planning and preparations will continue for incorporation of as many technology demonstrations as possible into the primary FY 2002 joint experiment, MILLENIUM CHALLENGE 2002. This will be initial year of funding the DOD Adaptive Red Team (DART) which will evaluate the major joint experiment of 2001 (Unified Vision 01) and prepare to observe and critique MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE 2002.

Information assurance and other security technologies will continue to be tested and deployed. Efforts in support of JFCOM will continue. Connectivity to key sites (JFCOM, TEC, etc.) will continue with selected circuits and equipment upgraded as required. ($1.400 million) (U) Experimentation Feeder Support for Joint Experimentation will continue. JFCOM's Campaign Plan 01 projects 26 major exercise and experiments which can support technology demonstrations. The primary FY 2002 effort will be MILLENIUM CHALLENGE 02 and the technology feeder support effort will enable the incorporation of numerous technology demonstrations. Plans for OLYMPIC CHALLENGE 04 will be further defined and work will be begin to align the technologies supporting this major integrating exercise. Integrated concept teams will have had the opportunity to prepare more detailed experimentation and assessment plans. Once the concepts and experimentation plans are more clearly articulated, technologies supporting the experiments will be identified. This funding will leverage ongoing developments to support joint experiments, not to fund the development itself . The DOD Adaptive Red Team (DART) Pilot Project will initially be funded from within this project. Its primary of focus in FY 2002 will be to evaluate MILLENNIUM Challenge 2002.

Through FY 1998, the program was managed by the Veterans Administration. In accordance with the FY 1999 Defense Authorization Bill (H.R. 3616, Sec. 244), the Department of Defense now guides investment of these funds as executive agent, acting through the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Naval Operational Medicine Institute. Coordination with the VA on research topics ensures that the program benefits the health of both active military forces and veterans. Research proposals are solicited from in-house DoD and VA investigators, and projects are selected for funding based on technical merit and relevance to the solicitation. Technical merit is determined through independent peer review by experts outside the DoD and VA. Projects are selected through independent peer review by intramural VA and DoD physicians and scientists. Funds support a `core` or general research program of cooperative medical research in topics such as emerging infectious diseases, trauma, stress, and exercise physiology. Funds also support studies on emerging medical issues of importance to DoD and VA.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cooperative Medical FY Cost Total 0.000 Continuing Continuing Coop DoD/VA Medical/P4647.674 Continuing (U) Project Number and Title: P464 Coop DoD/VA Medical (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) The Department of Defense continued an investment strategy and execution plan developed to comply with the FY 1999 Defense Authorization Bill (H.R. 3616, Sec. 244).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : The Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the need to rapidly develop and field new technological capabilities, and to explore new and innovative operational and organizational concepts associated with those capabilities. Such advances are critical to the objective of supporting the Chairman's Joint Vision 2020 . Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) are low risk vehicles for pursuing that objective. ACTDs are capability demonstration and evaluation programs in which the development and employment of technology and innovative, operational concepts by the military user are the primary focus. The demonstrations involve a material development organization that develops the technology, and a warfighting sponsor that assesses the military utility. In addition to stimulating innovation, ACTDs offer three other significant opportunities. They provide experienced combat commanders with an opportunity to develop operational concepts and operational requirements to fully exploit the capabilities being evaluated. They allow the users an opportunity to assess the military utility of the proposed capability prior to a major acquisition decision. They also provide the Services with a mechanism for compressing acquisition cycle time, thus significantly improving their response to priority operational needs. As such, ACTDs are at the foundation of the DoD acquisition reform process. They do not substitute for formal DoD acquisition procedures, but do accelerate these procedures for technologies which are deemed by the applicable combatant commands to have demonstrated military utility. Since FY 1999, ACTDs have been an integral part of the Joint Experimentation process under U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advance Systems and Concepts) (DUSD (AS&C)) works closely with JFCOM to prepare its annual Campaign Plans in order to insure ACTDs integrate technology and develop new concepts of operation to fully leverage with and integrate into future joint experiments. (U) The Military Departments and Defense Agencies provide most of the funding (80-90 percent) for ACTDs. This demonstrates significant Service/Agency commitment to the ACTD. Funding from this program element is used: 1) to support actual demonstrations and exercises, 2) to provide hardware to demonstrate military utility, and 3) to fund transition, interim capability operations and support for up to two years after the operational demonstration phase of the ACTD. This two-year phase provides the Service, Agency, and operators with adequate time to continue to address the issues of supportability, maintainability and training identified by the ACTD. (U) Both the Science and Technology (S&T) and the warfighter communities submit candidate ACTDs in January of each year. The candidates proposed by the S&T community reflect technological opportunities enabled by recently demonstrated technology. The candidates proposed by the warfighterUNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date : June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 08/16/01 2:35 PM UNCLASSIFIEDcommunity (Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Unified Commanders in Chief (CINCs) and Service operational organizations) respond to a deficiency in military capability or to an emerging military need. For each candidate, it is necessary to confirm that the proposed concept is based on technology that is sufficiently mature, and that the capability addresses a priority military need. (U) The maturity of the technology associated with the proposed capability is assessed by the DUSD (AS&C), with assistance of senior members of the science and technology community (known as the Breakfast Club). The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) prioritizes the ACTD candidates by military need. The principal management tools for the ACTD are the Implementation Directive and Management Plan. Each approved ACTD will be described in these top-level documents which provide details of the demonstration/evaluation, the main objectives, approach, critical events, measures of success, transition options, participants, schedule, and funding. (U) The typical timeline of two-to-four years for the operation al demonstration phase of an ACTD is compressed compared to normal timelines for fielding an operational capability. These shorter schedules are made possible because ACTDs incorporate mature or nearly mature technology and, therefore, forgo time consuming technology development and technical risk reduction activities. At the end of the ACTD, the user sponsor is able to determine if the capability provided by current technology has sufficient utility to warrant procurement. If there are significant shortcomings, their options are to either pursue an advanced technology demonstration to improve performance, or not pursue the technology any further at this time. In cases where the operational user is satisfied the prototype has significant utility, the prototype can be used as an interim capability. The Department then moves quickly to enter the formal acquisition process to acquire needed quantities or, if sufficient, to make fully operational those assets already produced. (U) The request for FY 2002 c andidate ACTDs was issued October 2000. Proposals were received from the CINCs, Services, other DoD Agencies, and industry in January 2001. Candidates are organized into the Joint Vision 2020 operational concepts of Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, Full Dimensional Protection and Focused Logistics. Review of the candidates for FY 2002 ACTDs began in February 2001. As an initiative in FY 2002, the Department intends to begin a larger number of ACTDs, provide s higher percentage of OSD funding for these new ACTDs and provide additional funding for expanded user evaluations (EUEs) at the conclusion of successful ACTDs. This additional EUE funding will also facilitate enhanced program transition. Funding for new FY 2002 ACTDs is approximately $30 million.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date : June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603750D 08/16/01 2:35 PM UNCLASSIFIED(U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS : (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments : All ongoing ACTDs initiated in Fiscal Years 1995 through 2000 have been reviewed for objectives, content and management. This includes in-depth review by the ACTD operational sponsors, such as United States Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). Of the approximately 20% of all ACTDs deployed, or requested for deployment, to Operation Allied Force, some remained in theater as part of Kosovo peacekeeping operations. Twelve new ACTDs were started in FY 2000: CINC 21, Coalition Aerial Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Communications/Navigation Outage Forecast System, Computerized Operational MASINT Weather, Content-Based Information Security, Global Monitoring of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Space Systems, Ground-to-Air Passive Surveillance, Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Multiple Link Antenna System, Quick Bolt, Restoration of Operations and Tri-Band Antenna Signal Combiner.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the needs of the warfighter for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers. By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, the defense research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly and with more precision than any potential adversary threatening national security. The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research as well as enabling advanced test and evaluation environments that allow synthetic scene generation, automatic control systems and virtual test environments. As such, high performance computing (HPC) has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) programs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 High Performance Computing Modernization PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U)The HPCMP has established and supports four major shared resource supercomputing centers as well as several smaller, special- purpose distributed supercomputing centers. These centers directly support the DoD S&T and T&E laboratories and centers and are accessible to local and remote scientists and engineers via high-speed network access. Providing for the adaptation of broadband, widely used applications and algorithms to address S&T and T&E requirements, along with continued training of users as new system designs and concepts evolve, is an integral part of the program. The program pursues continuous interaction with the national HPC infrastructure, including academe, industry, and other government agencies to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise. (U)The HPCMP user base includes approximately 5,000 computational scientists and engineers and over 60 DoD laboratories and test and evaluation facilities. The integrated HPCM program consists of a set of four large Major Shared Resources Centers (MSRCs), seventeen Distributed Centers (DCs), the Defense Research and Engineering Network and the Common High Performance Computing Software Support Initiative (CHSSI). The MSRCs are responsible for as large a fraction of DoD`s S&T and DT&E computational workload as feasible. These MSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, programming environments, and training. A limited set of smaller shared resource centers, Distributed Centers (DCs), augment the MSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. Distributed Centers address critical HPC requirements that cannot be met at MSRCs, such as real-time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC expertise located at the remote sites. The MSRCs and DCs are currently interconnected with all S&T and DT&E user sites via the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). Additionally the Common HPC Software Support Initiative (CHSSI) develops a set of critical common DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC systems at the MSRCs and Distributed Centers. (U)True modernization of DoD`s HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspects of HPC. While advancing the level of hardware performance is critical to success, the higher objective is to enable better scientific research, test and evaluation environments, and technology development for superior weapons, warfighting and related support systems. The goals of the HPCMP are to: Provide the best commercially available high-end HPC capability. Acquire and develop joint-need HPC applications, software tools and programming environments.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Performance Computing Modernization PE 0603755D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Educate and train DoD's scientists and engineers to effectively use advanced computational environments.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office has corporate-level responsibility for the cooperation and synergism of modeling and simulation (M&S) activities within the Department of Defense. M&S has demonstrated the capability to revolutionize the way in which the Department makes decisions and conducts its operations. Working as a system of systems, M&S can support a full range of applications (e.g. joint training, doctrine development, formulation and assessment of operational plans, mission rehearsal, force structuring and the acquisition of new systems). To ensure effective and efficient use of M&S, the Department has developed a strategy fostering interoperability and re-use, embodied in the Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation Master Plan, which serves as the basis for execution of this program. The major element of the strategy is development of a common technical framework (CTF) for M&S consisting of three components: the High Level Architecture; Functional Descriptions of the Mission Space (FDMS); and Data Standardization. Supporting these is a broad range of shared common services which include environmental representations; human and organizational behavioral representation; verification, validation and accreditation of simulations; a modeling and simulation resource repository; a modeling and simulation information analysis center; and outreach and education initiatives to ensure standardized and timely implementation of the plan. All aspects of these efforts are focused on the Warfighters of today and tomorrow through a rigorous and ongoing process of capturing and addressing Warfighting customer needs and requirements. As a result of this effort, the Department will be able to lead, integrate and leverage M&S technologies for the Warfighter and thus improve readiness, enhance mission rehearsal, optimize investment decisions, and achieve cost-effective acquisitions.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 Joint FY Number and P476 JSM (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) Three operational builds of the High Level Architecture (HLA) Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) 1.3 NG (Next Generation) were completed.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT U) This program element funds High Energy Laser (HEL) advanced technology development aimed at translating technology solutions for broadly defined military problems into demonstrated performance pay-offs, increased capabilities, increased supportability, or increased affordability. HEL weapons systems have many potential advantages, including speed-of-light time-to- target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazine depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no need for stocks of munitions or warheads. As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions, including some that are impossible, or nearly so, for conventional weapons. These include interception of ballistic missiles in boost phase, defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and the ultra-precision negation of targets in urban environments with no collateral damage. Research conducted under this program element develops and demonstrates the technology necessary to enable these and other HEL missions. (U) This program element is part of an overall DOD initiative in HEL science and technology being conducted by the recently formed HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). The goals of this HEL JTO funded research are to provide the technology to make HEL systems more effective and also to make them lighter, smaller, cheaper, and more easily supportable on the battlefield. In general, efforts funded under this program element are chosen for their potential to have major impact on multiple HEL systems and on multiple Service missions. As a result of this focus and of close coordination with the military departments and defense agencies, this program element complements other DOD HEL programs that are directed at more specific Service and agency needs.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Advanced Development PE 0603924D8Z UNCLASSIFIED(U) A broad range of technology is addressed in key areas such as chemical lasers, solid-state lasers, beam control, optics, propagation, and free-electron lasers. Under this program element these technologies are integrated and tested in sub-scale demonstration systems or sub-systems. Research is conducted by Government laboratories and industry, often teamed together. The program element funds integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental investigations. These integrated investigations are structured to convincingly demonstrate the piercing of technology barriers that currently prevent HELs from being fielded as viable weapon systems. In addition, they are structured to permit rapid technology transition. As results become available, DOD will transmit them to appropriate military-department, defense-agency, and industry programs for technology transition, where appropriate.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE High Energy Laser Advanced Development PE UNCLASSIFIEDCOST (In Millions) FY 2000 FY Project Number and Title: (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2001 Accomplishments: (U) None, this initiative is new as of FY 2002.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program is a budget activity level 4 based on the demonstration/validation activities ongoing within the program. The purpose of this program is to develop physical security equipment (PSE) systems for all DoD components, to include Force Protection. This program supports the protection of tactical and nuclear weapons systems, DoD personnel and DoD facilities. Funding for critical RDT&E security improvements within service channels has fluctuated widely over the years and prompted the FY89 Congressionally directed consolidation of the Services and former Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) / Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) PSE RDT&E funds into this single OSD controlled program element. The funds are used to provide PSE RDT&E for individual Service and Joint PSE requirements. The PSE program is organized so that an ongoing DoD-coordinated Joint Action Group, consisting of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) representatives monitors, directs and prioritizes potential and existing PSE programs. With few exceptions, each Service sponsors RDT&E efforts for technologies and programs, which have multi-service applications. The funds are also employed to evaluate exploratory development of Physical Security Equipment. This program element supports the Army's advanced engineering development of Interior Detection, Exterior Detection, Security Lighting, Security Barriers and Security Display Units. In a like manner, the program element also supports the Air Force's PSE RDT&E effort in the area of Exterior Detection/Surveillance, Entry Control, Delay/Denial, Tactical Systems and Airborne Intrusion. Finally, the program supports Navy RDT&E efforts in the areas of Waterside Security, Explosive Detection, and improved technology for Locks, Safes and Vaults. Beginning with FY 1997, this PE includes funding for Force Protection Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (FP COTS) evaluation and testing, which has received focus since the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist bombing incident. The FP COTS testing applies to all available technologies, which are considered effective for DoD use.

Demo III focuses on demonstration of technology that will enable the development of small, highly agile, unmanned vehicles capable of off-road, semi-autonomous operation at speeds of up to 32 km/hr during daylight and 16 km/hr at night by 4Q FY 2001. Demo III supports development of two emerging requirements at the U.S. Army Armor School for a robotic scout system and a robotic leader-follower system. Technologies for these systems are applicable to a wide array of Army programs. This program will be transferred to the Army for funding, beginning in FY 2001. A breakout of the three major thrusts follow: Concerted Technology Development: The technology development community, drawn primarily from government laboratories such as National Institute for Standards and Technology ( NIST), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Army Research Lab (ARL) , has organized itself into a series of working groups to address six technology areas deemed critical to the success of the program. The primary focus of the effort has centered on the development of perception for autonomous mobility; algorithms for local planning and autonomous behaviors; an intelligent software architecture ; and a small, highly capable control interface that can be integrated into standard display units. Modeling, Simulation and Experimentation: A modeling, simulation and experimentation effort conducted by the M ounted Battlespace Battle Lab (MBBL) , with assistance from ARL, has been running in parallel with the technology development program. The program has the twin goals of utilizing simulations to estimate the operational effectiveness of differing technological solutions and hardware/software configurations , and developing T actics, Techniques and Procedure s required to employ this technology effectively. An important outcome of this effort will be the technical support package (TSP) that will be required to support the second generation Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) user appraisal currently scheduled for FY 2002. Technology Integration and Evaluation with Users: This final component of the program will integrate technology on to a testbed vehicle and demonstrate autonomous mobility required to conduct theUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2a, RDT&E Project Justification Date: June 2001 military scout mission under tactical conditions. Unlike the other program elements, this program element was designed to be conducted by an industrial contractor chosen through a competitive procurement process that is being managed by the U.S. Army Tank -automotive /Armament Command 's Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC). In January 1998 TARDEC awarded a contract to a contractor team le d by the former Robotic Systems Technology (RST) now General Dynamic Robotic Systems (GDRS) , teaming with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Center for Intelligent Systems (CIS) and Sarnoff Corporation. (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments Conducted quarterly In-Progress Reviews with the members of the Integrated Product Teams in December 1999 and April and August 2000. Continued development of tactical behavior models in MODSAF. Continued development of baseline autonomous tactical behaviors for application to the scout mission. Conducted data collection/engineering evaluation activities in preparation for a Battle Lab Warfighting Experiment scheduled for 1st quarter, FY01. Developed a high performance Ladar and transferred it to the MDARS-E Program which exceeded all expectations in its capability to detect negative obstacles. Developed the technology that was incorporated into two highly mobile robotic platforms which were built for the Unmanned Ground Vehicle/Systems Joint Program Office (UGV/S JPO). Developed an Operator Control Unit and transferred this technology to the UGV/S JPO for incorporation on the Panther Program. This technology will serve as the primary soldier-robot interface as this program moves toward more semi-autonomous operations.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : CALS is an international core strategy to share integrated digital product data through a set of standards to achieve efficiencies in business and operational mission areas. DoD's overarching goal in CALS is to develop a seamless defense enterprise in which the knowledge products of the acquisition process are immediately and rapidly accessible to all authorized users while maintaining near immediate currency and quality of information. This desired state is referred to as the \"Integrated Data Environment (IDE)\". The IDE (immediate access to quality information) drives many defense- wide and functional-specific reforms and business process improvements. The rapid sharing of information is an implied requisite of Integrated Product and Process Teams, a fundamental process for implementing concurrent engineering and streamlining project management. Digitized information frees logistics support and operator personnel from the burden of cumbersome document or file formats for information processing or presentation - enabling new methods for the performance of maintenance and training tasks based on interactive electronic technologies. This program element is to (1) assess and transition evolving automation technologies into the CALS strategy; (2) develop, maintain and apply to weapon system program office operations an executable business model for the application of CALS and related technologies; (3) integrate technical and functional requirements into a Shared Information Framework of the standards, protocols, procedures, and network management conventions required to achieve compatible implementation of the IDE throughout the international defense enterprise.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental technologies that target DoD's most urgent environmental needs and are projected to pay back the investment within five years through cost savings and improved efficiencies. It responds to: (1) congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, (3) Executive Order 13148 which requires Federal agencies to place a high priority on obtaining funding and resources needed for the development of innovative pollution prevention programs and technologies for installations and in acquisitions, and (4) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by real world commitments such as environmental restoration and waste management. Preference for demonstrations are given to technologies that respond to Environmental Security objectives, have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD environmental requirements. Project funding supports the following categories for each year.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDRDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)Date: (MONTH/YEAR) June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/ Budget Activity 4R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Environmental Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) PE 0603851D8Z FY 2000 Accomplishments: - Reviewed and selected 35 technologies for demonstration. - Reviewed and selected sites for demonstration of technologies. - Prepared site-specific implementation plans. - Prepared sites and secure regulatory permitting. - Continued to demonstrate and evaluate 22 selected technologies. - Completed evaluation of 15 technologies. By Pillar: - Remediation: Successfully demonstrated and validated technologies in multiple high priority areas related to the Cleanup of contaminated DoD sites. For example, ESTCP Researchers have developed a standardized protocol that describes a simple and cost effective treatability test to determine the potential for employing reductive anaerobic biological in-situ treatment technologies to remediate chloroethenes. Successfully developed and demonstrated an enhanced treatment system that uses surface active agents (surfactants) to remediate Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) contamination in soil. To improve risk management decisions at contaminated sediment sites based on direct quantification of contaminant mobility, researchers have designed, developed, demonstrated, and certified a Benthic Flux Sampling Device (BFSD) technology to establish the capability for direct measurement of metals and organic contaminant remobilization in sediments. ($7.337 Million) - Unexploded Ordnance (UXO): ESTCP validated UXO technologies are having a significant impact on the DoD UXO remediation efforts. To address the challenge associated with locating UXO buried in highly vegetative and variable terrain, researchers have developed a portable detection system that will allow the collection and analysis of high-quality data at all DoD ranges regardless of terrain or tree cover equivalent to the most advanced vehicular systems. To reduce false-positive rates for UXO detection methods, ESTCP researchers have demonstrated advanced algorithms using data from both Magnetometer and EMI sensors to improve ordnance characterization and the rejection of false targets. ($4.252 Million) - Pollution Prevention: ESTCP continues to validate and transition environmentally clean technologies which directly support the military mission. Examples include, an enhanced, \"drop-in\", fully environmentally-compliant, Low VOC Chemical Agent Resistant Coating was successfully demonstrated at Marines Barstow Logistics Facility, CA, under production conditions. Successful demonstration of a high velocity oxygen-fuel thermal spray technology as an environmentally friendly alternative for hard chrome plating for main landing gear components was flight tested. A zero Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) polyurethane topcoat technology was successfully demonstrated on multiple aircraft. Shock-absorbing concrete (SACON) was demonstrated to be an effective means of capturing and containing lead on small-arms ranges, while inhibiting the leaching of lead corrosion products.

Kinetic Energy anti-satellite Cost 7,100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cont. A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The U.S. military has become dependent on satellites as a primary source of information in virtually all of its operations and then looking at the world-wide proliferation of technology which is making this type capability readily available to virtually any country. Today, national defense planners and strategists have to operate with the knowledge that future adversaries will have access to satellite derived intelligence, warning, communications, navigation, weather and other information that can significantly enhance their war-fighting capability and increase the risk to U.S. and allied forces. The execution of the FY 2000 funding is contingent upon the results of the on-going congressional and department review. (U) In 1989 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop a ground-launched, kinetic energy (i.e., hit-to-kill) anti-satellite (KE ASAT) weapon system which would leverage off technologies developed by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command in support of the (then) Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Following a Milestone I Defense Acquisition Board Review in December of 1989, the Army was given responsibility for development of the weapon elements of the system (booster, kill vehicle, launch and ground support systems, and the mission and battery control centers.) The Air Force was given responsibility for development of the command and control elements that would have allowed the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Space Command (USCINCSPACE) to plan and control ASAT engagements. (U) With the end of the cold war the perceived need for this capability, as well as support for continued funding diminished steadily and the program was restructured several times. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 (FY 1994) directed that the program be converted to a Tactical ASAT Technology Program as opposed to an acquisition program with a low funding level. Under this current program, the KE ASAT was test fired in September 1994, successfully meeting all requirements. This 94-pound kill vehicle is the critical component of a KE ASAT.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This Humanitarian Demining R&D program element focuses on the testing, demonstration and validation of equipment suitable for immediate use in various international humanitarian demining missions and environments. The goal is to provide equipment to the international demining community so that they may assess the equipment's capabilities in actual demining conditions. This program focuses on R&D technology development that reduces the time and cost associated with demining while improving the overall safety of the operator. This is accomplished through the adaptation of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment, the integration of mature technologies, and the leveraging from past and current R&D project activity in the tactical countermine and unexploded ordnance clearance mission areas. The primary objectives this program aims to achieve in technological development are to improve existing mine/minefield detection; improve current wide area survey equipment; clear large areas faster and more efficiently with improved mechanical mine/vegetation clearance equipment; provide improved protection for deminers; detect explosives in buried mines (biosensors); confirm the presence of mines (verification); mark and map mines/minefields; improve post clearance quality assurance (QA) equipment; train deminers in mine awareness, and improve deminer hand tools. These areas of emphasis have been adopted as a direct result of an annual Humanitarian Demining Workshop, the most recent of which took place in July 2000.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Continuing Humanitarian Project Number and Title: P920t Humanitarian Demining (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) Completed development and demonstrations on the improvements of existing mine detection technologies to include detection to a depth of 27cm.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program provides resources for the U.S. portion of bi-lateral and multi-lateral development projects, aimed at improving interoperability with allies and other likely coalition partners . Recent coalition operations, exercises and experiments have revealed the increasing complexity and difficulty of prosecuting multi -national air, land, and sea campaigns . Interoperability gaps between partners have retarded mission efficiency and jeopardized force protection. The complexity of the coalition battlefield makes it necessary to work cooperatively with our likely coalition partners to solve interoperability gaps in C3I, logistics and weapon systems as well as to improve coalition training capabilities. Coalitions are the preferred means by which the U.S. and our partners address international crises . Coalitions lend political legitimacy and provide resources that mitigate the U.S. financial, materiel and personnel burden (OPTEMPO). Further, t his PE directly supports the goals of the 1999 NATO Summit 's Defense Capabilities Initiative.

This program is a budget activity level 5 based on the successful transition of robotic technologies from Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) activities to Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD). This PE was established in response to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Service agreement at the April 1997 Joint Robotics Program General Officer Steering Committee (GOSC). The agreement was to have OSD retain oversight of DoD robotics programs through EMD. Individual Services are responsible for requirements generation and procurement funding. Within the JRP, emphasis is on the development of robotic technologies that: are usable in multi- service missions; provide capability in hazardous environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability; reduce or enhance force manpower and sustainability; and are affordable. Success has been achieved in four programs to justify EMD at this time. This PE establishes the consolidated DoD robotics program for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and advances UGV concepts into EMD for (1) the Standardized Robotic System (SRS) - a generic, modular set of kits that can be used to retrofit several different types of currently fielded vehicles to allow remote obstacle breaching operations (minefields, earthworks, bunkers, etc.), and have supported operations in Bosnia and Kosovo; (2) the Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) - a mine neutralizing capability/wire breaching and smoke obscurant system with P3I upgrades such as manipulator arm, semi-autonomous/autonomous control; (3) the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System, Interior (MDARS-I) - which will provide physical security inside warehouses of fixed installations and large storage facilities, protection of critical inventory items and track movement of items in warehouses and ammunition storage facilities; and (4) the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System, Exterior (MDARS-E)- which is intended to provide unmanned roving security patrols among buildings and around perimeters of large fixed installations.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2, RDT&E Budget Item Justification Date: June 2001 B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program funds ongoing system level engineering of the existing Link 16 system for joint interoperability and the development of the next generation Link 16 system, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). System level engineering responsibilities include Link 16 spectrum issues and Link 16 joint enhancements. Spectrum issues include system engineering, testing, maintaining necessary equipment, performing DoD internal and external coordination and platform integration/certification required to coexist and operate in the Air Radio Navigation Safety frequency band. Joint enhancements planned for Link 16 include Joint Range Extension (JRE), Dynamic Network Management (DNM), Time Slot Reallocation (TSR), Gateways, Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Toolset, Relative Navigation, Link 16 Weapons Applications and improvements to Link 16 Track Quality, Time Slot Synchronization, Target Correlation/Decorrelation, Geodetic Data Registration, Common Time Reference, and Combat ID. MIDS is a joint and international cooperative program involving U.S., France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Designed for tactical combat applications and environments, MIDS will provide a highly jam-resistant, secure digital (voice and data) information distribution system, enabling rapid integrated communications, navigation, and identification among tactical and command and control warfare elements. The MIDS-Low Volume Terminal (LVT) will make Link 16 more affordable for a larger population of U.S. platforms and systems and will be interoperable with previously developed and produced Link 16 equipment, JTIDS Class 1 and 2. Affordability is being achieved through the implementation of open and commercial architecture standards and parts that will allow the tailoring of production configurations to the minimum needs of different U.S. platforms and missions. This program funds the U.S. cost share of MIDS development, fabrication, and test of EMD terminals and terminal level pre-operational support for U.S. platforms which are implementing MIDS. This program is funded under BA-5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, because it encompasses engineering and manufact uring development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : Most of the Department's current accounting systems and processes were designed primarily to provide budgetary accounting information and reports required by the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. Consequently, many of these systems do not satisfy current cost accounting information requirements recently imposed on all federal government agencies nor meet the Department's management needs for cost information in support of more cost effective decisions. The program supports an initiative to improve cost accounting capabilities within the Department. The program will support cost accounting pilots to improve: (1) the accumulation and identification of cost information, (2) the analysis of cost information for making more cost effective decisions, (3) visibility of the cost of operations and programs and (4) delivery of relevant and reliable information to program managers in a way that better relates costs to outputs and activities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT This program element is to provide funding for the development and design of a Department of Defense (DoD) wide financial management system architecture. This architecture is planned to be used in guiding the modernization of the financial management systems currently in use within the Department, to correct existing deficiencies and to improve financial and related nonfinancial feeder systems. (Nonfinancial feeder systems include, but are not limited to, those in support of acquisition, medical, transportation, property, inventory, supply, personnel and other functions that provide (or feed) financial information to the Department's financial systems.) The new architecture is a high priority for the Secretary of Defense and is required for the Department to have timely, accurate and reliable financial data for use in making effective management decisions and achieving favorable audit opinions on financial statements. Program Accomplishments and Plans/New Starts : FY 2001 Accomplishments : * Funds to initiate this effort were not included in the FY 2001 budget but have been included in the FY 2001 Omnibus Reprogramming request. These funds will be used only if approved by Congress.UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIEDExhibit R-2/R-2a, RDT & E Budget Item Justification JULY 2001 FY 2002 Plans : 1. (25,900) Develop a Department-wide architecture to guide financial management modernization and reform efforts. The resulting architecture is planned to be used to manage financial management systems and business operations across the DoD Components, clearly defining organizational business relationships and functions, and defining technical solutions for the Department's integrated financial management network. 2. (28,200) Define standard Department-wide data requirements and develop a plan for implementing such standard data requirements. Currently, DoD Components do not employ standard financial management data elements and definitions within their various systems. By defining and implementing DoD-wide standard data requirements, the Department's financial management systems\u2014as modified and implemented in accordance with the DoD-wide architecture\u2014is expected to increase and provide more efficient interoperability and generate more reliable, consistent and relevant management information. 3. (30,200) Document (i.e., map) the flow of financial management transaction data from origin to financial and other management reports. In order to better ensure the reliability, relevance and consistency of financial data used by DoD managers and decision makers, it is essential that such data be subjected to adequate internal controls and processed in accordance with applicable federal and DoD standards. By defining management data requirements and documenting the flow of financial data and the processes that impact such data, the Department expects to be in a position to greatly enhance the quality and veracity of its management information. 4. (15,700) Develop and implement a process for achieving compliance in the Department's financial and nonfinancial (feeder) systems. Currently, most of the Department's financial management and critical feeder systems do not satisfactorily meet pertinent federal requirements. By bringing its systems into compliance with applicable federal management requirements, the Department expects to be in a position to reduce systems operating costs, generate more reliable data for managers and decision-makers, and achieve more favorable audit opinions on its financial statements.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. This program element funds the Joint Unexploded Ordnance Coordination Office (JUXOCO) of the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to develop policy and provide oversight in coordinating requirements and technology in detection and clearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) within the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as with other United States and international agencies, academia, and industry; to establish and maintain standards for testing, modeling, and the evaluation of unexploded ordnance detection and clearance technology; and to establish, gather, and maintain a database of the results of these efforts. In response to a request from the House National Security Committee (HNSC) and concerns of the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of Defense submitted a plan in March 1997, \"Report to Congress: Unexploded Ordnance Clearance: A Coordinated Approach to Requirements and Technology Development.\" This report was developed by a joint, inter-agency task force comprised of the proponents of the unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance mission areas (active range clearance, humanitarian demining, countermine, explosive ordnance disposal, and environmental remediation). The report defined research and development priorities, program management, and cooperative activities for technology applicable to area ordnance clearance, also known as UXO clearance. The report also described a plan to maintain visibility over and leverage technology efforts within DoD, at other government agencies, and in private industry for the detection, neutralization, and disposal of UXO.

(U) A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT The purpose of the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI) is to reduce weapon system life cycle costs, especially operating and support (O&S) costs, by inserting commercial products into military systems. COSSI is a crucial element in DoD`s strategy to reduce the operations and support (O&S) costs of fielded equipment and supports the DoD goal of reducing logistics costs by 20 percent. As legacy systems age, O&S costs increase. COSSI uses technology insertions to lower these costs. COSSI also allows DoD to capitalize on the commercial innovation cycle so equipment can be modernized faster. Adapting commercial technologies for use in military equipment typically requires non-recurring engineering, testing and qualification. If the testing is successful and the cost savings validated, the items are purchased as retrofits. All COSSI projects must have an endorsement by a military customer and be linked to an existing military system. The benefits include: improved mean time between failure, improved logistics support by reducing parts obsolescence, reduced software reprogramming time and costs, improved performance, and the promotion of open system designs making future upgrades easier and less costly. COSSI promotes the use of Other Transaction Authority rather than FAR procurement contracts so companies that do not normally do business with DOD are given the opportunity to provide cost saving ideas that would otherwise go unnoticed. OSD funding provides an incentive to structure joint projects with pervasive impact across weapon systems, and to institutionalize the use of Other Transaction Agreements.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit)DATE June 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA Project Number and Title: P805 Commercial O&S Savings Initiative (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2000 Accomplishments: (U) COSSI provided funds to develop and install an Integrated Mechanical Diagnostic/Health and Usage Management System on AH-1, CH-53 and SH-60 helicopters. The system collects real time data on helicopter performance including continuous rotor track and balance, vibration monitoring of the gearbox, drivetrain, and engine, and structural usage. The project is expected to reduce operation and support costs for the AH-1, CH-53, and SH-60 by over $1 billion by eliminating rotor track and balance flights, improving the efficiency of maintenance operations, enhancing operational readiness, and extending the period between depot maintenance. COSSI funding is also being used to develop a propeller control unit for P-3 aircraft. The project will replace the current analog/mechanical system with one that is digital/electromechanical. The benefits include higher reliability, elimination of control system adjustments requiring ground operation and flight checks, a built in test capability to improve trouble shooting, and elimination of parts obsolescence. The new propeller control unit is expected to reduce P-3 propeller maintenance costs from $20/flight hour to less than $4/flight hour.($ 11.554 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA FY 2001 Plans: (U) COSSI funds are being used to support three projects: an electronic propeller control system for C-130 aircraft, an advanced symbol generator for the AN/AVS-7 night vision imaging system/heads-up-display, and a new propeller deicing system for P-3 and C- 130 aircraft. The electronic propeller control system for the C-130 is a spin-off of a similar COSSI project for the P-3 started in FY 2000. The project will modify the propeller control system currently used on ATR 42 and ATR 72 regional civil aircraft for use on the C-130. An electronic propeller control and electronic valve housing will replace the mechanical valve housing and synchrophaser. The project is expected to reduce propeller maintenance costs from approximately $19/flight hour to approximately $2/flight hour. The advanced symbol generator project is a follow-on to a previous COSSI project that developed active matrix electroluminescent flat panel displays for Army aviator night vision goggles. The project will replace the current signal data converter (SDC) with a new one that is smaller, lighter, and less expensive to buy and maintain. The new SDC will be almost $10,000 less expensive to buy than the one being replaced. The propeller deicing project will develop a propeller mounted generator similar to the one designed for the Beech 1900D civil aircraft. The new design eliminates the carbon brushes currently used to transfer electrical power to the propellers. Having a generator mounted directly on the propeller will eliminate the need to clean and replace the brushes every 50 flight hours. Maintenance costs will be reduced by approximately $5 million/year. ($ 9.541 million) (U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) DoD will issue a project call for the FY2002 program. Lessons learned during previous COSSI solicitations will be used to further refine the program. Based on previous experience, most cost saving projects are expected to pertain to upgrading electronics and computers on legacy aircraft.($ 10.805 million)UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA Commercial O&S B.
