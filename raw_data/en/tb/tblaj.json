Why are so many people searching for acupuncture in Houston? Perhaps the best-known practice of Oriental medicine is acupuncture. In an acupuncture treatment, your practitioner will insert tiny needles at various points on your body. The points are determined by meridians which are similar to the neural network or vascular system. These needles gently stimulate your Qi; a Chinese term for energy or flow. Disruptions in Qi are responsible for the ailments you experience. By encouraging the flow of Qi, acupuncture stimulates your immune system thus promoting your body's ability to heal itself. After an initial intake appointment where your concerns or complaints are discussed, you will undergo your treatment sessions which will last from 30 minutes to an hour. Sometimes, if your ailment calls for it, we will also employ the use of Moxibustion; also known as Moxa. Moxa is a practice in which dried mugwort is burned near a point on your body. It warms the acupuncture point and is an excellent tool for increasing the flow of Qi.
