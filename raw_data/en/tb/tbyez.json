Purpose This FOA seeks applications for research projects to help reduce disparities in tobacco use and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in the United States and promote health equity through scientific inquiry focused on innovative state and local tobacco prevention and control policies including, but not limited to: The long-term goal of this FOA is to reduce tobacco-related cancer health disparities, and in doing so, to promote health equity among all populations. Applicants submitting applications related to health economics are encouraged to consult [NOT-OD-16-025](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-025.html) to ensure that the research projects align with NIH mission priorities in health economics research. Applicants may propose projects utilizing tobacco prevention and control strategies to promote health equity among all populations and reduce cancer health disparities in vulnerable populations. All applications must include an overall strategy that builds upon rigorous dissemination and implementation science. Investigators should include a well-designed plan for proactively disseminating research findings, including a specific plan for identifying and engaging critical community partners in the research, clearly described roles and responsibilities of key partners and plans regarding the nature and extent of future collaborations. Investigators should describe the communication plan and detailed list of responsible parties for decision-making and dissemination of research findings. This FOA is proposed in response to the March 2016 Report to the NCI Board of Scientific Advisors, titled \" [Tobacco Control Research Priorities for the Next Decade: Working Group Recommendations for 2016-2025](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/pdf/nci-tobacco-control-research-priorities-rpt-feb-2016.pdf).\" This report concluded that \"research is needed to identify innovative local, state, federal and private sector policy approaches that will advance the goal of eliminating tobacco use and its resultant harms, as well as effective strategies to more completely disseminate these approaches\" and that research is needed \"to identify and implement tobacco control policies that reduce or eliminate tobacco-related inequalities.\" [Health Equity in Tobacco Prevention and Control](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/best-practices-health-equity/pdfs/bp-health-equity.pdf) describes \"health equity as the opportunity for everyone to reach their full potential, regardless of any socially determined circumstance. Health equity can be achieved in tobacco prevention and control by eliminating differences in tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke between certain groups.\" This FOA will utilize the NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant (R21) mechanism, and is suitable for early phase, pilot, or exploratory/developmental projects. For such projects, preliminary data are not required; however, they may be included if available. Investigators who are interested in proposing larger scale, later phase projects based upon strong preliminary data should submit applications in response to the partner FOA of identical scope, [PAR-20-302](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-302.html), which uses the Research Project Grant (R01) mechanism. Background and Rationale The landmark [1964 Surgeon General's report](https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/B/M/Q/) on smoking and health began a process of public education, programmatic and policy intervention, and social norm change that has revolutionized how most Americans view commercial tobacco use, and in particular cigarette smoking. As a result, over the past five decades, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among U.S. adults has markedly declined- from 42.4% in 1965 to 13.7% in 2018. Tobacco prevention and control efforts implemented since the 1964 Surgeon General's report are estimated to have prevented 8 million premature smoking-attributable deaths in the United States and to have extended mean life span by 19-20 years, between the years 1964 and 2012. Despite this progress, tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable premature death in the U.S., as it does in most other high-income nations. The overall decline in prevalence masks substantial differences in adult cigarette smoking prevalence among different U.S. subpopulations, related to income, level of educational attainment, race or ethnicity, place of residence, health insurance coverage, the presence or absence of co-morbid mental health conditions and or substance abuse, and other factors. For example, in 2016, cigarette smoking prevalence was 14.3% among those living at or above the federal poverty level, compared with 25.3% among those living below the federal poverty level. In 2018, cigarette smoking prevalence was 29.2% among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adults compared with 19.5% among heterosexual adults. Similarly, exposure to SHS has dropped from about 50% of all nonsmokers in 1999-2000 to about 25% in 2013-2014. However, exposure remains especially high among some groups: approximately half of black nonsmokers are exposed to SHS, including seven in 10 black children; and SHS exposure is more than twice as high among nonsmokers living below the poverty level, compared with those living above the poverty level (48% vs. 21%, respectively). Disparities in smoking prevalence are increasingly reflected in differences in lung cancer incidence and mortality. For example, in 2016, the age-adjusted incidence of lung and bronchus cancer per 100,000 persons ranged from 86.8 in Kentucky to 25.1 in Utah. A 2016 editorial in JAMA Oncology notes the close link between tobacco use rates and overall cancer mortality, stating, \"the variation [in overall cancer death rates] across states today is greater than the overall improvement in mortality over the past 40 years: cancer mortality varies as much as 30% across states, and is strongly associated with state-level tobacco use.\" Differences in tobacco use are also strongly linked to differences in overall mortality between population subgroups. For example, in the U.S., England, Wales, Canada, and Poland, more than half the difference in mortality between men of high vs. low social strata is due to differences in the risk of dying from smoking at ages 35-69. A continued focus on tobacco prevention and control efforts at the population level can help reduce tobacco use, as well as the incidence of lung and other cancers. For example, in California, both tobacco use and lung cancer mortality have declined faster than the national average, and this is expected to continue. NCI Tobacco Control Monograph 22, [A Socioecological Approach to Addressing Tobacco-Related Health Disparities](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/monographs/22), concludes that knowledge of tobacco-related health disparities (TRHD) is \"enhanced by considering the interaction of factors at the individual, interpersonal, community or neighborhood, and societal or policy levels, and by considering the impact of diverse factors across the tobacco use continuum over the life span. Additional research to understand and reduce TRHD and promote health equity is essential to reducing the burden of tobacco use and tobacco-related cancer in the United States.\" Healthy People 2000 established the goal of reducing health disparities and expanded it to eliminating health disparities in Healthy People 2010. Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) includes addressing both health equity and health disparity and defines them as follows: Health equity: \"attainment of the highest level of health for all people. Achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequalities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and health care disparities.\" Health disparity is a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and or environmental disadvantage, and that adversely affects groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; SES; gender; age; gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. The HP 2020 goal combines both concepts to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups. Key Challenges Evidence-based policy approaches to tobacco prevention and control have the potential to further decrease the health and economic burdens of tobacco use and to reduce the wide disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-caused cancers across various subpopulations in the U.S. Policy interventions prioritize population-level outcomes by seeking to change the social-environmental context in which decisions about tobacco use are made They may be especially valuable for reducing disparities in tobacco use and promoting health equity among all populations because of their broad reach, ability to change social norms, and because they can be implemented at much lower cost than interventions that target individuals. However, gaps in our understanding of tobacco control policies remain, especially as they relate to the ability of new and existing policies to reduce disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related cancers and to promote health equity across all populations. The nation's tobacco prevention and control environment and policy landscape are increasingly complex and rapidly changing. Key challenges include the following: We understand in this environment of the COVID-19 pandemic that the broader health, social, cultural and economic conditions may impact the adoption and implementation of tobacco prevention and control policies. Many of the same populations who are most at risk for tobacco use and tobacco-related cancers are the same people who are disproportionately bearing the health burden of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Applications should reflect current conditions and may consider interactions between tobacco prevention and control policies and factors related to the pandemic. Research Objectives The central charge of this FOA is to understand how to improve the effectiveness of existing tobacco prevention and control policy strategies as well as to study new policy approaches to reducing disparities in commercial tobacco use and SHS exposure. The knowledge generated will contribute to reducing disparities in tobacco-related cancers and promoting health equity for all populations. Primary research topics that fall within the scope of this FOA include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Comprehensive smoke free policies (e.g., how to increase adoption and implementation of comprehensive smoke free policies in workplaces, multi-unit housing, homes, vehicles, parks, etc.); 2. Policies to reduce the appeal of tobacco products through advertising and marketing restrictions at the state or local level, or reduce the demand for tobacco products with various pricing interventions; 3. Policies related to coverage for tobacco dependence treatment (e.g., state, local and or federal policies affect access to, affordability, and use of cessation services among high risk populations, and the impact of surcharges on tobacco users); 4. Overarching policy environment (e.g. studies that examine the dynamic interplay of different tobacco prevention and control policies on tobacco use, how tobacco control policies may work together to reduce tobacco use among both youth and adults, focusing on how to accelerate progress in communities that have experienced slower declines in tobacco use, etc.); and 5. Innovative dissemination and implementation of research findings. Office of Disease Prevention- Shared Interest Data Harmonization for Substance Abuse and Addiction via the PhenX Toolkit: In order to encourage data integration and replication, the participating Institutes and Centers encourage investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies. One way to do so is to incorporate the measures from the Core and Specialty collections, which are available in the Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection and the Tobacco Regulatory Research Collection of the PhenX Toolkit Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) via the PhenX Toolkit: Investigators involved in human-subject studies are encouraged to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data on SDOH across studies. In particular, human-subject studies should incorporate SDOH measures from the Core and Specialty collections that are available in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit ( [www.phenxtoolkit.org](http://www.phenxtoolkit.org)). Design, Analysis, and Sample Size Considerations for Studies to Evaluate Policies Investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of a policy on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study design in which groups that are subject to the policy are compared to groups that are not subject to the policy. Designs that might be proposed include a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, a stepped-wedge group- or cluster randomized trial, a multiple baseline design, or another quasi-experimental design. Whenever participants are assigned in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states), or participants receive some part of their intervention in a group or cluster, and observations on individual participants are analyzed for between-group effects, special methods are required for analysis and sample size. Applicants will need to show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions.

Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. For this particular announcement, note the following: The R21 exploratory/developmental grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or biobehavioral research. An R21 grant application need not have extensive background material or preliminary information. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not required for R21 applications; however, they may be included if available. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is the trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: With regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the PD/PI(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? Do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? For a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: Does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed?

Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Grantee institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Not Applicable Data Management and Sharing Note: The NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing is effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023. Consistent with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.2.3_sharing_research_resources.htm#Data). Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000.
