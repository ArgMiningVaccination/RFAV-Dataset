Message to current patients from Dr. Goldstein: You already know my customized recommendations for your nutritional supplementation. These recommendations are designed to support optimal immune function. I believe this makes you less susceptible to any infection and more able to fight it quickly with less down time if you do get one! Remember, should you start to get symptoms, you should increase doses of Vitamin C, Vitamin D and iodine temporarily.
