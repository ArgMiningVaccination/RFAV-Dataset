In the future, the burden of cancer will become high er. Today, Europe as a whole is working together in the area of cancer policy initiatives and research in order to understand the underlying causes of cancer, to ensure the improved management of this disease and to study its social impact. Across Europe, the EU and its MS have mainly supported research on dissecting the causes and mechanism of cancer, translating this basic knowledge into clinical applications and supporting clinical research on new and improved interventions. Other issues related to canc er have been also covered, but have received a considerably lower attention (e.g. cancer control, prevention, patient care, etc.). Thus, room is left for cancer research aimed at improving existing treatments as well as studies of the organization of care, and methods to enhance quality of life and prevention. The European pharmaceutical sector has five companies in among the world's top ten pharmaceutical firms. The research pipeline for the top 10 European pharmaceutical companies suggests that firms se em to specialize in certain NCD categories. For example, pipeline data shows that NOVO -NORDISK, preferring to focus on other areas, does not have any CANCER relevant molecules under development; other firms like NOVARTIS or ROCHE, however, are developing several. Overall, the European pharmaceutical sector has increased its commitment to R&D over the past four years. GSK is the only top 10 company to record a shrinking commitment to research investment. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, have recorded a massive increase in R&D spending. But most companies have recorded progressive of steady increases . By contrast, US levels of investment in R&D have been more mixed. Interviews with stakeholders revealed several major themes with regard to the future of research in the area of C ancer . In the main, researchers find funding very complex and limited. They hold that most funding focuses on basic research which although it has an impact in the academic research of Europe, it also limits the capacity to comp ete with US . Researchers are concerned about lack of funding for independent clinical studies and a lack of independent funding sources. Cancer is the first leading cause of lost DALYs across Europe in terms of NCDs (17.68 %). Breaking down the category i nto its major diseases, Leukaemia is the largest cause of lost DALYs by comparison with Kidney. In the past few years, research investment in Cancer was well adjusted to reflect their relative burden. In terms of the effectiveness of research investment, Cancer funding is among the top three with an average of 38% of paper published for Cancer are of European origin, behind RESPI(56%) and CARDI (42%). According to the results in Europe, Cancer is a big subject area , averag ing 11.5 % of the papers in biomedicine overall. Cancer research represents just over one ninth of all European biomedical research output, but one eighth of world biomedical output. Germany has the highest output in terms of Cancer pap ers, highlighting that genetics is the dominant research type, followed by chemotherapy, prognosis and surgery. On the other hand, Malta is publishing very little and Germany, Italy and UK are the ones most publishing in cancer research , being correlative within is level of GDP. Critical Appraisal Cancer 11 1 European Research Programs Cancer is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe , with an estimated 3.45 million new cancer cases (excluding non -melanoma skin cancer) and 1.7 5 million deaths from cancer in 20 12 (Ferlay et al. 2013)1. In the future, the burden of cancer will become extremely higher. The European Commission became soon aware of the cancer problem and made a strong commitment to support cancer research at the UE -level through the different Framework Programmes. Today, Europe as a whole is working together in the area of cancer policy initiatives and research in order to understand the underlying causes of cancer , to ensure the improved ma nagement of this disease and to study its soci al impact. Europe has a long tradition of funding cancer research at the national and at the European level. The ECRM surveys and our previous Impact Assessment Report have highlighted various differences in the funding scheme and funding priorities of the Member States (MS). Indeed, despite the majority of public funding in cancer research being concentrated in public funding organizations (41% public and 7% private -public sectors), each country has its own funding system. The priorities set for cancer research funding generally matches the ones set by the EU Frameworks Programmes. As regards the EU level, w ithin the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6; 2002 -2006), for example, cancer -related research was attributed a budget of approximately \u20ac450 million. Whereas in the previous 5th Framework Programme (1998 -2002) cancer research focused mainly on molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, the 6th Framework Programme implemented a patient -oriented, ''translational'' research approach, aiming at bringing basic knowledge into medical practice more rapidly. This translational concept was also applied in the 7th EU Framew ork Programme (FP7; 2007 - 2013) ( Jungbluth et al. 2007 )2. The total EU funding for cancer research in the FP7 Cooperation Programme, taking into account all cancer -related projects, including not only the thematic \"cancer\" area but also other areas, i.e. diagnostics, nanotechnology, etc. is estimated to be over EUR 500 million. 1.1 Summary of RFO Research Projects This section presents a selection of 139 cancer research projects (a purposive sample) at national levels (MS) and EU -level, with the aim to provide a general description of funded research programs/ projects in cancer across the EU. For the EU -level, the selection was based on the first three calls for proposals launched in the FP6 (Thematic Priorities: Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health , as well as in the FP7 ( under the thematic \"ca ncer\" area) . For the MS -level, the main research funding organizations (RFOs) dedicated to cancer research were selected. 1 Ferlay , F .

Europe combating cancer: The European Union \u00b4s commitment to cancer research in the 6th Framework Programme. Mol Oconol 2007;1:14 -8. Critical Appraisal Cancer 12 In brief, the methodology followed to select these funded research program/projects in cancer was based on three parameters: i. A time limitation of 2006 -13 in order to include projects under FP -6 and because there is a large number of projects funded for the study period. Considering as time period 2006 -2013 limited the sample considerably ; ii. A selection of range of RFOs in cancer across the different European Countries and the most relevant projects funded by EU or at EU Level; In order to provide a reliable picture of cancer research funded programs/projects in Europe, those being the major research programs/projects funded were sele cted. Therefore, about 80% of the selected programs/projects were those funded by the EU. For the remaining 20% of the selected programs/projects, the selection was based on the amount of funding dedicated by the countrie\u00b4s main RFOs. The variables collected for each cancer research funded programs/projects were: Funder: main funding organisations of research projects on national level. Example: EC, DG Sanco, AECC (Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola type(s) of ins titution receiving the funds, n=number of partners Level of Collaboration: whether the research institutions involved in the project are from one country, a number of European countries, or European and non -European countries. Partner countries: the countr ies involved in the project Project Title: the project's name Research Area: the type of research, ex: prevention, diagnostic, treatment, management, policy etc... Project timeline: the years during which the project is undertaken Summary description: overview of what the project is focusing on and its objectives Achieved/Anticipated Outcomes: the main results achieved or likely to be achieved, ex: development of a new treatment for prostate cancer, or change in policy, etc... Amount of funding: the amoun t of funding the project received (if available) Once this data was collected, a mixed quantitative (deriving summary statistics) and qualitative analysis was performed. The creation of a \"Purposive Sample\" of European funded projects/programs involves several limitations. Firstly, this purposive sample does not strictly retrieve all the projects funded across EU on cancer. Since this would have been unfeasible, a sampling of the main projects/programs was carried out. Secondly, it was sometimes not poss ible to distinguish between basic and applied research projects via the database queries. Moreover, often the basic research such as microbiology and fundamental chemistry is not specifically directed to a group of cancers or a specific cancer site, but is directed towards a wide range of cancer sites and applications for treatment, diagnosis or prevention of the disease. For this reason, it was decided to not separate research projects by cancer sites. Thirdly, the website query has intrinsic limitations r elated to the public availability of information. Often, RFOs do not clearly state the levels of funding for individual projects/program or do not list Critical Appraisal Cancer 13 research projects/programs of earlier years (the most recently funded ones were more commonly listed). F or all these reason, we selected at a first stage RFOs for which information was available. However, by doing this, lack of data for some variables was still a major issue. For instance, the classification of research projects/programs into areas of resear ch was given for some projects only. When this information was not provided, the most suitable area or field of research was assigned. Otherwise, it was specified that the information (for this or other variables) is not available. 1.2 Major European Rese arch Programs Receiving Funding Under the FP6 (2002 -2006), the EU devoted 480 million \u20ac of funding to 139 cancer research projects. A selection of 40 major funded research projects is shown in table 1. The FP7 (2007 -2013) funded a similar number of projec ts for a total amount of over 500 million \u20ac. Further 40 research projects under this programme are shown in the same table. Across the EU, the main research programs/projects of each MS are shown in table ii. About 2 -3 research programs/projects are provid ed for each MS. A higher number of research programs/projects was collected for Spain and Portugal, because there are the countries for which WP5 (EASP) was responsible for the identification of RFOs and retrieval of funding activities. Looking at the aver age life -time of the projects, the average life of grant is of 28 months with a minimum time of 12 months and a maximum of 60 months per project (mostly in the case of EU - funded research projects/programs). The total funding allocated to the selected research projects/programs is 278,947,893 \u20ac (2,582,850 per research project/program). The funding allocated for the majority of the selected projects (68%) was under 3 million \u20ac, whereas for a relatively smaller number of projects (16%) the funding allocated reached 5 million \u20ac (Figure i). Figure i : Total funding allocated projects by Europe (2002 -2013) 4644 20 21 05101520253035404550 < 1Mil \u20ac 1 - 3 Mil \u20ac > 3 - 5 Mil \u20ac > 5 Mil \u20ac The most important area in which the RFOs were interested was in relation to the therapeutic and drug developments, specifically research areas of biology, scientific models and aetiology, whereas the health care research and economic health research are almost not existent. Indeed, a high number of projects (13% of the research projects with information available on research area) addresses genetic or cellular biology (research areas of biology), with the aim of finding the causes of chemical and biological mechanisms so as to develop new strategies in therapeutic and pharmaceutical care of cancer patien ts. Research into the molecular and cellular biology of cancer , Critical Appraisal Cancer 14 leading to major improvements in personalized cancer medicine, has also received a major attention in the past few years. For instance, EU -funded projects in this area were ANGIOTARGETING (Mul tidisciplinary research to explore and validate molecular targets for innovative treatments), and MOL CANCER MED ( Developing molecular medicines for cancer ), to name a few. In addition, of the EU -funded projects, only six projects addressed the quality of life for cancer patients ( are of Cancer control, Survivorship and outcomes research , such as the EUROCHIP project - European Cancer Health Indicator Project -III), and only a small percentage of the research projects/ programs addressed the economic consequ ences of cancer. All EU funded projects/programs involved a consortium or multiple partners across Europe. Recipients of funding were universities, as well as the private sector and NGOs, with several partners from di fferent countries collaborating (except one project of the private sector only, the \"European Consortium for Anticancer Antibody Development\"). These projects had particular relevance to the shaping of national and European policy on cancer given the larger level of funding investment involved, and the inclusion of research groups from several universities, research institutions and private companies and Charities. MS, at national level, used to fund research projects/program of 1 to 2 years, and on an individual basis (most of the projects/programs funded were not multicenter or collaborative). Most of the RFOs (n=90%) tend to fund only 1 organization. Overall, the topics funded fall within simil ar research areas (therapeutic and drug development). Most of the recipients of funding were universities or research centers (around 90%) , whereas the private sector and NGOs conducted research projects mainly in Northern European countries . Although priv ate companies and charities were commonly participating as members of larger consortiums (led by universities or public research institutions), there are several research projects/programs (as stated, typically from Northern Europe) led by the private sect or solely (e.g. CAMELIAT and ESCAPE, funded by the French RFOs) . In terms of the level of collaborations among RFOs of the MS, results highlighted the absence of trans -border collaboration. Indeed, all the projects were funded within the RFOs of the MS. I n other words, at national level, none of the selected RFOs funded any multicentric international project. This observation may indicate a need for larger collaborations within the Ms in order to enhance the quality of research in cancer, but also to avoid duplicate efforts (funded projects by the EU and MS may have overlapping aims because similar research areas are funded).

In order to achieve these aims , the EU has supported research on dissecting the causes and mechanism of cancer, translating this basic knowledge into clinical applications and supporting clinical research on new and improved interventions. Other issues related to cancer have been also covered , but have received a considerably lower attention ( e.g. ageing and cancer, childhood cancers, regional differences, psychosocial aspects, palliative care and guidance to support groups ). Thus, room is left for cancer research aimed at improving existing tr eatments as well as studies of the organization of care, methods to enhance quality of life and prevention. In the FP6 ( 2002 -2006) the 'Combating Cancer' initiative within the 'Life Sciences, Genomics and Biotechnology for Health' thematic priority result ed in approximately 480 million \u20ac allocated to 108 translational cancer research projects all over Europe. As has been already envisaged, t hese projects have resulted in advances in our understanding of cancer, and has also served to improve and develop anti-cancer therapies. The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7; 2007 -2013), provided extensive financial support for different areas of collaborative cancer research, ranging from basic to pre -clinical, clinical and translational research. The focus was on disease aetiology, new medicines and therapies; identifying and validating drug tar gets and biological markers that aid in the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment; and assessing the effectiveness of preventive prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Over 100 projects were funded for over 500 million \u20ace under the thema tic \"cancer\" area. The EU f unded cancer research in the FP7 Cooperation Programme, taking into account all cancer -related projects, included not only the thematic \"cancer\" area but also other areas, i.e. diagnostics, nanotechnology, etc . At national level, most funding is provided through governmental and charitable organizations and the health -care/university systems. Although some similarities with the EU funded projects/programs were noted (research areas prioritized), there were few multicenter and coll aborative research projects funded. A shift from regional or national efforts to continent -wide collaborations, including collaborative research with the private sector, would be desirable, as well as to pursue the component of translational research in ca ncer. Cancer is a complex disease caused by interactions of multiple factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental and lifestyle influences, infectious agents and ageing. The past Framework Programmes have witnessed a n important progress in underst anding the molecular mechanisms of cancer in the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell. Yet, intensive collaboration among scientific, medical and pharmaceutical communities is indispensable. Therefore, collaborative research on cancer is also considered to be a priority in the EU framework programmes. For instance, within the FP7, specific research programs allocated funds for this pu rpose (also including clinical trials) , such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) . At national level, f ew RFOs consider the private sector as a recipient of funding. It is needed to pursue the component of translational research in cancer at this level. Duplication of cancer research efforts between and even within Member States (MS) is very likely. As such , since research priorities defined by the EU (topics or thematic calls) were also adopted by the MS, several RFOs of MS may have fund (partially) projects funded by the EU. Therefore, an alignment of research efforts between the MS would be desirable. Eff orts have been already made for a better coordinated research program within Europe. For instance, since 2011, ECCO is leading the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer's (EPAAC) work package on research coordination, the objective of which is to devise methodologies to coordinate cancer research from all funding sources in Europe. Critical Appraisal Cancer 51 2 Private Sector Investment in Cancer Investments in NCD research funding originate from a variety of sources: national governments, regional organizations, charities, non-governmental organizations and supranational organizations. While policy -makers regard the management of NCDs as an increasingly important issue and are engaged in sponsoring research and facilitating cooperation between these organizations for the purpose of developing useful collaborations; less is known about the industry response to NCDs in terms of research and development. In this section of the CA, we consider the background and specifics of private sector investment in NCD research, and in part icular, Cancer. 2.0.1. Background: Private Sector Investment in Research and Development Across the various sectors of industry, the world's top companies are increasing their commitment to research and development (R&D). After the 2009 financial crisis, the world's top 2500 companies, which account for 90% of the world's industrial investment in research and development, enjoyed a brief rebound in sales for the years 2010 -11. Although growth stalled in 2012 -13, companies continued to invest in R&D, which , overall, increased 4.9% in 2013 ( Hernandez et al 2014, 6 )3. Currently, the top 100 world companies are responsible for 53.1% of the total investment in R&D, which includes 31 companies based in the EU, 39 in the US and 17 in Japan. These companies are also responsible for about one third of all patents filed for approval in the US and EU, with the Electronic and Electrical Equipment sector (Samsung and IBM) being the most active ( Hernandez et al 2014 ,12) 3 The Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology sector is one of the largest investors in R&D, claiming about a 18.0% share of total R&D investment for 2014 ( Hernandez et al 2014, 47 )3. However, the sector has a much less significant share of patents to R&D investment ratios. For example, the Electronic and Electrical Equipment sector, which enjoys the highest ratio, is about ten times larger than the ratio for Pharma & Biotech. Today, the production of safe and effective compounds requires substantial investment and cooperation between diverse companies across the sector, particularly bio -tech companies ( Hernandez et al 2014, 39 -40) 3. Indeed, biotech companies are outstripping traditional pharmaceutical companies in terms of investment in R&D, which has increased 20.4%, against pharmaceutical, which has itsel f decreased investment by 0.2% ( Hernandez et al 2014, 47 ) 3. Although the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology sector is among the largest in terms of global R&D investment; analysts have become concerned about the nature and quality of those investments. Decreased patent ratios, stalling investment in general R&D and the increasing role of biotech companies in discovering new molecules and bringing them to market are symptomatic of wider systemic shifts across the industry. The sector, they argue, is in th e grip of major changes, which are weighing heavily on the capacity of industry to undertake investment in R&D and respond to the growing challenge of NCDs. These shifts are tectonic and include: changed paradigms for scientific research, new measures of p roductivity and a declining tolerance for risk (Cockburn , 20064; Pammolli et al., (2014) EU Investment Scoreboard. Brussels: Eupopean Comission. Available online at: http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/scoreboard14.html 4 David make clinical pharmaceutical R&D\", Nature Reviews 10: 428 -438 Critical Appraisal Cancer 52 Today, new drug discovery is a high -risk and time -consuming process. Only 1 out of every 5000 - 10,000 compounds screened becomes an approved drug. And it takes a n average of 10 to 15 years at an average cost of more than US$1 billion to develop a successful medicine ( Merck 2015 )6. Significant can losses occur where outputs are dependent o n research interaction at the interface of various disciplines, and where there is no guarantee that new compounds will advance to clinical trials. Increased possibility of R&D failure is one of the main factors in the raised estimates of the costs per new molecular entity (NME), on the basis which analysts now question whether industry is in the grip of an R&D productivity crisis ( Cockburn, 2006; Pammolli et al., 2011 ) 4, 5. In past, analysts lauded the contribution of industry to the advancement of scie nce and medical technologies. Today, however, where they measure productivity in terms of the ratio of the \"output\" of a process to some measure of \"inputs\", like rising R&D expenditures and falling or static counts of new drug approvals ; they have identi fied a sharp decline in research productivity over the past decade ( Cockburn 2007, 1 )7. As such, o ld confidences in the industry and its product development pathway are fading. In 2004, the FDA expressed \"growing concern that many of the new basic science discoveries made in recent years may not quickly yield more effective, more affordable, and safe medical products for patients,\" citing falling numbers of applications for approval of new drugs, and placing the blame squarely on an \"increasingly challengi ng, inefficient, and costly\" product development path ( cited in Cockburn 2007, 3 ) 7. In the 21st century, industry analysts are concerned that the decreasing levels of productivity confronts policy makers with tough questions. Where tax -payers continue t o provide significant amounts financial support to industry led R&D, analysts are now asking whether these \"poor outcomes justify continued public investment at its current scale?\" ( Cockburn 2007, 2 -3) 7 2.0.2. Mapping the Private Sector Research Pipeline In this context, m apping private sector investment in NCD research funding becomes quite important. However, such a mapping exercise also involves unique challenges. For example, the details and strategic focus of public and third sector NCD research fund ing programmes are readily accessible and, in many c ases, a matter of public record. By contrast, the activities of the private sector are not. Governed by the profit motive, the specifics of private sector investment in NCD research are more usually conf idential. So, what is the commitment of European pharmaceutical companie s to R&D investment in Cancer. How can we map the ways (types of technologies) in which industry has responded to the challenge of Cancer? And how can we assess, or make sense, of thi s response. In order to map the industry response (activity, investment and initiatives) to Cancer in terms of research investment, we describe the research pipeline for major European pharmaceutical companies in terms of Molecules in Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, Submission and Approval . Data was collected from the four most recent annual reports available at the companies' global websites (2014 -2011). Where data was not available for 2014, the range 2013 -2010 was applied . Information was readily available on the web. Results are expressed in terms of phases of development for individual molecules, which are set out in the tables below. The tables also include the total amount of R&D expenses f or the available period and the percentage of sales or revenues allocated to R&D. In order to assess the industry response, we compare the top 10 European headquartered companies in terms of annual R&D investment against unmet European need for C ancer , and also against the response of the top 10 US headquarte red companies to unmet US need for C ancer . Table iii details the top ten pharmaceutical companies based in the US and Europe by investment in R&D. In the sections that follow, we discuss unmet need for NCDs in both Europe and the US, 6 MERK (2015) available on line at http://www.merck.com/inde x.html 7 Cockburn, Iain M.

In 2012, there were an estimated 3.45 million new cases of cancer (excluding non - melanoma skin cancer) and 1.75 million deaths from cancer ( Ferlay et al. 2013 )1. Cost of cancer treatments and research & development on this disease have become a dominant factor in policy making decisions. There is concern about the high cost of new treatments for cancer, probably because most of them are developed by profit institutions. The current trends of cancer res earch tend to development of new drugs and therapies, there remains tremendous scope and mileage in cancer research aimed at improving existing treatments as well as studies of the organization of care, methods to enhance quality of life and prevention. Organizational strategies should cover the broad spectrum that makes up cancer research and should fit the objectives of individual Member States as well as the broader European vision for cancer control ( Coleman et al. 2008 )8. The final aim of any cancer r esearch is to improve cancer control for each patient and in society as a whole. In order to translate research findings into strategies that will ultimately improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of cancer, it is not only scientis ts, but also the lay public and patients' organizations, who must be widely informed about the conduct and the results of research ( EPAAC, 2014 )9. There is a consensus that prevention activities are cost - effectiveness actions for the health care systems . To set cancer prevention priorities in cancer research policies, some actions could be (Vineis and Wild, 2014 )10: To develop and test effective preventive strategies based on structural interventions (including bans, taxation, and urban planning) that integrate with individual health promotion To study and test the best organizational ways to integrate primary prevention into health services To identify the unknown causes of cancer (including frequent cancers such as colon and breast cancer) with n ovel methods; in particular, the so -called omics technologies used to probe the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome To assess the extent of preventable cancers in all countries, taking into account their specific and changing expos ure profiles (e.g., infectious agents) Burden of disease analysis is a technique used to assess and compare the fatal and non -fatal effects of different diseases (such as prostate cancer) among population groups and over time. It combines data around prem ature death, measured by the years of life lost (YLL) and non -fatal health outcomes, measured by years lost due to disability (YLD) into a summary measure called the DALY (disability -adjusted life years). This allows the effects of different diseases (such as cancer) and injures to be compared on an equal basis. 8 Coleman MP, Alexe DM, Albreht T, McKeee M.

Critical Appraisal Cancer 55 As you can see in the figure ii, Cancer is estimated to be the first cause of the burden of disease in NCDs in Europe by percentage of lost of DALYs (17,68% of the total DALYs), followed by cardiov ascular (16,97%), mental (5%). Figure ii: NCDs in Category* *Sourced at: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidenc e (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million) . For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). 2.2 European Pharmaceutical Sector: Research Pipeline for Cancer The European pharmaceutical sector has five companies among the world's top ten pharmaceutical firms. And indeed, across Europe, t he sector is major investor in R&D. According to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries, the European pharmaceutical sector invested an estimated \u20ac30,630 million in R&D across Europe for the year 2013 ( EFPI 2014 )11. The industry also employs about 690,000 people and supports between three and four times than number of jobs across the EU area. The EFPI also asserts that the sector has suffered from the impact of European austerity measures introduced in response to the fi nancial and debt crisis of 2008 -9 (EFPI 2014 )11. 2.2.1. NOVARTIS (EUR) Novartis is a Swiss based company headquartered in Basel. It was formed in 1996 through the merger of Sandoz and Ciba -Geigy. In 2003, Novartis reintroduced the Sandoz brand as a single subsidiary in which it consolidated its generic drugs businesses. Novartis divested its agrochemical and genetically modified crops business in 2000 with the spinout of Syngenta in partnership with AstraZeneca, which also divested its agrochemical business. Today, Novartis focuses its business on three leading divisions: pharmaceuticals (Novartis), eye care (Alcon) and generics (Sando z). Novartis is currently expanding its presence in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where there is fast -growing demand for access to high -quality medicines and healthcare. The company has more than 119.000 employees in over 150 co untries.

According to the GBD, the US seems to have larger problems with categories like diabetes and mental health than Europe; and the situation for CVDs and Cancer is somewhat reversed. In the US, CVDs are the largest disease category in terms of lost DALYs, but the levels of lost DALYs in Europe and the US are about the same. Figure iii: NCDs in U nited States 2010: Disease Category* **Sourced at: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Breaking into disease areas, cancer remains the second largest contributor to lost DALYs in the US, with 15,13% of the total DALYs (In Europe was the first cause). The first cause is cardiovascular (16,92%). Mental health (13,61%), diabetes (7,97%) and respiratory (6,46%) are the third, fourth and fifth cause, respectively . 2.4 US Pharma ceutical Sector: Research Pipeline for Cancer Five of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies have their headquarters in the US, which is also the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals, and a world leader for investment in R&D.

GSK is the only top 10 company to record a shrinking commitment to research investment. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, have recorded a massive increase in R&D spending. But most companies have recorded progressive of stead y increases. By contrast, US levels of investment in R&D have been more mixed. Companies at the top of the scale, like Merck and Pfizer, have steady reduced their levels of investment. At the lower end of the scale, companies like Gilead and Celgene hav e massively increased their commitment. varieties of cancer development with BMS.

Critical Appraisal Cancer 75 Despite being the world leader for R&D investment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector, major US companies have significantly less cancer molecules in their research pipelines than European based companie s (116 v.53). In several cases, US firms were not at all active in developing new molecules for cancer. By contrast, European based pharmaceutical companies have a much greater commitment to cancer in terms of pipeline development. Certainly, the top 10 European companies seem to specialize in specific NCD categories, almost all the companies have molecules on development for cancer. However, compared with the US, other large European firms like GSK, Novartis and AstraZeneca have quite a number of produ cts in development. Indeed, these three firms consolidate more molecules in their research pipelines than do the top ten US firms collectively. Where the number of molecules under development in the United States is set against broadly similar levels of patent need in the US and Europe, there are grounds for concluding that US R&D commitment to cancer is lacking and perhaps even broadly insufficient to tackle to scale of the problem that these diseases represent. These conclusions are similar to some oth er NCD categories, as CRDs. These results are in contradiction of what is writing in previous analysis report where it has been found that in the US the R&D in pharmaceuticals has been higher than in the Europe, especially after 1992. In the analysis with found similar amount of money spent by companies in R&D (see table xli and xlii), but totally different amount of molecules in the pipeline for cancer (higher -almost the double - in Europe comparing in the US).

In the first place, we searched a database of cli nical studies (i.e. clinicaltrials.gov) for recently (2011) closed and ongoing clinical studies funded by each MD company identified above. Secondly, we searched databases of new approved MDs (i.e. FDA premarket approval, de novo database, EuroScan) hav e been searched according to the same time frame (2011 -2015). Thirdly, at the European Level, we searched a database of CE marked products exists since 2009, called EUDAMED. This database is only accessible to government agencies in charge for the market surveillance in each country (e.g. Ministero della Salute in Italy). In the US, by contrast, the relevant authority, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has a whole section on the website with approval dossiers for all medical devices. Although there i s not a direct link between technologies approved in the US and technologies licensed in the EU, knowledge of the most recent innovations overseas does provide some indication of the most up -to-date technologies that are available to improve clinical pract ice for the management for Cancer. Therefore, the FDA premarket approval (PMA) and de novo databases have been searched for new approved products between 2011 and 2015. The 510(k) clearance has not been considered as this refers to products \"substantiall y equivalent\" to others already on the market. In this case, unlike the 13 Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) ) has completed the acquisition of Covidien plc (NYSE: COV) in 2015 14 Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT) has completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc.

In addition to the FDA database s, we also searched the EuroScan Database. In Europe there is not an equivalent of the FDA online databases for new approved devices. We therefore relied on the EuroScan database. EuroScan is the International Information Network on New and Emerging Health Technologies, a collaborative network of member HTA agencies for the exchange of information on important emerging new drugs, devices, procedures, programmes, and settings in health care. Many European HTA agencies are members of the network (e.g. Agenas from Italy, NIHR Horizon Scanning Centre from UK, Osteba from Spain, SBU from Sweden etc.). As for the FDA databases, the search has been performed according to indication in the five NCD areas. Where results were generated, we report results in relation to the associated companies. 2.7.1.

Between 2011 and 2015, a total of 346 clinical trials have been conducted for NCD, for cancer corresponding to 4.62% of the total (16 clinica l trials). The company Covidien has developed more clinical trials that are applied in breast cancer and bone cancer, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, most companies in the sector had not developed any cancer relevant medical devices. Very few companies had produced research outputs in terms of scientific papers. Novartis was responsible for the overwhelming majority of papers (65.3%) with Jansen Pharmaceutical claiming a 8.0% share, Johnson and Johnson 6.4% and Siemens 5.2%. Investm ent in research and development is a key industry activity across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. Throughout the 20th century, the pharmaceutical industry has played a significant and indispensable role in the advancement of science through t he production and publication of high quality research ( Nairn and Rozek 1988, 139 )16. Where conventional wisdom would suggest that pharmaceutical companies primarily invest in developmental and applied research in order to advance their economic interest s; and where commonplace thinking would suggest that both the industry and wider society is dependent on blue sky scientific research undertaken in a predominantly academic environment; analysts have, and for some time, cast doubts on these ideas, finding that industry investments have contributed significantly to the vast body of scientific research in the public domain, which has guided and influenced researchers everywhere ( Koenig 1983; Nairn and Rozek 1988 )15,16. Measuring the quality and quantity of in dustry published research in mainstream scientific journals, analysts have found that industry investment in R&D has contributed significantly to advancement of broad based scientific research and the general public welfare ( Nairn and Rozek 1988, 139 ) 16. Today, however, sentiments are changing. While investment in R&D remains a principal activity of industry, the larger scientific paradigms under which R&D activities are conducted has undergone a tectonic shift. In the 21st century, however, following t he successful the mapping of the human genome, new pharmaceutical technologies are now created at the nexus of a number of intertwined disciplines: bio -pharmacology, chemistry, nanotechnology, and computational sciences ( Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105 )17. Today, drug discovery is about managing complex information that derives from a variety of disciplines, all of which exist outside the walls of the traditional pharmaceutical firm. In the twenty -first century, large pharmaceutical companies are increasi ngly forming research consortia to manage and exploit new forms of data that have arisen from parallel advances in molecular biology, nanotechnology, super -computing, statistical analysis and data management (Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105 )17. Actually, drug research is a high -risk and time -consuming process. Only 1 out of every 5000 -10,000 compounds screened becomes an approved drug. Today, it takes an average of 10 to 15 years at an average cost of more than US$1 billion to develop a successful medici ne (Merck 2015)6. Significant can losses occur where outputs are dependent of research interaction at the interface of various disciplines, and where there is no guarantee that new compounds will advance to clinical trials. 15 Koenig, Micha el E.D. (1983) \"A bibliometric analysis of pharmaceutical research\", Research Policy 12: 15 -36 16 Narin, Francis and Richard P. Rozek (1988) Bibliometric Analysis of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry research performance\", Research Policy 17: 139 -154. 17 Allarakhia, Minna and Steven Walsh (2011) \"Managing knowledge assets under conditions of radical change: The case of the Pharmaceutical industry\", Technovation 31: 105 -117. Critical Appraisal Cancer 91 Today, the increased possibili ty of R&D failure is one of the main factors in the raised estimates of the costs per new molecular entity (NME), on the basis which analysts now question whether industry is in the grip of an R&D productivity crisis ( Cockburn, 2006, Pammolli et al., 2011 )4,,5. In past, analysts lauded the contribution of industry to the advancement of science and medical technologies. Today, however, where they measure productivity in terms of the ratio of the \"output\" of a process to some measure of the \"inputs\", like r ising R&D expenditures and falling or static counts of new drug approvals, they have identified a sharp decline in research productivity over the past decade ( Cockburn 2007, 1 )7. Today, the pharmaceutical industry is in the grip of major systematic change. In response to the rapidly changing environment, industry has implemented conservative management practices for the purpose of increasingly the predictability of drug discovery and the sustainability of returns on capital investment in R&D. A consequenc e, investments in R&D produce NMEs that are, at best, only marginally better than existing therapies, thereby stifling innovation and amplifying a sense of crisis across the industry ( Munos and Chin 2011, 1 )18. For the future, analysts fear that unless industry ceases to pursue \"safe\" risk -averse management strategies, unless it adopts more collaborative approaches to knowledge creation and costs sharing, few breakthroughs will reach patients and sufferers of disease ( Munos and Chin 2011, 1 )18. Indeed, ana lysts counsel that sustainability and risk aversion did not characterise the breadth of vision shown by the industry's early pioneers. In the twenty first century, however, the entrepreneurial model is gone. The industry must find new means by which to r espond to unmet need, particularly in the area of NCDs. 18 Munos, Bernard H. and William W. Chin (2011) \"How to Revive Breakthrough Innovation i n the Pharmaceutical Industry\", Science Translation Medicine 3 (89): 1 - 3 Critical Appraisal Cancer 92 3 Stakeholder Interviews: Cancer Cancer affects all of humankind, but there are marked differences across local, national, and regional boundaries, particularly when considering specific tumour types rather than cancer as a whole. Epidemiological data on incidence of cancer and deaths caused by cancer vary enormously in coverage and quality between countries and regions worldwide (IARC, 2014 )19. The high -resource countries have the highest incidence of cancer and also provide the best services for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The highest prevalence proportions of cancer also occur in these populations. The most common cancers include lung, breast, prostate, and colorect al cancers. In countries in epidemiological transition, these cancers are increasingly common but incidence of stomach, oesophageal, and liver cancers remains high. Data from low -resource countries show that cervical cancer is still often the most common c ancer among women (IARC, 2014 ) 19. In low -and-middle -resource countries, incidence of particular tumours may be relatively low, but corresponding mortality data often reflect late -stage diagnosis as the norm and consequently poor clinical outcomes. World wide, differences in cancer incidence have been recognized for more than half a century as indicating different causes and, by inference, different opportunit ies for prevention. For governments around the world, the prevention and management of Cancer is a n important public health issue for the future (IARC, 2014 )19. Across Europe, policy -makers are engaged in funding research for developing interventions and prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of Cancer before they require a public health respons e. There are a total of 136 Research Funding Organizations (RFOs) investing in Cancer research. These RFOs display major divergences. Indeed, despite the majority of public funding in cancer research being concentrated in public funding organizations (41% public and 7% private -public sectors), each country has its own funding system. Research systems are generally complex, with some common features depending on the European area: Eastern Europe is characterized by a single funding source (100% of the RFOs are from the public sector; other sectors do not exist), while in Northern Europe charitable and voluntary sectors are the main active funders of cancer research. A more balanced situation is observed in Southern and Central Europe, where all types or fund ing organizations and funding sources are active. The Problem for Policy Makers EU MSs face diverse challenges with regard to Cancer: the prevalence of NCD risk factors varies considerably across Europe and national policy agendas and research activities also vary. As a result, MAPPING_NCDs aims to map current Cancer research funding and impact across the EU with a view to improving returns on investment. Mapping Cancer research investment and associated research impacts holds a potential to identify ove rlaps, synergies, gaps and also opportunities for policy learning, exchange and collaboration across the EU. This mapping exercise is complicated and involves the use of multifarious research techniques and databases, from the direct survey of RFOs to we b based queries, literature review and bibliometric analysis. Indeed, responding to the challenge Cancer present, European policy makers will need to consider a number of means and strategies to redress their impact. For example, effective medical devices and pharmaceuticals are essential for treatment and diagnosis. Financial incentives are also a means for improving the management of NCDs by targeting certain goals, processes and 19 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). World Cancer Report 2014. Lyon, 2014. IARC/WHO Critical Appraisal Cancer 93 outcomes. Moreover, Cancer patients often suffer from multiple co -morbiditie s. The management and treatment of Cancer requires multi -provider settings and integrated strategies. Policymakers need to consider improved information technology for the purposes of sharing data and information between care settings and to ensure qualit y control. In addition, they might also consider developing mechanisms for evaluating NCD management, and using health technology assessment (HTA) institutions to supporting policy -making and decision -making. In addition, however, policy makers need to co nsider stakeholder motivation to improve outcomes for patients with Cancer. New strategies and funding initiatives must, to some extent, align with the scientific, clinical and economic priorities and interests of leaders in the field of Cancer research. Semi -Structured Interviews While accurate mapping of Cancer research via surveys and bibliometrics can assist government in identifying the most fruitful approaches to making research investments; policy makers must also take account of the often strong visions and firm priorities of leaders in the field of Cancer research. To this end, MAPPING_NCDS involves the conduct of semi -structured interviews as a means for eliciting the preferences and opinions of key Cancer stakeholders. The project opens a dia logue with Cancer researchers on the basis that qualitative interviews hold the potential to develop wider theory for mapping of Cancer research funding with a view to improving the relevance, efficiency and impact of Cancer research ( Wright et al 2014 )20. Stakeholders are located at various points of the Cancer research funding process. As a result, MAPPING_NCDs opens a dia logue at these manifold points. Typically, Cancer funding originates from a variety of sources: national governments (European Union M ember States), international organizations with regional or global reach (OECD, WHO Regional Office for Europe, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations), the private sector (pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industry), charit ies (European Diabetes Foundation, Macmillan Cancer, World Cancer Research Fund), non -governmental organizations (United Nations Children's Fund, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and, importantly, supranational organizations (European I nvestment Bank, Council of Europe, The European Commission) as well as public -private partnerships (e.g. the Innovative Medicines Initiative). Funding can either be directly associated with NCD research or flow indirectly into NCD research via overall bud gets (i.e. hospital budgets). In this way, national governments play an important role in encouraging and fostering research in innovation, including direct governance for key research areas and indirect mechanisms for incentivizing NCD research. At each of these points, the project makes contact with stakeholders, seeking their views on both the current and future state of funding for Cancer research. Interviews provide opportunity to develop hypotheses about the future shape of Cancer research funding . Enabling close collaboration between the researchers and stakeholders, interviews allow stakeholders to describe their views of the current state of Cancer research and to improve researcher's understandings of the key factors influencing the shape of Cancer research. Interviews hold the capacity to answer the 'how' and 'why' of Cancer research funding, allowing researchers to understand how funding activities are influenced by the contexts in which they are embedded (Baxter and Jack, 2008 )21. Interviews improve the quality of the mapping exercise providing 20 John S.F. Wright, Paul G.

Ultimately, th e purpose of the stakeholder interviews is to open a sophisticated and collaborative dialogue between policy makers and key personnel involved in the conduct of Cancer research with a view to producing a more nuanced map of Cancer research funding and heig htening the potential for improving the state of Cancer research funding in the future. 3.1 Methods The aim to be achieved with the interviews is to gather opinions and information of the major policy makers, researchers, leaders of the past, present and future strategies in cancer research funding. For this purpose, a systematic process is followed for selecting interviewed (Researchers/ stakeholders), conducting the interview, and subsequent qualitati ve analysis of the data obtained. The methods used have been described elsewhere (Allen et al. 201022; Dempster, Woods, and Wright 201323). Stakeholders were purposively selected to reflect a range of factors including: expertise in cancer research, geographic location and expertise in awarding research funding. For all stakeholders, interview questions explored (1)current threads of research; (2) future research areas; (3) types of collaborations; (4) working with collaborators; (5) working with the private sector ; (6) types of funding organizations; (7) working with funding organizations; (8) future strategies for funding NCD research. We identified 57 experts, outstanding in the field of cancer research in their origin countries (Austria, France, L uxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Norwey, Bulgary, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus, Italy, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, Lithuania, Swiss ). Besides to researchers from international level or ganizations (WHO, IARC, WCRF). Finally, nine leading experts agreed to participat e and conduct interviews (Table lxx ), seven of them preferred to answer by telephone, except two who chose to answer the questions written.

The total duration was 3h 1min 6s, with an average of 26 minutes per interview. All interviews were recorded and transcribed . Consent was gained for all interview subjects and their anonymity . 3.2 Results 3.2.1. Impacts of funding strategies for cancer This study analyses the effects that funding strategies on cancer have on the society and knowledge in an effort to improve research programmes on cancer and enhance cancer control. In the main, researchers find funding very complex and limited. They hold that most funding focuses on basic research which although it has an impact in the academic research of Europe, it also lim its \"our capacity to compete with US where money from government and other sources is available for conducting academic clinical trials trying to answer strategic questions, instead of questions linked to drugs\". Researchers are concerned about lack of fun ding for independent clinical studies. They also resent the lack of funding for multi -national projects. On one hand, it is difficult to conduct a trial with subjects from just one country, and yet funding possibilities are mainly national and employ no money for central coordination. \"They are usually ok for giving money for national patients involved in the study but not for patients outside their country and not to central coordination\". Researchers demand easing the heavy administrative burden. They defend the simplicity and political support of Europe Against Cancer Programme (including publication Europe Code Against Cancer ), late 1990s, perceived as the most effective programme in \"raising public consciousness and making research money available to help control cancer\", whilst they are critical about the avoidable cumbersome and complicated procedures they need to go through when applying for funding on cancer research, not always balanced and sometimes leading to a waste of effort since \"the invest ment of your effort, against the probability of success is too disproportionate to make it valuable\". Whilst they are pleased to learn that the EU is willing to improve cancer control, they question whether \"the mechanisms that the European Union uses are necessarily the most efficient or the most effective\" to achieve this goal. In addition, they hold that the European multi -centred approach of cancer research efforts imposes too much bureaucratic work on the coordination team and \"take up a lot of time o f researchers that could be better spent doing research\". For some researchers, impact of research is difficult to quantify, especially for fundamental research, and are currently trying to move towards clinical research. \"One of the difficulties is usual ly funding research with multiple grounds and so it's difficult to measure the impact of our findings amongst lots of different findings, but in clinical trials we usually have much bigger impacts in terms of findings so it's easier\". Where as for others, q uantifying impact is relatively easy. Clinical trials are registered under the EU Clinical Trials Register which allows you to search for protocol and results information, not only for interventional clinical trials that are conducted in the European Union and the European Economic Area but also for those conducted outside this area that are linked to European paediatric -medicine development. In addition, impact and relevance of scientific research can be measured by the number of published issues. Yet, the y hold \"since the first publication of the Critical Appraisal Cancer 96 Clinical Trials Directive, there have been several publications showing the enormous decrease of academic clinical trials or academic studies all over Europe\". According to one of the researchers, significant fun ding has been put on cancer programmes in Europe over the past decade, both at European level and at the national level and has had a positive impact on therapeutic cancer. \"The impact has definitely gone towards the direction of personalised therapy for c ancer, towards the genetic and epigenetic characterisation of cancer\" . Stakeholders believe that the major contribution has been promoting international research network structures. \"Building real networks of different researchers of different countries and different situations, as well as making possible to build research infrastructure at the European level\". Assessing different countries from different settings, at different risks for papillomavirus, for example, on a more effective use of the vaccination is a very positive impact of the strategies for cancer. Translational research is an important re -structuring effort \"delivering the results of research faster to the clinic\". Besides the classic \"it's usually too short\" or \"the continuity of the programmes receiving funding could sometimes be threatened by the fact that programmes are for two years, three years...\" stakeholders do not think that research funding programmes can have a negative impact. RFOs repo rt huge positive impacts \"in terms of understanding the cell biology of cancer and of tumours\", whereas they consider that care must be taken to make sure that programmes implemented are effective and carried out for the direct benefit of patients, holding \"there has been an increased potential to identify markers of cancer with pressure to develop screening programmes that may be premature\" which sometimes leads to a negative impact since the benefits of screening not always outweigh the risks. 3.2.2 Ch allenges Indeed, one of the basic problems researchers state to be facing is the lack of funding. Thus, one of the main challenges for them is \"to maintain the same level of funding or increase it\" which seems very hard to achieve in this difficult econo mic climate. Similarly, there is a concern for the lack of dedicated calls for cancer research. \"Current call topics are very broad... There is going to be a tremendous competition between cancer and other therapeutic areas with no anticipated, expected, dedicated funding for cancer research\". One researcher was critical that the European Union priorities for funding research initiatives \"are not necessarily correct\", claiming that the billion Euros spent on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (Europe's largest public -private initiative between the European Union and the European Federation of the Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, aiming to speed up better medicines to patients) \"could have been spent more wisely in other forms of research, not necessarily cancer but including cancer... I think the pharmaceutical industry was perfectly able to deliver their drugs on their own\", on the grounds of the huge profits the pharmaceutical industry makes. The need for independent sources of funding is a lways a cause of concern. \"We had to go to the industry to be able to actually complete the project... And when you are in a consortium that has several commercial partners, then of course you will get into difficult intellectual property rights discussio ns and also you will necessarily have to do some compromise... It is not the best way we wanted but it was the only way to finish the project\" Critical Appraisal Cancer 97 Information is crucial in cancer control and data resources are therefore considered by all researchers intervi ewed to be one of the biggest challenges to cancer research in Europe, and also a serious threat to medical research in general if amendments proposed to the European General Data Protection Regulation (which include a requirement for specific consent for the use and storage of personal data) become law. \"It would disable cancer research, it would disable public health research, and I cannot understand how the EU can let this happen, unless it is blind\". Cancer regulation is the first essential element for improving cancer control. \"We know how many cases there are each year of each type of cancer across Europe, what the mortality is, what the levels of survival are and how they are changing with time, between cancers, between sexes, between countries and ov er time. All of that comes from cancer registration, yet the current draft regulation would disable cancer registries\". Just the EUROCARE -6 study, call for data, would require seeking the consent of 10 million cancer patients across Europe. \"I just don't u nderstand how the European Union can be so dissociated that it sets up a cancer information centre in Italy, at the Joint Research Centre, to collect all this information from cancer registries and to use it productively to drive European cancer policies, yet, at the same time as passing - by 621 votes to 10 - a regulation that would make that very data collection impossible. Does that make any sense? I don't think so\". Whilst researchers believe that a multidisciplinary and multinational approach in cance r is vital, they report a need for harmonisation of procedures among European countries for the storage of human material for research since each country has its own regulations. \"Very frequently we need collection of biological material... The possibility to transport tumour samples from one country to the other is very different from country to country. So, you can imagine the complexity of organising such a study\". Another key issue is handling the Big Data, i.e. storing, analysing, sharing and understa nding the huge quantities of data collected. \"A lot of efforts have been made to sequence lots of tumour genomes so research all over the world has obtained a huge amount of genetic data\". The main concern is \"how to manipulate all these data coming from t he sequencing of the tons and tons of genomes\". There is a real need for IT professionals and specifically in bio -informatics. Challenges identified by stakeholders are similar to those from researchers. An important asset for cancer research is counting on reliable data on cancer incidence. \"Linking bio -bank data with cancer registry data creates new possibilities for translational research\". They, too, are concerned that the new Data Protection legislation will seriously endanger research. \"Especially fo r rare diseases, cross - border research is very important... Too strict data protection regulation may even endanger this\". Stakeholders also state the need for more funding. \"It is more difficult to convince Research Councils of the governments that we n eed more resources for cancer research... Getting funding for clinical research, especially for clinical trials, has become more difficult\". In addition, they highlight the need for making a more efficient use of the research funding available, \"trying to focus the funding on really excellent groups\", asserting that a reasonable strategy would be \"to fund on a long -term basis research infrastructure on a wider perspective... some good research... to offer good advanced statistical support in terms of the d evelopment of new techniques\". There is also a need to exert more efforts to conduct translational research in cancer genetics, to move research from the bench to the bedside, to move genome discoveries into health practice and disease prevention, and to improve early cancer detection. Genetic signature improves the understanding of tumour biology and the development of personalised therapies. \"We are really more at the beginning of this process, of understanding the interaction, so, personalised medicine, personalised cancer research and personalised cancer medicine should be the programme of the future\". For this \"we need epidemiological studies which are also joined up at the European level... Critical Appraisal Cancer 98 Different population groups have different characteristics and it would provide a lot more insights... In the biomedical research you have to think much more long -term... European level is much too focused on short -term innovations and I would like to see a more holistic approach\". This challenge is also common to researchers, as one stated, \"have a comprehensive description of the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity and how this impacts on the response and, in particular, resistance to therapies... necessary to work through collaborative programmes with a considera ble amount of allocation since it would require genetic and epigenetic characterisation\". Building a European solid collaboration for research at different levels is another major challenge for stakeholders, although sometimes difficult \"to go beyond the borders of your own institution, your own group\". Improving cross -border collaboration is also a major challenge of RFOs. Small national studies have their limitations. \"Instead of organising one big European trial, we initiated seven smaller trials, eac h with too small statistical power to detect a survival advantage... The seven European trials have their own individual design in regard to inclusion criteria and criteria for abnormal findings, which makes it difficult to do a met analysis\". RFOs also re sented the lack of a \"funding organisation for researcher initiated cancer research\". Finally, two broad areas identified by RFOs as challenges for future cancer research are to do with prevention. The first one refers to the implementation of effective p olicies to promote behaviours \"to create an environment that is conductive to health... not just permissive but positively conductive\". The second alludes to the identification of key characteristics of tumours \"to allow appropriate and different intervent ions for their management and prevention. However, funding challenges for prevention are perceived as being problematic since \"there isn't and needn't be a pharmacological model and the industrial input into cancer research is not available for prevention research\". 3.2.3 Recommendations Some of the current gaps identified by the researchers are detailed in the foregoing section since what is lacking is perceived as an objective to be achieved in the future. In the main, gaps include mostly: cross -border collaboration, no link between basic and clinical researchers and the patient, gap in translational and clinical research due to lack of independent sources of funding, gap in the validation and clinical implementation of basic research, gap in the regulat ion in terms of homogeneous validation for new health technologies (diagnostic tools, predictive tests, biomarkers...); lack of central coordination for cancer registries, lack of quality of data in some cancer registries, no cancer relapses and metastasis r egistration (\"how can we allocate resources and define the needs of those patients if we don't know how many they are?\"), lack of epidemiological studies in cancer, gap in rare cancers and in child cancers (\"because they don't concern that many people alth ough we have many different rare cancers\"). On the basis of the gaps and challenges mentioned throughout the report, researchers, stakeholders and RFOs interviewed for the purpose of this study suggest the following issues as recommendations for future EC activity on cancer: Prioritise personal cancer medicine (\"We need to understand the tumour microenvironment... understand therapy resistance and the processes around metastasis... will involve developing new tools such as whole -genome sequencing... devel op new biomarkers... new imaging techniques\"). Critical Appraisal Cancer 99 There is a need for independent research on all the new technologies on radiotherapy, surgery and, in particular, in the area of molecular biology. \"Almost every week there are studies published of a new bioma rker and of a new test that is developed but we have no idea on the clinical application\". \"More research is required on new surgical techniques or new methods of delivering radiation\". Provide more funding for academic independent research in general. Establish networks of comprehensive cancer centres throughout Europe. Finance projects in which participation from several countries is encouraged. Invest on multinational research infrastructures \"funding the foundation and implementation phase\". Potentiate strategies such as ERANet programmes, effective to synergise co -funding programmes between the European Commission and the different countries. Promote transnational programmes for the translational and clinical areas of research. Encourage cooperation between basic translational and clinical researchers. \"I think projects that would give priority to that cooperation should be favoured in terms of funding\". Promote larger population -based, observational studies, as opposed to intervention studies . The Council of Europe should \"produce a summary of the risks to cancer information in Europe if the current draft Regulation on Data Transfer is not suitably modified\". Raise awareness to conduct research not for the sake of just publishing but for the im pact that research will have on the treatment and management of cancer. Cooperation with patient advocacy groups (listen to them to understand and address their needs). Develop Europe -wide (not just in the EU) strategies on cancer. Promote NCD research programmes \"to identify new strategies for NCD prevention\". \"It is just a staggering disparity in vision and commitment between communicable and non -communicable disease\", even though communicable disease is responsible for around 1% deaths in Europe, whil st cancer for 20 -29%. Invest more on prevention research rather than at the interface between pharmacological research, cell -based research and health system delivery. Striking a balance between basic science intervention and prevention research \"changin g the behaviours that lead to the risk factors... promoting healthy behaviours\". Improve cancer registries (\"there should be a central coordination of all cancer registries, and they should be homogenous on what we collect). Allocate funding on a European level to enable sharing useful data from national cancer registries databases. \"Most European countries have excellent health registers... diagnostic information linked to hospital admissions and outpatient visits, registration of use of prescribed pharmac euticals\". \"Link data from registries with valuable the conduction of more epidemiological studies \"but I would say not just any kind of epidemiological studies but a correct registry of all cancers, the important data coming from those cancers and the particular case of breast cancer\". Cancer continues to need new treatments. \"I would like to see more funding dedicated to advanced cancer... since it stills kills 100% of cases\". Prioritise child cancers Promote a better use of in vitro and animal models to ensure that every piece of research is relevant to human cancer Devote efforts to identify the mechanisms through which normal cells become abnormal. Support cross -disciplinary research involving basic researchers in epidemiology and cancer biology and in cancer prevention and clinical treatment and care. Ease the heavy administrative burden of procedures for applying for funding for cancer research. Develop and recognise \"health services\" as a field of research. Critical Appraisal Cancer 100 Promote discussions on ethical implication of research. Basically, most interviewees believe that funded research in cancer is not always delivering the best possible results. Partly due to the lack of knowledge (\"Our inability to truly understand the complexity of a cancer c ell and how we can overcome the problem of resistance\") which could be improved by investing more efforts on conducting research that has a clinical application, the bottom -up approach (researcher initiated research) and rigorous peer review for best scien ce. A special mention, not on financing itself but on procedures, is made by one researcher with regards to applications to specific call topics, in particular the previous FP7 but also the current Horizon 2020. Applicants do not receive basically any or not enough feedback on the outcome, and specifically \"the negative outcome of the first stage proposal\", which is perceived as unmotivated. The areas beyond financing in which the EU should be looking at, according to interviewees, include: Engagement of the Patient Organisation, increasing awareness of cancer patients towards new therapies and personalised medicine. Revision of the proposed amendments to Data Protection Regulation because it will have a tremendous negative impact on research. Harmonisation of laws and regulations that affect multinational trials in terms of the transport of tumour and biological samples. Investment of further efforts on the validation of quality of care and even accreditation. Establish networking among foundat ions and a platform for charities to encourage cross -border collaboration. EU should take a leading role to help raise awareness about the importance of supporting cancer research. As for ways in which cancer research may be suffering from a certain degre e of duplication there is a variety of opinions. Whilst some researchers believe that there is indeed duplication due to the complexity of procedures and different regulations among countries (\"it's a nightmare to run multinational projects, people just gi ve up and run smaller projects inside their own country... so you have duplication instead of one large European project\") which could be avoided by enhancing multinational cooperation, by making unified programmes \"to bring together all different actors to walk in the same direction\", by establishing a sort of a \"high level policy funding board\" to encompass funders; others think that duplication is not always a bad thing since research needs to be re -demonstrated \"Sometimes it is important to illustrate tha t a finding is replicable\", and since \"duplication may and should also lead to collaboration between researchers who are interested in the same scientific problem area\". 3.3 Discussion and Conclusion This analysis provides a view about the impact of research funding activities of cancer in the Europe while identifying areas of unmet needs to gain deeper insight of the main challenges that, as suggested by respondents, should be addressed for the future research in this area. With regards to intervention programmes and impacts, it outlines that while significant funding has been devoted to cancer programmes in the last decade, with major contributions made to cancer control, most efforts have been dir ected towards basic research and to interventions at a national level, as opposed to applied research and multinational interventions. It also reveals that several publications show a decrease of academic clinical trials all over Europe. In addition, and d espite the Critical Appraisal Cancer 101 many positive impacts reported in the area of cancer in general and specifically in innovative fields such as tumour biology, it is suggested that care should be taken to ensure that benefits outweigh the risks of the screening procedures and in vasive tests. A current issue which according to respondents needs to be addressed urgently, since it seems to constitute a major threat for the continuity of research, is the issue of the specific consent requirement proposed as an amendment to the Europ ean General Data Protection Regulation which may apparently disable cancer registries and cancer research if approved. Indeed, information is key to cancer research and the raised concerns do seem to have a point there if researchers are to fall inside the duties of this regulation. Another issue that strikes from the interviews is the apparent disparity in allocations between communicable and non -communicable disease, with non -communicable diseases receiving a tiny percentage of funding compared with thei r burden, taking into account that cancer on its own accounts for 20 -29% of deaths in Europe vs. 1% of deaths from communicable diseases, according to data provided by a senior research interviewed. Cancer continues to be a leading cause of death and, con sequently, respondents suggest there is a need for increasing funding for cancer research and prevention programmes in an effort to contribute to an overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality. More specifically, this analysis demonstrates the need for more independent research since, amongst other consequences, commercial partnerships compromise intellectual property rights. Certainly, there has been a generalised recognition of the growing importance of personalised cancer medicine which several respondents considered to be the future of cancer research and, therefore, urge the European Union to prioritise. In conclusion, this analysis reveals the need for strengthening and implementing policies that enhance cancer control efforts across the Euro pean Union. Cancer is a non -communicable disease which encompasses multiple diseases in one and requires data from different population groups with different characteristics to gain a deeper insight and determine the patterns and trends that affect cancer incidence. Cancer requires a multinational and multidisciplinary approach, in particular with regards to rare cancers. To this end, this analysis suggests that the European Union should prioritise research on personalised cancer medicine and direct more ef forts towards the establishment of networks or programmes that encourage solid cross -border collaboration for research at different levels, provide more funding opportunities for independent academic research and for translational research to place latest discoveries into health practice and disease prevention, implement effective policies that promote behaviours that are conductive to health, and, last but not least, implement priorities to protect personal data whilst not hampering research. Critical Appraisal Cancer 102 4 Bibliometrics: Impact of Cancer Research Funding A key aim of MAPPING_NCD s is to establish the impact of funding investment across five key NCD areas: cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer and mental health . In this aim, MAPPING_NCD moves beyond the state of the art in the research area by pursuing bibliometric mapping and analysis of the volume of research outputs in the EU and MSs relevant to these disease areas. Bibliometrics establishes the impact of funding investmen ts by mapping and analyzi ng of the volume , citations, funding sources, influence on clinical guidelines and newspaper stories of research papers and reviews in the Web of Science (WoS) published in EU MSs during the last ten years (2002 -12). Where funded research produces scientific papers, funding is considered to have had 'impact'. Bibliometrics identifies specific impacts associated with individual research papers through citations in other relevant papers. Bibliometrics also checks funding acknowledgm ents in relevant papers . It considers the extent to which they have provided the evidence base for clinical guidelines relevant to various NCDs . And, it also considers the extent to which they are cited in stories about NCD research in newspapers and the broadcast media in MS . In this way, the impact of the paper is associated with the relative values that papers achieve against these measures. 4.1 What is Research Impact? Measuring the impact of research is a complex task. Often, health improvements depend on a host of different research discoveries, which are made at different times and in different places. The pathway from the conduct and publication of research to bett er health is usually indirect. In addition, the results of research contribute to better health in different ways, from the improved diagnosis and treatment of patients to the prevention of illness or the reduction incidence. Figure iv details the manifo ld linkages between research funding and health impacts. Figure iv: Some of the links between research and healthcare improvement Among these many nodes and linkages, 'government policy' occupies a central position and has a several linkages to other n odes. Moreover, the 'reduction of illness incidence' also depends on a large number of inputs, including: environmental pollution, individual health behaviours, wealth, Critical Appraisal Cancer 103 education and the effectiveness of public health campaigns. Thus, it can be observed that research impacts upon all these nodes, many of which are not specific to individual disease areas. Similarly, different types of research can also deliver advances in individual disease areas. And for these reasons, the norms for measuring both the effectiveness of research and its quality can also differ. Nevertheless, all of these nodes are inter -connected . And at connection points, hard evidence of research impact necessarily accumulates. In the main, the evidence of research impact manifests itself in the paper trails that flow between one node and another. For example, research funding produces research, which produces papers in scientific journals, which in turn lead to citations in other journals , decision making influence, policy, media st ories and even the allocation of additional research grants. Tracking and analyzing these paper trails, using them as a proxy for research impact, is the fundamental business of bibliometic research. In this section of the paper, we utilize bibliometric m ethods to analyses data that accumulates at five of these nodes along the many paths to research impact for Cancer. These nodes are : Scientific research papers Funding sources (decisions on funding) Citations The evidence base of clinical guidelines; The stories in newspapers and the research papers that they cite. 4.2 Scientific Research Papers: Cancer The first means by which b ibliometric analysis establish es funding impacts is by the number of published scientific papers. This section of the report details the number of downloads papers for Cancer whose details are in the Web of Science (WoS) from 31 European countries (the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) in the 12 years 2002 -13. To this end, bibliometric analysis utilizes two overlapping databases , the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) and also the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI ), for the provision of knowledge on socio -economic impact and behavioral interventions associated with Cance r. The report identifie s by means of a \"filter\" whose precision and recall was determined by means of experts in the subject area marking sets of papers as relevant or not. Filters were developed for each of the five disease areas : Cancer research (oncolo gy): ONCOL Cardiovascular research, research: MENTH, and Respiratory disease research: RESPI Details for each filter were written to five Excel spreadsheets for analysis, which are explaine d in each of the five relevant Critical Appraisal documents. The main analyses were of country outputs, their research levels (from clinical to basic) and for some subject areas, the type of research or disease. Each filter was applied to the Web of Scie nce for the Science Citation Index (extended) - SCI - and for the Social Sciences Citation Index(SSCI), for the twelve years 2002 -13, and articles and reviews only were identified. The papers were also limited to those with at least one address in one or more of the following 31 countries - the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Table lxxi lists the countries with their digraph ISO codes. Critical Appraisal Cancer 104 Table lxx i: List of 31 countries used to limit the downloaded papers ISO Country ISO Country ISO Country ISO Country AT Austria EE Estonia IS Iceland PL Poland BE Belgium ES Spain IT Italy PT Portugal BG Bulgaria FI Finland LT Lithuania RO Romania CH Switzerland FR France LU Luxembourg SE Sweden CY Cyprus GR Greece LV Latvia SI Slovenia CZ Czech Rep. HR Croatia MT Malta SK Slovakia DE Germany HU Hungary NL Netherlands UK United Kingdom DK Denmark IE Ireland NO Norway The \"full record\", which includes all addresses, e -mails and funding details (where given) were then downloaded to a series of 12 \"year\" files, 500 papers at a time These were then processed by a special macro to produce one combined Excel spreadsheet. The 12 separate spreadsheets were then combined together to make a single sheet. This contained 2 82,055 papers. Each paper in the combined sheet was given an individual index number, and the following parameters were recorded: Names of all authors, in the format SMITH -AB Paper title Source (journal name, year, volume, issue, pages) Journal name Docume nt type (article or review) Addresses (all in upper case, separated by a forward slash). Note: in the WoS UK papers are attributed separately to ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND or NORTH -IRELAND. Country of publication Year of publication Month of publication (for most papers where the date of the journal was given) Language (almost all were in English) E-mail address(es) of corresponding author, sometimes others Funders, FU (for late 2008 papers and subsequently) Funding acknowledgement text, FX Composite list of authors and their individual addresses (from 2008) Authors' full names (where given), in the format Wilhelm, Hans; Wanke, Isabel; Hirche, Herbert (this allows the sex of most of the authors to be determined) Whether in the SCI or SSCI only Although mos t papers in the WoS have their chosen keywords and formal abstracts, these were not recorded in the main spreadsheet as they would have made it far too cumbersome. From the paper title, a macro was applied to determine if the paper could be classed as \"cl inical \" or \"basic\" or \"both\", according to the presence of one or more words on two lists, see Lewison and Paraje, 200424. The research level of the journal in which the paper was published was also determined 24 Lewison, G & Paraje, G (2004) The classification of biomedical journals by research level. Scientometrics,60(2) , 145 -157. Critical Appraisal Cancer 105 from a master list, based on the same scheme; clinical journals were classed as RL = 1 and basic ones as RL = 4, and ones in between were given an RL value as a decimal number between 1.0 and 4.0. These RL values were determined for groups of five years, 2000 -04, 2005 -09 and 2010 -14. In order to mea sure the impact of C ancer , a specialized ONCOL filter was created. This filter, consisted of two main parts: a list of specialist journals and another list of title words. The filter was first developed in consultation with Cancer Research UK, a leading charity, for the Science Citation Index on CD -ROM. It has since been extensively modified to make it apply to the Web of Science (WoS) with its different interface and software, and to take account of the additional journals covered by the WoS, and ones a dded recently. It has also been amended to include newly - discovered genes that predispose a person to cancer, and new medicines. The list of title words also includes the names of a large number of cancers. The filter was calibrated with reference to thr ee sets of papers taken from the WoS: ones captured by the filter (or not) and ones whose addresses included (or did not include) department names (and their contracted forms) characteristic of cancer such as CANC, ONCOL, ONKOL, and TUMOR. Set A were paper s identified by the filter AND having one or more cancer words in their address field; Set B were papers out with the filter but with one or more cancer words in their address field; Set C were papers identified by the filter but without a cancer address w ord. The number of papers in each of these three sets in a given year in the WoS was then designated as N. Samples of all three sets of paper details were downloaded to a spreadsheet and presented to one of the NCD mapping partners to mark as relevant to cancer research (1) or not relevant (0). Shading of the marks with a decimal between 0 and 1 was also possible. These markings were used to determine the numbers of papers retrieved by the filter that were deemed to be relevant, and by rule-of-three, the estimated number in set D (not found by the filter and without a cancer address word). Table lxxii, below, shows the calculations. Table lxxii . Example of calculations used to determine the precision (p) and recall (r) of the ONCOL filter.

This was an iterative process, and several rounds were needed, with successive sets of papers being marked by the Andalusian School of Public Health. The final values of precision and recall were p = 0.95 and r = 0.98 . Critical Appraisal Cancer 106 Cancer is one of the biggest NCD research areas.

The mean citation score varies by a factor of more than two for the extremes of the cancer sites (leukaemia, colorectal, breast = 17.9; gallbladder = 7.6) and by almost two for the extremes of the types of research (prognosis = 20.3; surgery = 11.5). In fact, the ACI value is positively correlated with the size of the research community, or at least the number of papers, with r2 = 0.56 for the 22 cancer sites, and r2 = 0.33 for the 11 types of research. The analysis began with a comparison of the European and world outputs in cancer research, and the determination of how much biomedical research was accounted for by oncology. For this purpose, It has been used a previously -developed filter based on biomedical address words, such as: an*esthe*, biophys, Cilag, dermatol*, epidem*, family, Genentech, hlth*, which was found to give good d iscrimination between biomedical and non -biomedical papers in journals such as Nature and Science, and to provide virtually complete coverage of most biomedical journals. Table lxxvii shows the world outputs of biomedical research papers and ones in oncol ogy, with the output of the 31 European countries as a group (integer counts) in biomedical research. Table lxxvii : Biomedical research outputs from the world and from the EUR31 country group (integer count), and the corresponding outputs in oncology. BIOMED ONCOL ONCOL/BIOMED, % Year World EUR31 EUR World EUR31 2002 2008 12.2 11.8 2009 83025 12.9 665225 256864 38.6 87968 29414 33.4 13.2 11.5 So the European group of nations has diminished its presence more in cancer research (from 41% of the world to 33%) than in biomedical research overall (from 43% to 39%). The reduction is primarily because of the rise in output of China and other Asian nations such as South Korea, Taiwan and India. Cancer research represents just over one ninth of all European biomedical research output, but one eighth of world biomedical output. The addresses on each of the 282,055 ONCOL papers were analysed by means o f a special macro to give both the integer and the fractional count of countries on each. For example, a paper with two French and one German address would be classed as FR = 1 and DE = 1 on an integer count basis, and as FR = 0.67 and DE = 0.33 on a frac tional count basis. The latter was used for most of the analysis as it gives a much better impression of the amount of effort contributed by each country, particularly to highly collaborative international papers where the contribution of a given country may be quite small. Since we wished to investigate the extent and nature of international collaboration, we recorded not only the presence of the 31 countries in Table lxxi as fractional counts, but also that of 11 other major countries with who European c ountries may be expected to collaborate. They were among those with the largest foreign contributions to the fractional count totals, but this ranking varied somewhat by year (and by subject area). The additional countries were as in Table lxxviii. Tabl e lxxviii . List of 11 countries whose fractional contribution to each paper was also recorded.

For each of the original 31 countries, it has been determined the integer and fractional count totals, and the numbers in each of the 12 years; and also has been d etermined the annual average percentage growth rate (AAPG) based on fractional counts. [This was obtained from a plot of the logarithm of the number of papers each year.] Table lxxv lists the results for ONCOL papers, with the total integer and fractiona l counts, the percentage of the foreign contribution and the annual average percentage growth rate. Since research output tends to be correlated with Gross National Product (rather than simply with population), we have plotted the countries' fractional pa per counts against GDP for a representative year (Figure xi).

It is also expected that researchers in the scientifically larger countries (e.g., UK, Germany) would find it easier to work with a partner within the country that provided complementary expertise than researchers from small countries (e.g., Estonia, Ireland) and would therefore tend to collaborate less internationally. However it might expect that international transnational links would be much weaker for the Member States in eastern Europe, and so Figure xi has been plotted to show if this is the case.

The data are provided both as different - sized rectangles within a square rep resenting a country's (or region's, or the whole world's) total disease burden, and they can also be downloaded to file. This has been done for the 31 countries of the European region, and for the disease areas relevant to this study; the data selected we re for all ages and both sexes. They are in the form of percent of total DALYs for the country, and were then multiplied by the DALY total to give the DALYs for each disease and country. These could then be added to give the total for the EUR31 region, a nd the pattern of disease burden for each country compared with the European average. For some diseases, the differences were not great, but for others there were big variations in relative burden between countries. For cancer, data were provided on some 24 different manifestations, not all of which corresponded to our analysis of sites (see Table lxxxi above). However DALYs were given for all 13 of the sites listed in the columns of Table lxxxi, and the percentages of total DALYs (all disease areas) for the 18 countries are shown in Table lxxxii. 4.3 Funding Sources The funding of research is now recognised as an important source of information for its evaluation (Lewison & Dawson, 199826; et al., 201030; Rigby, 201331). At its simplest, the acknowledgement of a funding source on a paper indicates that an agency, usually an external one, has reviewed the research project and judged that it is worthy of support. Mul tiple funding sources would indicate that the project has found favour in several places. In the past, the recording of the funding sources on a paper was a labour -intensive task as each paper needed to be inspected individually, usually in a big library. It was, however, worthwhile if the work could serve to provide many different funding bodies with a tally of papers that they had supported. This was the principle behind the creation of the Wellcome Trust's Research Outputs Database ( Jeschin et al, 199532; Dawson et al., 199833; Webster, 200534). This covered all UK biomedical papers over the 14 years, 1988 -2001, and was based on the papers in the Science Citation Index on CD -ROM, which was purchased from the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia (now Thomson Reuters) and operated under license from them. The data were made available to members of the \"ROD club\", who paid a graduated annual fee and in return received a list of their papers, together with access to consultancy advice. 26Lewison G, Dawson G.

Critical Appraisal Cancer 116 Since the introduction of the Science Citation Index, the facilities available for searching and for retrieving data have been steadily enhanced. During 2008, Thomson Reuters started to provide details of funding for individual papers - quite likely stimu lated by the earlier existence of the ROD! There are two individually searchable fields, FO = funding organization and FT = funding text. The FO field lists the names of the acknowledged funders and FT gives the full text of the acknowledgement, includin g recognition of individuals who have helped with the research. For some funding bodies, the FO field also lists the grant numbers, although they are often absent and have not been considered in this analysis. Authors of papers record their funding acknow ledgements in a wide variety of ways . Many papers had multiple funding acknowledgements35. In order to determine the funding sources for RESPI and the four other disease areas, it was therefore decided to use a coding system, with four parts: a trigraph (t hree character) code designating the individual funding body; a single letter code showing the form of support (no longer used); a digraph (two character) code designating the sector and sub -sector of the funder; and another digraph showing the country of the funder based on the ISO codes. The trigraphs were designed to be easily memorable, e.g., MRC = UK Medical Research Council; BHF = British Heart Foundation, although it turned out that there were so many different funders of UK research papers that m any had to be given odd combinations of letters36. It also became apparent that some papers did not carry an acknowledgement because they had been supported internally - in a government lab (such as one supported by a research council or Government departme nt), by a collecting charity, or by a commercial company. So the decision was made to include these \"implicit\" acknowledgements along with the \"explicit\" ones in the acknowledgement paragraph to form a composite acknowledgement37. In principle , the researc h described in all published papers has to be paid for in some way . In practice, however, there are many papers (especially ones describing clinical work) that do not contain any formal acknowledgement. In any case, m ost of their authors would be academ ics or medical personnel working in a hospital or clinic, supported by general university funds or by salary support from the health service. But such support would not be peer -reviewed, and so such papers would perhaps be of a lower standard. For these reasons , it did not seem appropriate to record this nominal support, and the ROD was set up to record such papers as \"unfunded\", and the hospital or university or research institute address was not given a code. However, if a specific acknowledgement appe ared to a university or department, or to a hospital, then it was presumed that some system of grants was in place and the contribution of the employing organisation WAS recorded with a code. This gave rise to three sub -sectors of the private -non-profit s ector, namely HT = hospital trustees, MI = academic38 and NP = other non -profit. The other two were CH = collecting charity and FO = endowed foundation. The methodology used to extract funding information for papers whose details were downloaded from the W eb of Science (WoS) was the same across the five disease areas. The basic principle used was to assign a three -part code to each funding body, with a three -letter code to identify it uniquely, 35 There are also acknowledgements to individuals who have provided help or advice. These are not considered further in this report. 36 Initially, every UK research funder was given an individual trigraph in order to cater for the possibility that it would become a ROD member, although membership seldom rose above 30. 37 Several of the ROD members maintained their own labs and also gave external research grants and this system allowed them to compare their respective outputs. 38 This term was used because many universities and colleges are both endowed with capital and are still collecting money ( e.g., from their alumni). Critical Appraisal Cancer 117 a two -character code to identify the sector and sub -sector, an d another two -character code to identify the ISO designation. Codes were assigned to each funding body listed in the FO = funding organisation section of the WoS, subject to redaction if they were mentioned in a conflict of interest statement only as havi ng paid for unrelated work. Codes were also assigned where there was an acknowledgement implicit from one (or more) of the addresses - a government department or agency, the laboratory of a collecting charity, or of an industrial company. Once codes were assigned to each funding body, they were collected and written to two thesauruses for future use. The spreadsheet of papers was then completed with the explicit and implicit codes by means of a special macro, which also combined the codes into a single co lumn. Another macro determined the division of funders by main sector for each European country (own government including local and regional authorities; own private -non-profit (PNP), industry, international, and other). These were doubly fractionated: t o allow for the fractional presence of the target country on each paper, and to allow for the total number of funders on a paper. The commercial sector was divided up into five sub -sectors, with companies divided into three: pharmaceutical, biotech and ind ustrial. The first and third of these were further divided into independent and subsidiary. The purpose was to distinguish between the research activities of UK subsidiaries of large multi -national companies which might be relatively independent of the p arent, e.g., the Merck Neuroscience Park in Harlow, which did its own research and also gave funding to universities. However there were many takeovers of small biotech (and not so small pharma) companies and it seemed appropriate to regard the takeover a s a way in which the new parent company would thereby gain the intellectual property of the new acquisition. This meant that many of the commercial codes became out -of-date. This had two consequences for the analysis of funding sources. First, the count ry of a company was effectively undefined, and second, the sub -sector could change when a biotech company had brought a new drug to market and had so become a pharma company. The public sector was divided into three sub -sectors: government department (cont rolled by ministers), government agency (nominally independent of ministerial directives) and local authorities (including regions, counties and cities). They were given sectoral codes: GD, GA and LA, respectively. Although the latter form of support har dly exists in the UK, it is becoming increasingly common in several continental European countries (L\u00e4nder in Germany, r\u00e9gions in France, provinces in Spain) and also in North America (provinces in Canada and states in the USA) and in Australia (states and territories). Most of these regions have been given their own trigraphs, although some smaller regions have generic codes, see below. Because of international collaboration on biomedical research papers, many of the UK papers covered in the ROD also had foreign partners and acknowledgements to foreign funding sources. The thesaurus soon began to run out of trigraph codes, and we started to use \"generic\" codes for the smaller organisations (in terms of their biomedical research spend). These consisted of a single letter (X, Y or Z) followed by one digit (to designate the country) and another to designate the sector and sub -sector. Individual countries that supported a lot of biomedical research were given their own digraph (e.g, X1 = USA); others were gi ven one that showed their continent. There is, of course, some redundancy as the country and sector/sub -sector are also given by the second and third digraphs, but these are needed for the main analyses. For example, X1B -BT-US indicates a US biotechnolog y company in two ways. Generic codes for the UK were not used initially, but have been introduced to cater for the large number of new British funding bodies, and codes UK1, UK2 etc. are employed.

These trigraphs, and the associated sectoral and country codes, were assembled into a large thesaurus of funding bodies. The thesaurus is structured so that the different names and formats given to a funding body (and in some cases its dependent agencies, bodies or companies) are all listed to facilitat e the allocation of codes. At the time of writing, there were 17,485 entries and 10,045 (out of a possible 17,576) individual letter trigraphs. This suggests that there is still plenty of opportunity for new codes, but it is often difficult to find appro priate letter combinations for new organisations with many funded papers. These are appearing in continental European countries as work on the project develops, because the thesaurus was originally developed mainly for UK funding bodies. Critical Appraisal Cancer 119 4.4 Cancer: Fundi ng Sources Not information from KINGS College until the end of July. 4.5 Citations of Research Papers Bibliometric analysis uses citation scores to measure of the impact of research papers. For most NCDs, European research was better cited than the world average, although there was much variation between countries. Interestingly, there was generally poor correlation between the burden from particular diseases and the amount of research. In this case, there may be grounds for re-balancing some natio nal research portfolios. The 11 defined research types, listed in Table lxxiv was defined by means of title words and journal name strings, selected by Professor Richard Sullivan of KCL. They generated different numbers of papers, as described in the firs t report, with genetics giving the most (48,259 or 17.1%), followed by chemotherapy (28,240 papers or 10.0%), prognosis (27,189 papers or 9.6%) and surgery (26,585 papers or 9.4%). Figure xiii shows the distribution of research levels on the same basis as Figure xiv. 1.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 GENE none j Figure xiii: Chart of mean Research Level of papers and of journals in which they were published for ONCOL papers of 11 research types. RL = 1.0 is clinical observation; RL = 4.0 is basic research. 5-yr cites per paper Figure xiv: Chart of mean five -year ci tes for ONCOL papers of 11 research types published in 2002 -09. As the ONCOL papers for each of the first eight years were identified, their citation scores were found on the WoS and downloaded as a series of Excel files. These were then concatenated and modified by means of another special macro so that the source was in exactly the same format as the one used for the preparation of the papers spreadsheet. The five -year citation count Critical Appraisal Cancer 120 (designated as Actual Citation Impact, ACI) for each paper was calcula ted (beginning with the year of publication), and this value was then carried across to the papers spreadsheet by means of a look -up function based on paper titles. A few citation scores could not be determined either because the paper title was too long (> 255 characters) or contained quote marks. For these papers, the source was used as the look -up field. In order to determine the mean citation score for each country and other citation statistics, the spreadsheet was annotated with 31 additional columns each of which contained the product of the paper's citation score, ACI, with the fractional presence of each country among its addresses. The sum of these products, divided by the fractional count of the country for the relevant years (in the first insta nce, the eight years 2002 -09), then gave the country's citation score on a fractional count basis, which is more appropriate than the score based on integer counts. These individual country scores could then be compared with the ACI values for the EUR31 co untries as a group and those for the world. These were obtained for each year's ONCOL publications directly from the WoS, although the sets of papers needed to be divided into sub -sets, based on journal initial letters, in order that each one should have no more than 10,000 papers, as this is the limit in the WoS for citation reports. Citation scores have been increasing slowly with time, in part because the WoS now covers more journals than previously, and also because authors are expected to be more punc tilious in their acknowledgement of earlier work . Figure v shows the progression in ONCOL ACI scores from 2002 to 2009; the values for intermediate years (2003 -08) for Europe are shown as three -year moving averages in order to smooth out annual fluctuatio ns. The mean score for Europe was slightly below the world average in 2002 -03, but since 2006 it has been slightly higher, probably because of the greatly increased world presence of China, whose papers tend to be less well cited than average. 05101520 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Five-year cites per paper, ACIWorld EUR 31 Figure x v.

[There were actually 5.15% of European papers that achieved this number of citations.] This may be a better measure of how effective a Critical Appraisal Cancer 121 country's research output is because it is normally the most influential papers that are really important to the development of a field.

Another indicator of \"quality\", or more accurately the esteem wi th which a country's researchers are held, is the percentage of reviews ( Lewison, 2009 )39 which are usually invited by journal editors from senior scientists. Figure xvii shows this percentage, with the bars coloured according to the number of reviews published by the country in the 12 -year period. 39 Lewison G (2009) The percentage of reviews in research output: a simple measure of research esteem.

It is perhaps surprising that the five Scandinavian countries score relatively low on this indicator, whereas Greece performs highly and is in the top group, with > 15% of its papers classed as reviews. 4.6 Clinical Guidelines This measure of impact has been used previously both to evaluate the research being cited, and to describe the evidence base for recommendations regarding clinical practice. However, the mere presence of such guidelines is no guarantee that they will be e ffective at improving healthcare (Schrader et al., 2006 )40. The first study, on a small scale, examined the cited papers on a sample of 15 UK clinical guidelines ( Grant et al., 2000 )41. It found that they were very clinical and that UK research was over -cited by 2.5 times. A subsequent study of 43 cancer clinical guidelines in the UK (Lewison et al., 2008 )42 reached similar conclusions, and showed that they could also be used as a means to evaluate research in other countries, for example six Swedish univer sities. This work was subsequently updated ( Pallari and Lewison, 2014 )43 and showed that surgery featured strongly among the cited references (over 25% of the total). It also showed a big variation in whether a country's papers were over - or under -cited r elative to its presence in cancer research. Thus UK research was over -cited by almost four, Danish, Dutch and Swedish research by more than two, but that from the \"accession\" Member States (Poland, Czech Republic and Romania) by half or less. We investiga ted the clinical guidelines currently available in the different European Member States in order to extend the work to other countries. Although many countries had a set of national guidelines, some had regional ones as well, and there were yet others pub lished by European societies of professionals in various branches of medicine. We even learned that in Sweden, each of 40 Schrader M, Weissbach L, Weikert S, Schostak M and Miller K (2006) Paper tigers - Do clinical guidelines improve health care quality in patients with testicular germ cell tumors in Germany? Health Policy , vol 75 (3), pp 338 -346. 41 Grant J, Cottrell R, Clu zeau F and Fawcett G (2000) Evaluating \"payback\" on biomedical research from papers cited in clinical guidelines: applied bibliometric study BMJ 42 Lewison G, Tootell S, Roe P & Sullivan R (2008) How do the media report cancer resear ch? A study of the UK's BBC website. British Journal of Cancer 99, 569 -576 43 Pallari E and Lewison G (2014) Papers cited by cancer clinical guidelines. Poster presented at the 15th COLLNET meeting, Ilmenau, Germany. Critical Appraisal Cancer 123 the 21 counties had their own clinical guidelines. Clearly, it would have been impossible for us to collect the references on all of th ese, and so we decided to limit the study to national guidelines. In the earlier studies on UK guidelines, the identification of the references with papers processed for the Web of Science involved much labour as each one had to be sought individually. It would not have been practical in the scope of this project to continue in this way for guidelines for the other NCDs and for all the other European countries, but we were able to semi -automate the process by means of a visual basic macro, written by Dr Ph ilip Roe of Evaluametrics Ltd. This worked as follows: first, the references section of a guideline in PDF format were copied and pasted to an Excel spreadsheet; second, these were slightly tidied by removal of page numbers, document running heads, etc; and thirdly, the macro was then operated, and it generated sets of search statements, eight at a time, ready for copying and pasting into the search panel of the WoS. An example is given below: ((AU=(Anderson AND Pottier AND Strachan) AND TI=concurrent AN D SO=(T*) AND PY=1992) OR (AU=(Heaney AND Conway AND Kelly AND Johnston AND English AND Stevenson) AND TI=Predictors AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2003) OR (AU=(Martin AND McLennan AND Landau AND Phelan) AND TI=childhood AND SO=(B*) AND PY=1980) OR (AU=Roorda,R AND AND SO=(E*) AND PY=2005) OR (AU=(Dundas AND Chan AND Bridge AND McKenzie) AND TI=bronchodilator AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2005) ) The limit of eight individual papers was set so as to kee p within the limits for the number of terms allowed by the WoS. Author names (AU) up to six in number were given without initials as sometimes they were given incorrectly by the guideline although if there was only one author the first initial was given. [In the WoS, Jones or Jones, A will find papers by Jones, AT but Jones,PR will NOT find papers by Jones, PRT.] The title word (TI) was selected to be the longest in the paper title. The journal name (source, SO) was given by just its initial letter as t he guidelines usually gave an abbreviated name and this would have needed to be substituted by its full name, which would have had to be researched and entered into the macro. Finally, the publication year (PY) was given for completeness. This process wor ked well, and even though the search statements needed to be inspected individually (to remove author names with non -Roman characters which are not recognized by the WoS and to delete any punctuation marks attached to title words), it was possible to ident ify and download over 860 references from one guideline in about 3 1/2 hours. The macro also listed references that did not satisfy its specific requirements so that any errors could be corrected manually and the macro then run again. 4.7 Clinical G uidelines : Cancer The example chosen here is the set of 17 guidelines for lung cancer (almost always the most burdensome form of the disease) in five countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. There were a total of 3232 references, but only 2512 of them could be identified as papers in the WoS, and their parameters determined. Some of the papers were cited on more than one of the 17 guidelines, with one being cited on seven of them. Although the guidelines were all published in the years 2008 -14, some of the cited papers appeared as long ago as the 1960s, and the inter -quartile range was from 1998 to 2006. As expected, the large majority (78%) of the cited papers were in the sub-field of lung cancer research, and they were very clinical in char acter. Figure xviii shows that papers from European countries, and Canada, are relatively over -cited compared with their Critical Appraisal Cancer 124 presence in lung cancer research, but research from east Asian countries (China, South Korea and to a lesser extent, Japan) is almost ignored. This was found previously in a study of 43 UK cancer clinical guidelines ( Lewison & Sullivan, 2008 )44. US UK JP DE CAITFR NL ES AUBECN of papers cited on CGs Figure xviii. Comparison between presence of leading countries in the papers cited on 17 European clinical guidelines on lung cancer and the ir presence in lung cancer research, 2004 -13, fractional counts. (Dashed lines indicate a factor of two, up or down.) There is a big difference between the types of research cited on the 17 clinical guidelines and those forming the lung cancer oeuvre . This is shown in Figure xix. The evidence base for the clinical guidelines depends much more on the three treatment options (surgery, SURG; chemotherapy, CHEM; and radiotherapy, RADI) and much less on genetics (GENE). There is a contrast here, because papers of the different research types achieve very different levels of academic citations, with the most highly cited (genetics) obtaining more than twice the citation score of one of the least cited (surgery), see Figure xix. But as Figure xx shows, surger y papers have the most influence on patient treatment, whereas genetics papers have very little. Genetics papers in lung cancer may obtain the most citations, and so may impress grant -giving bodies, but it is lung cancer surgery research that may actually benefit patients through its effect on clinical guidelines. 44 Lewison G and Sullivan R (2008) Th e impact of cancer research: how publications influence UK cancer clinical guidelines British Journal of Cancer, vol 98, pp 1944 -1950 Critical Appraisal Cancer % LUNCAFigure xix.

Mean five -year citation scores for European lung cancer papers, 2004 -09, of different research types (for codes, see Table lxxi) 4.8 Newspaper Stories There is abundant evidence that politicians are unduly sensitive to stories in the media. Some of these are based on individual cases, in which it is reported that named patients do not have access to particular means of therapy (expensive drugs, for example). Ministers react by making special provision for them, but this can distort the overa ll health -care system as with the Cancer Drugs Fund in the UK ( Thornton, 2011; Knapton, 2014 )45,46. Senior officials can use the stories to bring news of research to their ministers; most will not have the time to read the literature extensively and need 45 Thornton S (2011) Cancer Drugs Fund is not a fair allocation of NHS resources. BMJ 342, d621 46 Knapton S (2014) Cancer Drugs Fund makes no sense, says head of drugs rationing body NICE. Daily Telegraph, 2 September. Critical Appraisal Cancer 126 help to learn about interesting developments. The same is true for health -care administrators in hospitals and clinics, who may learn about new methods of health -care delivery that offer potential cost savings. Medical personnel will also benefit, though t he media can also provide misinformation that can cause doctors to misdiagnose ( Schmidt et al. , 2014 )47. They can also influence researchers, and there is evidence that media coverage increases modestly the numbers of citations ( Phillips et al., 1991; Lewi son et al ., 2008 )48,49. The print media may even be a source in their own right (Hicks & Wang, 2013 )50. The biggest influence may be on ordinary people, and could assist the public to choose healthier life styles ( Nishtar et al Robbins, Pang & Leask, 2012 )54,55 although sensational press coverage of supposed links between MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination and autism has had a n egative effect ( Holton et al ., 2012 )56. They may also add to the political pressure for public investment in medical research, particularly if own -country papers are well -cited. In some countries, commentators on the significance of the research often come from medical research charities, which thereby gain exposure ( Lewison et al., 2012 )57. Print newspapers are in decline in many countries, but many have a strong web presence and are still important despite the growing influence of social websites such as Twitter and Facebook. This part of the project was intended to show the effects of European NCD research on six groups of people: politicians and other decision -makers; senior officials and advisers; health -care administrators; medical personnel (doctors, other professionals); 47 Schmidt HG, Mamede S, van den Berge K, van Gog T, van Saase JLCM and Rikers RMJP (2014) Exposure to media information about a diseas e can cause doctors to misdiagnose similar -looking clinical cases.

It embarked on an ambitious programme of study on the coverage of research in the five NCDs during the 12 -year period, 2002 -13, in a large number of European newspapers. Some of these have their own s earchable websites; others can be searched through full -text databases such as Factiva \u00a9Dow Jones, to which KCL subscribes. The results of this element of the project span the five NCD disease areas. For this reason, they will be reported in the Bibliom etrics Work Package of Mapping NCDS. 4.9 Discussion and Conclusion The complexity of investments streams and differences between the countries may make the development of common cancer funding policies very difficult and m easuring the impact research inve stments is a complex task . Indeed, h ealth improvements stem from a wide variety of interrelated research discoveries, made at different times and in different places. Other factors such as environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures also have an imp ortant bearing on the incidence of illness and further complicate the task of measuring research impact. For this reason , research impacts are evident at a variety of nodes along the pathway , many of which are not specifi c to individual disease areas. Bibliometrics has the capacity to quantitative measure impact at several of these nodes, including: scientific research papers, funding sources (decisions on funding), citations, evidence base of clinical guidelines; and newspapers stories regarding resear ch papers. In terms of the number of published scientific papers , Cancer generated the biggest of the five results for NCD s worldwide , with just 282055 papers . However, b y comparison with the other NCD s, published research for Cancer shows a significant Eu ropean presence, among the top three with an average of 38% of paper published, behind RESPI (56%) and CARDI (42%) and 35% for MENTH . According to the results in Europe, Cancer is a big subject area , averag ing 11.5 % of the pa pers in biomedicine overall. Cancer research represents just over one ninth of all European biomedical research output, but one eighth of world biomedical output. In terms of individual European countries , there are big differences in output, with more tha n three orders of magnitude between the largest (Germany) and the smallest (Malta). However, some of the smaller countries are expanding their output rapidly - notably Romania, whose fractional count output rose from only 7 papers in 2002 to over 250 in 2 013. Regarding collaboration it is expected that researchers in the scientifically larger countries (e.g., UK, Germany) would find it easier to work with a partner within the country that provided complementary expertise than researchers from small countri es (e.g., Estonia, Ireland) and would therefore tend to collaborate less internationally. However, we might expect that international transnational links would be much weaker for the Member States in Eastern Europe. These \"accession\" Member States do inde ed collaborate less than expected, whereas the five Scandinavian countries, with Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland, collaborate internationally more than the trend -line would suggest. According to the results, the countries whose European collaborations are expanding most rapidly are Brazil, India and China, followed by South Korea and Australia. Nevertheless, there is little expansion in collaboration with Russia and Japan during the period 2002 -13. Within the area of Cancer, the impact of European rese arch is defined first of all into 11 research types, generating different numbers of papers, with genetics giving the most (48,259 or 17.1%), Critical Appraisal Cancer 128 followed by chemotherapy (28,240 papers or 10.0%), prognosis (27,189 papers or 9.6%) and surgery (26,585 papers or 9.4%). Second by 22 different cancer sites, with breast giving the most of cancer papers ( 25805 or 10.2 %), 4.7%). The mean citation score varies by a factor of more than two for the extremes of the cancer sites (leukaemia, colorectal, breast = 17.9; gallbladder = 7.6) and by almost two for the extremes of the types of research (prognosis = 20.3; surgery = 11.5). In fact, the ACI value is positively correlated with the size of the research community, or at least the number of papers, with r2 = 0.56 for the 22 cancer sites, and r2 = 0.33 for the 11 types of research. Critical Appraisal Cancer 129 5 Conclusion Cancer is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe, with an estimated 3.45 million new cancer cases (excluding non -melanoma skin cancer) and 1.75 million deaths from cancer in 2012. In the future, the burden of cancer will become high er. Today, Europe as a whole is working together in the area of cancer policy initiatives and research in order to understand the underlying causes of cancer, to ensure the improved management of this disease and to study its social impact. Across Europe, the EU and its MS have mainly supported research on dissecting the causes and mechanism of cancer, translating this basic knowledge into clinical applications and supporting clinical research on new and improved interventions. Other issues related to canc er have been also covered, but have received a considerably lower attention (e.g. cancer control, prevention, patient care, etc.). Thus, room is left for cancer research aimed at improving existing treatments as well as studies of the organization of care, and methods to enhance quality of life and prevention. The major US companies that are the world leaders for R&D investment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector have significantly less cancer molecules in their research pipelines than European based companies. In several cases, US firms were not at all active in developing new molecules for cancer. By contrast, European based pharmaceutical companies have a much greater commitment to cancer in terms of pipeline development. Certainly, the top 1 0 European companies seem to specialize in specific NCD categories, almost all the companies have molecules on development for cancer. However, compared with the US, other large European firms like GSK, Novartis and AstraZeneca have quite a number of prod ucts in development. Indeed, these three firms consolidate more molecules in their research pipelines than do the top ten US firms collectively. These conclusions are similar to some other NCD categories, as CRDs. The analysis interviews reveals the need for strengthening and implementing policies that enhance cancer control efforts across the European Union. Cancer is a non -communicable disease which encompasses multiple diseases in one and requires data from different population groups with different ch aracteristics to gain a deeper insight and determine the patterns and trends that affect cancer incidence. Cancer requires a multinational and multidisciplinary approach, in particular with regards to rare cancers. To this end, this analysis suggests that the European Union should prioritise research on personalised cancer medicine and direct more efforts towards the establishment of networks or programmes that encourage solid cross -border collaboration for research at different levels, provide more funding opportunities for independent academic research and for translational research to place latest discoveries into health practice and disease prevention, implement effective policies that promote behaviours that are conductive to health, and, last but not l east, implement priorities to protect personal data whilst not hampering researc h. Cancer is the first leading cause of lost DALYs across Europe in terms of NCDs (17,68%). Otherwise, in case of cancer papers, relevant to 13 main cancer sites for the leadi ng 18 European countries from 2002 to 2013, the differences for some diseases were not great, but for others there were big variations in relative burden between countries. Breaking down the category into its major diseases, Leukaemia is the largest cause of lost DALYs by comparison with Kidney. In the past few years, research investment in Cancer was well adjusted to reflect their relative burden. According to the results for numbers of papers of 11 research types from each of 31 European countries in ONC OL, we can note that Germany (45436) has a greater total number of papers, followed by Italy (37876) and UK (37541), highlighting that genetics is the dominant research type, followed by chemotherapy, prognosis and surgery. Very little research attention is evidently paid to quality of life, palliative care or screening. Therefore the overall situation, with a positive but rather Critical Appraisal Cancer 130 small correlation between disease burden and research output it is apparent that lung cancer is under -researched and perhaps bre ast cancer over -researched. On the other hand, Malta is publishing very little, and Germany, Italy and UK are the ones most publishing in cancer research , being correlative within is level of GDP. However, some of the smaller countries are expanding their output rapidly - notably Romania, whose fractional count output rose from only 7 papers in 2002 to over 250 in 2013, and followed by Cyprus Lithuania and Luxemburg.

It has to be noted that some of the companies also make pharmaceutical drugs and the counts of papers may include them.
