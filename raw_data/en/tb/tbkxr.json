Sajah is the author of the book [Evolutionary Herbalism: Science, Spirituality, and Medicine from the Heart of Nature, ](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/evolutionary-herbalism)which weaves together herbal and medical traditions from around the world into a singular cohesive model, guided from an herbal practitioner's point of view to a comprehensive understanding of the practice and philosophy of healing with herbs. Sajah presents an innovative approach to herbalism that considers the holistic relationship among plants, humans, and the underlying archetypal patterns in nature. Organized into five parts moving from the microcosmic to the universal, Sajah's work explores a unique integration of clinical herbalism, Ayurveda, medical astrology, spagyric alchemy, and medical and esoteric traditions from across the world in a truly holistic system of plant medicine. A balance of the heart and the mind, the science and spirit of people and plants, [Evolutionary Herbalism](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/evolutionary-herbalism) provides a holistic context for how plants can be used for transformational levels of healing for the body, spirit, and soul. For both the student herbalist and experienced practitioner, Popham's original perspectives guide you to a more intimate, synergistic, and intuitive relationship with the plant kingdom, people, and nature as a whole. Sajah Popham's mission is to share knowledge, tools, and medicine that promote the healing power of plants \u2014to not just heal our bodies of disease, but to assist in the evolution of human consciousness back into its natural state. His holistic focus is on finding the universal principles and practices across herbal traditions and using plants in a way that not only brings about physical healing and rejuvenation but psychological and emotional health along with spiritual transformation. Sajah holds a degree in Herbal Sciences from [Bastyr University](https://bastyr.edu/) and has studied herbal traditions across the world and with some of North America's top clinical practitioners. He lives in the Pacific Northwest forest with his wife Whitney. Today, during Part 2 of my podcast with Sajah Popham, we will talk more about his approach, which unites traditional models in a way that utilize the whole plant (chemistry, energetics, and spirit) to heal the whole person (body, spirit, and soul) by getting to the root causes of disease.
