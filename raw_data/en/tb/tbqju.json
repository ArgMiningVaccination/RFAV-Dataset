They are single, membrane-spanning, non- catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell the latter two are not found in humans. Levamisole, marketed under the trade name Ergamisol, is a medication used to treat parasitic worm infections. It has also been studied as a method to stimulate the immune system as part of the treatment of cancer. Most current commercial preparations are intended for veterinary use as a dewormer in cattle, pigs, and sheep. After being pulled from the market in the U.S. and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, levamisole has been tested in combination with fluorouracil to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. One of the more serious side effects of Levamisole is agranulocytosis, or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08-5% of the studied populations. There have also been reports of levamisole induced necrosis syndrome in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin. Levamisole was evaluated as an immune stimulant in a randomized controlled study of patients with anaplastic gliomas, who had undergone surgical resection and who were also treated with radiotherapy and BCNU chemotherapy. Studies utilizing the avian sarcoma virus-induced glioma in rats also showed no improvement in survival with levamisole stimulation as the only immune agent, but the combination of active immunization and adjuvant stimulation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin plus levamisole was found to be therapeutically effective in this model and will be used in future pilot studies of active immunization in patients. Levamisole is a synthetic phenylimidazolthiazole that was first introduced in 1966 as an anti-helmintic agent. Current studies have been focused upon its effect on immune response and on cancer treatment. We examined the molecular mechanisms of levamisole in the activation and maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) and human T cells. Treatment of DC with levamisole increased the presentation of CD80, CD86, CD83 and human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) molecules on the cell membrane, as well as the production of interleukin-12 p40 and IL-10. Levamisole-treated human DC also enhanced T cell activation towards type 1 T helper immune response by inducing interferon- secretion. Neutralization with antibodies against Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 inhibited levamisole-induced production of IL-12 p40 and IL-10, suggesting a vital role for TLR-2 in signalling DC upon incubation with levamisole. In this study, we showed that BALB/c bone marrow-derived DC stimulated with LMS resulted in enhanced cell- surface expression of CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC class II, as well as enhanced production of IL-12p70, TNF- and IL-1. Interestingly, the LMS activated DCs were able to stimulate CD4(+) T cell proliferation and facilitated Th1 differentiation by increasing the secretion of IFN- in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction. Furthermore, to confirm the in vitro data, we investigated the effect of LMS on antigen-specific antibody and cytokine production in BALB/c mice. Immunization with LMS plus OVA showed that anti-OVA IgG2a and IFN- were increased significantly compared with OVA alone in BALB/c mice. Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2010 Sep;32(6):756-62. Meta- analysis: levamisole improves the immune response to hepatitis Bvaccine in dialysis patients. Fabrizi F1, Dixit V, Messa P, Martin P. We identified four studies involving 328 unique patients on regular dialysis. Only prospective, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included. Pooling of study results showed a significant increase in response rates among study (levamisole plus HBV vaccine) vs. control (HBV vaccine alone) patients; the pooled Odds Ratio was 2.432 (95% Confidence Intervals, 1.34; 4.403), P = 0.002. Nephrology (Carlton). 2014 Jan;19(1):27-31. Effect of levamisole supplementation on tetanus vaccination response rates N, Khajeh M, Sagheb MM. At 6 months, 11 out of 15 (73%) patients in the levamisole group as compared with four out of 16 (25%) patients in the placebo group still had protective anti-tetanus IgG levels (relative risk = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.19, 7.23). Supplementation of Td vaccination with levamisole may enhance seroconversion against tetanus in haemodialysis patients. BCG is an attenuated (nonvirulent) form of Mycobacterium bovis cultured in 1921 by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France. In the late 1920's, autopsy studies performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, showed a lower frequency of cancer in patients with tuberculosis. Attempts were made to use BCG against a variety of human cancer tumors with only limited success. It wasn't until the 1970's, however, that a Canadian urologist, Dr. Alvaro Morales, began his groundbreaking work on the use of intravesical BCG for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Over 30 years later, BCG continues to be used worldwide for the treatment of high grade noninvasive bladder cancer. We investigated whether three mycobacterial preparations currently used in the clinic (BCG and vaccae and in human T-cells. Results show that T-cells are activated by these mycobacterial preparations, as indicated by upregulation of activation marker expression and proliferation. Activated T-cells display enhanced effector responses, as shown by upregulated granzyme B expression, production of the T(H)1 cytokines IFN- and TNF-, and enhanced degranulation in response to susceptible and resistant tumour cells. A type of metastasis in which skin cancer spreads through a lymph vessel and begins to grow more than 2 centimeters away from the primary tumor but before it reaches the nearest lymph node. For the small uncontrolled study, twenty (20) patients in advanced stages with limited life expectancy were recruited in a 2-year period. Patients were classified into two groups according to the treatment to be employed. Group 1 included 6 patients who refused to be treated with standard treatments and received only immunotherapy. Group 2 included 14 patients treated with both immunotherapy and chemotherapy/ radiotherapy (CT/RT). The vaccination procedure: 3 intradermal doses of 0.5 ml each, with intervals of 6 weeks between each dose. Tumor fragments (about 1 g) from patients were kept in sterile PBS at 80 \u00b0C until use. For each dose, about 0.3-0.4 g of tumor tissue were macerated in 0.6 ml sterile PBS. At the moment of vaccination, the soluble fraction of the homogenate was mixed with formaldehyde 36 % at a final concentration of 0.02 % and 0.6 ml of BCG suspension 0.15 %. The survival rate upon a 5-year period was plotted for the immunotherapy only (IT) group and the combined treated (CT/RT/IT) group, as well as for the overall survival across all subjects. The calculated 5-year survival is indicated for each plot. However, T cells are peculiar in that they do not seem to require antigen processing and major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) presentation of peptide epitopes, although some recognize MHC class Ib molecules. Furthermore, T cells are believed to have a prominent role in recognition of lipid antigens. Imiquimod Imiquimod (INN) is a prescription medication that acts as an immune response modifier and is used to treat genital warts, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis. Imiquimod signals to the innate arm of the immune system through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that circulate in the blood and are found in peripheral lymphoid organs. They constitute < 0.4% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In humans these cells express the surface markers CD123, BDCA-2(CD303) and BDCA-4 (CD304), but do not express high levels of CD11c or CD14, which distinguishes them from conventional dendritic cells or monocytes, respectively. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), is aprotein functioning as a ligand that induces the process of cell death called apoptosis. TRAIL is a cytokine that is produced and secreted by most normal tissue cells. It causes apoptosis primarily in tumor cells, by binding to certain death receptors. TRAIL has also been designated CD253 (cluster of differentiation 253). Mifamurtide (Mepact\u00ae, Takeda) is a drug against osteosarcoma, mainly affecting children and young adults, which is lethal in about a third of cases. The drug was approved in Europe in March 2009. In a phase-III clinical trial in about 800 newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients, mifamurtide was combined with the chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and methotrexate, with or without cisplatin and ifosfamide. The mortality could be lowered by 30% versus chemotherapy plus placebo. Six years after the treatment, 78% of patients were alive. Drugs in R&D 9 (2): 131-5. 2008. "}
