The General Assembly finds that despite current scientific knowledge that zidovudine (AZT) prolongs the lives of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome victims, and may also be effective when introduced in the early stages of human immunodeficiency virus infection, many members of the public are deterred from seeking testing because they misunderstand the nature of the test or fear that test results will be disclosed without their consent. The General Assembly finds that the public health will be served by facilitating informed, voluntary, and confidential use of tests designed to detect human immunodeficiency virus infection. (2) A person who has signed a general consent form for the performance of medical procedures and test s is not required to also sign or be presented with a specific consent form relating to medical procedures or tests to determine human immunodeficiency virus infection, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, or infection with any other causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that will be performed on the person during the time in which the general consent form is in effect. However, a general consent form shall instruct the patient that, as part of the medical procedures or tests, the pat ient may be tested for human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis, or any other blood -borne infectious disease if a doctor or advanced practice registered nurse orders the test for diagnostic purposes.
