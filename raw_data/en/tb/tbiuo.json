The theme for the fall issue of Prevention Strategist is navigating change. It's been said that \"the only thing constant is change\" and as infection preventionists dealing with the pandemic we can certainly attest to that. Indeed the whole world is still reeling and trying to recover from the ongoing changes brought on by SARS-CoV-2. Although change can be disruptive and overwhelming, it is not always negative. It can teach us to adapt and develop resilience, thereby leading to increased strength and positive outcomes. Recently we witnessed a perfect example of necessary change leading to resilience when COVID-19 caused us to pivot from an in-person annual conference in Austin, Texas, to a totally virtual experience. Despite the disappointment, frustration, and challenges this new format presented, the conference was hugely successful with almost 3,600 attendees and raving reviews (see page 12 for a few social media posts). The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to force us to face the inevitability of change and remind us of the quote by Dr. Wayne Dyer, \"Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.\" The APIC Board of Directors understood this and set out to re-examine our Vision and Mission as well as our Strategic Plan for 2025. Our vision now includes making the whole world safer from infection rather than just healthcare and our mission calls on us to advance both the science and the practice of infection prevention (see page 16 for further information). As we continue to navigate these uncharted waters of change, the U.S. Coast Guard Rules of Navigation, which every vessel must follow to prevent collisions on the waterway, can perhaps provide guidance. Their first rule is \"always have a proper lookout.\" We are fortunate that our CEO, Board of Directors, staff, and volunteer leaders admirably fulfill that role by keeping us on course. The next rule is to \"operate at a safe speed.\" The revision of our Strategic Plan is an example of that. Adequate time and deliberation is being dedicated to this critical undertaking that will provide a roadmap for moving forward. Another navigation rule is \"do not make assumptions on the basis of scanty information.\" That comes naturally to IPs, since our wheelhouse is gathering, interpreting, and reporting data. All the hard work, research, and data collection that our IP Academic Pathway Task Force is doing will help us expand and diversify our workforce for years to come. Like the caterpillar who becomes a butterfly, APIC is going through a metamorpho - sis. We must leave our comfort zone and try new things if we are to fly to new heights. The words of T.S. Eliot provide motivation for our journey: \"Only those who risk going too far can find out how far they can go.\" Ann Marie Pettis, RN, BSN, CIC, FAPIC2021 APIC President PAUL FLEET/ SHUTTERSTOCK.COMPrevention BOARD OF DIRECTORS President Pettis, RN, FAPIC Treasurer Carol McLay, DrPH, MPH, RN, CIC, FAPICImmediate Past Connie Steed, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPICEx Officio Devin Jopp, EdD, MS Chief Executive Officer DIRECTORS Berriel-Cass, BSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC CIC, NE-BC Katie Cary, MT(ASCP), MPH, CIC Kathleen Gase, MBA, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Brian Harte, MD Tim Landers, PhD, RN, CNP, MLS (ASCP)CM, CIC, Gail MD Carol Vance, MSN, RN, PHN, CIC Angela Vassallo, MPH, MS, CIC, FAPIC Erica Washington, MPH, CPH, CIC, CPHQ, FAPIC DISCLAIMER Prevention Strategist is published by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 2021 API-Q0321 BY DEVIN JOPP 'Please place the mask over your own mouth and nose before assisting others'I'M SURE ALL of us at some point or another have been seated on an airplane and have heard the oxygen mask instructions recited over the PA: \"Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the mask over your own mouth and nose before assisting others.\" It's one of those lines that, over time, has lost its meaning. Most people don't even look up at the flight attendant during the safety briefing and go back to reading their book or using their electronic devices. However, while I've not personally experienced a loss of cabin pressure on a plane, I'm pretty sure that single piece of advice would be extremely helpful should it ever happen. So, what does the oxygen mask rule mean to infection preventionists? Quite a bit, actually! In this COVID-19 era, you could say that we have lost our collective cabin pressure. As the latest COVID-19 surge has reminded us, we have to engage in self-care and wellbeing to make sure that we are at our best to care for our family, friends, patients, colleagues, and communities. Wellbeing is a seemingly simple concept but is actually quite complex and dynamic. In my pre-APIC life, I helped lead an effort to define wellbeing in the college health space, and we came up with a rather simple defini - tion: \"We define wellbeing as an optimal and dynamic state that allows people to achieve their full potential\" ( https://nirsa.net/nirsa/2020/05/22/ announcing-inter-association-definition-for-well-being/ ). When we dig deeper, we find that wellbeing encompasses many dimensions of a person including emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social, and spiritual ( https://thrive.wfu.edu/# ). Wellbeing is not the absence of challenges, stress, or problems, and is not an unreachable plane or a mysterious Zen-state. Wellbeing is like a fingerprint\u2014unique to you and identical to no one else. At times of stress, like now as we respond to the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, it's easy for us to forget about wellbeing. Managing stress is critically important and we can use tools in our toolbox like relaxation (e.g., yoga, visualization, breathing), physical activity, and social support to help us lower our stress. However, stress management is only one piece of our overall wellbeing puzzle. In that vein, I am pleased to announce that APIC is launching a series of new webinars to try to help our members navigate these tumultuous and difficult times that challenge our wellbeing. Starting mid-September through October, APIC will be hosting a series of webinars aimed at help - ing you manage stress, provide an outlet to connect with your peers to share your thoughts and feelings, and to provide tips and tactics you can use to improve your own wellbeing (see page 50 for more information). Just like flying in a plane, we must make sure that our tray tables are up, seat belts are on, and seatbacks are in the upright position. We must ensure our own wellbeing needs are met and apply our proverbial wellbeing mask first, so that we can assist with the wellbeing of others when they need it. Devin Jopp, EdD, MS APIC CEO 8 | FALL 2021 | Prevention 1039022_PhoneSoap.indd 1 14/04/21 3:39 PMCELEBRATING EXCELLENCE THANKS TO THE administration of vaccines and the diligent work of infection preventionists (IPs), vaccinated individuals have slowly started the transition to a post-COVID-19 life. While there seemed to be a brief moment of relief, the world is now trying to tackle the Delta variant. IPs continue to work through the vari - ous challenges they face during this pandemic and know the fight isn't over. We were hopeful to meet with everyone face to face at the APIC conference this year and hold our CIC\u00ae reception to honor your work. Even though the event was virtual, CBIC was thrilled to have the opportunity to share your stories through our Honoring CIC\u00ae and a-IPC Preventionist Spotlight. Since the summer Prevention Strategist column, CBIC Board and staff have made great strides in imple - menting initiatives to provide pathways to assess and maintain infection prevention competency. CBIC announced that eligibility requirements for new and lapsed CIC\u00ae certificants would be updated to reflect current practice. These updates went into effect June 1, 2021, and will help differentiate between those who should take the a-IPCTM versus the CIC\u00ae. The a-IPCTM measures readiness to practice infection control while the CIC\u00ae examination measures proficiency gained by experience. Test development for the CIC\u00ae examination based on the 2020 Practice Analysis survey results is underway. Beta-test applications have been submitted and those who were eligible had until the end of September to complete their exam. Thank you to all who participated! Results from the beta-test exam will be used to set the new cut, or passing, score. There will be a delay in receiving examination scores while revised exam standards are finalized. Just a reminder that there will be no CIC\u00ae examination available from October 2021 to December 2021, however, this has no effect on the a-IPCTM exam or recertification exam. Once the revised CIC\u00ae examination form is ready, CBIC will communicate when eligible individuals can start applying to test in early 2022. Leading the way in infection prevention While the pandemic was challenging in numerous ways for all within the infection prevention and control field, it was through excellent leadership we saw success. The demand for IPs during COVID-19 caused many individuals to step into roles they might not have felt prepared for. For others with years of experience in the field, it was their time to step up and help lead their team. Whether you were the mentor or the mentee, you rose to the occasion during a historical time. Certification signals to employers that you are committed to professional growth in the field of infec - tion prevention and control by keeping your knowledge and skills current to better your organization's infection control function and its success. This community is built on leading each other to an overall goal of improving public health while also keeping your colleagues safe. Please continue supporting and encouraging one another both in the field while at work and outside the field in study groups. CBIC is proud to represent such an outstanding group of individuals. On the horizon This pandemic has increased the demand for certification in healthcare settings and highlighted how essential it is to have infection preventionists present within the long-term care setting. CBIC is now exploring a certification for IPs working in long-term care. Certification in Long-Term Care is aligned with CBIC's vision of \"healthcare without infection through verifiable competency.\" Thank you to all IPs in long-term care who participated in the survey to validate the tasks performed in the field and the knowledge needed to perform those tasks competently. Results from the survey are being reviewed by our Long-Term Care Committee. CBIC will share more communication on next steps as we move through the process. With appreciation, Janet Glowicz, MPH, PhD, RN, CIC, FAPIC 2021 CBIC President BY JANET GLOWICZ Moving forward with momentum \"I have had the opportunity to mentor several IPs as they prepare for their CIC\u00ae and after they get certified I often see a shift in their confidence. I love supporting other IPs to get their CIC\u00ae and role modelling what it has done for me in my career as an IP.\" Ashley Heller, CIC\u00ae certified March 2018\"Becoming certified in infection prevention shows a continued commitment by the preventionist in supporting best practices and care that are able to support patient care and staff safety in the best way possible. This has been extremely important during the COVID-19 pandemic as many look to the CIC\u00ae specialist for guidance and leadership to get us through these trying times.\" Kelly Catiel, CIC\u00ae certified November 2018 10 | FALL 2021 | Prevention S F EA Social isolation and school closures have added a lot of stressors to children's lives. You can help them cope and keep them S.A.F.E. through SUPPORT, ACTION, FACTS, and ENGAGEMENT . Support Support your child in speaking up if they have questions, are scared, or feel bullied. Try to keep up with regular routines and be a role model for your child on ways to take a break when frustration sets in. Spend meaningful time with your child. Seek professional help if you have any concerns about their mental health. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if your child confides thoughts of suicide: 800-273-8255. Action Ensure your children are up to date on their vaccinations. Contact your child's healthcare provider to discuss what vaccinations are missing or out-of-date and what actions you should take to get them caught up. Visit the CDC website to review the Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for ages 18 or younger. Vaccinate your child against the flu. If they are 12 or older, get a COVID-19 vaccination for your child. Get your COVID-19 and flu shots if you have not already. Teach and model good hygiene practices. Make sure all household members clean their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after using the restroom, before and after food preparation, before and after meals, after playing with pets or coming in from outside, and anytime they look soiled. Teach household members to keep hands away from their eyes, mouth, and nose. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your sleeve and then clean your hands right afterward. Keep children home when sick to avoid bringing germs to school that could make others sick. Follow CDC COVID-19 prevention recommendations about indoor mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing. Make sure your child knows how to wear their mask properly and provide them with a clean mask each day. Facts Knowledge is power...follow the science! Get your facts about COVID-19 from trusted sources such as healthcare providers, public health department websites, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Reliable sources use data and evidence to back up their claims. Word of mouth, social media, and friends are not always the best source for health information. Engagement Talk with your child about ways to stay safe in class and explain the \"why\" behind your advice. Encourage them to ask questions. Engage school personnel, including school nurses, on what they are doing to keep your child safe and how you can help. Talk to your employer about options if you or your child become sick\u2014be prepared.

ISTOCK.COM/PIXELLIEBE 12 | FALL 2021 | Prevention International Infection Prevention Week: October 17-23, 2021 Make Your Intention Infection Prevention because Preventing Infection is Everybody's Business 2021 has been a year of great gains in medicine and science. We have gone from being completely susceptible to a novel coronavirus, to having a fighting chance with the creation of not one, but several vaccines to combat COVID-19. While infec - tion prevention has not always been top of mind for everyone (besides our infection prevention fighting IPs), the last 2 years have continuously proved that we are stronger together and that infection prevention is everybody's business every day. Our unsung heroes\u2014our IPs\u2014are leading the charge in a worldwide fight against COVID-19, misinformation, and also against the spread of less top-of-mind offenders like C. auris , influenza, RSV, measles, and so many more infectious diseases. International Infection Prevention Week (IIPW) October 17-23, 2021 celebrates the international fight not only to eradicate COVID-19, but also to eradicate the spread of all infections both in our own homes and in healthcare settings. APIC will be planning engaging social media activities, IP Instagram stories takeovers on APIC's Instagram account, and fun memes, shareables, and of course information about how to keep yourself and those you care for safe. As always, our store will be stocked with IIPW merch to celebrate all year long and we will continue to upload infographics and fact sheets to help your education efforts. If you haven't already, we urge you to share YOUR COVID-19 story as a hopeful reminder to others of the amazing contributions our IPs have made in the fight against COVID-19.

This recognition is an expression of the Board's gratitude for the individual's dedication and service to the infection prevention profession and to APIC. Congratulations to Sue Barnes, RN, CIC, FAPIC, for receiving APIC's first Champion Award! Read more about Sue at https://apic.org/apic-champions/ .APIC's first champion: Sue Barnes Originally from the Washington D.C. area, Irene Khan, MPH, holds a B.S. in Biology and a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology from George Mason University. She has over 9 years of laboratory experience working as a Molecular Biology Scientist and Genome Analyst for a private biotech company and more recent clinical experience working as a Surveillance Infection Preventionist for a prominent healthcare system in Atlanta, GA. Irene is currently working towards her Doctorate in Public Health at the University of Georgia. Her research interest includes a focus on improving patient health outcomes in the healthcare setting. At APIC, Irene is embarking on a research project addressing health inequities and health disparities in infection prevention and control. The project aims to design interventions to mitigate racial disparities in developing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) to improve health outcomes.Meet APIC's first fellow Irene Khan www.apic.org | 15APIC NEWS What was the motivation/thinking process behind APIC's revising of the mission and vision? Ann Marie: COVID-19 has truly turned our world upside down and forced the Board to think hard around the focus of APIC's mission and vision. When considering the vision statement, perhaps the largest environmental factor considered was that APIC's influence extends well beyond healthcare into other industries like transportation, entertainment, hospitality, education, etc. COVID-19 has thrust infection prevention and control into the forefront of the public's collective con - sciousness. Our vision and mission had to evolve to ensure that APIC is not only relevant but is leading the way forward. APIC's new vision statement is now \"a safer world through prevention of infection.\" APIC's new mission statement has been revised to \"To advance the science and practice of infection prevention and control.\" When considering modifications to our mission statement, we determined that APIC must advance both the practice of infection prevention and the science that will lead to new discoveries, innovations, and methodologies that can aid us in our work. We're so excited about this modified mis - sion and believe that it will help establish our organization as the leading source for both infection prevention science and practice. These changes are quite powerful; they will usher in a new era where we will expand APIC's research capabilities and begin conducting our own research, while at the same time, we will assume a much larger role in facili - tating cross-institutional research on cutting edge topics for APIC's new vision and mission: APIC President Ann Marie Pettis, RN, BSN, CIC, FAPIC, Past President Connie Steed, MSN, CIC, FAPIC, President-elect APIC CEO Devin Jopp, EdD, MS, share their thoughts on the making of a new vision and mission for APIC, and what they hope the future will bring to the organization and the IPC profession. our profession. Regarding practice, new tools and resources will be developed and shared among IPs and ensure that all APIC members have access to the knowledge they need to be successful in their roles. We understand part of APIC's focus will be on driving both the science and practice of infection prevention ahead\u2014what might that look like? Connie: In many ways, the focus is building off the natural progression and the strong foundation that we have built here at APIC. For years, APIC has produced invaluable guidance and practice resources that have facilitated the practice of infection prevention across our nation and our world. On the science side, through our esteemed journal, AJIC , we have served as the key source of scientific advancement by disseminating cutting edge science to our readers. However, our new focus, as Ann Marie indicated in her remarks on the mission, takes us to the next level. For example, in the near future APIC headquarters will work on creating a team of national and international IPs who are scientists, researchers, and research fellows and who will secure funding and produce original research to advance the IPC field. We also expect that over time, APIC will take a lead - ing role in building research networks to advance multi-entity scientific research. On the practice side, we will see expanded sets of resources and guidance for varying IPC settings and will see expanding work on providing policies and procedures that can continue to help inform our practice. This barely touches the surface but hopefully provides a glimpse of things to come. Ann Marie Pettis Connie Steed Linda Dickey Devin JoppA conversation with APIC leaders 16 | FALL 2021 | Prevention We understand the new IP Academic Pathway is a critical part of the new strategic plan. How does that factor in our strategic direction? Linda: The IP Academic Pathway represents a grouping of initiatives that are critical to developing the next IP generation workforce. Today, there is no clear guidance on how to develop into an IP from a young undergraduate, and also no defined educational pathways. In order for the profession to advance, we need to clarify expectations for knowledge and roles at various levels. The IP Academic Pathway will be a crucial part of the new strategic plan and includes the development of frameworks for apprenticeship and internship programs to more immediately help cross-train professionals into the profession. It also includes the development of undergraduate concentration programs of study and stand-alone graduate-level degrees that focus on infection prevention and help establish a clear educational runway. This program is a cornerstone to our strategic plan as we try to develop clear ways to help ensure we have plenty of well-trained IPs to meet the demand and fit the growing needs of healthcare and non-healthcare settings. What other changes does APIC plan on implementing in order to fulfill its new mission and vision? Devin: We are currently in the process of bringing our vision and mission to life and as our new strategic plan unfolds, I believe it will build on the base of work we're already doing and take us to the next level. Right now, our focus has been building the foundation on which we can expand our future work. One example is the research that we are conducting on diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as patient equity. This work will influence our road ahead as we look to ensure our workforce and our leadership is diverse and inclusive. Additionally, our new patient equity taskforce is collecting the necessary data that can help us as IPs to identify and share the best practices that will guarantee everyone will have equal access to care and equal outcomes from that care. We also are working on expanding our membership model to allow organizations to bring more individuals from their companies who could benefit from APIC resources and also create more bundled services and offerings with that membership. At the same time, we're evaluating new ways to allow for members to engage in our work through expanding our member sections to new settings, topics, and roles. And finally, we have a number of new programs under development that will create new opportunities for specialized education for various practice settings, both inside and outside of healthcare. All of our expanded efforts place us one step closer to reaching our new vision and mission. Despite the daunting challenges COVID-19 has presented, it has also galvanized infection preventionists into action. It's such an exciting time for our association and for the IPC profession as a whole. microbial surveillance testing MADE EAS Y NOW!

More people than ever are interested in the role of inequity in healthcare outcomes, how to get personal protective equipment (PPE), and how they themselves can contribute to preventing the spread of infections (i.e., masking, hand hygiene). Although the conversations on these topics have become tainted with partisan bickering, most in the public arena realize the impact infection prevention and control (IPC) has on their daily lives.ISTOCK.COM/USCHOOLS\"It's easy to talk about it in the abstract, but the devil's always in the details.\" -John Scofield 20 | FALL 2021 | Prevention During this pandemic the role of infec - tion preventionists (IPs) became crucial to preventing outbreaks from permeat - ing throughout facilities. IPs were forced to deal with PPE shortages, patient and staff cohorting, and the everyday risks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The role of IPs became a centerpiece in the day-to-day plans of their facilities. However, with renewed focus on IPC, why are policymakers still struggling to understand this role? Below we review some of the most com - mon questions we receive from legislators and how the complexity of IPC challenges their perception of healthcare. What is the role of an infection preventionist? When speaking to policymakers, introducing the role of an IP will usu - ally be a first step. As advocates for the profession, we rely on a lot of stories and resources developed from mem - bers. According to the APIC website, \"Infection preventionists (IPs) are profes - sionals who make sure healthcare work - ers and patients are doing all the things they should to prevent infections. Most IPs are nurses, epidemiologists, public health professionals, microbiologists, doctors, or other health professionals who work to prevent germs from spread - ing within healthcare facilities. They look for patterns of infection within the facility; observe practices; educate healthcare teams; advise hospital leaders and other professionals; compile infec - tion data; develop policies and proce - dures; and coordinate with local and national public health agencies.\" While this relatively short and simple synopsis provides some detail to people just learn - ing about the profession, it is important to relay the complicated and challenging realities of this position. Compare the role of an IP in a skilled nursing facility, ambulatory center, dialysis facility, and a hospital, or your role to your colleague who works at a similar care set - ting. What is your role in employee health? Quality? Surveillance? Additionally, what is considered a background or sufficient training in IPC can also vary by facility, which is why APIC has been a strong advocate for certification. Why haven't I heard about infection preventionists before? When discussing hospitals/healthcare most people think about patient-facing professions such as doctors and nurses. They don't think about the complex apparatus necessary to keep healthcare facilities running and safe. Policymakers are often not much more sophisticated in their understanding of healthcare. They automatically want to define roles in the buckets they understand or recognize. When learning about a role as technical and behind-the-scenes as an IP, they are not always aware of the resources necessary to keep a healthcare facility from becoming the epicenter of an outbreak. Also, it is worth noting that the every - day challenges of preventing HAIs and establishing processes to keep patients safe are generally performed out of the public eye. Another way to say this is: if things are going well, people don't notice your work. COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of IPC and the need for qualified IPs overseeing these programs. Don't doctors and nurses already do this? Inevitably, this question will be asked by policymakers, who assume that IPC is a top priority for all healthcare provid - ers while treating a patient. When con - fronted with this logic, we refer to the data which clearly illustrates the need for an expert focused on this area. Every year, nearly 700,000 HAIs occur in hospitals and up to 3.8 million infections occur in long-term care facilities. In the past, HAIs were considered inevitable; how - ever, we now know that when investments are made in IPC (i.e., the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program [CUSP], certification, surveillance) impacts can be made. Since the early 2000s, hospi - tals have seen nearly a 30% reduction in the number of HAIs. IPs have been an important part of this progress and must continue to receive the resources and commitment by facilities to be effective.Why is certification necessary? Similar to the scope of an IP's role, what is considered sufficient background or training in IPC can also vary by facil - ity or geography. During the fledgling days of IPC programs in hospitals, many IPs were hired with minimal qualifica - tions for the role. Some were selected for being vocal on certain issues, while others were simply \"voluntold\" because the spot needed to be filled. While the field has made great strides since the early adoption of IPC programs, there is still a great deal of flexibility as to what qualifies someone for this role. Another challenge of the field is the wide variety of specialties entering it. As mentioned above, an IP could have a background as a nurse, epidemiolo - gist, public health professional, micro - biologist, doctor, or other healthcare professional. All these fields are valu - able contributors to the field, but they do not have a common curriculum around IPC. With few post-secondary programs offering degrees specific to this field, certification is the best way to show com - petency. Additionally, preparing for the exam is a great way to learn more about the role. APIC is a strong supporter of requiring certification for new IPs enter - ing the field. While these questions do not repre - sent all the questions we receive, they do share some of the challenges we face when advocating for the safety of patients and elevating the profession. As we continue to emerge from another wave of COVID-19, educating policy - makers about IPC will be an important way for them to learn about the criti - cal role they will play, along with IPs, in preventing another pandemic of this magnitude.

Focus on long-term care and behavioral health outbreaks BY STEVEN SCHWEON Hospital outbreaks are reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column helps the IP heighten awareness of appropriate interventions to prevent outbreaks. The health department contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for additional investi - gative assistance. To assist with detecting the source, the investigation was divided into four parts: 1. Screening high-risk individuals for a positive HCV infection and ana - lyzing the findings for the genetic constitution. 2. Observing infection control practices at both the SNF and hospital. 3. Case-control analysis of both the SNF and hospital records to assess for potential modes of transmission and risk factors for HCV infection. 4. Developing and implementing infec - tion prevention recommendations to stop additional transmission. As part of this intensive investigation, HCV, Hepatis B virus, and HIV testing were performed on staff and patients. Unfortunately, some residents were lost to follow-up (either deceased or discharged), and could not be tested. The SNF also experienced ongoing turnover and used temporary agency providers. In summary, 30 of 105 residents (29%) were HCV posi - tive, using HCV nucleic acid amplification testing and rapid antibody testing. To assist with the investigation, a second SNF in the community was used as a control. At this facility, 3 of 96 randomly sampled residents (3%) were HCV positive; 1 being a former resident at the outbreak facility.Calles et al1 describes the onset of symptomatic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among three senior patients who resided in the same, 114-bed skilled nursing facility (SNF). Symptoms were reported to the health department during a 3-month period. None of the patients had a history of high-risk behaviors, including injection drug use. All three patients had received health - care at a local hospital. Based upon your clinical acumen, you are highly suspicious that the exact source of transmission with this bloodborne pathogen is one of the following: 1. Glucometers that are not adequately cleaned and disinfected between residents2. Narcotic medication diversion, either at the SNF or local hospital 3. Podiatry equipment and work-flow processes 4. Shared electrical razors that are not cleaned and disinfected correctly between residentsIdentify the pathogen!ISTOCK.COM/DR_MICROBE 22 | FALL 2021 | Prevention The ABCs of Hepatitis - for Health Professionals HEPATITIS A is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV)HEPATITIS B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV)HEPATITIS C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) U.S. Statistics Estimated 24,900 new infections in 2018 Estimated 21,600 new infections in 2018 Estimated 862,000 people living with chronic HBV infection in 2016 Estimated 50,300 new infections in 2018 Estimated 2.4 million people living with HCV infection in 2016 Routes of TransmissionFecal-oral route. HAV is transmitted through: Close person-to-person contact with an infected person Sexual contact with an infected person Ingestion of contaminated food or water Although viremia occurs early in infection, bloodborne transmission of HAV is uncommon.Percutaneous, mucosal, or nonintact skin exposure to infectious blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV is concentrated most highly in blood, and percutaneous exposure is an efficient mode of transmission. HBV is transmitted primarily through: Birth to an infected mother Sexual contact with an infected person Sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other injection-drug equipment Less commonly through: Needle-sticks or other sharp instrument injuries Organ transplantation and dialysis Interpersonal contact through sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes or contact with open sores of an infected personDirect percutaneous exposure to infectious blood. Mucous membrane exposures to blood can also result in transmission, although this route is less efficient. HCV is transmitted primarily through: Sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or other equipment to inject drugs Less commonly through: Birth to an infected mother Sexual contact with an infected person Unregulated tattooing Needle-sticks or other sharp instrument injuries Incubation Period 15-50 days (average: 28 days)60-150 days (average: 90 days (average range: 14-84 days) Symptoms of Acute InfectionSymptoms of all types of viral hepatitis are similar and can include one or more of the following: Jaundice Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Joint pain Dark Urine Clay-colored stool Diarrhea (HAV only) Likelihood of Symptomatic Acute Infection <30% of children <6 years of age have symptoms (which typically do not include jaundice) >70% of older children and adults have jaundice Most children <5 years of age do not have symptoms 30%-50% of people 5 years of age develop symptoms Newly infected immunosuppressed adults generally do not have symptoms Jaundice might occur in 20%-30% of people Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., anorexia, malaise, or abdominal pain) might be present in 10%-20% of people Potential for Chronic Infection after Acute InfectionNone Chronic infection develops in: 90% of infants after acute infection at birth 25%-50% of children newly infected at ages 1-5 years 5% of people newly infected as adultsChronic infection develops in over 50% of newly infected people Continued on next page CDC www.apic.org | 23HCV genetic analysis was performed to assist with identifying the transmis - sion source; all 30 cases were genetically related. Of 153 staff members tested, 139 (91%) were negative, with the HCV, linked by transmission. A podiatrist of interest was living out of state, at the time of the investigation, and was not tested for HCV. The investigators discovered several causes of the outbreak: There was no full-time dedicated IP at the facility where the outbreak took place. Infection control protocols were lengthy and not user-friendly. Infection control training sessions were infrequently held. Direct observations of phlebotomy including serum international nor - malized ratio (INR) testing, injectable medication handling and administra - tion, and other nursing care were con - ducted, and no lapses were identified. Care by a former podiatrist was discussed with the available staff. Treatment of ingrown nails and cal - luses resulted in bleeding, particularly among residents on warfarin therapy. Investigators observed care provided by a different podiatrist in a procedure room. They noted inconsistent environmental surface cleaning between each resident, difficulties with maintaining separation between clean and dirty equipment, a different podiatrist used a new, sterile nail clipper for each resident, with the instruments being processed at the local hospital, and gloves were not rou - tinely changed between residents unless blood was encountered, in which case gloves were changed and hand hygiene was performed with the alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Nursing would use a single nail clipper during bathing for patients without dia - betes. This was disinfected between use and stored in the washroom. A separate, single nail clipper was kept on the medi - cation cart for residents with diabetes. Nicks and cuts from fingernails cut too short were observed with these patients. Glucometer cleaning and disinfection practices were inconsistent. Numerous hospital procedures were reviewed, e.g., transfusions, hemodi - alysis, endoscopies, percutaneous or other invasive procedures, controlled injectable substances, etc., and were not found to be associated with the cases. The investigators concluded that podia - try, INR monitoring, wound care, and any nail care were significantly associ - ated with the infection. Since all the staff members tested negative, the investigators felt \"patient to patient\" was the cause of the outbreak. As a result, numerous rec - ommendations were made to stop addi - tional transmission: All newly admitted residents were tested for HCV, and monthly, after admission, for a minimum of 2 years. Staff received infection control train - ing by a \"credentialed infection control practitioner.\" The treatment room where podiatry care was given was relocated to a larger space, with improved handwashing sink access, and separate clean and dirty workspaces. Single-use, disposable nail clippers for all nail care were initiated. INR point-of-care testing was adopted after the outbreak investigation concluded. Multiple infection prevention recommen - dations were made to the podiatrist. Highlight: Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, stems from the Greek hepatikos , or \"of the liver.\"2 About 50% of individuals infected with Hepatitis C3 are not aware they are infected, with this virus being the leading cause of liver transplants and liver cancer. CDC provides very detailed HCV information, including transmission, signs and symptoms, testing, treatment, etc., for healthcare professionals.4 References 1.

Consider performing a detailed tracer of all podiatry practices within your facility. Identify potential hazards such as where the care is performed, hand hygiene adherence, personal protective equipment used, clean and dirty instrument separation, sterilization of instruments, transportation of soiled instruments, etc. Discuss findings with your leadership team and appropriate facility committees. 2. Have a heightened awareness for an unusual infectious disease onset: how do three senior residents, with no risk factors, develop a bloodborne pathogen infection in your facility, for instance? 3. Hepatitis C virus is a nationally notifiable condition.5 While initially reported by the laboratory, always double-report to ensure the public health authorities are fully aware. Discuss reportable infections at the appropriate facility committees. 4. Adhere to your federal, state, and local regulations, in addition to facility policy when an outbreak is suspected; consider developing an outbreak policy, which includes key contacts, phone numbers for daily and after hours, and emails of the appropriate health department. It might be helpful to also store the health department's contact information in your personal phone and computer. 5. Standard precautions should be consistently implemented for all patients, including those who are HCV positive.6IDENTIFY THE PATHOGEN! 24 | FALL 2021 | Prevention PROTECTING FRONTLINE STAFF FROM AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS n High Protection 99.97% against biohazards (APF 50 & 1000) n Reusable and cost-effective n Comfortable & lightweight < 1lb/400g n No belts or hoses n IP Rated 66 water tolerant n Simple and fast to don n NIOSH approved n Smart AirSensit Technology + STERI-PLUS exhalation filter for Source ControlEVERY ANGEL DESERVES A HALOHC-072021 REQUEST A DEMONSTRATION sales@cleanspacetechnology.com 1045935_Cleanspace.indd 1 27/07/21 11:24 PM(It's time to take proven infection prevention further) The M\u00f6lnlycke and Hibiclens trademarks, names and logo types are registered globally to one or more of the M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care Group of Companies.

She received her MPH from the University of Michigan with an emphasis on Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology. Prior to starting a career in infection prevention, Tiffany spent 2 years conducting research on female reproductive tract immunity and studied abroad in South Africa doing field work in HIV prevention. Tiffany is an emerging leader with 10 years of acute care IP experi - ence covering a variety of patient care settings and complex patient populations. She is skilled at influencing change and uses innovative approaches to solve problems. Tiffany served as board treasurer for her local APIC chapter for 4 years, has published several process improvement works, and served as a guest lecturer for 5 years at University of Michigan's School of Public Health. Tiffany is a proud wife and mother of three. In her free time she loves reading, cooking, and discovering all the wonders of LA. View Tiffany's infection prevention career journey on the next page! 1. What inspired you to become an infection preventionist? More specifically, \"who\" inspired me? It's been over a decade, but I'll never forget sitting in class learning how to conduct an outbreak investigation. The guest speaker was a bubbly, dynamic IP with a contagious passion, who made the profession sound very exciting! I already had a love of people, patterns, and problem-solving, so when IP PROFILE A conversation with an infection preventionist she said \"Infection Preventionists are Medical Detectives... \" I was sold. Six months later, I joined my first infection prevention team and the guest speaker from that unforgettable day became my manager and mentor. 2. What were some of your challenges when you first entered the field? Public speaking was a big hurdle for me in the early stages of my career. Much of what we do as IPs involve influencing diverse stakeholders on complex issues in both small and large settings. Thus, learning how to speak with clarity, deliver engag - ing, authentic presentations, and connect with the audience was a skill I wanted to master. It took focus and lots and lots of practice, but in the end not only did I become a better com - municator, I became a better IP, which ultimately improved the lives of our patients, visitors, and staff. 3. What has helped you most as you have progressed in your role as an IP? Building a strong network of mentors, colleagues, and friends has helped me progress the most in my role as an IP. In just one click I have access to all the evidence-based science I need to be knowledgeable and make good recommendations, but the relationships I've fostered with other experts in the field is what has elevated me the most. I would not be where I am today if others had not poured into me. These individuals helped translate theory into practice, boosted my confidence, and inspired me to perform at the highest level. 32 | FALL 2021 | Prevention 4. How has your background helped you in the IPC profession? A Master of Public Health in Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology equipped me with the tools to become a better problem-solver. I believe having an MPH also brings intellectual diversity to infection prevention teams and healthcare enter - prises because it offers an eclectic educational expe - rience with training in epidemiology, behavioral health, research, and biostatistics. 5. What is the best advice you ever received? \"What got you here won't get you there.\" The skills and attributes that helped you achieve success in one domain may not be the same ones you need to transcend another. Being open to feedback and constructive criticism helped deepen my self- awareness, improved my emotional intelligence, and allowed me to let go of the past to make room for the future. 6. What advice do you have for others who are new to the field or considering the field of infection prevention and control? Be curious. Be courageous. And be kind to yourself. Infection prevention is an incredibly rewarding field, but it takes time and patience to develop confidence and find your groove. Fail forward. Embracing a growth mindset will take you wher - ever you want to go. When working with various teams, approach challenges with a positive, col - laborative attitude \"...we are all here for the same common purpose\u2014patient safety.\" Start building connections with professionals inside and outside your organizations who inspire you to become the best version of yourself. 7. How can you use infection prevention to bridge the equity, diversity, and inclusion gap? In the coming year, I plan to expand my com - munity outreach by engaging with local schools to promote the IPC profession. I believe it's important for young students, especially those in underserved communities, to learn about infection prevention as a career option and to see professionals who look like me happy and thriving in the field. I hope to inspire the hearts and minds of these young schol - ars by providing them access and opportunity to connect with IP professionals around the globe. Figure.

As the scope of infection prevention expands from the traditional inpatient service lines to settings such as ambulatory, surgery, and dialysis centers com - bined with the transition from singular healthcare facilities to healthcare systems, there is a neces - sity to increase infection prevention staffing to ensure a high quality of care.1 Additionally, over the past few years, the requirements for regu - latory reporting have increased and with it the responsibility of infection preventionists (IPs) to lead performance improvement projects to reduce healthcare-associated infections. IPs now require a broader range of professional leadership skills. While the scope and responsibilities of infection preven - tion programs increase, the shortage of IPs to meet these new demands is also increasing. It is anticipated that 40% of IPs will retire within the next decade.2 Within this group are IPs with the most years of experience and the highest percentage of certified IPs. Additionally, a survey conducted in 2019 regard - ing recruitment and hiring practices for IPs has identified that 25% of IP positions are vacant, and 43% of those positions have been vacant for longer than 3 months.3 Due to the rapidly growing need for qualified IPs to replace those who are retiring, there is much work occurring to increase the pipeline of candidates into the infection prevention profes - sion. Mentorship is a strategy that will bring others into the field and ensure those who are already in the profession continue their journey from novice to expert IP. Mentorship is defined as \"the influence, guidance, or direction given by a mentor.\"4 This professional relationship is mutually beneficial for the mentee, who receives knowledge and expertise, and for the mentor, who develops leadership capabilities and hones professional skills. It is well established both outside of and within healthcare that mentorship increases retention and job satisfaction of employees for both the mentor and mentee.5,6Mentorship can be accomplished in two ways, either infor - mally or through a formal mentorship program. Informal mentorship is less structured and may develop naturally out of personal or professional relationships. It tends to be a long-term relationship that may or may not have specific goals, where the mentor is a coach or advisor as needed. A formal mentorship typically has a defined timeframe and specific goals to accomplish. Mentors and mentees are some - times matched, and pairings can be based on the goals or the experience sought by the mentee and the specific expertise of the mentor.7 According to the expert level of the APIC Competency Model, it is our responsibility as IPs to participate in mentorship.8 The model depicts the stages of professional development for the IP. The APIC Competency Model's Novice Roadmap is a useful tool in identifying gaps in knowledge and gives direction to the IP's professional development.9 Expert IPs may be drawn to mentorship based on a desire to give back. Many IPs describe how they were encouraged and mentored along their path to become expert IPs. Mentorship comes naturally to some, and the relationships may simply develop informally within the expert IP's circle of influence. This informal relationship is one form of mentorship. Other, more formal relationships may be included in the training plan for an IP program or through a local APIC chapter mentorship 34 | FALL 2021 | Prevention Table 1. Mentorship advantages. Mentor Mentee Build leadership skills Control your career path Mutual learning opportunity Assistance in finding solutions Expanded network Expanded network Give back to your profession Benefit from another's experience Source: IPAC Canada Handbook for mentoring Committee; Formal mentorship may be conducted one on one or in a group. Sometimes distance mentoring is needed due to proximity to experts and mentees. As mentioned earlier, the benefits of the mentor-mentee relationship are bidirectional (see Table 1). Mentorship ben - efits the professional growth of both the mentor and mentee. Just as development and assessment of gaps in knowledge are recommended for the novice IP, the same should also be done for the expert IP. This is the beauty of the IP profession\u2014 constant growth and learning are part of the role. IPs continue to develop professionally when they serve as mentors, which in turn helps to hone the skills associated with successful mentor - ship. Additionally, mentorship brings professional and personal satisfaction to guide others along their career and life path. It has also become an important aspect of succession planning for infection prevention programs to attract and maintain IPs. For the mentor: Opportunities to mentor arise in various ways. Some informal mentoring relationships may progress into a formal arrangement over time, while other opportunities are more purposeful. Seek opportunities through the local APIC chapter or within your own organization. If your local APIC chapter does not have a program, consider taking the lead on developing one for your chapter members. If you lead an IPC program, consider formalizing your internal mentoring program to build leaders within your organization. By doing so, you are also building a succession plan. Both mentor and mentee must commit to their own development. Consider your own strengths and challenges and seek out training and advice that will assist you in becoming an effective mentor. For the mentee: To seek out an informal mentor, start by forming professional relationships with a person who has accom - plished what you would like to accomplish, whether they are a few steps ahead or an expert in their field. This can be accom - plished through networking; a great place to network is within your local APIC chapter. Remember as you search to keep in mind the characteristics of a mentor mentioned in the list. Once you have established a connection, let the person know that you aspire to reach similar goals and ask to spend time talking to them about how they have gotten to where they are. Allow the relationship to evolve organically from that point forward. If they are open and approachable, continue to seek out their advice on your career development. As a mentee, you should take initiative with your mentor and shape the agenda of the relationship. To get the most out of your mentorship, whether it is an informal or formal arrangement, approach any interaction with specific goals in mind and associated questions, not simply relying on the mentor to instruct you on tasks you should complete. You must also be open to feedback and not expect that your mentor will have all the answers or be an expert in every area. At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your career development and your mentor can be a great resource to guide you along your journey. There are excellent APIC resources to guide the mentor and mentee. Understanding the APIC Competency Model and using the assessment tools to identify areas where additional develop - ment is needed will give the mentor and mentee a starting off point.

As we learn more about effective ways to recruit, hire, and train IPs, our field can progress to include other professional back - grounds.\" -Sara M. ReeseAJIC AUTHOR INTERVIEW Challenges and opportunities in recruiting, hiring, and training infection preventionists across facility settings WHY IS YOUR AREA OF FOCUS IMPORTANT (OR RELEVANT) FOR THE INFECTION PREVENTIONIST AND OTHER HEALTHCARE WORKERS? Gilmartin : Recruitment, hiring, and training of IPs is an important focus, for there are not enough of us to do the work (many are retiring or leaving the field). The best recruitment strategy is to retain our current IPs and develop them into experts in their organization, community, state or nationally. The next best recruit - ment strategy is to seek talent far and wide: nurses, laboratory scientists, public health professionals, and foreign medical graduates. Also, create training programs for new graduates, those with little or no clinical experience, or those coming to infection prevention from diverse clinical backgrounds. Last, provide career long 36 | FALL 2021 | Prevention mentorship to guide new and experienced IPs in the art and science of infection prevention and epidemiology. This way our field will innovate, adapt, and ensure patient safety for decades to come. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH YOUR WORK? Reese : I would like to move the field of infection prevention forward by including diverse professional backgrounds, which only make the field stronger. As we learn more about effective ways to recruit, hire, and train IPs, our field can progress to include other professional backgrounds. In my experience, the stronger teams of IPs include nurses, public health profes - sionals, data analysts, and performance improvement specialists. If we can learn how to train professionals with different backgrounds (outside of nursing) to be effective IPs, healthcare facilities would be more open to recruiting other disciplines, which only make our field stronger with different skill sets and perspectives. Smathers : I'd like to see IP hiring man - agers embrace hiring novice IPs from diverse backgrounds. Something that I've heard over the years from manag - ers is, 'I don't have time to train some - one,' but if we continue with that way of thinking, we will run out of IPs from the existing pool. As people retire and leave the field, we need to commit to training new talent and need to look for these individuals across healthcare and public health disciplines. I hope that our research inspires hiring managers to think differ - ently about their hiring and recruiting processes so that we can build a healthy workforce of future IPs. WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE LED UP TO YOUR CURRENT WORK? Smathers : As a hiring manager of IPs, I had experienced a challenge in recruit - ing experienced IPs and have witnessed a surge in MPH grads who are interested in the field, but many didn't have expe - rience in healthcare. When I saw the MegaSurvey publication by Sara Reese and Heather Gilmartin, I was excited by the data which showed the benefits of diverse backgrounds and the paper generated some other questions for me about the hiring and recruiting of IPs. When I emailed Sara and Heather with these questions, they knew that we couldn't answer these questions with the data that was collected from the 2015 survey, but they were very interested in partnering to answer these questions as they were important for the field. Gilmartin : Dr. Reese and I have worked together since 2008, when we were mem - bers of the Colorado Department of Public Health: Health Facility Acquired Infections Advisory Committee. I have a nursing background and she had a public health background. We spent many hours talking about how our training influ - enced our perceptions of the field. This led to a project with the APIC Research Committee that looked at data from the 2015 APIC MegaSurvey. We were curious what were the educational characteristics of practicing IPs. We found that in 2015, IPs with a nursing background dominated the profession, but IPs with laboratory sci - ence and public health backgrounds were out there. We also found that each group played to their strengths. IPs with a nurs - ing background reported spending most of their time focused on prevention and control of HAIs, while IPs with a laboratory scientist background focused on interpre - tation of surveillance data and IPs with a public health background focused on com - munication and feedback. We concluded that infection prevention departments could benefit from hiring IPs from diverse professional backgrounds, and published these results in 2017 in AJIC (doi: 10.1016/j. YOU ABOUT YOUR WORK? Reese : I love learning more about the field of infection prevention as well as networking with young IPs to help mentor them towards a lengthy career in infection prevention! We are in a new world with IPs as many are coming out of school interested in the field, so we have an opportunity to recreate this field to be a lifelong career. WHAT'S NEXT? Smathers : I am very excited by the work of the APIC Academic Pathway and see this as a turning point in our field. As we deliberately create a path to careers in infection prevention and control, we will be not only safeguarding our future, but will also be increasing the visibility and showing the importance of our profession.

Anything not directly related to this mission was just noise. So, when my com - munity/public health nursing course overlapped with adult critical care nursing, I did not prioritize the content. My wise professor was aware of the priorities with which her course competed against, and yet her dedication to the topic didn't waver. Her passion and skill for educating engrained within me a need to stop alleviating the pains of the tertiary disease and injury by focusing upstream and preventing them instead. It was through the didactic and practice experiences she fostered that I updated my original mission and pivoted towards prevention by becoming a public health nurse.RECRUITING THE NEXT GENERATION OF IPs Igniting interest BY MARIE H. WILSON on the same mission I had found myself at that stage. My experience provided a unique voice with which to reach them, an opportunity I used to share the value of prevention in healthcare. Establish a diverse team Interest in and action towards incorpo - rating infection prevention programs at college and university levels started before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic will serve as a catalyst to expand their presence beyond nursing or public health degree plans. Infection prevention pro - grams benefit from diversity of background on the team, so how can we facilitate this earlier in professional plan - ning? Imagine an operating room elective course open to all health professions that incorporates principles of point-of-use cleaning and disinfection. Imagine a multi-disciplinary clinical experience that facilitates a mass vaccination clinic.1 Imagine an engineering minor degree plan emphasizing infection control risk aversion in building and construction. By being a part of the design for these educa - tional opportunities for students, we can inspire a future cohort with the mission of becoming an infection preventionist much sooner. Connect, partner, develop Interested in engaging with a college or university? Consider these ideas for advancing the profession: 1) Connect with your alma mater or a pre - vious mentor. Offer to come back and guest lecture. It isn't difficult to make the presentation unique and engaging; students are often invigorated by the new voice at the front of the room (whether virtual or in-person). A great icebreaker to describe our scope in the hospital is the Infection Preventionists Save Lives video produced by APIC in 2018.2 2) Partner with your local APIC chapter to invite instructors and/or students as guest attendees at educational and networking offerings. 3) Develop an internship program within your organization for students in health professions (e.g., nursing, public health, pre-med, etc.). Just like primary prevention, the earlier we get involved in training the future of our profession the greater the impact we will ultimately have.

They step into the role for IPC awareness and motivate staff for practice improvement. Training on IPC is important for them to fully function as link nurses. In the United Kingdom, link nurses have shown to be of value as they are vital in practice improvement in scored audits and in implementing policies in addition to collection of unit data for healthcare- associated infections.1 In our facility, Al Wakra Hospital, link nurses were selected by the head nurses of the unit and trained on-site by the IPC practitioner covering the unit. Sporadic trainings are offered to the link nurses and neither how much information is con - veyed nor how many educational activities they attend is monitored. Yet, they are the point person and liaison of the clinical unit and the facility IPC practitioner. It has been observed that IPC practices are different across the hospital and knowl - edge of the links staff is not standardized. The links staff as well as the nursing staff have frequently requested training so that any misunderstandings are clarified and RECRUITING THE NEXT GENERATION OF IPs BY FEAH ALTURA-VISAN practices are standardized. Observations among rounds done by members of the IPC team, the Quality and Patient Safety (QPS) Department, and department heads, have shown inconsistencies in IPC knowledge and practices. The solution The Al Wakra Hospital is part of the Hamad Medical Corporation in the State of Qatar. The facility IPC team in collaboration with the Nurse Education team established the \"Essentials for Infection Prevention and Control Course for Link Staff\" training course in 2017 based on the APIC Competency Model. The goal is to provide IPC link nurses with an extensive 5-day training that will encourage accountability, ownership, and collaboration within the facility's IPC program. The purpose of this course is to enhance the confidence and practice of link nurses by improving their knowledge and skills as they contribute to the prac - tice of IPC. Thus, the aims of Hamad Medical Corporation in the provision of \"best care\" are supported. Furthermore, IPC practices will be standardized and improved. The result is provision of quality and efficient, infection-free ser - vices to all. All IPC link nurses are expected to attend and pass the Essentials of IPC course. The training consists of advanced lectures on microbiology, standard and expanded isolation precautions, engi - neering of an isolation room, infec - tious diseases, antibiotic stewardship, healthcare worker vaccination, quality improvement, adult education, and healthcare-associated infections. It is conducted by multidisciplinary experts to include microbiology and infectious dis - ease consultants, nurse educator, CSSD lead, quality reviewer, facility engineer, and the infection preventionists. There are hospital tours in the microbiology department, waste treatment plant, air handling unit area, central sterilization unit, and endoscopy decontamination area to seal the information discussed during the didactics. At the same time, this is done to understand that IPC involves a multi-disciplinary group of different specialties, all moving parts cre - ating the whole IPC program. Moreover, there are workshops that include PPE validation and healthcare-associated infection case studies.Case Study from QatarThrough 'Link Nurses': Building the IPC Team 40 | FALL 2021 | Prevention As part of summative evaluation, 30-item examinations are provided and a passing rate of 80% is required to pass the course. In addition, the APIC Self-Assessment survey is provided before the first class and after the completion of the presentations on the fifth day.2 A ran - dom survey after 6 months from comple - tion of the course is also conducted. The main output of this intense train - ing is involving the links staff in identify - ing the top three IPC risk events using a five-by-five risk assessment matrix. An IPC program plan will then be estab - lished by the IPC links staff and pre - sented to their divisional administration, facility IPC committee, and chair, assis - tant executive of quality and patient safety, and the executive director of nurs - ing by the end of the week (fifth day). The training serves as a platform for the links staff and their superiors to agree, commit, and decide on improving the IPC practices in their individual clinical units and specialties. This program will be rolled out for 4 months, until the next cohort of IPC link nurses will evaluate and revise the program based on the new data and observations made. The course is accredited by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners (QCHP) and American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). This brings a new generation of IPC links staff who know, understand, perform, and rationalize IPC practices, leading healthcare-associated infection preven - tion strategies and spearheading innova - tive ideas for practice improvement in healthcare-associated infection preven - tion, patient isolation, sharps injury pre - vention, and hand hygiene. Methodology: Lewin's Change Model Unfreeze\u2014Change\u2014Freeze. Being able to identify that there is a practice gap is the first stage of change.

The IPC links staff will risk assess prac - tice gaps, prioritize the risks, and pro - vide a plan for implementation. With the knowledge, skills, motivation, commu - nication, and continuous assessments, change has been observed not just from the IPC links staff but from the clinical unit practices, as well. Discussion IPC staff has provided excellent feed - back after the sessions. On the 6-month post-lecture random survey, the IPC links staff shared that they have con - fidently practiced and answered inqui - ries related to IPC. Their clinical leads also have witnessed the changes\u2014they have been more assertive, proactive, accountable, and confident in their IPC implementations. With the activities of the IPC links staff, there has been improvement in hand hygiene prac - tices from an average of 45% in 2011 when the hospital initially opened to an average of 97% by the end of 2020. There has been an observed reduction in healthcare-associated infections, as the compliance to the care bundles for prevention has improved tremendously from a fluctuating average of 70% in 2017 to an average of 90% at the end of 2020. Currently, the IPC links staff play a vital role in the Al Wakra Hospital IPC program. The IPC team is working with them at unit and divisional levels on quality improvement projects. This has also presented a new opportu - nity to the trained IPC links staff. Since 2017, there have been 300 graduates of the essentials of IPC for link staff class. Among the graduates, three were pro - moted from staff nurse to IPC reviewer (starting stage of IPC), while four were promoted to IPC practitioners. The cor - porate IPC recommended to newly joined IPC staff to attend the training as part of their orientation, and other govern - ment health entities were sent to attend this training as well. In addition, there have been graduates that further went and successfully passed their Certification Board of Infection Control (CBIC) exam - inations. There have been great reviews among those that completed the course and are now in IPC positions across the corporation. Ongoing research is being done from the surveys taken from the IPC link staff comparing their self-assessment on the first day, fifth day, and then randomly 6 months after completion of the course. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as it hit Qatar, especially when our facility became a hospital for COVID-19 positive cases on the second wave, our IPC links staff have helped a lot in the implementa - tion of the PPE use, hand hygiene practices, hot and cold routes, exposure risk assess - ments, and follow up. It has helped lift a lot of heavy burden from the facility IPC team. In conclusion, this activity established a network of proficient IPC link staff that will lead their peers and support improvement projects performed on their respective units. The training resulted in effective, standardized, and safe care being provided, leading to health - care-associated infection reduction and prevention. It has led to motivated and inspired IPC link staff who are looking forward to becoming a permanent part of the IPC family. References 1. Dawson, SJ. The role of the infection control link nurse.

I got my BS in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Studies and my MS in Emerging Infectious Diseases. I've been working in public health, more specifically infectious disease epidemi - ology, for over 10 years. While I was in graduate school I worked on a federally funded project that tracked emerging biological and chemical threats among NAVIGATING CHANGE IN CARE Infusing SciComm into Infection Prevention: BY SASKIA POPESCU The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed many vulnerabilities within our response to infectious diseases. We will likely be studying and discussing these for years to come, but one of the most significant breakdowns we've experienced has been in communication. Infection prevention and public health efforts rely on effective communication to educate, train, and drive change. Science communication, often referred to as SciComm , has become increasingly important as we navigate the world of vaccinations, changing public health guidance, and global versus regional response. Recently, I chatted with science communicator and epidemiologist Jessica Malaty Rivera, MS, to discuss her work, this pandemic, and lessons we can apply moving forward. Currently, Rivera also serves as the Science Communication Lead for The COVID Tracking Project, a member of the COVID-19 Dispersed Volunteer Research Network, and an expert contributor for dozens of news sources. humans and animal populations across the globe. We used open-source media to identify indicators and warnings of epidemics and pandemics. My work as an analyst trained me to become a science communicator as we were translating complex science and health information from over 50 languages into simple and easy to understand summaries for diverse audiences. That experience has uniquely prepared me for the COVID-19 pan - demic, and I feel extremely humbled to be a resource.ONE THING I SEE INCREASINGLY SKATED OVER\u2014CAN YOU DEFINE SCIENCE COMMUNICATION 'SCICOMM'? Sir Mark Walport wrote, 'Science isn't finished until it's communicated.' I like to think of science communication as the last mile of the scientific process\u2014 taking the findings from labs, universi - ties, and research groups to a wider and more diverse audience. I also feel very strongly that the work of science commu - nication is not \"dumbing things down\" but rather increasing people's science and data literacy. WHILE THIS IS A HUGE TOPIC THAT WE COULD PROBABLY DISCUSS FOR HOURS, HOW DO YOU FEEL SCICOMM HAS PLAYED OUT DURING COVID-19? The scientific process is exactly that\u2014a process. Because it is constantly evolv - ing through ongoing research, the way we talk about it through press releases, preprints, headlines, and social media requires precision, nuance, and a lot of caveats. We've seen way too many hot takes as journalists and \"influencers\" seek eyes and clicks on their pieces. It's been incredibly frustrating to see everything An Interview with Jessica Malaty Rivera 46 | FALL 2021 | Prevention from infighting from experts on terminol - ogy to armchair experts opine on topics well out of their expertise. Both of these issues further erode public trust. IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT ARE THE AREAS SCIENTISTS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH DURING THE PANDEMIC? Science communication as an after - thought is one of our biggest failures in responding to this pandemic. Many of us in this space were bracing for the info - demic to emerge as we saw government and public health officials delay mes - sages and publicly contradict each other. I recognize how difficult it is to respond in a clear and unanimous voice in the midst of a novel virus outbreak, but this is truly a consequence of years of defund - ing and deprioritizing infectious disease surveillance and public health research at a federal level. One specific example is the missed opportunity for a vaccine commu - nication plan as part of Operation Warp Speed. Ensuring that vaccines turn into vaccinations requires trust and confidence to be built through consistent, transpar - ent, and easy to understand information for everyone . It's plausible that if we had prepared for the predictable scourge of misinformation and disinformation, many more lives could have been spared from COVID-19. AND THE AREAS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL? Responding to public health emergen - cies involves a lot of interdisciplinary collaboration. I have been so impressed to see people from nearly every back - ground step up to do everything from helping make COVID-19 data avail - able to the public to sharing credible information on social media to combat the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation. WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED THAT IP s WOULD BENEFIT FROM? Nuance and context are key to sci - ence communication, especially when covering topics like risk and hazard. Even the difference between those two terms is often lost in public health messages. Hazard refers to things that can poten - tially cause harm, whereas risk is the combination of hazards and exposure. Being extra clear on what activities, environments, substances, etc., present true risk is critical to influence risk miti - gating behavior and effective infection prevention. MOVING FORWARD, DO YOU THINK THAT COVID-19 WILL SET A PRECEDENT FOR THE IMPACT OF SCICOMM ON PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS? Absolutely. This pandemic has brought public health to the center stage which has its pros and cons. While terms like 'flatten the curve' and 'herd immunity' are now vernacular, many scientific terms have been manipulated for the sake of politics, religion, and even social clout, making the work of science communi - cators even harder. Science communica - tion must be folded into all public health interventions, emergencies or not. IF THERE WAS ONE THING YOU WISH YOU'D KNOWN EARLIER IN THE PANDEMIC, WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN? WOULD IT HAVE MADE YOUR JOB EASIER? Sadly, I wish I knew that the CDC would truly not be able to perform the tasks they were designed to perform from day one. Many of us, particularly those working closely with COVID-19 data, were holding our breath for the CDC to come back 'online'; that day really didn't come until 2021. The fallout of not having federal data standards available to all 56 states and jurisdictions has made analyzing and writing about COVID-19 data incredibly challenging. LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE, HOW CAN WE IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES, AND EVEN BOOSTERS THAT WILL BE NEEDED, THROUGH BETTER TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION? In the same way that vaccine hesitancy isn't one thing, science communication isn't, either. Science communication requires cultural competence and emo - tional intelligence so that it can reach wide audiences. Increasing vaccine con - fidence cannot happen from one mes - sage, or even one messenger. There are communities who have and continue to struggle with legitimate medical trauma, there are communities who have varying degrees of access to internet and digital resources, and there are people with dif - ferent abilities that make trusting medical professionals, academia, politicians, and even the regulatory system really diffi - cult. This work requires not just scientists adopting SciComm as part of their work, but it also involves training lay leaders and community members to become cham - pions of science and data.

Mansi: The Phase 2/3 study of mRNA-1273 in adolescents ages 12-17 years completed enrollment in the U.S. An initial analysis of 3,732 participants randomized 2:1 in TeenCOVE Study showed a vaccine efficacy rate of 93% in seronegative participants who received at least one injection in a secondary analysis. The analysis included 15 cases (13 in the placebo group and 2 in the mRNA-1273 group) reported 14 days after first dose and based on the CDC definition of COVID-19, which requires one COVID-19 symptom and paired with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The median duration for fol - low-up in this initial analysis was 53 days following the second dose. mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills. The Conditional NAVIGATING CHANGE IN CARE Prevention Strategist speaks with: The Prevention Strategist editorial panel had the opportunity to interview a representa - tive from Moderna regarding the Moderna vaccine, current COVID-19 trends, and what Moderna has in the works. Marketing Authorization for Spikevax (previously known as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) in the European Union has been expanded to include adolescents 12 years of age and older. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare also approved Moderna Inc.'s COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 to 17. Moderna has filed for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for adolescents with the FDA as well as with additional regulatory agencies around the world. GLOBAL HEALTH PS: Has the Moderna vaccine been distributed and used world-wide? If so, which countries have used it? Mansi: Moderna has received emer - gency (or other conditional, interim or provisional) authorization for use of its COVID-19 vaccine in adults from health agencies in more than 50 countries and an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization, as well as authorization for use of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents ages 12 and up in the European Union and Japan. On June 1, 2021, the Company initiated the rolling submission process for a Biologics License Application for the vaccine in the U.S. and expects to complete its submis - sion in August. Moderna is working with additional health agencies on the autho - rization and/or approval of its vaccine in additional jurisdictions. BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, partially supported the research and development of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with federal funding under Contract no. 75A50120C00034. Moderna retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. SIDE EFFECTS PS: Many women are experiencing the \"third breast\" reaction as a side effect, with the axillary lymph node swelling to the size of a grapefruit. Can Moderna share any additional information on vaccinated women having potentially abnormal mammograms or having to delay mammograms due to overstimu - lated lymph nodes on their vaccine side arm? Is Moderna tracking the sequelae of this particular side effect? Mansi: In the phase 3 clinical trial, axillary lymph node swelling or tender - ness occurred in 19.8% of participants 18 years of age and older. Moderna does continue to track these occurrences in the real world post-vaccination. James Mansi, Moderna Vice President for Medical Affairs, North America James Mansi, PhD, has close to 25 years of experience in pharmaceutical research and development. He has been involved with the development and introduction of several novel vaccines, most notably human rotavirus vaccine, human papillomavirus vaccine, zoster vaccine, invasive meningococcal vaccines, the MF59- adjuvanted and cell-based seasonal influenza vaccines. James obtained his doctoral degree in Physiology and Endocrinology from Universit\u00e9 Laval (Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada).James Mansi 48 | FALL 2021 | Prevention However, as swelling can occur in the underarm and radiate down into the breast, the Society Breast Imaging offers considerations for patients and providers scheduling screening exams stating: \"If possible, and when it does not unduly delay care, consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination or 4-6 weeks following the second dose of a Position%20Statements/2021/ SBI-recommendations-for- managing-axillary-adenopathy-post- COVID-vaccination.pdf .) BOOSTERS PS: Pfizer initially circulated that the booster would be administered 12 months after completion. Is there any estimate as to what the booster dose interval might be for Moderna? Mansi: In a Phase 2 study, vaccination with 50 \u00b5g of three different Moderna mRNA booster candidates induced robust antibody responses against the wildtype D614G COVID-19 strain and against important variants of concern including Gamma (P.1); Beta (B.1.351); and Delta (B.1.617.2). The booster candidates included mRNA-1273, investigational mRNA-1273.351, and investigational mRNA-1273.211. Neutralizing antibody levels following the boost approached those observed after primary vaccination with two doses of 100 \u00b5g of mRNA-1273. These data have been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. PS: Can you provide some back - ground and context to the recent FDA EUA update and ACIP recommenda - tions on a third dose of COVID vaccine to immunosuppressed patients? Mansi: The FDA has approved an update to the EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) to include a third dose for immunocom - promised individuals 18 years of age or older in the United States who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.A recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 120 individuals who had undergone solid organ transplant pro - cedures (heart, kidney, kidney-pancreas, liver, lung, pancreas) demonstrated that a third dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine improved immune response com - pared to placebo. In the study, the third dose of mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated.1 Pursuant to this FDA authorization, the U.S. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted unanimously in support of a third dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) for those people who are immunocompromised. We recognize the need to protect those at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 disease and we remain committed to help - ing to end the COVID-19 pandemic with our mRNA vaccine. Reference 1.

N Engl doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2111462 VARIANTS PS: Has Moderna continued to study the duration of immunity from the first two doses of the vaccine? Mansi: In final analysis of Phase 3 COVE study data, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine showed 93% effi - cacy, with the efficacy remaining durable through 6 months after administration of the second dose. PS: The coronavirus was stable for many months before variants began to appear. What triggers the variants? Are the variants stabilizing or continu - ing to change? Do they force a \"drift\" (small amount of variation) and \"shift\" (a large amount of variation), similar to the flu virus...or too early to tell? Mansi: New data on the durability of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in generating neutralizing antibodies against variants of concern was recently published in Science. According to the paper, the majority of individuals vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine main - tained both binding and functional antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants for 6 months after the second dose. These data support the durable effi - cacy of 93% seen with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine through 6 months. We expect that these data and the grow - ing body of real-world evidence will help inform health regulators' approaches to how and when to administer additional boosting doses. This study used a variety of assays and showed that after two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, binding and neutralizing antibodies were gener - ated against ancestral strain of the virus and against the variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Iota. While some waning in antibody levels was observed over time, the major - ity of participants had detectable neutral - izing antibody titers at 6 months after the completion of the primary series. A trend towards lower antibody lev - els against SARS-CoV-2 spike variants was observed in the oldest individu - als at Day 209 (through 6 months). Differences were small, however, and there was overlap between age groups. Importantly, many individuals in the oldest group retained neutralizing activ - ity against the variants 6 months after the second vaccine dose. These data complement other recent observations based on real world evi - dence demonstrating robust longev - ity of clinical efficacy of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,1 effectiveness in the face of rising levels of the Delta variant of concern,2 and in those harder to treat populations such as those people in long- term care facilities,3 or those patients living with cancer.4 References 1.

(For example, COVID-19 and MERS-CoV, or flu and COVID-19.) Mansi: Moderna plans to explore potential combination vaccines against flu, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syn - cytial virus what was accomplished with COVID-19 be applied to any new emerging pathogens? Mansi: Moderna's mRNA vaccine technology offers potential advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability, which may position our company as a leader in preparing for and responding to infectious disease threats that place mil - lions of people at risk around the world. There are currently nine prophylac - tic mRNA vaccines in our development pipeline, with seven Phase 1 studies cur - rently underway. We believe mRNA-based vaccines offer several advantages, including: Ability to mimic many aspects of natu - ral viral infections. mRNA enters cells and is used to produce viral antigen proteins from within the cell that include natural, post-translational modifications. This mimics the process by which natural viral infections occur, where information from viral genomes is used to produce viral proteins from within a cell. This can potentially enhance the immune response, includ - ing improved B and T cell responses. Multiplexing of mRNA for more compelling product profiles. Multiple mRNAs encoding for multiple viral proteins can be included in a single vaccine, permitting production of com - plex multimeric antigens that are much more difficult to achieve with tradi - tional technologies. As an example, our CMV vaccine (mRNA-1647) contains six mRNAs, five of which encode five different proteins that combine to form a pentameric protein complex that is a potentially critical antigen for immune protection against CMV. Rapid discovery and advancement of mRNA programs into the clinic. Many viral antigens are known. However, with traditional vaccines, the target pathogens or antigens have to be pro - duced in dedicated cell-cultures and/ or fermentation-based manufacturing production processes in order to initiate testing of potential vaccine constructs. Our ability to design our antigens in silico allows us to rapidly produce and test antigens in preclinical models, which can dramatically accelerate our vaccine selection. Capital efficiency and speed from shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure. Traditional vaccines require product-dedicated production processes, facilities, and operators. Our mRNA vaccines are produced in a manufacturing process that is suf - ficiently consistent across our pipeline to allow us to use a single facility to produce all of our mRNA vaccines.

The day started off like any other. With my kids and husband sound asleep, I got ready for work then headed out to the Washington State Department of Health (WA-DOH). My calendar looked like a normal day of meetings with the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Team I manage, another with healthcare partners to discuss prevention of multi-drug resistant organisms, and even some meeting-free time to plan HAI projects.of navigating change during COVID-19: ISTOCK.COM/RATTANKUN THONGBUNThe author with her youngest son. www.apic.org | 518:45am, Epidemiology Morning Huddle. Our Office Director announced that the first U.S. case of what we now know to be COVID-19 was confirmed in a resident of Washington State. The patient had received care at a local clinic, and we needed to trace back their steps to assess transmission risk to others. My IP colleague and I hopped in the car and, along with local public health and the clinic IP, we toured the clinic and inter - viewed staff. Fast forward to July 31, 2021. I have been activated on WA-DOH's COVID-19 incident management team (IMT) for 554 consecutive days as the healthcare outbreak unit supervisor. Change is inevitable and generally, I'm ok with waves of change, but the past 554 days have felt more like a tsunami of change. These days, I often remind myself that the IP profession has advanced because of change. IPs look to evidence-based practice to gauge and shift prevention methodologies. Research, implementation and dissemination science, and technol - ogy are part of the APIC Competency Model making them integral to what we do. If any profession was primed for the pandemic, it was infection prevention. Even so, IPs have been stretched to the limit and beyond. As look back on 554 days of activation, I've come to realize that three things have kept me going: reflection, restoration, and appreciation. Reflection. Since the outset of the pandemic, things have moved at an unprecedented, accelerated pace and at times it feels like Groundhog Day. As we begin to see upticks in cases and out - breaks again, it can feel disheartening. In these moments, I've learned to reflect to the early days of the pandemic when we didn't have a test for the virus, under - stand the transmission modality, or have a vaccine. It's important to remember where we started and how much we've accomplished. Reflection doesn't need to be cumbersome; it can be as simple as talking to a friend, journaling, or stepping away from our computers and thinking about the past. Recently, I stepped away from my computer to organize files in our HAI Team's office space. In doing so, I hit historical APIC gold. I found a cabi - net brimming with APIC conference proceedings dating back to 1973! That year, Dr. James Whitby presented on the role of the computer in hospital epi - demiological studies. He described the system he developed as a combination of punch card machines and typewriters to track Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and other organisms (1973, APIC Conference Proceedings, Toronto, Canada). Through these historical docu - ments, I was reminded that as IPs, we've been a part of remarkable discoveries, including the prevention of bloodborne pathogens, measures to quell antimicro - bial resistance, and innovations with HAI surveillance. I'm grateful to my predeces - sors for paving the way for the infection prevention profession. While Dr. Whitby described his system as \"unsophisticated and clumsy,\" it's illustrative of a rung in the ladder that led to the more sophisti - cated surveillance methods we use today for COVID-19 and other HAIs. Restoration. Our DOH healthcare outbreak response team has logged incredible hours responding to outbreaks \"I've learned to reflect to the early days of the pandemic when we didn't have a test for the virus, understand the transmission modality, or have a vaccine. It's important to remember where we started and how much we've accomplished. Reflection doesn't need to be cumbersome; it can be as simple as talking to a friend, journaling, or stepping away from our computers and thinking about the past.\"NAVIGATING CHANGE IN CARE in long-term care facilities. Whether we worked on the frontlines responding to outbreaks, conducted surveillance, or developed policies and educated staff, we are likely feeling the heavy hand of response fatigue. Stepping away from our screens can do wonders for our well-being. I'm learning to unplug, through rest, fam - ily time, and exercise. Scheduling these intentional restoration breaks through - out the week is key to sustaining our IP workforce. Appreciation. When I walk down - town in the city where I live, I see well-designed and inviting outdoor res - taurant seating areas and streets closed off to cars to promote a walkable area that allows for safe physical distancing. Throughout the pandemic, I've marveled at the innovative ideas that businesses, public health, and healthcare have put in place to keep each other safe. Innovation is all around us and it gives me hope. Looking back at the last 554 days, I'm grateful that my IP colleagues have taught me that change can serve as a catalyst for both personal and professional growth, pushing us to take on bigger challenges and excel professionally.

Underlying respiratory disease was also associated with increased risk.3 The COVID-19 pandemic provided an optimal environment for this emerg - ing pathogen to colonize and infect vul - nerable patients. Many critical patients with COVID-19 were intubated and on ventilators for long periods of time, requiring tracheostomies. In addition, they required central lines for long-term IV therapy, indwelling urinary catheters, and long-term antibiotic therapy.2 The optimal environment for fungal infections Hospitals worldwide were challenged in many ways by the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient volume and acuity exceeded the capacity of hospitals.4 The impact on intensive care units was particularly overwhelming due to the extreme high acuity of patients, long lengths of stays, and increased mortality caused by the COVID-19 virus. Crisis strategies for personal protective equipment (PPE) con - servation were put in place. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were required to use PPE and other supplies that they were unfa - miliar with.5 There was an extreme short - age of commercially prepared disinfectant wipes, forcing HCWs to create wipes NAVIGATING CHANGE IN CARE An IP's worst nightmare using commercial disposable towels and bleach. As the pandemic per - sisted, HCW shortages became critical. This resulted in longer shifts, more shifts, and less recupera - tive time off for clinicians. Surge planning became a priority as did unconventional strat - egies for patient care. Hospitals used creative processes to conserve energy of HCWs as well as PPE supplies. Extended use of PPE The staff in the Infection Prevention Depart ment at Providence St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, began looking for alternative methods of providing safe patient care while extending the use of PPE. Three goals were kept at the forefront of the search: safe patient care, continued safety for our caregivers, and PPE conservation. A search led to a process using safety zones for donning and doffing PPE. A workflow for patient care using the safety zone process used by the Environmental Protection Agency under their Emergency Response Plan was developed. The safety zones of hot, warm, and cold indi - cated variable levels of contamination. Caregivers were required to wear face masks at all times as part of the universal masking protocol. The cold zone would be considered free from viral contamina - tion. The warm zone, where donning and doffing would occur, would be considered to have moderate contamination. Lastly, the patient's room where the patient care occurs, or \"hot zone,\" would be consid - ered to have the highest level of viral con - tamination. All caregivers were educated on the new workflow as well as the don - ning and doffing process. Caregivers who entered the room were directed to wear isolation gowns, masks, and face shields, moving from patient to patient through the warm zone. Changing of gloves and hand hygiene between patients remained essential. If patients had any additional infections other than COVID-19 or had unconfirmed COVID-19, this strategy was not used, and gowns were changed along with gloves and hand hygiene between patients.Outbreak during a pandemic: ISTOCK.COM/LUKATDBBY CLAUDIA SKINNER, LILIAN ABLIR, AND TODD BLOOM www.apic.org | 55Now for the outbreak The Department of Public Health received multiple reports of increased healthcare-associated C. auris cases in the county. Our first C. auris index case was identified from a clinical culture. This patient had multiple room changes through - out hospitalization including a short stay in the intermediate care COVID-19 unit. A second clinical isolate was identified a week after. The patient stayed in the same COVID-19 unit the entire hospitalization. These two cases prompted an outbreak investigation. Although both patients were not in the intermediate care unit at the same time, both were on ventilators and were receiving hemodialysis treatment. Upon notification to the County Healthcare Agency, a point prevalence study (PPS) was recommended to the three units occupied by these patients. The units provided critical care for COVID-19 patients on ventilators and other patients requiring cardiac and intermediate level care. A total of eight PPS were conducted to assess for C. auris colonization. C. auris swabbing requires a single swab to both axilla and groin and specimens were sent to an out-of-state public health laboratory for processing. Multiple processes were put into place after the identification of the index case. However, C. auris has the ability to colo - nize patients asymptomatically and per - sist on surfaces contributing to outbreaks in healthcare settings.6 Time for action: Tactics to mitigate further spread On August 20, 2020, the local health department came to visit Providence St. Jude Medical Center for a consultative visit. Their recommendations were to focus on our environmental hygiene and use of shared equipment (i.e., vital sign machines, blood glucose machines, portable X-ray machines). A literature review was done which revealed key prevention strategies includ - ing accurate surveillance, environmental hygiene, and hand hygiene.7 In order to ensure accurate surveil - lance, a communication and education plan was required to ensure all caregiv - ers had the knowledge to identify the high-risk patients. All caregivers were provided education about C. auris , resis - tance, environmental persistence, vulner - able patient population, and potential for patient morbidity and mortality. Early identification through screening A screening process was developed to include all patients admitted from a skilled nursing facility (SNF) or long-term care facility (LTC) who had any lines, drains, or wounds. These patients were considered high risk and placed into presumptive contact isola - tion. Patients who were identified as at risk for C. auris had green tape placed at the threshold of the door to alert staff. This is a process that has been in place for years at this facility; red tape signifies an MDRO, and white tape indicates C. difficile . This, along with a sign on the entrance to the door, notified all who entered of what type of PPE to use, based on source, i.e., mask for droplet should the organism be in the tracheal aspi - rate. The tape is left on the floor until Environmental Services (EVS) has ter - minally cleaned the room to ensure they have clear understanding of what PPE is required. The disinfectant product EVS uses is effective against C. difficile and C. auris so no changes in products were required. Environmental hygiene C. auris in a patient care area, par - ticularly with high-acuity patients, is very difficult to eradicate. It colonizes the patient's skin and contaminates the hospital environments, requiring sus - tained efforts.3 Therefore, a strong part - nership between EVS staff, leadership, and infection prevention is necessary.8 During the outbreak, it was agreed upon that all rooms that housed a suspected or confirmed C. auris patient would receive a double terminal cleaning. EVS would first clean the discharged room with their approved disinfectant, and then re-clean the room with bleach wipes, to ensure nothing was left untouched. This practice continued for a few months until the C. auris patient volumes greatly declined. While it took more resources and time to double clean these rooms, it was criti - cal to do so, as most of these patients were housed in their rooms for weeks at a time, leaving more opportunity for heavy bioburden to adhere to surfaces. A courageous decision was made by the leadership team to stop all admissions to our high-acuity unit where the outbreak occurred until no further C. auris cases Table 1. Point prevalence study.

With this full unit closure, there was ample opportunity to utilize a combination of HALOMistTM (Hydrogen Peroxide Disinfecting Mist) and ATP audit - ing for room cleanliness. As the patient was discharged from a room, the room was kept empty until it could be fully refurbished. This included removal of glove box holders and syringe box hold - ers from the walls to be replaced with new equipment. Cracks and small holes in walls were repaired prior to fresh paint. All paper prod - ucts were discarded from drawers. This also allowed for any worn or torn furni - ture or equipment to be replaced, ceil - ing and plumbing to be investigated for any leaks, and dirt or dust to be removed. Before the unit was fully opened again, the rooms were terminally cleaned an additional time. Shared equipment cleaning A process was developed to easily identify clean equipment from used or contaminated equipment. Equipment such as bladder scanners, blood pres - sure machines, and wheelchairs were included, and other shared equipment. A bright pink tag was placed on the piece of equipment after cleaning and before placing into the proper storage location. When the equipment was taken out of storage or away from the hallway where it lived, the pink tag was removed and hung on a command hook in its storage location. When the equipment was returned to its storage location, the pink tag hanging on the wall acted as an easy reminder to immediately clean and replace the pink tag on the equip - ment. Pink tags were not to be left on the equipment during use. The process was taught and audited. Hand hygiene Education was required to ensure all were aware that this was not just another Candida , but instead a highly resis - tant, dangerous fungus that acts like a bacteria and has the potential to spread quickly to a vulnerable patient popu - lation. Hand hygiene was emphasized through discussion and audits with all disciplines involved. Expert help All eyes were on the immediate need to eradicate. Infection prevention leaders within our health system as well as our local public health care agency came to lend a hand and provide consultation on processes put in place. Having the extra set of eyes to review processes and ensure nothing was missed was an important part of our process. On September 24, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) visited our facility. An eight-person team, five from Epidemiological Intelligence Service, one from NIOSH, one expert on PPE, and one team lead came on site. They toured the facility, observed our processes and care, and reviewed our action plan. Although this was a friendly, consultative visit, it was intimidat - ing to realize our outbreak was at this level. Once the CDC team was on site, it became evident they were here to review, advise, and consult\u2014essentially to help us eradicate and maintain a C. auris -free environment. In our debrief with the CDC, they were very complimentary of our efforts, and provided the following recommenda - tions: continue current processes as they are working; closely audit the \"pink tag\" process, hand hygiene, and environmental hygiene; and prioritize commercially pre - pared wipes, as we were forced to create our own disinfectant wipes during this stage of the pandemic due to global shortages. They also advised us to stop the double WHY IS CANDIDA AURIS A PROBLEM? It causes serious infections. C. auris can cause bloodstream infections and even death, particularly in hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical prob - lems. More than one in three patients with invasive C. auris infection (for example, an infection that affects the blood, heart, or brain) die. It's often resistant to medicines . Antifungal medicines commonly used to treat Candida infections often don't work for Candida auris . Some C. auris infections have been resistant to all three types of antifungal medicines. It's becoming more common. Although C. auris was just discovered in 2009, it has spread quickly and caused infections in more than a dozen countries. It's difficult to identify. C. auris can be misidentified as other types of fungi unless specialized laboratory technology is used. This misidentification might lead to a patient getting the wrong treatment. It can spread in hospitals and nursing homes. C. auris has caused outbreaks in healthcare facilities and can spread through contact with affected patients and contami - nated surfaces or equipment. Good hand hygiene and cleaning in healthcare facilities is important because C. auris can live on surfaces for several weeks. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although the thought of the CDC visit - ing was initially intimidating, they were extremely approachable; we were able to glean much knowledge about the processes we had in place which gave us insight to continue these efforts. We continue to be in direct communication with our local public health department for ongoing support. Conclusion C. auris , within a high-acuity unit, patients on ventilators and with trache - ostomies, central lines, and wounds, can be devastating. The inherent persistence of this fungus further challenges HCWs. However, with the expertise of IPs, hard work of EVS and facilities, support of top leaders, and knowledge of experts in the field of epidemiology and disease control, this drug-resistant menace can be stopped and contained. Ongoing efforts are nec - essary to rapidly identify any high-risk patients, place into appropriate precautions, and communicate through the continuum of care to prevent further outbreaks in our hospital and in our community.
