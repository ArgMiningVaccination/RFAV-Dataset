ICH M11 Template 3 Interventional Clinical Trial Protocol Template 1 0 Foreword 2 0.1 Template Revision History 3 Date Description of Revision (To be determined) Initial template 0.2 Intended Use of Template 4 This template is intended for interventional clinical trials of drugs, vaccines, and drug/device 5 combinations intended to be registered as drugs. The template is suitable for all phases of 6 clinical research and all therapeutic areas. Existing ICH Guidelines and ISO 14155 were 7 considered in its development. The template is designed to enable modification suitable for the 8 particular trial. Refer to the sections below for additional details and conventions related to 9 flexibility. 10 0.3 Template Conventions and General Instructions 11 This template uses the typefaces described in the table below to distinguish between their 12 intended use and applicability. Use of consistent font sizes (12 point) throughout the document 13 is recommended, but not required. 14 Type of Text (Applicability) Typeface Details Description (Intended Use) Universal text Black Times New Roman font Text that should appear in all protocols Instructional text Red Calibri font (Delete for final document) Text that provides instructions, but which should not appear in a final protocol Suggested text Blue Century font Restyle to Black Times New Roman for final document Text that is suitable for many t rials, but which may need to be modified, deleted, or replaced according to the specific aspects of the t rial Variable text {braces} in the prevailing typeface Select from choices by eliminating unwanted options; remove braces and restyle remaining text to match other text in the final document Where a choice is suggested between options in a passage of text, braces are used to separate them Fields [Square brackets] in the prevailing typeface with grey shading Brackets with grey shading are used to indicate variable text modelled as a field in the electronic manifestation of the protocols ICH M11 Template 4 Type of Text (Applicability) Typeface Details Description (Intended Use) Populate field from available choices, or with free text if indicated; remove brackets and restyle text to match other text in the final document 15 Heading Structure and Flexibility 16 This template uses the typefaces and numbering conventions described in the table below to 17 distinguish between heading levels. To ensure consistency and predictability for all readers, the 18 numbering conventions should be strictly observed. However, fonts, font sizes, and colour are 19 not intended to be fixed requirements , and can be adapted as specific situations may dictate, 20 or per country or regional requirements. 21 Example Heading Heading Level Typeface in this Template Modification or Deletion Addition 1 LEVEL 1 (L1) 14 point Times New Roman Bold Black ALL CAPS Do not delete or modify L1 or L2 headings Retain heading and indicate \"Not Applicable\" Do not add L1 Headings 1.1 Level 2 (L2) 14 point Times New Roman Bold Black Add L2 headings, if needed, at the end of the higher-level section to preserve the established L1 and L2 heading structure 1.1.1 Level 3 (L3) 12 point Times New Roman Bold Black Do not delete or modify Level 3 safety subheadings (Section 8.4) Other Level 3 headings may be deleted or modified as needed ICH M11 Template 5 Example Heading Heading Level Typeface in this Template Modification or Deletion Addition 1.1.1.1 Level 4 (L4) Delete heading or modify as needed Insert where needed Additional Non- Numbered Heading Non- numbered heading 22 Table and Figure Numbering 23 Tables and figures should be numbered and include a title or caption, respectively. No 24 numbering convention is specified by this template, but a consistent approach should be 25 applied throughout the document. 26 Page orientation can be modified from portrait to landscape as needed. 27 Terminology 28 The following terminology has been selected for use within this template and is considered to 29 be appropriate for all phases, trial populations, and therapeutic areas: 30 Because the scope of this protocol template is focused on interventional clinical trials, 31 the term clinical trials is used rather than clinical studies when referring to 32 interventional clinical trials. 33 Participant is used rather than subject, healthy volunteer, or patient when referring to 34 an individual who has consented to participate in the clinical trial. Patient or individual is 35 used to distinguish the population represented by the trial participants, when 36 necessary. 37 Trial intervention refers to any therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent including 38 pharmaceuticals, biologics, vaccines, cell or gene therapy products (when applicable), 39 and drug-device combination products when registered as a drug. Trial interventions 40 include the agent being tested or used as a control (for example, placebo or active 41 comparator). Procedures conducted to manage participants or to collect data are 42 excluded from the usage of this term. 43 While blinding is the more commonly used term, masking is an alternative term which 44 may be used in certain situations. 45 Suggestions for Publishing a Paper or .pdf Document: 46 Various formatting, typefaces, and instructional elements are used in this template to inform 47 preparation activities, but these should not appear in final protocols. Specific recommended 48 steps for finalisation are as follows: 49 ICH M11 Template 6 Delete Section 0 and all its contents 50 Update the Table of Contents (TOC). 51 Confirm that the Level 1 and Level 2 headings are visible in the navigation pane or 52 bookmark view). Visible Level 3 bookmarks are also recommended. 53 Delete unneeded or non-applicable Level 3 or lower headings and ensure remaining 54 Level 3 and lower headings are numbered appropriately 55 Delete any unused variable text and related prompts 56 Restyle any \"suggested\", \"example\", or \"variable\" text to match the regular text 57 Remove all instructional text, and 58 Remove brackets that denote variable or field text after making appropriate selections. 59 As a reminder, protocols often become public through transparency requirements in various 60 regions/countries. 61 0.4 Abbreviations Used in this Template 62 Abbreviation or Acronym Definition AE Adverse Event AESI Adverse Events of Special Interest AxMP Auxiliary Medicinal Product CDISC Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium COAs Clinical Outcome Assessment(s) CRF Case Report Form DREs Disease-Related Events ECG Electrocardiogram EU European Union EUDAMED European Databank on Medical Devices EudraCT European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database IB Investigator's Brochure ICF Informed Consent Form ICH International Council for Harmonisation IDE Investigational Device Exemption IEC Independent Ethics Committee IMP Investigational Medicinal Product IND Investigational New Drug ICH M11 Template 7 Abbreviation or Acronym Definition IRB Institutional Review Board IVRS Interactive Voice Response System IWRS Interactive Web Response System jRCT Japan Registry of Clinical Trials MedDRA Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities N/A Not Applicable NCT National Clinical Trial NIMP Non-Investigational Medicinal Product PD Pharmacodynamics PK Pharmacokinetics SAE Serious Adverse Event SoA Schedule of Activities TOC Table of Contents WHO World Health Organization 63 ICH M11 Template 8 Protocol Full Title: [Protocol Full Title] The protocol should have a descriptive title that identifies the scientific aspects of the trial sufficiently to ensure it is immediately evident what the trial is investigating and on whom, and to allow retrieval from literature or internet searches.

only). 254 1.1 Protocol Synopsis 255 The protocol synopsis is a short summary of the key points of the trial. 256 No text is intended here (header only). 257 Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints 258 Include a copy of the Objectives/Endpoints Table including primary and secondary endpoints 259 only from Section 3 of the protocol and follow all the same instructions. Not all trials will have 260 a complete estimand. Do not include exploratory endpoints in the synopsis. 261 [Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints] 262 Overall Design 263 Several key aspects of the trial design are summarised below. 264 [geographic scope] Briefly state the following: 265 Intervention model (for example, single group, parallel group, cross-over, factorial, 266 sequential). 267 Control (for example, placebo, active comparator, low dose, historical, standard of care, 268 sham procedure, or none [uncontrolled]). 269 Active comparator, if applicable; indicate N/A if not applicable. 270 Trial intervention assignment method (for example, randomisation, stratification, or 271 both). Do NOT state block size. If assignment to intervention is by randomisation, 272 describe when randomisation occurs relative to screening. 273 ICH M11 Template 20 Trial population type (for example, healthy volunteers, adult patients, paediatric 274 patients). 275 Population Diagnosis or Condition (for example, \"acute lung injury,\" or a specific 276 biomarker profile); indicate \"N/A - Healthy\" for trials in healthy volunteers. 277 Population age range (for example 3 mos, 18 to 80 years old). List N/A if a maximum 278 or minimum age limit does not apply. For trials in which multiple age ranges may be 279 eligible (for example, a younger cohort and an older cohort), indicate the minimum and 280 maximum ages for the trial overall, with an additional comment for any excluded age 281 ranges. 282 Site distribution (select from: single-site, multi-site, or multi-site and multi-regional). If 283 none of these applies, indicate other and describe. 284 Number of Arms: [Number of Arms] 285 Enter the numeric value for the number of arms in the trial.

For complex trials, additional schemas may be added to describe activities or 352 trial periods in greater detail. 353 [Schema] 354 1.3 Schedule of Activities 355 The schedule of activities must capture the procedures that will be accomplished at each trial 356 visit, and all contact with participants, for example, telephone contacts. This includes any tests 357 that are used for eligibility, participant randomisation or stratification, or decisions on trial 358 intervention discontinuation. Allowable windows should be stated for all visits. 359 [Schedule of Activities] 360 361 ICH M11 Template 23 2 INTRODUCTION 362 No text is intended here (header only). 363 2.1 Purpose of Trial 364 Explain why the trial is needed, why the research questions being asked are important.
