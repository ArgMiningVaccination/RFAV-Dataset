IntroductionIt is in vain to expect any great progress in the sciences by thesuperinducing or engrafting new matters upon old. An instaurationmust be made from the very foundations, if we do not wish torevolve forever in a circle, making only some slight and contemptibleprogress.\u2014 Francis Bacon1A culture of denial subverts the health care system from its foundation. The founda-tion\u2014the basis for deciding what care each patient individually needs\u2014is connectingpatient data to medical knowledge. That foundation, and the processes of care built uponit, require standards for managing clinical information analogous to accountingstandards for financial information. If businesses were permitted to operate withoutaccounting standards, the entire economy would be crippled. That is the condition inwhich the $2 trillion U.S. health care system finds itself\u2014crippled by lack of standards formanaging clinical information. The outcome is a continuing state of denial about thedisorder that would be exposed if clinical information were managed with order andtransparency.Contrary to what the public is asked to believe, physicians are not trained to connectpatient data with medical knowledge safely and effectively. Rather than building thatfoundation for decisions, autonomous physicians traditionally rely on personalknowledge and judgment, in denial of the need for external standards and tools. Medicaldecision making thus lacks the order, transparency and power that external standards andtools would bring to it. Physicians are left to carry a prohibitive burden. Acting undersevere time constraints, they must connect intricate patient data with crucial details fromvast and growing medical knowledge,. The outcome is that the entire health careenterprise lacks a secure foundation.Equally insecure are the complex processes built on that foundation: decisionmaking, execution, observation, and corrective action over time. Responsibility for allthese processes falls on physicians. Yet, here again medicine lacks accounting standardsto manage clinical information. Inputs are undefined. The outcome is that physicians arenot equipped to fulfill their immense responsibility safely and effectively. Othercaregivers are not equipped to share that responsibility with physicians. Patients are not 1 Bacon F. Novum Organon (1620), Summary of the Second Part, Aphorisms Concerning theInterpretation of Nature and the Kingdom of Man, Aphorism No. 31 (Montague, trans., 1854); athttp://history.hanover.edu/texts/Bacon/APHOR.html. 06/27/08equipped to work effectively with multiple caregivers, nor to assume the ultimateburden of decision making over their own bodies and minds. In short, essential standards of care, information tools and feedback mechanisms aremissing from the marketplace. And the underlying medical culture does not even recog-nize their absence. This does not prevent some caregivers from becoming virtuosoperformers in narrow specialties. But that virtuosity is personal, not systemic, andlimited, not comprehensive. Missing is a secure system for enforcing care of highquality by all caregivers for all patients. Graduate medical education fills this vacuum with harmful habits and illusions thatphysicians find difficult to let go. Credentialing confers a legal monopoly on physicians,insulating them from competition. The resulting state of denial blocks development ofa secure, orderly system of defined inputs, tight feedback and continuous improvementin patient care. This state of affairs can be transformed. The necessary standards of care and infor-mation tools, as described below, are in large part already developed. Their widespreadadoption could permit inputs to be defined, new roles for caregivers and patients toemerge, individualized decision making to occur, new feedback loops to develop and aself-correcting, continuously improving system of care to evolve. Some may disagree, arguing instead that it is enough simply to reduce third partyinvolvement in funding and the doctor-patient relationship. Others argue that thenecessary transformation is already underway, as \"health information technology\" is usedto bring \"evidence-based medicine\" to \"patient-centered\" care. Yet, neither point of viewcomprehends the wide gap between what current medical practice delivers and whatpatient care truly requires. This gap persists regardless of whether health care spendingis provider-driven (traditional fee-for-service medicine), payer-driven (managed care)or now \"consumer-driven.\" Until the gap is closed, attempts at cost control and universalcoverage will continue to revolve in a circle, without sustainable progress.Closing the gap could transform how medicine is personally experienced bycaregivers and patients. Supported by a system of order and transparency, caregiverscould find their work to be less exhausting and more rewarding, emotionally andintellectually, than what they now undergo. The physician's role could disaggregate intomultiple roles, all freed from the impossible burdens of performance that physicians arenow expected to bear. The expertise of nurses and other non-physician caregivers coulddeepen, and their roles could be elevated. All caregivers could follow time-honoredstandards of care that in the past have been honored more in the breach than theobservance. All caregivers and patients could jointly use electronic information tools for06/27/08matching data with medical knowledge, radically expanding their capacity to cope withcomplexity. Inputs by caregivers could be defined and subjected to constant feedback andimprovement. In that environment, patients and their families could personally manageunique, individual needs, collaborating with caregivers as necessary. A truly evidence-based medicine could develop, where evidence would be used to individualize carerather than standardize it. Under a system of checks and balances, using a commoninformation infrastructure, patients and caregivers could act on incentives for quality andeconomy far more effectively than before. Society could thus find enormous opportunities to harvest resources now going towaste. These wasted resources include a vast body of medical knowledge that all patientsand caregivers could use more effectively, simple tests and observations that in combina-tion could uncover solutions to patient problems, patients who could become betterequipped and motivated to improve their own health behaviors, routine patient care thatcould become a fertile source of medical knowledge, and the first hand insights ofcaregivers who could participate in harvesting that new knowledge for the benefit oftheir own patients.Were such a transformation to occur, the health care delivery system would becomea transparent network that patients/consumers navigate to manage their own health. Asan analogy, consider the transportation system\u2014like health care, a system where publicsafety is at stake. Travelers rely on expert service providers when needed (pilots, automechanics, travel agents, for example), but the primary decision makers are travelersthemselves. They determine the destination, the route, and the mode of travel for ajourney. And their decisions are highly individualized. Two different people drivingacross the country might choose completely different routes, depending on whom andwhat they wish to visit and what they encounter along the way. Because such factors arevariable, the choice of routes among different travelers is variable. No one would regardsuch variation as inappropriate. No one would expect travelers to conform to some\"evidence-based\" determination by experts of the \"best\" route across the country. Similarly, in medicine, no one should think that two different people labeled with the\"same\" disease necessarily have comparable medical needs. Nor should be we think thatthe care of unique individuals must conform to \"evidence-based\" guidelines derived fromlarge population studies. Rather, high quality efficient care would emerge case-by-case,in a progression of many small steps, each one carefully chosen and reliably executed.Like the transportation system, the health care system should be usable by ordinaryconsumers when feasible. In travel, rather than relying on professional taxi drivers, we06/27/08learn to drive and we buy our own cars. Instead of hiring professional engineers to tellus what cars to buy, we read Consumer Reports and judge our personal needs andpreferences for ourselves. Instead of hiring professional guides, we read maps and roadsigns. In some modes of travel (rail and air) we depend on expert service providers, butwe as consumers, not those experts, choose the mode of travel. By comparison, if pilotshad the authority that physicians have in the health care system, then pilots would decidewhen consumers travel by air, and unnecessary flights for short distances would beroutine.Essential to the functioning of consumers and expert service providers in thetransportation system are reliability of the infrastructure and transparency in the rulesfor its use. Consider auto transportation. Roads and bridges are maintained in drivablecondition. Maps, road signs and electronic systems are provided for navigation. Driversare licensed and cars are inspected. Traffic laws are defined and enforced. As a result,drivers can find their destinations and arrive safely. The primary risk to safety is thebehaviors of other drivers, not breakdowns in the transportation system. In contrast,breakdowns in the safety, quality and economy of health care are endemic.Consider also airline safety regulation. A key characteristic is that inputs by workerswith specialized expertise are carefully defined within an integrated system, everycomponent of which is subject to strict scrutiny and control. Airline mechanics, forexample, are subject to careful recordkeeping and inspection requirements. Pilotcredentials are based not on formal education but on periodic demonstration of actualcompetence in flying specific planes. Air traffic control systems, sophisticated cockpitinstrumentation and detailed standards of care govern the actions of expert pilots. Pilotsdo not have professional autonomy. They function within a protective system that ismeticulously monitored. As a result, airline travel is so safe that consumer decisionsabout using it are made virtually without regard to safety concerns. No one choosesamong airlines by comparing crash rates or pilot credentials. Any complex system depends on the quality of its parts and their connections. Thefunctioning of all parts must be reliable and oriented towards a common purpose. Inthese terms, the transportation system is superior to the health care system. The healthcare system will never be trustworthy or affordable until its parts and their connectionsmatch the transportation system in three key respects. Indeed, its recent evolution isturning in this direction: Inputs by caregivers must be carefully defined and controlled. During the last decade,this development has begun to take root. The patient safety movement hasdemonstrated over and over again the need to define and control inputs from06/27/08fallible human beings. But this development has focused largely on execution ofdecisions. Decision making itself equally needs definition and control of inputs,because each human mind, left to its own devices, is unreliable and not wellconnected to other participants in the system. Medical education and credentialingblock the necessary changes in this regard. To reform, they must become focusedon instilling in practitioners a core of behavior, not a core of knowledge. A trustworthy and transparent intellectual infrastructure for care must be established. During the last decade, the Internet has revolutionized access to expandingmedical knowledge. But the human mind cannot apply complex knowledgeeffectively without external aids. Caregivers and patients trying to navigate themedical landscape need two information tools: a map of the landscape and acommunication system for the journey. The map (tools for coupling medicalknowledge with patient-specific data) reveals the landscape so that individuals canfind routes that serve their personal needs (unlike \"evidence-based\" traveldirections dictated in advance). The communication system (structured medicalrecords) enables the patient and multiple caregivers to coordinate their actions byrecording and planning each step of the journey, informed by feedback from eachother and from what happens along the way. With this infrastructure, allcaregivers and consumers can apply complex knowledge to detailed data, andreadily understand how their efforts interrelate. The central role of the patient/consumer must be recognized. During the last decade, thisrecognition has become increasingly evident in two areas: consumer-drivenhealth care and management of chronic illness. But these developments areincomplete. The consumer-driven care movement focuses more on spending thancare. In management of chronic illness, many organizations have developedapproaches for helping patients manage their own conditions, but these disparateefforts are not unified by common tools and standards applicable in all medicalcontexts. Common tools and standards exploit basic principles of orderlyproblem-solving that everyone grasps. With that simplicity and unity, the healthsystem becomes transparent and usable for all.Transforming medicine in these respects would reorient patient care towards a singlepurpose: individualized medical problem solving for each unique patient. That orienta-tion differs fundamentally from both payer-driven managed care and traditional,provider-driven medicine. These are both variations on the same vendor-driven system.06/27/08 Both variations are disconnected from patient needs because a truly consumer-drivensystem of care has yet to be built.To present these concepts, we begin with a detailed case study. Then we describe twoinformation tools2 and the standards of care they implement. Finally, we analyze theimplications of these tools for reform of medical practice, the development of medicalknowledge and medical education. The following outlines Parts II to VIII below.IIA detailed case study of a missed diagnosis: This part examines disorder in medicaldecision making, explains the need to change medicine's division of labor, andanalyzes implications for reform of medical practice. IIIThe concept of defined inputs: This part explains the necessity for defined inputs bycaregivers. This does not mean dictating medical decisions (the approach taken bymanaged care and evidence-based medicine). Rather, defined inputs meanassurance of reliable functioning, which is a prerequisite to meaningfullycomparing outcomes. The concept of defined inputs presented in this sectionunderlies the information tools for medical decision making described in parts IVand VI, and the approach to medical education and credentialing described in partVIII. IVCoupling patient data with medical knowledge: This part describes software toolsdesigned to elicit relevant patient data and match it with applicable medicalknowledge for specific medical problem situations. Using these software toolseffectively imposes standards of care that are more rigorous than accepted medicalpractice. Physicians object to these standards on various grounds, which this partdiscusses in detail. VHistorical and philosophical background: This part describes how medical practice lacksscientific rigor due to its unwarranted reliance on the unaided human mind\u2014anissue that Francis Bacon identified 400 years ago at the birth of modern science. F.A. Hayek analyzed related issues in market economies, where people avail 2 Specifically, the information tools are (1) decision support software designed for coupling medicalknowledge with patient data, and (2) electronic medical records designed to organize care around patientproblems instead of provider habits. Known respectively as knowledge coupling software and the problem-oriented medical record (POMR), these tools implement standards of care for managing medicalinformation, as discussed in parts IV and VI below. Some basic references are Weed, LL., et al., KnowledgeCoupling: New Premises and New Tools for Medical Care Education, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1991 (chapter13 of this volume, authored by Dr. Ken Bartholomew, provides a detailed discussion of use of knowledgecoupling software in conjunction with the POMR in a primary care practice); Weed, LL et al., MedicalRecords, Medical Education and Patient Care, Cleveland: Case Western Reserve University Press (1969);Burger, Charles S., \"The Use of Problem Knowledge Couplers in a Primary Care Practice\", HealthcareInformation Management, vol. 11, no. 4, Winter 1997, available at www.pkc.com; C.C.

These principlesare directly applicable to medicine, which is both a scientific and commercialendeavor.VIThe medical record: This part examines how the medical record can serve as theessential tool to manage complex cases (typically cases involving chronic diseaseand multiple problems). When the medical record is structured to reflect the basicsteps of orderly problem solving, the complex processes of care become transparentto patients, caregivers and third parties. VIIThe nature of medical knowledge as applied to patient care: This part examines how theinformation tools described in parts IV and VI overcome the limitations ofevidence-based medicine by taking into account the medical uniqueness ofindividuals. VIIIMedical education and credentialing: This part argues that medical education andcredentialing must change from a knowledge-based to a skills-based approach. Aknowledge-based approach fails to exploit the power information technology foraccessing knowledge and completely undermines definition and control of providerinputs to care. Moreover, medical education must be conceived in terms of not onlycaregivers but also patients/consumers, because they are central to medical decisionmaking and execution.06/27/08IV. The foundation: coupling patient data with medicalknowledgeA. Importance of defining initial inputsFor the want of a nail the shoe was lost, For the want of a shoe thehorse was lost, For the want of a horse a rider was lost, For the wantof a rider the battle was lost, For the want of a battle the kingdomwas lost. And all for the want of a horse-shoe nail.\u2014 Benjamin FranklinOrderly problem solving begins with gathering relevant information. Relevance isa function of purpose. In medicine, information is gathered for three basic purposes: (1)maintaining wellness, (2) identifying medical problems at an early stage, and (3) solvingidentified problems. The output of this information gathering process is an initialdatabase for decision making. The database elements relevant to the first two purposescomprise the screening database. The database elements relevant to the third purposecomprise the initial workup of each problem identified by the screening database plus anyadditional problems identified by the patient and provider. (The initial workup issometimes referred to as the \"present illness.\")Gathering a database should involve (1) careful selection of data relevant to the threepurposes just stated, and (2) accurate analysis of the data to determine implications for thepatient. Both selection and analysis require matching data with medical knowledge. The results of the matching process need to be organized for problem solving purposes. This total process of matching general medical knowledge with patient-specific data andorganizing the results we refer to as knowledge coupling. Regardless of whether it iscarried out by the unaided mind, software tools or both, knowledge coupling is inherentin developing a database for decision making.Knowledge coupling is employed not only for the initial database but also fordefining problems, formulating diagnostic or treatment plans, evaluating the results ofthose plans and modifying the plans as needed, all of which involve matching medicalknowledge with patient data. Knowledge coupling is thus fundamental to all of medicaldecision making. But its importance is greatest, and most amenable to improvement,06/27/08when developing the initial database. Indeed, undefined, uncontrolled inputs to theinitial database are a root cause of harm and waste in patient care.The pivotal importance of the initial database should come as no surprise. Complexactivities rest on a foundation laid by initial choices. Initial choices commit scarce timeand resources to a chosen course of inquiry or action. Yet, initial choices are very oftenmade without considering or comprehending relevant information. The best choice maythus be delayed, rejected or overlooked. Initial errors of this kind, like Franklin'smissing horseshoe nail, trigger chain reactions that often cannot be stopped or evenperceived until too late. Known as \"cascade effects\" when they occur at the biologicallevel, these harmful chain reactions also occur at the organizational level. They are arecurrent phenomenon in clinical care at both levels.3 4 And events at both levels ofteninteract to increase the risk and degree of harm to the patient. Characteristic elementsin these chain reactions include multiplying of disorganized data collection and riskymedical interventions, delay of beneficial treatment, escalating complexity and increasedlikelihood of error as a result. Because initial choices have such great significance, complex activities are usefullyconceived in two categories: (1) threshold processes where initial information isconsidered and initial decisions are made; (2) subsequent follow-up processes where deci-sions are executed, feedback is received and new decisions are made. The element offeedback further highlights the importance of threshold processes, because careful initialplanning is often needed to establish feedback loops. A clear example of the importance of threshold processes medicine is the case studyin part Error! Reference source not found.. Months of unnecessary care and avoidablesuffering were set in motion when \"classic manifestations\" went unrecognized in theinitial workup. Other examples appear frequently in the media. Consider the following: A Pulitzer-prize winning Wall Street Journal article reports on \"a deadlydiscrepancy between the available medical knowledge about aortic aneurysmsand the ignorance of many front-line physicians.\" Headlined \"Medical IgnoranceContributes to Toll From Aortic Illness,\"5 the article explains that aortic disease\"kills an estimated 25,000 Americans a year ... a larger toll than that of AIDS and 3 Deyo R. Cascade Effects of Medical Technology. Annu. Rev. Public Health 2002. 23:23-444 Mold, JW, Stein JF. The cascade effect in the clinical care of patients. New England Journal ofMedicine, 1986. 314:512-14.5 Helliker K, Burton T. Medical Ignorance Contributes to Toll From Aortic Illness. Wall StreetJournal. Nov. 4, 2003, p. A1, available at http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2004/explanatory-reporting/works/story7.html.06/27/08most kinds of cancer.\" Yet, many physicians are not aware of the prevalence ofaortic disease, its risk factors, its presenting signs and symptoms, and importantdiagnostic and therapeutic advances in caring for the disease. The article suggeststhat front-line physicians are to blame for their \"ignorance.\" Yet, such blamemisses the point, because ignorance is inevitable. The article suggests that a newmedical specialty for aortic illness is needed, but that too misses the point, becausethe illness, and thus the need for the specialist, are difficult to recognize. The pointis that an orderly, structured investigation is essential from the outset of care,because aortic illness is only one of hundreds of possible disease conditions sug-gested by its various presenting signs and symptoms. If those diagnosticpossibilities are systematically investigated from the outset, then promptdiagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease (whether it turns out to beaortic illness or something else) become readily achievable in many cases. Thedifficulty is that all physicians inevitably will be ignorant of some of thosediagnostic possibilities, their manifestations and their treatments. It is thus crucialto minimize dependence on the personal knowledge of physicians or any othercaregivers. Only then does it become possible to optimize diagnostic workups ofpresenting signs and symptoms, whatever their cause. Seen in this light, the WallStreet Journal headline radically understates the tragedy the article describes. Rather than \"Medical Ignorance Contributes to Toll From Aortic Illness,\" a moreaccurate would have been, \"Medical TollFrom All Illness.\" And rather than blaming \"the ignorance of many front-linephysicians,\" who deserve help rather than blame for being less than omniscient,it would be more accurate to blame the leaders behind the front lines, \"the bestand the brightest\" who are positioned to transform the disorganization faced byall caregivers and patients. A 1998 ABC News report6 described the case of a patient who experienced fatigueand joint pain, progressing to muscle pain, worse fatigue, disorientation anddouble vision. She \"consulted more than 20 different doctors in search of anexplanation,\" without success. Finally, she turned to Dr. Charles Burger, who firsthad her spend \"about 30 minutes completing a detailed computer-generatedquestionnaire that posed virtually every question that medical science suggests isrelevant to her symptoms of fatigue\u2014more than 550 questions in all.\" Dr.Burger's computer software then coupled the questionnaire responses with a 6 http://www.pkc.com/videos.aspx. The software described is from PKC Corporation.06/27/08database of possible diagnoses associated with the responses. The patient's signsand symptoms \"turned out to be a nearly perfect match for 'hyperventilationsyndrome,' a shallow-breathing disorder that can gradually change the body'schemistry.\" The patient learned corrective breathing techniques, with theoutcome that her health is \"steadily improving.\"Such examples suggest that optimizing the initial workup could pay enormousdividends. Optimizing threshold processes in medicine must begin with defining inputs to theprocess of coupling general knowledge with patient-specific data. This knowledgecoupling process is employed for both components of the initial database\u2014the screeningdatabase and initial workup of any identified medical problems. The followingdiscussion is limited to the initial workup. In part Error! Reference source not found.below we address the screening database. The knowledge coupling function may be carried out by the unaided human mind,or with the aid of software tools. Because the unaided mind is so unreliable and soinefficient at knowledge coupling, software tools are essential. The question thusarises\u2014which should be used first when conducting the initial workup? Should thecaregiver first apply personal knowledge and judgment, and then use software tools tohelp with unresolved problems? Or should the caregiver first use software tools and thenturn to personal knowledge and judgment? A central theme of this paper is that software tools should be employed first. Stateddifferently, human thought should supplement but not substitute for software tools whenthe knowledge coupling function is performed. This principle constitutes a new standardof care for medical practice. It is completely contrary to the basic premises of medicaleducation and credentialing. To understand these points, we first need to examine theunderlying logical structure of the initial workup, and then compare alternativeapproaches to conducting it.B. The structure of the initial workup We all know what happens when a physician first examines a new patient. Thephysician's clinical judgment largely determines what questions are asked about thepatient's \"chief complaint\" and medical history, what points are checked in the physicalexamination and what laboratory tests are ordered. Similarly, the physician's personaljudgment is the primary vehicle for analyzing the data collected. Then the physicianjudges what data and analysis to include in the medical record. Cognitive inputs to the06/27/08initial workup are thus not predefined but determined during the patient encounter. Similarly, as to manual inputs when performing the physical examination, the qualityof performance by physicians and other caregivers is not verified in advance. Caregiversvary considerably in the skill they bring to performing physical examinations, and theyare rarely subject to corrective feedback on the quality of their performance. In short, theinitial workup is unreliable at many levels. Optimizing this initial workup requires breaking it down into three steps\u2014choice,collection and analysis of patient data. Specifically:1.Initial data must be chosen that is known to be cost-effective for identifyingdiagnostic or therapeutic options. This requires linking one datum\u2014the patient'scomplaint\u2014with comprehensive medical knowledge about what cost-effectiveinitial data.2.All the chosen data must be collected by conducting the patient/family history, thephysical examination and laboratory tests) without error or omission.3.Once collected, the chosen data must be linked with comprehensive medicalknowledge to determine, based on those initial data, what diagnostic or treatmentoptions should be considered, the initial pros and cons of each option, and whatsteps should be considered next.Combining the initial data and knowledge inputs should yield the followingoutputs: a set of options (diagnostic or therapeutic), plus, for each option, evidence(patient data) for and against the option, with proposals for additional data to collect ortherapeutic measures to initiate. Equipped with this information, the patient andcaregiver apply judgment and preferences to make an initial choice among the optionsidentified.This basic structure applies to both diagnosis and treatment decisions. That bothtypes of decision have the same logical structure is not surprising. Organized problemsolving of any kind involves processing information to identify options, plus evidencefor and against each option. This information processing provides the basis for decisions. The decision is made when the patient or caregiver applies judgment to choose amongthe options identified, based on the evidence, in light of personal preferences and values. The objective quality of the decision, and its subjective acceptability to the patient, bothdepend on optimizing the basis for that decision. C. Two contrasting approaches to the initial workup The traditional approach to the three steps of the initial workup depends on thepersonal knowledge and judgment of the physician. The physician chooses and collects06/27/08very limited initial data (steps 1-2) for purposes of quickly formulating initialconclusions or hypotheses (step 3). Applying clinical judgment throughout, the physicianis highly selective with the first two steps, proceeding to the third step as soon aspossible. If the first iteration of this sequence is not successful, the physician keepsrepeating the sequence with new data. This can be termed a judgmental approach, becauseit relies heavily on the trained physician's sophisticated clinical judgment in selecting theright initial data on the patient and then analyzing that data accurately (steps 1 and 3). External information tools are not employed for either step. A contrasting approach begins with defining a detailed, standardized database for agiven diagnostic or management problem (step 1), taking all medical specialties intoaccount, based on research of the medical literature. Constructed before any patientencounter, this database is entered into software designed to be used during the patientencounter. In step 2, the patient and caregiver use the software as guidance for collectingall of the defined data for the given problem, whether or not the caregiver judges the datato be useful for an individual patient. In step 3, the software automatically links all of thedata with comprehensive medical knowledge about the significance of the data pointsand their interrelationships. This is a simple process of association, readily accomplishedwith software tools and without reliance on the caregiver's knowledge or judgment.This alternative to the judgmental approach we term a combinatorial approach. It usescomputer software to combine data with knowledge, in order to identify medicallysignificant combinations of data points. The combinatorial approach contrasts with thejudgmental approach not only in its reliance on an external tool to determine decisionmaking inputs, but also in the nature of these inputs: The level of detail, in both the data collected and knowledge taken into account,are much greater with the combinatorial approach. This detailed information is gathered and presented up front and all at once, ratherthan in a gradual, piecemeal fashion. Inputs are highly standardized (the data collection and identification of linkagesto medical knowledge are determined uniformly, regardless of which providerthe patient sees), unlike the highly variable inputs of the judgmental approach,where inputs depend on the caregiver's personal knowledge, experience, specialtyorientation, reimbursement expectations, time constraints and other factors.Driven by an external tool, not personal judgment, the combinatorial approachcreates a minimum standard for the information taken into account, but not a limit onthat information. Caregivers (and patients) are free to supplement the defined initialworkup with any additional data they judge useful, and are free to make their own06/27/08connections between the patient data and medical knowledge in addition to theconnections identified by the software. In contrast, the judgmental approach limits theinitial workup to the data and connections suggested by the caregiver's personaljudgment, with no assurance of satisfying minimum standards of completeness oraccuracy.The tool-driven, combinatorial approach immediately brings to bear the best currentexpertise, accumulated from the experience of countless patients and caregivers overtime, filtered through peer-reviewed medical literature. In contrast, the judgmentalapproach relegates the patient largely to the limited expertise possessed by the caregiversavailable to the patient.The judgmental and combinatorial approaches contrast in terms of not only theirinputs but their outputs. Specifically: The output of a combinatorial approach is not a clinical decision, but merely theinformational basis for a decision: a set of options with patient-specific evidencefor and against each option. The initial options and evidence are generated by thesoftware tool , not by the physician's judgment. The decision to be made based onthis output is left to the patient and caregiver. In contrast, the output of ajudgmental approach naturally takes the form of the physician's recommendationsplus a selective presentation of options and evidence, generated by exercise of thephysician's clinical judgment. The combinatorial approach automatically generates complete documentation,which is available over time to the patient and multiple caregivers and to clinicalresearchers. This documentation includes positive, negative and uncertainresponses (whether or not the caregiver judges them to be significant). In contrast,typical physician notes are ambiguous as to whether an unmentioned finding wasfound to be negative or uncertain or was never checked at all.The judgmental approach, not the combinatorial approach, is the accepted standardof care in medicine. For example, standard coding guidance states that the physician\"uses the presenting illness as a guiding factor and his or her clinical judgment about thepatient's condition to determine the extent of\" the history and physical examination.7The judgmental approach, with its dependence on the unaided mind, is the acceptedstandard not only in routine primary care but also in advanced specialty care at leadingmedical centers. With respect to the latter, this conclusion might seem surprising because 7 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Evaluation and Management Services Guide (Rev. July2007), pp. 12-13, at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNProducts/Downloads/eval_mgmt_serv_guide.pdf.06/27/08specialists frequently pursue detailed data collection, which is characteristic of thecombinatorial approach. Such investigation, however, usually occurs after the initialworkup, and after a crucial threshold judgment is made\u2014the judgment of whichspecialist should be consulted first. Different primary care physicians or other gate-keepers vary in their judgments of which specialist should be consulted first, andphysicians in different specialties vary enormously in how they approach a given patientproblem (not to mention the variation that exists even among physicians within the samespecialty). In contrast, the tool-driven combinatorial approach takes into account dataand knowledge from all potentially relevant medical specialties at the outset of care,before any physicians exercise judgment. This deferral of judgment is critical, becausepatients often have multiple problems, and because even a single problem oftenimplicates multiple body systems, each with its own medical specialty. D. Optimizing the initial workup\u2014evaluating the twoapproaches Recognizing the differences between the judgmental and combinatorial approachesis essential to optimizing the initial workup. Optimization requires both selecting theoptimal approach and optimizing its execution. Comparing the judgmental and combinatorial approaches faces significant obstacles. Very few physicians have even considered the combinatorial approach, much lessactually used the software tools required. Moreover, rigorously implementing thecombinatorial approach is disruptive. Ultimately, using the required software toolsentails large changes in mental habits, established procedures, occupational roles, withsignificant reimbursement implications. Unless those changes are made, the twoapproaches cannot be accurately compared. Moreover, the basis for comparison is subjectto dispute. In particular, comparison on the basis of medical outcomes is problematic atbest. The effect of the initial workup cannot be isolated by controlling or adjusting forall the other inputs over time from providers and patients and external forces. Thatreality makes it impractical to design a clinical trial providing an accurate outcomecomparison of judgmental and combinatorial approaches to the initial workup. Innovation must be pursued without the security blanket of definitive outcomecomparisons. What can be done in the face of the above difficulties is to analyze the basic premisesof the judgmental and combinatorial approaches in relation to what patients need andmodern information tools permit. In doing so we must take into account the realities of06/27/08medical practice, including the reactions of physicians, other caregivers and patients. Yet,their beliefs, existing occupational roles, current uses of technology, and immediateinstitutional needs must not cloud or restrict our long-term vision of what is optimal forindividual patients and the health care system as a whole.8 At the same time, visions ofwhat could be optimal with greater resources must not divert us from making optimaluse of existing resources.The basic premise of the judgmental approach is that firsthand clinical judgments ofhighly trained physicians interacting with patients should govern the initial workup.Physician judgments should not be compromised by second-hand, abstract, \"evidence-based\" generalities incorporated in clinical guidelines or software tools. Those externaltools may have some utility as references to consult, but physicians should primarily relyon their own clinical judgment to determine the contents, and assess the results, of eachinitial workup for each unique patient. In contrast, the basic logic of the combinatorial approach is that detailed initial datato be collected for a given medical problem should be defined in advance and collectedwithout fail at each patient encounter. For this to happen, software tools, not clinicaljudgment during the encounter, should govern collection and analysis of the data. Ongoing clinical judgments of physicians may have some utility as a supplement to thecombinatorial minimum standard, but should not be permitted to lower that standard.E. Basic objections to the combinatorial approach. Physicians naturally view the judgmental approach, and the elaborate trainingneeded for the unaided mind to apply it, as inherent in scientifically advanced medicalcare. By comparison, a tool-driven combinatorial approach seems to impose both crudestandardization and excessive detail\u2014\"cookbook medicine\" taken to a compulsiveextreme. These general reactions can be broken down into the following five specificpoints: A combinatorial approach seems prohibitively time-consuming and expensive tophysicians, because the knowledge coupling software employed in the combina-torial approach requires routinely collecting data (step 2 of the initial workup) ingreater detail than is customary or feasible in real-world medical practice, whererapid throughput of patients is an economic necessity. 8 Weed LL, \"Physicians of the Future,\" New England Journal of Medicine, 304: 903-907, April 9, 1981.06/27/08 Whatever its feasibility, detailed data collection at the outset of care seems unpro-ductive to physicians. On this view, detailed initial data collection results frompremature concern with unlikely possibilities (rare diagnoses, non-standardtreatments). Limited time and resources logically should be directed first at themost common and likely possibilities. Knowledgeable physicians can frequentlyavoid the time and expense of detailed data collection, as illustrated by thephysician who correctly diagnosed the Addison's disease case based on verylimited data from the initial examination (see part Error! Reference source notfound. above). Physicians view the standardized data collection involved in a combinatorialapproach as mere cook-book medicine. Every patient and every practice situationare different. Selecting which data are clinically useful for each patient in anyparticular context (step 1 of the initial workup) must be judged by the physicianduring each patient encounter. Physicians object that the combinatorial approach harms the doctor-patientrelationship. Because the patient interacts initially more with a computer andnon-physician personnel than with the physician, the combinatorial approachgives the physician less opportunity to observe the patient's condition firsthandand establish a personal relationship. Physicians believe that mere information processing by external software tools cannever substitute for their informed clinical judgment. Like experts in otheradvanced fields of knowledge, physicians solve complex problems by applyingfirst principles in a subtle and discriminating manner that no software canreplicate. Nor can software replicate physicians' intuitive, instinctive judgmentsarising from their personal interactions with patients. Much of the above critique originates in the culture of graduate medical education. That culture teaches reliance on personal intellect. Medical students are first selected foracademic proficiency. Then they learn that they must acquire vast medical knowledge. Then they learn to rely heavily on their own intellectual powers when applying thatknowledge to detailed patient data. Then they submit to knowledge-based standards forlicensure and board certification. Their ordeal indoctrinates physicians with faith in theefficacy of intellect. Reinforcing this faith are the high compensation and statusphysicians receive for exercising their clinical judgment. Moreover, they are legallyinsulated from competition by other caregivers who might deliver superior care withless faith in personal intellect. 06/27/08Not only physicians but their patients acquire this faith. We are all socialized tobelieve, as the great clinician Herman Blumgart once wrote, that \"application ofknowledge at the bedside is largely the function of the sagacity inherent in or personallydeveloped by the individual physician.\"9 Sherwin Nuland has further described thisideal of personal sagacity:To understand pathophysiology is to hold the key to diagnosis, without whichthere can be no cure. The quest of every doctor in approaching serious disease isto make the diagnosis and to design and carry out the specific cure. This quest Icall The Riddle, and I capitalize it so there will be no mistaking its dominance overevery other consideration. The satisfaction of solving The Riddle is its own reward,and the fuel that drives the clinical engines of medicine's most highly trainedspecialists. It is every doctor's measure of his own abilities; it is the mostimportant ingredient in his professional self-image. ... Our most rewardingmoments of healing derive not from the works of our hearts but from those of ourintellects -- it is there that the passion is most intense.10Yet, the works of our intellects cannot be trusted. Those rewarding moments whenour intellects solve The Riddle for some patients are inseparable from terrible momentswhen our intellects fall short. And the problem is not just fallibility. The problem is alsothat the best intellects can serve only a few. One physician's solution of The Riddle forone patient provides no foundation for improving the care of all patients by allcaregivers. Those realities are the Achilles heel of the judgmental approach to the initialworkup. A commitment to overcome those realities leads inevitably to thecombinatorial approach, implemented with external information tools designed to makeit practical. F. A software implementation of the combinatorial approach... a whole calling may have unduly lagged in the adoption of newand available devices. It may never set its own tests. There areprecautions so imperative that even their universal disregard willnot excuse their omission. \u2014Judge Learned Hand11Physicians vary in their innate and acquired intellectual abilities. Moreover, eventhe most gifted and well-schooled intellects are not reliable when processing large 9 Blumgart H., \"Medicine: The Art and the Science,\" Hippocrates Revisited, R. Bulger ed. (New York: MEDCOM Press, 1973), p. 34.10 Nuland, Sherwin B. How We Die: Reflections of Life's Final Chapter (NewYork: Alfred A. Knopf,1994), pp. 248-49.11 The J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir. 1932).06/27/08amounts of information on the fly\u2014which is precisely what steps 1 and 3 of the initialworkup require. Medicine thus needs a new division of intellectual labor\u2014a divisionbetween electronic tools that process information, and users who, based on thatinformation and personal values, apply judgment to arrive at decisions. This division of labor exploits the fact that human judgment becomes increasinglyaccurate, efficient and powerful when it receives relevant information and is equippedto take that information into account\u2014 provided, however, that the information isactually relevant to the problem at hand and not so voluminous or disorganized as toescape comprehension. The proviso is critical. An overload of extraneous or disorgan-ized information brings to the fore the very cognitive weaknesses that must beovercome. Yet, physician credentialing pretend these cognitive weaknesses do not exist.The culture of medicine must drop the pretense and instead enforce the consistent useof external information tools. To understand what this means, it is useful first to stepback and identify three distinct functions that information technology may perform: 1. storage and retrieval of general knowledge (e.g., Internet access to medical texts); 2. storage, retrieval and transmission of patient data (e.g., electronic medical records,telemedicine tools); and 3. linkage of patient-specific data with general knowledge for decision makingpurposes (e.g., computerized prescription order-entry systems that use patientdata inputs to provide individualized guidance on medication selection anddosing, or the knowledge coupling software discussed below). The difficulty of each of these three functions has been escalating dramatically for acentury, with the extraordinary growth of medical knowledge and corresponding patientdata. Performance of the first function has successfully kept pace with this growth, thanksto electronic tools for knowledge storage and retrieval. Performance of the secondfunction, however, has not kept pace, in part because of lack of interoperability amongdifferent technologies, and in part because of the disorganized state of medical recordsas discussed in part Error! Reference source not found. below. Here, our concern is thethird function - linking data with knowledge. Paradoxically, improvement in the firsttwo functions makes this third function all the more difficult. That is, new tools for thefirst two functions increase the volume of accessible knowledge and data to combine andcomprehend.That third function is at stake in steps 1 and 3 of the initial workup. Recall that step1 involves linking one datum -- the patient's problem - with comprehensive medicalknowledge about the additional data needed to investigate that problem. Once collected06/27/08(step 2), the chosen data must be linked with all relevant knowledge (step 3) in order to\"connect the dots\"\u2014to comprehend the pieces of data that turn out to be useful, whilefiltering out extraneous data. The unaided human mind cannot perform this linkagefunction reliably or efficiently. The difficulty is not just that the volume of medicalknowledge exceeds what anyone can learn. (That problem diminishes with tools forefficient knowledge retrieval.) The deeper problem is that no one is able to link complexknowledge reliably with detailed patient data, especially when operating under real-world time constraints. This is a familiar phenomenon. It occurred, for example, in the Addison's diseasecase described in part Error! Reference source not found.. The inherent intellectualdifficulty is often exacerbated by situation-specific or provider-specific constraints. Adoctor may be so busy and distracted, or so fixated on possibilities within his specialty,that he fails to consider or follow through on possibilities that another physician mightpursue immediately. Moreover, existing knowledge is imperfect. Actual patients oftendo not fit neatly into the patterns that education and experience lead physicians to expect. Every patient is unique in the combination of those characteristics and circumstances thatbear on solving the patient's problem. Thus, the subset of data and knowledge that turnout to be useful differs for every patient, even patients labeled with the same disease. And that subset cuts across specialty boundaries. Medical specialties artificially restrictanalysis, because actual patient problems turn out to implicate multiple specialties. Itis thus not possible to determine in advance the limited subset of data and knowledgethat will prove to be relevant to each patient's unique needs.One context in which the mind's limitations have become especially obvious ismedication ordering in hospitals. In that context, most observers now recognize thatjudgmental and manual processes are no substitute for computerized prescription orderentry (CPOE) systems. More than two decades of studies have documented compellingquality and cost improvements at institutions that enforce use of well-designed systems.If this is true for the limited function of medication ordering, then it should come as nosurprise to find that electronic tools are essential in any setting that requires linkage ofpatient data with medical knowledge\u2014especially the initial workup. Electronic tools should filter and organize all information potentially relevant to theproblem at hand for the purpose of \"connecting the dots\" among the limited items ofinformation actually relevant to the individual patient. To illustrate, consider diagnosisof hypertension. Scores of possible causes (and other diagnostic associations) are usefullytaken into account for safe and cost-effective diagnosis of hypertension. These diagnosticpossibilities implicate numerous medical specialties. Cost-effectively identifying which06/27/08of the diagnostic possibilities are relevant to an individual patient requires makinghundreds of distinct clinical findings from history, physical and laboratory data. Yet,most physicians consider only a fraction of all this information when conducting initialworkups of hypertension. Another example is management of diabetes. Again, the medical literature showsthat managing diabetes requires taking into account scores of different therapeuticoptions. Identifying the options relevant to an individual patient and initially assessingthe pros and cons of the relevant options involves making hundreds of distinct findingsat the outset of care. Again, most physicians consider only a fraction of all thisinformation during initial workups of diabetic patients.12 Once made, all of the initial findings are coupled with a database of medicalknowledge built into the knowledge coupling software. The software's output is a listof diagnostic or therapeutic possibilities (i.e. possibilities for which at least one expectedfinding appears in the patient), plus the evidence for and against each possibility (i.e. theexpected findings that are present and those that are not present). The output alsoincludes comments on findings and options for which further explanation is useful, andsupporting citations to the medical literature. The software thus links data with generalknowledge, filters out information not potentially relevant to the patient and organizesthe rest, arranging it by the option to which the information relates. Complex informa-tion is presented in a way that is maximally useful for solving the problem at hand. Thistotal process is termed \"problem-knowledge coupling.\" 12 The examples given are based on research conducted by PKC Corporation for purposes of buildingthe knowledge coupling process can be conceived as navigating through three concentric circlesof knowledge and corresponding patient data. These three circles relate to diagnostic ortherapeutic options for the individual patient, as shown below.The outer circle consists of all known options that are potentially relevant to theproblem in question, plus, for each option, medical knowledge about the most usefulinitial data to collect for purposes of determining which options are worth investigating. This outer circle is completely standardized. The same data should be collecteduniformly for all patients with the same presenting problem.The middle circle is the subset of options, with corresponding knowledge and data,that are worth considering for an individual patient, based on data suggested by the outercircle and collected for that patient. The options worth considering are options for whichat least one positive finding is made in that patient. Unlike the outer circle, theinformation in the middle circle is not standardized; it varies among different patientswith the same presenting problem. The initial consideration of these options is simplycomparing them to determine if one option stands out as the solution to the patient'sproblem, or, if not, which options are worth further investigation.The inner circle is the option ultimately chosen as the best solution for the patient'sproblem. In some cases, the initial workup will be sufficient to arrive at this inner circle;in other cases, further investigation will be needed before a solution can be identified. In cases of genuine uncertainty, the inner circle is never located, because no clearsolution may be ascertainable from coupling existing knowledge with available data.Sound decision making requires navigating reliably and efficiently from an initialposition of ignorance, through the first two concentric circles, to the inner circle. Reliability and efficiency in this process are crucial. All possibilities relevant to themedical problem must be considered, and all possibilities irrelevant to the individualpatient must then be excluded, without unnecessary trial and error. Another way to visualize these concepts is as a grid, with columns for all options androws for all findings applicable to the problem in question. The grid corresponds to theouter circle depicted above. The data for any individual patient will fill only a smallfraction of the cells in the grid, and the pattern formed by those cells (corresponding tothe second circle) will differ for almost every patient. When those cells are concentratedin one column, that option may be chosen for that patient (corresponding to the innercircle), but even then different patients in the same column will likely vary\u2014theirpatterns will overlap but not be identical.06/27/08Once the knowledge coupling process identifies possibilities relevant to the patient,the next step is to prioritize those possibilities for further consideration. Knowledgecoupling software does not establish priorities but groups the possibilities in a way thatfacilitates making a judgment about priority. The grouping varies depending on themedical problem involved. For example, the Coupler for diagnosis of hematuria classi-fies possible diagnoses into the following groups: Rapidly Progressing Disorders: May Need Immediate Attention Causes for Which Just One Finding Makes Consideration Mandatory Other Causes of Hematuria Approach for Isolated Hematuria When No Findings Suggest a DiagnosisWithin each one of these groups, the Coupler output lists primary options (i.e.diagnostic possibilities) for which one or more positive findings appear in the patient. For each option, the listing shows the number of positive findings in the patient and thetotal number of possible findings for that option. That information gives the user animmediate sense of which options seem to best match the patient. For example, oneoption might show that 5 of 7 findings were positive, while all other options might showonly one or two positive findings. But the apparent best match should not necessarily bethe highest priority option. Instead, the highest priority options to consider are rapidlyprogressing disorders that could cause harm if not treated quickly. The next highestpriority group is options for which just one positive finding makes considerationmandatory, regardless of how many positive findings appear for other options. The nextgroup lists other possible options, which can easily be ranked by the positive findingsas a proportion of all findings for each option. That numerical ranking, however, is nota sufficient basis for judgment. Needed is further information about each option,including a description of typical manifestations, known variations from what is typical,epidemiological information about prevalence in various populations, possible tests toorder and other information useful for diagnostic assessment. This kind of informationappears when the user clicks on each option in the list. Sometimes the description for one of the options matches the patient closely, and allother options match poorly. That description might identify a single test to confirm orrule out the option, or, in the absence of such a test, the user may judge whether theoption can be accepted as clearly the correct diagnosis. In other cases, several optionsmight be worth considering based on positive findings and the descriptions provided,while in other cases, none of the descriptions match the patient well and no diagnosisseems plausible. In these two situations, the Hematuria Coupler provides detailed fur-ther guidance for each option. For example, under the heading \"Approach for Isolated06/27/08Hematuria When No Findings Suggest a Diagnosis,\" the following subheadings appear: (1) Isolated hematuria with no plausible diagnosis, (2) Left renal vein hypertension, and(3) Prostatic venous rupture. Under the first subheading the user finds epidemiologicalinformation (e.g. cancer and urological disease prevalence among men above and belowage 40 with microscopic hematuria) and detailed explanation and references aboutpossible further testing and monitoring. Similar guidance is provided for left renal veinhypertension and prostatic venous rupture. Another example is the Coupler for management of Type I and II diabetes in adults(including gestational diabetes, disease complications and related conditions). Theoptions are classified into the following groups (only those relevant to an individualpatient will be displayed): Glucose-Related Crises Requiring Hospitalization Related Conditions Requiring Identification and Management Monitoring Diabetes Control Controlling and Monitoring Diet Exercise Overview of Drugs for Diabetes Oral Drugs That Increase Insulin Secretion by the Pancreas Oral Drugs that Decrease Insulin Resistance & Increase Glucose Use Oral Drugs that Slow Digestion of Complex Carbohydrates after Meals Insulin Therapy Before-Meal Insulin Analogs and Inhaled Insulin Basal Insulin Analogs Insulin Therapy: Preventing and Monitoring For Common Problems Foot Care Travel Considerations Cholesterol and Triglyceride Management Blood Pressure Management Preventing, Monitoring For, and Managing Associated Conditions Pregnancy and Diabetes Monitoring for and Managing Complications of Diabetes Other Couplers That Might Provide Further Guidance Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)06/27/08 Emerging Therapies and Therapies of Limited Availability Options For Which Only Cautions Are Present** Guidance options that are unlikely to apply to this particular patient, but for which informationabout cautions might be useful, are included under this heading.A useful comparison with the combinatorial approach and knowledge couplingsoftware is the concept of simply entering findings into a search engine such as Google.13 That approach falls far short of knowledge coupling at three levels. First, the searchresults depend entirely on what terms the physician enters in the search engine, that is,on the initial findings that the physician judges to be significant. That exercise ofjudgment completely undermines the initial workup. Different combinations of findingson a patient may point in very different directions. No one can be confident that the rightcombination of findings will emerge unless the initial workup takes into account,without omission, all the findings needed to elicit all the options worth considering forthe individual patient. Second, Google searches an unfiltered, unstructured body ofinformation\u2014the entire world wide web\u2014completely unlike the distilled and structuredbody of precisely relevant information in which knowledge coupling \"searches\" takeplace. Third, the output of a Google search lacks the structure and precise relevance ofthe output generated by knowledge coupling software. Accordingly, the recent BMJarticle on use of Google as a diagnostic aid acknowledged serious limitations in thatapproach: We suspect that using Google to search for a diagnosis is likely to be more effectivefor conditions with unique symptoms and signs that can easily be used as searchterms ... Searches are less likely to be successful in complex diseases with non-specific symptoms ... or common diseases with rare presentations ... . Theefficiency of the search and the usefulness of the retrieved information also dependon the searchers' knowledge base.Some observers have pointed out that the Internet has created an unprecedentedexcess of available information. In the past, much of that information would have beenforgotten rather than preserved. Now it seems as if \"the art of forgetting\" must berestored.14 This new excess of information magnifies a dilemma already inherent in any 13 Tang H, Ng J. Googling for a diagnosis\u2014use of Google as a diagnostic aid: internet based study. BMJ, doi:10.1136/bmj.39003.640567.AE (published 10 November 2006),http://www.bmj.com/cgi/rapidpdf/bmj.39003.640567.AEv1.14 Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, \"Useful Void: The Art of Forgetting in the Age of UbiquitousComputing\" (April 2007), http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/Research/wpaper.nsf/rwp/RWP07-022/$File/rwp_07_022_mayer-schoenberger.pdf; Seth Lloyd, \"You Know Too Much\" (4/28/07),http://discovermagazine.com/2007/apr/you-know-too-much.06/27/08attempt to apply complex general knowledge to specific problem situations. Sometimesexpressed as \"connecting the dots,\" or \"finding the needle in the haystack,\" this dilemmais effectively addressed with knowledge coupling software. Use of knowledge coupling software does more than locate relevant information; italso changes modes of expression, which in turn changes perception. In traditionalpractice, a complex patient encounter is typically reduced to a few words or phrases inthe record stating the physician's \"impression.\" That impression is bound to be bothincomplete and subjective, and the language chosen to express it may further distort thereality of the patient's condition. It is always the case that language appropriates andalters reality by representing it in terms of the speaker's or writer's perspective, usingwords and concepts that the audience may understand differently than the speaker orwriter.15 But with the use of knowledge coupling software, this process becomestransparent, defined and subject to organized improvement (see the discussion in partError! Reference source not found. at note Error! Bookmark not defined. below). Ratherthan have the caregiver compose a selective, minimalist statement of impressions froma limited initial workup (or cut and paste some other caregiver's previous text in anelectronic record), the combinatorial approach has the patient work with the caregiverto select from pre-defined, careful descriptions of myriad details that might describe thepatient's condition. The descriptions from which the patient selects may be pictorial aswell as textual. And the patient and caregiver remain free to add their own additionaldescriptions on specific points. It is important to understand that use of Couplers breaks down specialty boundaries. For significant medical problems the outer and middle circles of information encompassmultiple specialties. Specialized knowledge inevitably is incomplete and fragmentedrelative to actual patient needs. As a result, physicians cannot know all the tests andobservations that might be relevant to complex medical problems. Nor can they knowhow to interpret and interrelate all the results. Nor do they have time for the researchneeded to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. Even when their knowledge is sufficient,physicians are frequently unable to apply their knowledge to detailed data in anorganized, reliable manner. For those reasons, failures to collect, comprehend or evenkeep track of potentially useful data are endemic in medicine. These are not failures ofindividual physicians. Rather they are failures of a non-system that imposes burdens ofinformation processing too great for physicians to bear. 15 Knowledge Coupling, note 2 above, p. 52.06/27/08Despite the relief from these burdens that knowledge coupling software provides,many physicians initially find that its use is disruptive and disturbing. The disruptionis in part external, because using Couplers effectively involves changing officeprocedures and making greater use of non-physician personnel. But the disruption is alsointernal, because a change in self-image is involved. The software constantly confrontsphysicians with options and evidence going beyond what they would take into accountif left to their own devices. Physicians soon realize that all their hard-won knowledgeis radically incomplete; indeed, it is often misleading. Entrenched mental habits mustchange.It becomes apparent to physicians, their co-workers and their patients that their roleis not to learn medical knowledge but rather to access and apply the limited knowledgerelevant to each patient's individual needs. This new role cannot be performed reliablyif the physician exercises clinical judgment about what options are worth considering orwhat initial data are worth collecting for each patient. Rather, the caregiver's role is tocollect, without omission, all the data made relevant by the outer circle of knowledge(which does not preclude collecting additional data that the caregiver or patient believeare relevant). G. Answering objections to the combinatorial approachIn light of this basic description of the combinatorial approach and the external toolneeded apply it, let us revisit the five objections outlined in part I.E above. In readingthis discussion, keep in mind the three steps of the initial workup (see part I.B) and thethree circles of information (see part I.F).1. Feasibility of detailed initial data collectionAs we have seen, the tool-driven combinatorial approach requires collecting initialdata in far greater detail than is customary. Physicians object that the level of detailinvolved as prohibitively time-consuming. In many practice settings, physicians areexpected to see several patients every hour. That pace leaves no time even to collectdetailed data, much less time to analyze and review it all with the patient. Even insettings where the pace is slower, most physicians view the combinatorial approach tothe initial workup as unacceptably time-consuming. This objection is not meaningful unless it takes into account the utility of thecombinatorial approach. If it is sufficiently valuable in terms of quality and long-runcost-effectiveness, then the combinatorial approach should be enforced without regard06/27/08to the prior habits or expectations or economic demands of providers and third partypayers. The utility of the combinatorial approach is the subject of sections 2-5 below. Inthis first section, however, we examine its feasibility. The amount of time required by the combinatorial approach is less than it mayappear at first glance. Only data that are simple, non-invasive, quick and inexpensive toobtain are selected for the initial workup. Non-physician caregivers and patientsthemselves, guided by knowledge coupling software, can gather those data with greatefficiency and reliability.16 17 Entering history and symptom data in the softwarerequires the patient to do nothing more than click once (to say \"yes\") on those findingsthat the patient recognizes as describing his or her condition (positive findings). Thepatient clicks twice to say \"not sure.\" Negative findings require no action at all. Andmost findings are negative for most patients. Most patients thus can rapidly makehundreds of findings simply by paging through computer displays, clicking on theoccasional positive or uncertain item. Some findings require the patient to click on abutton to review an explanatory graphic or text. That extra step for the patient savestime, because the patient relies on the software rather than the caregiver for initial help. Moreover, positive and uncertain findings can be annotated with free text when thepatient or caregiver wish to elaborate. That extra step also becomes a timesaver, becauseit elicits and captures significant patient data in context for later use. One practitionerestimates that gathering data in this manner is 5-10 times faster than a verbal discussioncovering the same amount of data.18The efficiency of the combinatorial approach becomes most obvious at step 3 of theinitial workup: linkage of detailed patient data with comprehensive medical knowledgebearing on the significance of the data. With knowledge coupling software, that stepoccurs instantaneously. Equally important, the software's output organizes all thisinformation for rapid comprehension, while filtering out extraneous information that cansafely be ignored. Specifically, the software displays a list of diagnostic or therapeuticoptions suggested by the initial positive and uncertain findings on the patient (themiddle circle of information), while omitting options for which not a single positivefinding is made (the outer circle). The options displayed are logically grouped, and 16 Bartholomew K. The Perspective of a Practitioner, in Weed LL. et al., Knowledge Coupling: NewPremises and New Tools for Medical Care Education, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1991, p. 240.17 Burger, C., \"The Use of Problem Knowledge Couplers in a Primary Care Practice\", HealthcareInformation Management, vol. 11, no. 4, Winter 1997, available at www.pkc.com18 Personal communication with Harold D. Cross, M.D.06/27/08clicking on each option displays all of its positive, uncertain and negative findings asevidence for or against that option in that patient, along with additional description,commentary and citations about the options and findings. This output is generated automatically, without the time-consuming process ofdrafting or dictating/typing/proofing a narrative summary. The software's output ismore complete, organized and precise than a narrative summary and more compatiblewith coding systems. The output can be printed or exported to electronic medical recordsystems, and reports can be generated in rich text format for printing or electronictransmission to the patient and other providers. In short, using software tools to couplemedical knowledge with patient data generates enormous direct administrativeefficiencies. The more important source of efficiency, however, is the indirect effect onproductivity.Using knowledge coupling software for the initial workup resembles use of a map.A map is a highly efficient information tool for navigating in unfamiliar territory. Itsefficiency results from its communicating carefully selected geographic information ina distilled, visual form that is maximally usable at the point of need. Similarly, knowl-edge coupling software provides a map to the landscape of medical knowledge. Patient-specific data items entered into the software, like coordinates on the X and Y axes of amap, enable the user to find immediately the patient's location in the landscape ofmedical knowledge. Collecting detailed data is, of course, more time consuming thanusing coordinates on a map. But this time investment pays large dividends. The caregiver and patient can rapidly compare the patient's condition with more-or-less similar situations described in the software's output, including not only the optionsand data it suggests but also the commentary it provides and the medical literature itcites. Detailed information becomes manageable because it is filtered and organizedbased on individual relevance to each patient's unique combination of needs. A carefulinitial workup is thus more feasible than it may first appear. As described by apioneering user of knowledge coupling software, Dr. Ken Bartholomew: ... let me dispel the notion that [Couplers] are extremely time-consuming if usedproperly. Certainly, the first few times using a Coupler will be time consuming,but no more so than reading a textbook chapter on a given problem. ... Because ofthe timeliness of the data that is built into the couplers, and since they are sopertinent by being problem-oriented [i.e. designed analyze is presenting problems,not medical specialties], I do not need to spend 20 or 30 minutes going throughindices of textbooks to find what may or may not be appropriate information.19 19 Bartholomew K. The Perspective of a Practitioner, in Weed LL et al, Knowledge Coupling: New06/27/08The whole question of feasibility is thus transformed. Once individualized problemsolving becomes the goal, then nothing less than detailed data collection seems feasiblefor achieving that goal. Moreover, to the extent that the goal is efficient use of personnel resources,knowledge coupling software makes it feasible to increase reliance on inexpensive non-physician caregivers. As described by one user of knowledge coupling software, Dr.Charles Burger:We have trained medical assistants to a high level of skill in information gatheringand physical examination. They serve as the main information gatherers, enteringhistorical and physical examination findings into the coupler. Since couplers definethe universe of what needs to be done for each problem, the medical assistantsbecome extremely skillful in these basic but important tasks. This use of medicalassistants allows the physician or nurse practitioner to spend most of his or hertime clarifying and annotating the history, checking certain physical findings, and,most important, reviewing the results of the coupler session with the patient tomake decisions regarding possible diagnoses or management options.20Similarly, as described by Dr. Bartholomew: In my clinic we have experimented with nurses ... doing the \"pre-workup.\" Thisis the bulk of the time-consuming process. When I enter the examining room, I havea coupler [output] that is largely done. With a good nurse, a large portion of thecommon physical findings can be entered in the computer and a note left ifsomething is in question. The physician then rechecks any physical findings thatare positive or questionable. This is, in fact, extremely time saving and allows youto ... \"become a consultant in your own practice.\" Physicians who organize their practices to take advantage of knowledge couplingsoftware may find significant economic benefits.21 And the rewards are more thaneconomic. Use of knowledge coupling software not only lessens the burdens on thephysician but makes practice more interesting and satisfying. As described by Dr.Bartholomew:The physician in this setting enters the equation at a higher level of expertise, and,instead of spending the whole day gathering mundane data, spends much moretime reviewing the complexities of the cases that need that extra caution to thepatient's benefit. Furthermore, I must admit that the practice of medicine in thissetting is simply more fun. It is more fun because it is more intellectuallyrewarding, and this is itself an excellent reason to be using couplers.

The couplers are full of information; I have never failed to learn something neweach time I have used one. ... Using couplers begins to become a reinforcingloop\u2014because they are fun to use, you use them more. The more you realize thatvaluable information, beyond your own personal store of knowledge, is beingbrought to bear on each of the patient's problems, the more secure you feel, themore patient gratification you generate, and the more gratification you have fromyour own practice.22The foregoing addresses the feasibility and benefits of the combinatorial approachfrom the physician's perspective. But in the long run that is the wrong perspective. Medicine's division of labor needs to shift away from the physician and towards externalinformation tools, non-physician caregivers, and patients themselves. That conclusionbecomes increasingly obvious as we further address physician objections to thecombinatorial approach. 2. Utility of detailed initial dataPhysicians, even if persuaded that detailed data collection is feasible, questionwhether it is truly productive at the outset of care. The only advantage of detailed initialdata, it seems, is identifying as many diagnostic or therapeutic options as possible. Forany individual patient, most of those possibilities will turn out to be inapplicable (theouter circle of information, as described above). Physicians believe that their expertiseenables them to leapfrog over the outer circle. They can rapidly identify the options ofprobable relevance to the individual patient. Those are the options worth investigating(the middle circle), and only limited data are needed to identify them, physicians believe. The important question, on this view, is whether objective evidence of probability,rather than subjective, variable physician judgments, should be the basis for identifyingthe options worth investigating. Whatever the answer to that question may be, expertphysicians collect initial data selectively rather than exhaustively. If and when itbecomes necessary to investigate improbable options (rare diagnoses, non-standard treat-ments), then more detailed data collection may be needed and specialists may beconsulted. An iterative process of successive elimination thus occurs. On this view,collecting detailed initial data at the outset of care defeats a primary purpose of expertfunctioning in the initial workup\u2014to avoid unnecessary data collection.23 22 Ibid.23 This section draws on \"The Database,\" in Knowledge Coupling, and on The Philosophy, Use and06/27/08This entire point of view rests on a mistaken premise\u2014that detailed initial datacollection is not needed to identify the options worth investigating. The reality, how-ever, is the opposite. The only reliable way to determine the options worth investigatingfor an individual patient is first to collect patient-specific data in great detail. Much of the detailed initial data will turn out to be irrelevant. But the relevant andirrelevant data cannot be distinguished in advance. They vary for each patient with thesame presenting problem. Detailed data must therefore be gathered at the outset. In noother way is it possible to take into account all options of potential relevance, and narrowthem down to options of actual relevance for an individual patient. These thresholdinquiries are compromised when detailed data collection and analysis are deferred. \"The matter of time is essential in all estimates of the value of information,\" NorbertWiener once observed.24 In medicine, the value of detailed information is greater at theoutset of care than the value of the same information gathered piecemeal, over time. Thatreality explains the traditional precept (honored more in the breach than the observance)that a detailed patient history \"is still the most essential part of clinical decision making. ... Extra time spent gathering data almost always saves much more time in the longrun.\"25 This observation from 20 years ago is now true more than ever, because growingmedical knowledge increases the utility of data available from a well-designed patienthistory (as well as physical examination and basic laboratory tests). As Dr. Ami Schattnerhas written: \"Diagnostic difficulties can often be resolved by simple means. ... closeattention to the safest, least expensive, and most informative test of all\u2014the history\u2014canhelp resolve diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas weeks and sometimes months beforethey might otherwise be resolved.\"26 Moreover, the patient history, physical exam andbasic laboratory tests are often needed to use advanced diagnostic tests productively, inboth formulating inquiries and interpreting results. For example, as Jerome Groopmanpoints out, the settings for multidetector CT scans (which enable rapid scans of large Interpretation of Knowledge Couplers, note 2 above, co-authored and authored, respectively, by Chris Weed.24 N. Wiener. The Human Use of Human Beings. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1950, 1954; New York:Avon Books, 1967, p. 168.25 Mold, JW, Stein JF. The cascade effect in the clinical care of patients. New England Journal of Medicine,1986. 314:512-14 (p. 513).26 Schattner A. \"Simple Is Beautiful: The Neglected Power of Simple Tests.\" Arch Intern Med 164:2198-2200 at 2199 (Nov. 8, 2004). 06/27/08volumes of tissue) can be adjusted to take into account not just the specific question posedby the referring physician but also the patient's history.27 One would hope that economic pressures induce more selective use of costlydiagnostic technologies and more effective use of traditional approaches. But, as Dr.Schattner elsewhere writes, precisely the opposite has occurred: \"physicians have become'fascinated', 'preoccupied' and 'obsessed' with their new instruments,\" which \"arevigorously promoted by the large companies that supply them.\" This state of affairs isdestructive at many levels:With the increasing availability of powerful diagnostic instruments, physicianshave become distanced from both their patients and the basic clinical data. Today,tests and procedures are considered infallible and ordered in increasingnumbers\u2014often almost blindly, repeatedly and sometimes even without examiningthe patient. Thus, many are redundant, inconclusive or misleading, in addition tobeing unnecessarily expensive. Uncertainty, false positive findings and fear oflawsuits often beget more tests or procedures and may trigger dangerous cascades. This testing-dominated approach undermines the value of clinical skills, whichtend to become underestimated, underused and finally lost.28A primary reason for neglect of basic clinical observations and tests is their multipli-city. That makes it difficult to know or recall what tests are available for any givenproblem or which tests should be used when. Equally difficult is comprehending all thedata generated. Accordingly, Dr. Schattner argues, fully exploiting information from thepatient history \"mandates a closely linked and thoughtful use of large, preferablyelectronic, databases.\" But Dr. Schattner does not address the core issues of how and whenexternal databases are to be used. In traditional medical practice, the physician's unaidedmind largely determines the content of the initial history during the patient encounter;afterwards the physician may go to medical libraries and electronic databases for externalguidance, if time permits. This sequence is backwards. External guidance should beorganized before and used during the three steps of the initial workup\u2014choice, collectionand analysis of patient data. That is what knowledge coupling software accomplishes. Then the practitioner and patient may supplement the software's output with additional 27 Groopman J., How Doctors Think, note Error! Bookmark not defined. above, pp. 193-94.28 Schattner, A. 185 (5): 273-275,available at http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/185_05_040906/sch10143_fm.html. See also Dr.Schattner's response to letters Ibid, is remarkable thatthese issues are still the subject of debate. By now it should be obvious that caregivers need informationtools to use clinical imaging tools effectively as much as they need the imaging tools to reveal internalorgans. In both contexts, ignoring modern technology is unacceptable. 06/27/08observations suggested by their personal knowledge, experience and judgment\u2014that ofthe practitioner who may have seen many other similar patients, and that of the patientwhose intimate personal knowledge and experience of her own condition may revealcrucial variations from what is expected. The preceding discussion is framed in terms of diagnostic decision making, but asimilar analysis applies to treatment decision making, especially management of chronicdisease. Many problems require considering a multiplicity of treatment options,including expensive technologies, a variety of medications, other interventions andchanges in patient behaviors. Evaluating the possibilities for each individual patientrequires detailed data collection and analysis. That does not occur without the necessarystandards and tools. As a result, patient needs are easily sacrificed to the short-termeconomic interests of other parties.This notion that routinely collecting detailed data is useful may seem to contradictresearch in the psychology of decision making. Summarizing this research, MalcolmGladwell states that in some situations \"you need to know very little to find the under-lying signature of a complex phenomenon.\" In such cases, Gladwell concludes, collectingand considering detailed data bury the few data points that matter in a mass ofextraneous information.29 This point is valid as far as it goes, but it overlooks two crucialelements. First, when many possibilities must be considered and each one has a differentsignature (e.g., multiple diagnostic possibilities, each with its own cluster of findings),then detailed data must be collected in order to consider all the possibilities. Second,finding the few data points that matter buried within detailed information is readilyaccomplished with software tools. Breaking our dependence on the unaided mind solvesthe needle in a haystack problem.The Addison's disease case discussed in Part Error! Reference source not found.powerfully illustrates these points. Recall that the physicians began by considering onlya limited range of diagnostic options, based on probabilities. As they explained it: \"theclinician usually begins a diagnostic investigation by considering (and excluding) themost common diagnoses. As those most common diagnoses become less likely, many lesscommon diagnoses are considered\" (emphasis added).30 Consistent with this acceptedpractice, an evidence-based ranking of diagnostic possibilities for fatigue would assigna low rank to Addison's disease, because that condition is rare, both in the generalpopulation and in the population of patients with severe fatigue. 29 Gladwell, M. Blink (New York: Little Brown and Co., 2005), pp. 136-45.30 Keljo D, Squires R. Clinical Problem Solving: Just in Time. N Engl J Med 1996: 334:46-48 (p. 48). 06/27/08But those broad populations were not relevant for this particular patient. Instead,relevant to her was the limited group of individuals with combinations of findingssimilar to hers. The initial findings on her included fatigue, shortness of breath,hypotension, weight loss and numerous, deeply pigmented moles\u2014each of which aredocumented manifestations of Addison's disease. Soon after the initial encounter,additional known symptoms of Addison's disease appeared. In the limited group ofpatients with such a combination of findings, Addison's disease should be ranked highas a probable diagnosis. But in this case it was not even considered as a possibility untilthe patient was near death.The reason for this delay emerges from two elements of the situation. These twoelements occur routinely in both primary and specialty care: First, none of the findings recited above are specific to Addison's disease. On thecontrary, the various findings each suggested numerous diagnostic possibilities. Collectively, these possibilities implicated almost every specialty in medicine. Second, faced with this complexity, the patient's physicians began their considera-tion with diagnostic possibilities that they viewed as \"the most common.\" Addison's disease was apparently not considered because it is rare. This approachis accepted medical practice. In beginning with the most common possibilities, physicians commit a basicconceptual error. Indeed, this approach is backwards. What is common or rare in thegeneral population should be the last information to consider, not the first. The firstinformation to consider for an individual patient should be all the possible diagnosessuggested by the patient's particular combination of findings, regardless of the probabil-ity of those diagnoses occurring in larger populations. Addison's disease would haveimmediately emerged as a highly probable diagnosis if the non-specific findings on thisgirl were combined. The underlying principle is clear: findings that are non-specificwhen viewed in isolation often become highly specific when viewed in combination. Acorollary principle is that judgments of probability are highly misleading as applied toindividual patients, because those judgments are derived from large population studieswhere the few variables examined become isolated from the detailed patient data neededfor combinatorial analysis.These principles give the combinatorial approach enormous power. But that powerdepends on gathering data in sufficient detail and then reliably matching it with medicalknowledge. The reliability of both tasks depends on using software tools rather than theunaided mind to guide initial data collection and analysis. 06/27/08Data collection guided by software tools is highly standardized. Why mandate thatdeparture from accepted practice?3. Utility of standardized initial data Physicians object that the combinatorial approach does not allow for case-by-casediscretionary judgments in selecting initial data. This view rejects a central element ofthe combinatorial approach\u2014that standardized initial data must be determined in advancefor a given presenting problem. In other words, for every patient who has that problem,the caregiver must habitually collect all data specified in advance, without any omissionsbased on the caregiver's clinical judgment. To many physicians, this standardization ismere \"cookbook medicine.\"This view is backwards. In reality, cookbook medicine results from our humanpropensity to process only information that supports our preconceptions. Each physicianhas a personal set of preconceptions, generating enormous variability. The only escapefrom this dilemma is to standardize initial data collection and analysis. Paradoxically, standardized data collection is essential to capturing the uniqueness ofindividual patients. Their medical individuality emerges when data are collected froma predefined universe of standardized data with sufficient consistency and detail to showindividual variations. In contrast, when physicians have discretion to shorten a stan-dardized initial workup, key individual variations may be lost. Indeed, this loss ofinformation is to be expected.Consider, for example, the problem of diabetes management. An initial workup ofa diabetic patient should cover some 330 findings. Each patient's set of positive findingswill differ. And those variations among diabetic patients may be crucial to their care,because every finding is carefully selected in advance for its direct relevance to diabetesmanagement. If physicians substitute their own judgments for the predefined initialworkup, some of those judgments will result in omissions. And some of those omissionswill reflect physician idiosyncrasies (time constraints, clinical prejudices, unsupportedhypotheses) rather than accurate judgments of which findings can safely be ignored. Inshort, allowing judgmental omissions from a predefined initial workup reintroduces thevery idiosyncrasies that patients need protection against. (Judgmental additions to theinitial workup are a quite different matter, as discussed below.)Some experienced physicians may be confident that they can judge when it is safe toabbreviate an initial workup. Their talent and experience, they believe, often enablethem to recognize a clear diagnosis or treatment without performing a complete workup.06/27/08 Those physicians will readily acknowledge, however, that their judgments are superiorto the judgments of some other physicians with less talent or experience, and certainlysuperior to the judgments of non-physicians. Permitting those other practitioners to omitportions of the initial workup at their discretion will therefore leave patients at risk. Moreover, even the most self-confident physicians must concede that their superiorjudgments will not always be accepted on faith by patients or others. Indeed, patients orcolleagues or payers or regulators might prefer to rely on initial workups conducted bynon-physician caregivers, who would not presume to cut corners during the initialworkup based on their personal knowledge or judgment. In short, everyone involved needs some objective standard for identifying trust-worthy judgments. The combinatorial approach provides the necessary objectivestandard\u2014that is, detailed patient data selected in advance based on review of themedical literature. Patients or others who are unwilling to accept physician judgmentson faith can simply demand completion of the predefined initial workup, even if thephysician views it as unnecessary overkill. A self-confident physician should welcomethat demand, because a complete initial workup presumably will vindicate his superiorjudgment\u2014that is, the physician will have already considered anything significant thecomplete initial workup reveals.Actual experience with the combinatorial approach reveals that the self-confidenceof even the best physicians is often misplaced. The human mind, no matter how giftedand well-schooled, simply cannot be trusted with the intricate information processingthat individualized decision making entails. When the medical literature shows that 300+initial findings are needed to manage diabetes, for example, the physician's case-by-casejudgments of when to dispense with some of those findings are bound to be fallible. Every patient's combination of findings will vary. Any individual variation may turn outto be significant. And this differentiation increases with chronic conditions, as eachpatient's evolving disease interacts with his or her unique physiology, psyche andcircumstances over time. Moreover, two other factors mandate rigorous enforcement of a combinatorialminimum standard. First, however justifiable some omissions from the initial workupmight seem, they create an unexplained gap in the patient's record of care. Caregiversother than the initial examiner cannot distinguish between findings that were checkedand found to be negative and findings that were simply omitted and never checked. Theresulting uncertainty invites either wasteful duplication or uninformed follow-up. Second, omissions contaminate the patient's record of care as a source of data fordiscovering new knowledge. The recorded care of many thousands of patients should06/27/08provide reliable data from which patterns can be identified, as we shall discuss furtherin Parts Error! Reference source not found. and 0.These points are a reminder that medicine needs something like standards ofaccounting in the business world. In a business, every deposit and every payment offunds must be recorded. No one would attempt to judge when it is unnecessary to do so,because everyone understands that recording each deposit and payment is essential tomaintaining controls over financial operations. Similarly, in medicine, rigorouslycollecting and recording every positive finding of a predefined data set is necessary tomaintain reliable systems for decision making and feedback. A combinatorial approachto the initial workup makes this point obvious, because it means that each item of datahas been carefully chosen in advance for its potential utility.Here users may reasonably object that they need some flexibility in the timing ofdata collection for some items (particularly lab tests). It may not always be practical insome practice settings to immediately obtain each and every test result that the knowl-edge coupling software identifies as needed for the initial workup. The software accom-modates this need by designating certain items as data to be collected \"if available.\" When necessary, the user can defer collection of these items in the hope that other datawill be enough to arrive at a solution. The key point to recognize is that the softwareshould make this exercise of judgment by the user transparent. The missing data itemsare recorded as uncertain findings, not as negative findings. Anyone reviewing theCoupler output is thus alerted to the possible need to obtain the missing data.4. Effect on the doctor-patient relationshipWhatever utility the combinatorial approach to the initial workup may have,physicians still object that it harms their relationship with patients. The combinatorialapproach means that the patient interacts initially not with the physician but with acomputer and with non-physician personnel who conduct the physical examination. Thisdivision of labor is unacceptable to some physicians and patients. They contrast anidealized scenario where the physician sympathetically inquires about the patient'shistory, personally performs the physical exam, observes the patient's demeanor andimmediately orders tests and procedures he judges to be relevant. Through this inter-action, it is believed, the physician develops personal rapport, observes firsthand thepatient's physical and emotional condition, and establishes his immediate command ofthe situation. 06/27/08Physicians are right that their personal relationships with patients are critical. At itsbest, the human interaction between caregiver and patient is itself therapeutic. Butphysicians' idealized image of their relationship with patients is hardly consistent withhow the initial workup is usually conducted. Time constraints often prevent a sympa-thetic discussion of the patient's condition, cultural barriers may hinder communication,graduate medical education fosters behaviors and attitudes that interfere withcommunication, and not all physicians have good communication skills to begin with. In short, the personal relationship between the physician and patient is not necessarilya positive element. Moreover, that personal relationship provides no comfort to patientsif not backed by professional expertise the patient can trust. Patients need to be able to trust the physician to gather and correctly take intoaccount the right information. An objective basis for trust arises when physicians employa combinatorial approach to the initial workup implemented with software tools. Incontrast, a judgmental approach to the initial workup hardly inspires patient trust. \"Theaverage patient visiting a doctor in the United States gets 22 seconds for his initialstatement, then the doctor takes the lead,\"31 according to one study. Other observersconclude that the physicians are deficient in bringing out patients' own concerns.32 Thisstate of affairs fosters cynicism among patients. As expressed in the headline of a NewYork Times article on the subject: \"Tell the Doctor All Your Problems, But Keep It to LessThan a Minute.\" The hurried, judgmental approach remains accepted practice eventhough research has \"linked poor communication to misdiagnoses, the ordering ofunnecessary tests, and the failure of patients to follow treatment plans.\"33 Critics of current practice advocate improved interviewing techniques by physi-cians.34 Yet, no improvements in interviewing will ever bring initial workups to anacceptable level of quality. So long as physician judgment determines the content of theworkup, the inevitable outcome is enormous variation from one physician to another. Drs. John Bjorn and Harold Cross documented this phenomenon more than 35 years 31 Langevitz W, Denz M, Keller A, et al. \"Spontaneous talking time at start of consultation in outpatientclinic: cohort study.\" BMJ 2002. 325:682-693.32 Ibid.; Marvel have weimproved? JAMA 1999. 281:283-287.33 M. Levine, \"Tell the Doctor All Your Problems, but Keep It to Less Than a Minute.\" New YorkTimes, June 1, 2004. 34 Ibid.; Marvel MK, Epstein RM, Flowers K, Beckman patient's agenda: have weimproved? JAMA 1999. 281:283-287.06/27/08ago35 when they recruited one of their patients to take her case to a number of physiciansin their community. This patient found that each physician elicited different informationand drew different conclusions, even though they were examining the same symptomsin the same person. Since then, innumerable studies have further documented that variation amongproviders is the norm in numerous medical contexts (most of these studies do notexamine the context of the initial workup, the importance of which is not generallyrecognized). These studies, however, typically do not compare responses of differentproviders to a single patient but rather compare provider responses to a single diseasecondition. Variation is conceived as departure from \"evidence-based\" guidelines for aparticular disease condition. This concept does not account for the possibility that somevariations by physicians justifiably reflect the varying needs of individual patientslabeled with the \"same\" disease. In contrast, the Bjorn and Cross study, by comparingresponses of multiple physicians to a single patient, clearly shows that variation reflectsprovider idiosyncrasies. This conclusion comes as no surprise to patients. In fact, theonly consistency some patients experience is that multiple physicians repeatedly askthem for the same basic information\u2014which is hardly the consistency patients want. Patients and doctors are adrift. For them, the system fails even to define the optimalinitial workup, much less disseminate and enforce it. This state of affairs is what harmsthe doctor-patient relationship. Patients see that physicians' initial workups are variable,ad hoc and incomplete. The patient is too often left wondering whether the physicianconsidered all the relevant diagnostic or treatment possibilities, gathered the right data,correctly interpreted the data obtained, and carefully recorded what was done. Physi-cians themselves may have the same doubts about their own work, and that of theircolleagues (which is one reason why patients find themselves repeatedly asked for thesame data). The result is that patients shuttle from one costly specialist to another,because no one involved can tell whether the uncertainty they face reflects gaps inpersonal knowledge (which the next specialist might know enough to remedy), orwhether that uncertainty reflects gaps in current medical science (which makes the nextspecialist consultation an exercise in futility). This disorder undermines the therapeutic benefit inherent in caregiving itself. Medical attention satisfies a basic human need for relief and sympathy. But if patients 35 Bjorn J, Cross H. The Problem-Oriented Private Practice of Medicine. 1970. Chicago: Modern HealthcarePress, pp. 24-28.06/27/08perceive disorder and lack of care in what is done to them, that perception alone maydestroy the therapeutic benefit that medical attention itself potentially confers. Unlike a judgmental approach to the initial workup, an orderly, combinatorialapproach lays a secure foundation for a system. Both parties feel protected against thelimits and idiosyncrasies of the unaided mind. The burden of uncertainty is reduced, andopen communication is enhanced. The combinatorial approach brings both greatereffectiveness and greater honesty to the physician's work. As Dr. Richard Rockefeller haswritten of his experiences in patient care using knowledge coupling software: \"our senseof worth and competence is better served by improved outcomes in the realm of thepossible than by compensatory fantasies of omniscience.\"36 Similarly, Dr. JeromeGroopman (not a user of knowledge coupling software) has written:Does acknowledging uncertainty undermine a patient's sense of hope andconfidence in his physician and the proposed therapy? Paradoxically, takinguncertainty into account can enhance a physician's therapeutic effectiveness,because it demonstrates his honesty, his willingness to be the more engaged withhis patients, his commitment to the reality of the situation rather than resorting toevasion, half-truth and even lies. And it makes it easier for the doctor to changecourse if the first strategy fails, to keep trying. Uncertainty sometimes is essentialfor success.37 But without knowledge coupling software, it is difficult to distinguish between genuineuncertainty and mere personal unawareness of applicable knowledge. A sociologist has done a survey of patient attitudes towards use of PKC knowledgecoupling software in a primary care practice.38 He found that a majority viewed theirexperience favorably, a significant minority were neutral and a significant minorityviewed their experience unfavorably. Elements of the experience that were viewedfavorably included thoroughness and depth of data collection, inclusion of personallifestyle details bearing on diagnostic and treatment decisions, lessened reliance on thedoctor's personal knowledge, objective presentation of decision options and evidence,and printouts of the detailed knowledge coupling results (which facilitate recall, under-standing, follow-up, and discussion with family members and other providers). Unfavorable reactions appeared to reflect antipathy to computers and a preference for thefamiliar, personal questioning by an authoritative physician. The sociologist whoconducted the survey wrote that some patients view the computer as \"fostering an 36 Knowledge Coupling, note 2 above, p. ix.37 Groopman J., note Error! Bookmark not defined. above, p. 155.38 Weaver R. \"Informatics Tools and Medical Communication: Patient Perspectives of \"KnowledgeCoupling\" in Primary Care,\" Health Communication, 15(1), 59-78 (2003).06/27/08'impersonal' environment\" even though the software elicited detailed findings about thepatient's condition and personal circumstances. Also problematic for a few patients is thefact that use of computers protects against the mind's fallibility: \"Whereas most respon-dents applaud this, a few, ironically, seemed disheartened by the tacit admission of themind's limitations, [which] seemed to diminish their confidence in the care and advicebeing delivered.\"39 A contrasting view was expressed by one of the survey respondents,who commented: I have had a couple of problems that a series of doctors failed miserably todiagnose. None of them ever picked up a book while I was in the office nor hintedthat they consulted any reference. Perhaps their performance wouldn't have beenso pitiful if they had used references. Computers can be a quick way to find andcheck information.40Dr. Ken Bartholomew, who pioneered use of PKC knowledge coupling software toimplement the combinatorial approach, described the reactions of his patients as follows:Not only do patients see the thoroughness involved in the use of couplers, but theysense that we care enough to give them the kind of thoroughness that they feelentitled to. With the coupler's systematic review of details in the patient's life thatcould be relevant to the current problem, the patient feels that his or her individualsituation has been thoroughly examined and all possible conclusions have beentaken into account. In management couplers, they further see the many differentcombinations of therapy and understand that the care of a complex, long termproblem requires a detailed understanding of the patient's unique situation,followed by a careful monitoring of the options chosen. Even when a diagnosis isstill in question, they have, in my experience, been completely satisfied with theoutcome of the encounter. In addition, by receiving a printout of the findings andpossible causes, they feel empowered to review the situation at home and to watchfor signs and symptoms that may aid the diagnostic process in the days or weeksto come. The use of couplers teaches them that there is a time course to diseaseand that not all signs and symptoms necessarily occur \"by the book\" orsimultaneously. By thus empowering our patients with information, as opposedto leaving them in a void, we reinforce their collaborative role as part of a teamworking toward an understood goal. ... it is only when this occurs that theoptimum physician/patient relationship is built.41Another physician user of knowledge coupling software, Dr. Richard Rockefeller, hasfurther described the importance to patients of detailed data collection about theirpersonal situation and experience: 39 Ibid., p. 75.40 Ibid. p. 73.41 Bartholomew K, in Knowledge Coupling, note 2 above, pp. 238-39.06/27/08In the prevailing medical paradigm, orientated as it is toward general knowledge,patients feel appreciated and well cared for to the extent that their problems aregeneric, that is, match population-based classifications of pathology. When thedimensions of their suffering and needs extravasate beyond these borders, ascommonly happens, patients discover their idiosyncrasies to be sources offrustration and anger. They often find themselves alienated not only from a systemwhich fails to meet their needs but also from themselves, to the extent they identifywith the systems implicit devaluation of their uniqueness. [In contrast, thecombinatorial] approach ... takes the set of attributes, historical circumstances andpreferences which differentiate one individual from the next as central to, ratherthan as a troublesome distraction from, the important work of the therapeuticencounter. Patients' satisfaction is enhanced as their aptitudes andcontributions\u2014self-knowledge, willingness and ability to gather data pertaining tothe problem, among others\u2014are appropriately valued. Finally, as a reward forrelinquishing the comfortable (but also dangerous, increasingly untenable andultimately unfulfilling) illusion of being wholly provided for by an omnipotentparent, patients are afforded the human rewards of collegiality, including equalstature in the patient/doctor relationship and control over decisions affecting theirhealth.Written in 1991, long before current discussion of \"consumer-driven care,\"\"information therapy\" and the like, Dr. Bartholomew and Dr. Rockefeller prescientlydescribed an ideal that the marketplace is beginning to recognize. But the recognitionis incomplete, and so the necessary tools and standards of care are yet to be accepted.5. Information processing, clinical judgment and the twostages of decision makingOur only remaining hope and salvation is to begin the whole labourof the mind again; not leaving it to itself, but directing it perpetuallyfrom the very first, and attaining our end as it were by mechanicalaid. \u2014 Francis Bacon42We have seen that clinical judgment is unreliable in both selection and analysis ofinitial patient data, and we have examined selection of initial data at some length. Herewe further examine analysis of patient data. a. Analysis as information processingBy \"analysis\" of patient data we mean a simple process of association between dataitems and corresponding medical knowledge\u2014for example, the association between a 42 Bacon F. Novum Organon (1620), Preface to Second Part, available athttp://history.hanover.edu/texts/Bacon/novpref.htm.06/27/08cluster of patient findings and a diagnosis explaining those findings, or between possibletreatments for the diagnosis and patient findings bearing on suitability of each treatment. Conceived in this way, data analysis involves raw information processing\u2014establishinglinkages between patient findings and a database of medical knowledge. That functionis readily carried out with software tools used by all caregivers and patients themselves. This simple concept of analysis is to be distinguished from more complex processesinvolving logic and inference. In turn, both simple and complex analytical processes ofdecision making may be distinguished from instinctive, intuitive processes. Physicians object that a simple process of association is crude and incomplete. Theanalytical sophistication involved in understanding pathophysiology is lacking. Moreover, even if software tools with that sophistication were designed, those toolscould never capture the subtleties of personal interactions with patients and the resultinginstinctive element of clinical judgment.The reality, however, is that giving free rein to clinical judgment degrades analysisof initial data. Inevitably, physicians jump to conclusions based on skimpy data andlimited personal knowledge. As Dr. Jerome Groopman has written of diagnostic analy-sis, for example, \"research shows that most doctors quickly come up with two or threepossible diagnoses within minutes of meeting a patient ... All develop their hypothesesfrom a very incomplete body of information.\"43 Their analyses are similarly incompletein the treatment context, where physicians often fail to consider much of the informationneeded for identifying and choosing among available treatment options. The exercise of judgment naturally leads physicians to shortcut organized thresholdprocesses and plunge into follow-up processes prematurely. Without a secure founda-tion, those follow-up processes are piecemeal, disorderly, risky and full of waste. Actingin a hit-or-miss fashion, physicians order tests and treatments as soon as possible. If theydo not hit on a solution, more tests and treatments are tried. The escalating volume ofdata to ponder often becomes too large and disorganized to take it all into account, whilethe volume of medical knowledge relevant to interpreting all that data becomes too largeto recall or comprehend. Coordination, follow-through and feedback frequently fallapart. Risk of mishap lurks every step of the way. This quagmire traps both primary care physicians and the specialists they consult.

In that case, what was needed was not sophisticated clinical reasoningbut simply pattern recognition\u2014the association between the initial findings and the 43 Groopman J. How Doctors Think, note Error! Bookmark not defined. above, p. 35. 06/27/08correct diagnosis. Software tools would have been superior to expert judgment for thatlimited task. Autonomous clinical judgment is not capable of performing that task reliably, nomatter how well physicians are educated. Constraining clinical judgment is the mind'scapacity for information processing. To compensate, the mind's normal modes ofoperation include various simplifying approaches (heuristics) that limit the informationtaken into account, as decades of research in cognitive psychology has demonstrated. Inthe last decade, thanks to the patient safety movement, medicine has woken up to theimplications of this research for explaining why execution of medical decisions so oftengoes awry. More recently, implications for medical decision making itself have becomethe focus of attention.44 But the weaknesses of clinical judgment go beyond the mental heuristics on whichthe mind relies to cope with complexity. The problem is also that judgment is idiosyn-cratic and personal. Except in the simplest matters, no two people take into account thesame information in the same way. Idiosyncratic variations among physicians arise fromvarying individual abilities, varying medical backgrounds (training, experience,specialty orientation), other influences (emotional, cultural and financial), and othercontingencies (the time available at the patient encounter, the stage of the patient'scondition at that point, the patient's recall of needed information, the interpersonaldynamics between patient and caregiver, the sequence in which different specialistshappen to be consulted). Most of us try to use our judgment to recognize and overcome internal cognitiveweaknesses and external influences. But our capacity to do so is just as limited as ourcapacity for raw information processing. The mental heuristics identified by cognitivepsychologists \"appear to be integral components of human information processing. Aswith visual illusions, awareness does not prevent us from being susceptible to theireffects ...\"45 Much the same can be said of other influences (financial interests, emotionalneeds, cultural preconceptions) that further distort judgment. Inevitably, reliance onjudgment compromises analysis of initial data. 44 Well before the patient safety movement made the issue prominent, however, the implications ofcognitive psychology for medical decision making were discussed in the literature. See Weed LL.,Physicians of the Future, note 8 above; Weed LL. Knowledge Coupling, note 2 above, pp. 8, 37-42, 212, 226-27.45 A Elstein. Heuristics and Clinical Reasoning. Acad. Med. 74:791-793 (1999),p. 793.06/27/08b. The two stages of decision making and the proper role ofjudgment What, then, is the role of judgment, if any, under the combinatorial approach? Recallfrom Part III.A our discussion of the two stages of decision making: (1) building aninformational foundation designed to identify options for decision with the pros andcons of each option, and (2) choosing among the options. The first stage requiresprocessing information\u2014making associations between general knowledge and patient-specific data. The second stage involves applying judgment to choose among the optionsin light of the evidence. Judgment at this second stage involves logical analysis, intuitionand personal values. The role of human judgment is to supplement the first stage of decision making andgovern the second. In the first stage, the predefined initial workup may be supplementedwith additional information judged by the patient or caregiver to be relevant. Butjudgment should not be permitted to cut short the initial workup. The first stage mustbe completed, so that, in the second stage, judgment is informed and its basis is trans-parent. And in the second stage, it is the patient's judgment, not the physician's, thatshould be decisive. If patient data are carefully chosen in advance, collected without omission andreliably coupled with medical knowledge at the initial workup, then the need for judg-ment in some cases is almost eliminated. That happens when the first stage reveals aclear solution to the patient's problem. A clear solution is one that anyone's judgmentwould accept. The Addison's disease case study discussed above provides an example. There, assembling the right information would have revealed a clearly correct diagnosisand treatment at the outset of care, with minimal judgment required. In such cases, thelocus of decision making authority should not matter, because the right decision almostmakes itself once the right information is assembled. Significant judgment is needed only if uncertainty remains and opinions vary afterrigorous information gathering and processing at the initial workup are completed. Atthat point, the patient and caregiver are usually faced with a range of possible diagnosticor treatment options to investigate further and choose among. Uncertainty means thatno one option stands out as superior to all the others. Once a choice is made among theoptions, continuing feedback and adjustment over time may be needed (particularly incases of chronic disease), taking into account new patient data coupled with relevantmedical knowledge. These follow-up processes involve a series of choices and theexercise of judgment at each point, but judgment should be highly structured, not open-06/27/08ended. That is, ongoing judgments should be structured within processes that arerigorously organized and documented (the subject of part Error! Reference source notfound. below) as well as continuously informed by reliable knowledge coupling. c. Physician objections to separate stages of decisionmakingPhysicians tend to reject compartmentalizing of the decision making process intoseparate stages. On their view, as data and impressions emerge from the very beginningof the initial workup, physicians believe they can and should employ their trained judg-ment to quickly form hypotheses and thereby determine what further data to obtain fromthe history, physical examination and laboratory tests, which then provide feedback onthe hypotheses, and so forth. In this iterative process, physicians believe, continual exer-cise of informed judgment by gifted, highly trained and experienced experts is superiorto a rigid combinatorial approach where pre-determined data are collected uniformlyand linked to medical knowledge without resort to expert judgment. Moreover, on thisview, it is an illusion to think that compartmentalizing the two stages of decision makingprotects against the pitfalls of human judgment. Judgment is inescapable throughout. In the first stage of decision making, preexisting medical judgments by someone deter-mine what options should be considered, what counts as evidence for and against thoseoptions, and what initial data should be collected as evidence. That someone, on thisview, should be the treating physician\u2014not the patient, not third party payers, notclinical researchers, and not the authors of texts, clinical guidelines or software tools. Only the treating physician's judgment, on this view, combines medical science, firsthandcontact with the individual patient and firsthand experience with similar medicalproblems in many other patients. Only the treating physician has the expertise tointegrate advanced medical knowledge and experience with each patient's individualneeds.Implicit in this point of view are different concepts of expertise. Before respondingto this point of view, we should unravel these differing concepts of expertise in generaland physician expertise in particular. It should be understood that these traditionalconcepts of expertise all assume that the human mind is the primary vehicle forinformation processing \u2014 for combining general knowledge with specific data. Whenexternal tools assume that function, they directly reveal new patterns and relationshipsthat the human mind may only infer indirectly, if at all (see part 0 below). Thus,traditional expertise as discussed below is superseded, just as the stethoscope issuperseded for diagnosing what chest X-rays reveal directly. (Accordingly, the following06/27/08discussion of traditional concepts of expertise is a digression, which may be of littleinterest to readers who accept the need for external tools to process complexinformation.)Three schools of thought about expert decision making. Physicians naturally believethat their informed judgment involves a set of cognitive abilities (knowledge, analyticalskill and developed intuition) that only they can acquire and apply. This belief in \"the artof medicine\" seems supported by a distinction recognized by psychologists andphilosophers. They distinguish between explicit knowledge (associated with conscious,deliberate judgment) and tacit knowledge (associated with intuitive or instinctivejudgment), expressed in the phrases \"knowing that\" and \"knowing how,\" respectively.46 Explicit knowledge involves factual information, principles and logical relationshipsthat can be articulated. Tacit knowledge involves skills and perceptions that cannot bearticulated (\"we know more than we can tell\"). Experts thus appear to acquire tacitknowledge that texts and software tools cannot reproduce. Indeed, expertise issometimes defined as possession of specialized tacit knowledge. On this basis, it mayseem plausible to believe that physician expertise cannot be reproduced in software tools,and that physician judgment should not be subordinated to the combinatorial standard.This school of thought seems to be further supported by research showing theimpressive powers of instinctive judgment. These powers have been studied in manycontexts, not limited to professional expertise. Relying on this school of thought,Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller Blink argues that conscious, deliberate judgments are oftenless trustworthy than first impressions and snap judgments (\"rapid cognition\").47 Gladwell suggests two reasons for this phenomenon. One is that deliberate decisionmaking often buries the few key factors that matter in excessive information (this pointmisses the potential for external tools to uncover the few key factors that matter). Another reason is that deliberate decision making lacks the power of our \"adaptiveunconscious\" to comprehend intangible, unarticulated factors of relevance (of course, thispoint misses the risk that unconscious heuristics cause crucial information to beoverlooked).By comparison with this school of thought favoring instinctive judgment, the cultureof graduate medical education favors deliberate over instinctive judgment. Scientific 46 Barbiero, D. \"Tacit knowledge.\" Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind,http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/tacitknowledge.html.47 Gladwell M. Blink, pp. 13-14.06/27/08understanding of pathophysiology is viewed as the core element of physician expertise. The acquired knowledge and analytical capacity involved in that expertise48 is what Dr.Sherwin Nuland described as \"every doctor's measure of his own abilities ... the mostimportant ingredient in his professional self-image (see note 10 above). Some non-academic practitioners may disagree, viewing their developed intuitions as no lessimportant than scientific knowledge and analysis, but they still view the latter asessential to their expertise. A completely different school of thought points in just the opposite direction. Thisschool discounts the value of expert decision making, regardless of whether expertise isattributed to deliberate or instinctive judgment. As summarized in a meta-analysis byprofessors William Grove and Paul Meehl, decades of studies in various fields (includingmedicine) have compared subjective, impressionistic, expert judgments with mechanical,algorithmic procedures such as multiple regression, weighted sums of predictive factors,and actuarial tables. These procedures combine items of data (e.g. findings on a patient)to arrive at predictive conclusions (e.g. diagnoses) in a formulaic manner. Grove andMeehl conclude that the mechanical procedures perform as well or marginally better thanthe judgments of expensive expert professionals. Based on this conclusion, they arguethat the legal authority conferred on expensive experts in many contexts is not justified.49 This school of thought suggests that human judgment should be minimized not only inthe first stage of decision making, as argued here, but also in the second stage, contraryto what is argued here. To summarize, we have described three alternative bases for medical decisionmaking\u2014(1) deliberate judgments based on explicit knowledge, (2) instinctive judgmentsbased on tacit knowledge, and (3) mechanical substitutes for judgment\u2014and three schoolsof thought about these alternatives. In academic medicine the prevailing school ofthought is that deliberate judgment is the core element of physician expertise. The 48 Some would argue that knowledge, not analytic capacity, is the primary basis for an expert'sdeliberate judgment: \"Studies of expertise have repeatedly demonstrated that the expert is distinguished,not by the possession of any general skills, but by the ready availability from memory of appropriateknowledge to resolve the problem.\" Norman G R. Problem-solving skills, solving problems and problem-based learning. Med Educ 1988;22: 279-86. If knowledge is indeed the primary basis of expertise, then theclaim of experts that they are irreplaceable is that much weaker. As a vehicle for knowledge retrieval,software tools are superior to the expert's mind, which cannot readily retain or retrieve from memory thevariable bodies of knowledge relevant to real world problems.49 Grove W, Meehl P. Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal(mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: the clinical-statistical controversy. Psychology, Policyand Law 1996; 2:293-323, p. 316. See also Dawes R. Rational Choice in an Uncertain World (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. 1988), pp. 202-19. 06/27/08second school of thought (not specific to medicine) is that the power of instinctive judg-ment is undervalued and deserves increased acceptance; some view this power as adefining characteristic of true expertise. The third school of thought, accepted by manycognitive psychologists, is that both deliberate and instinctive judgments are overvaluedand very often should be replaced with formulaic, non-judgmental alternatives.The necessity of distinguishing between the two stages of decision making. Thesevarious schools of thought about the nature of expertise, and physician experts whoobject to compartmentalizing the process of decision into separate stages, miss twoessential points. First, different forms of human judgment and substitutes for judgment are eachunreliable in the second stage of decision making (making choices) becauseimportant information is so often overlooked in the first stage (identifyingavailable choices and the pros and cons of each). That explains why the studiescited by Grove and Meehl show the accuracy of human judgment to be onlymarginally different from non-judgmental substitutes, and why both are highlyfallible. Their fallibility diminishes, however, when the right tools and standardsof care are brought to the task of assembling information in the first stage ofdecision making. Second, what matters is the division of labor between judgment and external tools. At both stages of decision making, the mind's limited capacity to recall andprocess complex information in the first stage constrains expert judgment. Bypassing that constraint with simple software tools enhances medical decisionmaking far more than sophisticated software that simulates the expert's flawedfunctioning within that constraint.50The ideal of continuous improvement. In our efforts to improve decision making,the guiding principle should be to continuously improve the basis for decisions in thefirst stage as a foundation for exercising judgment in the second stage. Improving thebasis for decisions not only informs the exercise of judgment but also clarifies when toemploy deliberate or instinctive judgment or a substitute for both. Above all, improvingthe first stage of decision making involves obtaining and acting on feedback overtime\u2014the key to continuous improvement of any complex activity. 50 \"Reengineering Medicine,\" note Error! Bookmark not defined. above, p. __. A similar pointwas recently made in Fenstermacher K. \"The tyranny of tacit knowledge: What artificial intelligencetells us about knowledge representation,\" Proceedings of the 38th Hawaii International Conference on SystemSciences - 2005, available athttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1385736&isnumber=30166. 06/27/08In medicine, continuous improvement in the basis for decision making is not attain-able unless a combinatorial approach is enabled with knowledge coupling software. Improvement may then occur at many levels. This is easiest to understand at the levelof deliberate judgment, which can be articulated and captured in knowledge couplingsoftware. But improvement may also occur at the level of instinctive judgment. Continual use of knowledge coupling software with many patients over time developsand enriches physicians' tacit knowledge. At every patient encounter, the combinatorialapproach brings to bear a wealth of significant information going beyond the physician'spersonal store of knowledge and experience Elicited with knowledge coupling tools,this broader information is not abstract or general but rather is directly relevant to theimmediate problems of an individual human being. Caregivers who have thisexperience with thousands of their patients over time may develop instincts andintuitions that are unattainable in current medical practice.Some physicians may choose to believe that their exceptional minds are capable ofselecting and analyzing initial data as well or better than lesser minds equipped withexternal tools. These physicians, however, must admit that their expertise is notavailable to most of those who need it, nor is it transparent and subject to organized,continuous, verifiable improvement. And those physicians must admit that even theirjudgments may on occasion be wrong. Their exceptional ability may then cause them totake the patient faster and farther in the wrong direction than would otherwise occur. Moreover, regardless of ability, a physician's personal experiences in patient careinevitably affect his or her judgments of what patient data should be collected and whatthe data means. (This becomes explicit whenever physicians justify their conclusionswith the statement, \"in my experience ... \"). Yet any physician's personal experience isinevitably limited and randomly different from that of other physicians. Judgmentshould be informed and tested by evidence that may lie outside personal experience andthat may contradict beliefs derived from experience. Merely personal judgment shouldnot compromise either stage of decision making. Enforcing this principle was the original goal of evidence-based medicine. But thatgoal is not achievable by evidence-based medicine in its current form. Evidence-basedmedicine compromises decisions by misplaced use of population-based knowledge forunique individual patients. The only way to extract some utility from population-basedknowledge for patient care, and above all the only way to develop a more individualizedbody of medical knowledge, is to enforce detailed data collection on all patients, withoutthe case-by-case exercise of judgment as to what data are necessary.06/27/08To permit judgmental departures from a combinatorial minimum standard increaseseach patient's exposure to wrong judgments. And a wrong judgment of initial data canbe disastrous. Consider again the Addison's disease case. There, the initial data weresufficient to suggest the correct diagnosis. Yet, the physicians misjudged the data andthereby overlooked the correct diagnosis for months. Their patient almost died as theywandered down the various blind alleys their judgments suggested. What is needed is a system designed to minimize erroneous judgments whileincorporating prior, accurate judgments applicable to the problem at hand. This istraditionally a central function of experts\u2014not just to exercise judgment but first to applyestablished knowledge\u2014to filter out extraneous prior judgments and identify relevantprior judgments for solving the problem at hand\u2014that is, moving from the outer to themiddle circle of knowledge (see part I.F above). This research function is not feasible insettings where time is short, economic pressures are intense and information is in a stateof disorder. Studies of professional expertise thus suggest that \"an individual's ability to'bring order to the informational chaos that characterizes one's everyday environment'determines whether that professional continues to perform competently.\"51 Bringing order to informational chaos is precisely what knowledge couplingsoftware accomplishes. It does so far more efficiently than physicians could ever do. Andonce these basic information processing tasks are carried out, human judgment becomesfar more accurate, efficient and powerful. Stated differently, the right software toolsenable ordinary human judgment to accomplish what costly expert judgment can merelyattempt. To reiterate, judgment is empowered when (1) directly relevant information ispresented in an organized form with extraneous information filtered out, and (2) time isavailable to consider that information with care. Knowledge coupling software is thusdesigned to filter and organize information, freeing up time for the caregiver and patientto consider it thoroughly. Moreover, the software incorporates pre-existing medicaljudgments that were reached under ideal conditions. Software builders have moreopportunity than practicing physicians to exercise careful judgment in evaluating themedical literature. The literature in turn offers peer-reviewed judgments of leadingauthorities who similarly have more opportunity than ordinary practitioners to deli-berate with care. 51 Pew Health Professions Commission, Reforming Health Care Workforce Regulation, San Francisco: TheCommission, 1995, p. 26, quoting Pottinger, Competence Testing As a Basis for Licensing: Problems andProspects, Washington, D.C., National Center for the Study of the Professions, 1977.06/27/08In some cases, that threshold step is itself enough to reveal a clear solution (the innercircle), as discussed. These cases are the low-hanging fruit. In more difficult cases,however, that threshold step reveals uncertainty and the need for more investigation.That investigation begins a series of follow-up processes calling for repeatedexercises of judgment. These judgments must be reached in a scientifically rigorousmanner. What that means is the subject of part Error! Reference source not found. below. As we shall see, just as knowledge coupling software minimizes the role of expertclinical judgment at the initial workup, so rigorous scientific practices lessen the need foruncertain clinical judgments during these follow-up processes after the initial workup.This notion of lessening reliance on expert judgment contradicts the expectations ofhighly educated people in general and physicians in particular. Advanced educationteaches its recipients to rely heavily on their own minds in applying establishedknowledge. In no field is this more true than in medicine. Recall Dr. Nuland's words: \"Our most rewarding moments of healing derive not from the works of our hearts butfrom those of our intellects.\"52 The activity of developing new knowledge, where theintellect has an essential creative role, is taken as the model for the activity of applyingestablished knowledge. Professional education offers rewards of money and status forthis reliance on personal intellect. But this state of affairs runs directly counter to thedevelopment of both modern science and market economies. The next part examinesthose developments in relation to medical practice. 52 See note 10 above.06/27/08VII.The nature of medical knowledge as applied to individualpatientsMuch of this paper has focused on the human mind's limited ability to recall andapply medical knowledge under real-world conditions. This constraint means thatphysicians process only a fraction of the medical knowledge relevant to patient needs. Beyond this gap between the human mind and medical knowledge is an equallyimportant gap between medical knowledge and patient realities: our knowledgecomprehends only a fraction of the complexity faced by caregivers and patients. Indeed,our \"knowledge\" is not just incomplete but in part is simply wrong. As in other areas of science, medical knowledge is only a provisional approximationof reality. Medical knowledge must constantly be tested against that reality, in bothpatient care and clinical research. In patient care that testing process demands taking intoaccount all potentially relevant knowledge and patient-specific data at the outset of care,and then carefully monitoring and adjusting whatever course of action is chosen, as wehave discussed. In clinical research, that testing process demands continuouslyharvesting feedback on knowledge by carefully examining meticulous records of theapplication of knowledge to individual patients. From this point of view, we consider different forms of medical knowledge, itsrelation to patient-specific data and how these issues are understood in current medicalpractice. We begin with the concept of evidence-based medicine. A.The gap between evidence-based medicine andindividual patient needs... we must bring men to particulars, and their regular series andorder, and they must for a while renounce their notions and begin toform an acquaintance with things.\u2014 Francis Bacon53For centuries an unresolved debate has been carried on in medicine about themeaning of an individual patient's risk54 and the concepts of induction and probabilityas applied in patient care.55 During the past two decades the debate has provided the 53 Bacon F. Novum Organon (1620), see note 1 above, Aphorism No. 36. 54 Goodman S. Probability at the bedside: the knowing of chances or the chances of knowing? AnnIntern Med 1999;130:604-606.55 Hanckel F. The problem of induction in clinical decision making. Medical Decision Making. 1984;4:59-06/27/08framework for critiques of managed care (in the U.S.) and evidence-based medicine(EBM).\"EBM and managed care share a common ethical and epistemologic focus onoutcomes measured across populations.\"56 Both epistemologically and ethically, thisfocus is misplaced in the context of patient care. As Chris Weed has observed, statisticalinformation about population outcomes answers questions that patients and theircaregivers do not ask:Statistical answers are rationally useful only when one is interested not inindividual cases but in regularities occurring in large numbers of cases. In otherwords, the patient is not in the position of a gambling casino. He or she is not in aposition to say that if money is lost to the customers one day (the patient's illnessis misdiagnosed or mismanaged), the odds are that it will be recovered severaltimes over within a week. The patient may in a very real sense be \"open forbusiness\" only for that day.57Epistemologically, outcomes measured across populations do not permit us to knowthe expected outcome for an individual who differs in relevant respects from themeasured population\u2014and relevant differences are the norm, not the exception. Ethically, population-based decision making rests on an \"assumption that outcomes facedby individual persons can offset each other,\" as Asch and Hershey observe. Thatassumption \"effaces the moral distinction between those persons.\" Outcomes amongpopulation members can be permitted to offset each other in veterinary care for livestockherds, but not in health care for human beings.58Therefore, in optimizing decisions for individuals, the uniqueness of each individualmust be rigorously taken into account. This reality is now invariably acknowledged byevidence-based medicine proponents. But they underestimate the extent of individualuniqueness within populations, and fail to define a rigorous, systematic approach fortaking that uniqueness into account. For example, one authoritative statement of EBM 68.56 Tonelli M. The Philosophical Limits of Evidence-Based Medicine, 1998; 73: 1234-1240 (p. 1238).57 Weed CC. The Philosophy, Use and Interpretation of Knowledge Couplers, note 2 above, p. 4. The quotedstatement, written in 1982, predated the rise of managed care and evidence-based medicine, but itarticulated the reason why physicians and patients distrusted those developments.58 Asch D, Hershey J. Why some health policies don't make sense at the bedside. Ann Intern Med 1995;222:846-850 (p. 848). One reason for the population perspective is that so much of medical care is paid bythird parties. A third party payer views cost-effectiveness in relation to the entire covered population. Butindividuals within that population view cost-effectiveness in relation to their individual needs, and healthcoverage (both group and individual) is purchased on that basis. The benefit of that bargain is denied toits intended beneficiaries when their individual needs are not even taken into account. 06/27/08principles explains: \"we must remember that recommendations can be made only foraverage patients, and the circumstances and values of the patient before us differ.\"59 Thisseems to imply that average patients are medically similar, differing only in non-medicalcircumstances and values, and therefore that medical recommendations can apply across a population, subject only to individual adjustments for non-medical differences. Thereality, however, is that virtually all individuals differ medically from the average. Thatis, they differ not just in their circumstances and values but in their medical characteristicsbearing on the problem presented. The details of those differences, not populationaverages, must be the start and end points of individual decision making. Averages areuseful, if at all, only for clues about which details are the highest priority for analysis.Misconceiving individual variations as exceptions to population-based rules pervertsthe core element of evidence-based medicine, its \"hierarchy of evidence.\" At the top ofthis hierarchy are randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Randomization deliberatelyexcludes most individual variations, even those (such as co-morbidities) manifestlyrelevant to individual decision making. Other forms of population-based evidence, suchas large observational studies and systematic reviews, similarly exclude or overlookpotentially relevant data about individual variation. Evidence-based medicine thusdirects clinicians to look first to population-based general rules and then to considerindividual variations merely as exceptions to those rules. This hierarchy is upside down. Knowledge about large populations is useless,indeed misleading, until other, more individually applicable knowledge is first takeninto account. Thus the sequence in which evidence is considered is crucial. Recall from theAddison's disease case study in Part II.A how the physicians first looked for diagnosesthought to be common in the population of people suffering from severe fatigue, despitedetails about their patient revealing her to be quite unlike that large population and verymuch like the small subpopulation of people with Addison's disease. Recall further howthe article characterized the patient's presentation of the disease as atypical, when inreality her presentation should have been seen as one of many possible expectedvariations within recognizable patterns of the disease. This example illustrates how thepopulation-based perspective suppresses awareness of individual variation, and inhibitsclinicians from taking into account patient-specific details. 59 Guyon G. et al. (for the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group). \"Users' Guides to the MedicalLiterature. XXV. Evidence-Based Medicine: Principles for the Users' Guides to Patient Care. \"JAMA 284:10; 1290-1296 (Sep. 13, 2000, p. 1294)06/27/08More complete than this population-based perspective is a perspective that beginsand ends with awareness of each patient's uniqueness. Continuing with the Addison'sdisease example, that disease can be defined in terms of a single abnormality\u2014deficiencyin adrenal-cortical hormones. Yet that one element can interact with unique individualphysiologies in enormously variable ways. We thus can conceive Addison's disease ineither population-based or individualized terms, that is, either (1) the basic elementcommon to the entire population with the disease (the hormone deficiency), or (2) thevariable ways in which unique individuals respond to the hormone deficiency andmanifest the disease. The second, individualized conception is too detailed to be capturedin textbook terms or comprehended by the unaided mind.60 These principles apply in the therapeutic as well as diagnostic context. Considerclinical trial results for drug therapy. Such results are typically expressed as \"averagetreatment effects\" in the trial population relative to a placebo or alternative therapies. Yet, the average obscures heterogeneous treatment effects within the trial population,not to mention differences between that population and the populations that may lateruse a drug therapy.61 Thus, for an individual patient considering use of the drug, thepopulation average is much less relevant than a detailed comparison of the patient'smedical characteristics with those of two subpopulations: individuals who experienceda favorable outcome and those who experienced an unfavorable outcome. Supposedetailed comparison of careful medical records on the patient and careful records on theclinical trial population reveals that the patient closely resembles the subpopulation witha favorable outcome. In that case, the population average is essentially irrelevant to thatpatient. Decision making based on large population studies is becoming increasingly 60 The utility of these two perspectives varies with the context. For example, in the therapeutic context,the population-based concept of Addison's disease is useful, because most patients with the disease can besuccessfully treated with simple hormone replacement therapy. In the diagnostic context, theindividualized perspective becomes somewhat more important, because Addison's disease manifests itselfin variable ways. Yet, Addison's disease should be relatively simple to diagnose, because recognizablepatterns of the disease can be ascertained from organized data collection and analysis. Many conditions aremuch more complex to diagnose or treat, and even simple conditions can become difficult in patients whohave co-morbid conditions or other complicating factors.61 See McMurray J, O'Meara E. Treatment of Heart Failure with Spironolactone \u2014 Trial andTribulations, 2004. New Eng J Med 351:6; 526-529; Juurlink D et al., Rates of Hyperkalemia AfterPublication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study. 2004. New Eng J Med 351:6; 543-551. Thesearticles describe a large discrepancy between a favorable clinical trial of a drug for advanced congestiveheart failure and unfavorable outcomes associated with increased use of the drug after the trial results werepublished and disseminated in practice guidelines. The articles analyze a number of foreseeableexplanations for this discrepancy, including clear differences between the real-world population receivingthe drug and the randomized trial population. 06/27/08pointless now that we can analyze individual variation and small subpopulations at thelevel of genes and protein molecules. The primacy of patient-specific evidence does not mean that population-basedevidence is useless. On the contrary, once detailed initial data is taken into account,population-based evidence can then provide useful guidance to prioritize investigation. In the diagnostic context, where detailed patient data initially suggest several plausiblediagnoses, it is then useful to know which of those possibilities are most common. Otherthings being equal, a common condition should be a higher priority for investigationthan a rare condition. But using population-based knowledge of prevalence to select thehighest priority diagnostic possibility is only an intermediate step. The next step iscollecting new patient-specific data to confirm or rule out that possibility. Oncecollected, that new data supersede population-based evidence as a basis for decision. Similarly, in the treatment context, patient-specific data bearing on suitability of atreatment for an individual patient should normally supersede population-basedguidelines about aggregate therapeutic efficacy. Efficacy often varies substantiallyamong individuals within a population, including a randomized population in a clinicaltrial. That heterogeneity is obscured when population-based therapeutic outcomes areexpressed as population averages. Individualized decision making requires taking intoaccount patient-specific information bearing on four dimensions of individualvariability:the patient's (1) baseline probability of incurring a disease-related adverse event(\"risk without treatment\" or \"susceptibility/prognosis\"), (2) responsiveness to thetreatment, (3) vulnerability to the adverse effects of the treatment, and (4) utilities[personal values and preferences] for different outcomes.62The above discussion suggests that randomized clinical trials in their present formare a poor substitute for rigorous medical practice as a source of evidence to informdecision making. In particular, analysis of drug safety and efficacy could become moreaccurate, timely, and affordable, if rigor was brought to medical record keeping andcoupling of medical knowledge with patient data. In contrast, as Dr. Scott Gottlieb hasobserved, current regulatory approaches are futile: The fundamental problem inside the FDA is ... the quality of information on whichthe FDA can base its evaluations. Today, the data that medical reviewers receivein conjunction with the process for approving new products are from highlystructured clinical trials, carried out on homogenous populations of patients that 62 Kravitz R, Duan N, Braslow J. Evidence-Based Medicine, Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects and theTrouble with Averages. 2004, 82:4; Erratum athttp://www.milbank.org/erratum4-4.pdf. 06/27/08are carefully screened and preselected and then given new drugs under specialprotocols. There is little chance that such trials will ever provide a complete reviewof how a new treatment will perform when it is used in much broader populationsof patients in real-world clinical settings, where patients do not always take theirmedicines on time or at all; where patients might have other medical problems orbe of advanced age or in frail health; and where they have comorbidities or unusualdiets, or they fill prescriptions for medications or dietary supplements that interactwith one another, subtly or otherwise. 63Dr. Gottlieb goes on to point out that clinical trials large enough for validity areextraordinarily time-consuming and costly, and it is sometimes impossible to recruitpatients with the desired characteristics for such trials. Moreover\u00b8 as few as one percentof all adverse drug events are estimated to be reported by physicians.64 Thus, passivereporting systems that are dependent on physician initiative and not integrated withmedical practice are insufficient for harvesting reliable information. Instead,practitioners and patients must function with information tools from which researcherscan harvest new medical knowledge as a byproduct. This dual purpose for well-designedinformation tools can create enormous synergies.The population-based perspective distorts not only clinical decision making andresearch but also concepts of quality control. Consider, for example, the numerousstudies documenting large geographic variation in utilization rates of health care serviceswithout any corresponding variations in medical needs in the respective geographicareas.65 These studies raise two basic questions: (1) what utilization rate of the servicesin question is appropriate, and (2) how can appropriate usage be enforced uniformly? Atfirst glance, these questions may seem readily answerable by population-based analysis. For example, in some cases the answer to the first question is that variations may seemclearly attributable to provider-induced demand (because of correlation betweenutilization rates and the supply of providers). The answer to the second question mightbe to counteract provider-induced demand by using evidence-based practice guidelinesto restrict provider discretion. 63 Gottlieb S., Opening Pandora's Pillbox: Using Modern Information Tools To Improve Drug Safety.note Bookmark not defined. above, p. 939.64 Ibid., pp. 939-41.65 See generally Congressional Budget Office, Geographic Variation in Health Care Spending, Feb. 2008,available at http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8972/02-15-GeogHealth.pdf.

Evidence-based practice guidelines derived from largepopulation studies are no answer to this question because they do not take into accountrelevant, patient-specific details. The only way to take those details into account is toemploy external tools designed for selection and analysis of detailed data in light ofmedical knowledge. If individual decisions are optimized in that manner, and if thepersonnel, procedures, drugs, devices and facilities used to execute those decisions arereliable, then whatever level of aggregate usage results from those decisions isappropriate, regardless of whether or how usage varies geographically. Consider againthe transportation system analogy discussed in part I. If roads and traffic systems arecarefully monitored and-maintained in good working order, and if various routes andmodes of transportation are available for individual travelers to choose from, and iftravelers are well-informed about options available, then travelers will make whateverchoices best fit their situations. The transportation system should provide a range ofchoices that fits the existing range of individual needs, but the system should notpredetermine and dictate some particular pattern of collective choices as the bestoutcome. The above discussion has contrasted two points of view: (1) that individualvariations are exceptions to the population-based norms, and (2) that individualvariations are the norm, and thus population-based knowledge may not be relied uponto guide individual decision making. Rejecting (1) in favor of (2), as this paper does, mayseem to some readers to be an unrealistic exaggeration. The following section addressesthat issue.B.General knowledge and individual uniqueness1. Two forms of medical knowledgeMedical knowledge is often conceived as generalizations applicable to populationsof individuals. This population-based concept of medical knowledge is not complete. Medical decision making routinely demands taking into account individual variationsfrom what population-based knowledge leads us to expect. 06/27/08a. Population-based knowledgeConsider first what is meant by the population-based concept of medical knowledge. Some of the great advances in medical science are applicable to large populationswithout regard to variations among individuals. Salk's development of a polio vaccine,for example, involved a single therapeutic agent that prevents polio in virtuallyeveryone. In that context, differences among individuals have no significance except inthe very few cases where the vaccine may not be safe or effective. Similarly, even incontexts where individual variations have critical and pervasive significance, individualneeds cannot be addressed without applying general principles of pathophysiologyapplicable to large populations. All diabetics, for example, despite their enormousvariability, have in common some dysfunction in hormonal regulation of blood glucoselevels. Indeed, diabetes is defined in those terms. Medical knowledge is thus naturallyconceived as applicable to large populations. This population-based concept of medical knowledge also applies to variationswithin a large population when multiple individuals with a particular variation or setof variations in common are grouped into a definable subpopulation. For example, thepopulation of diabetics can be grouped into myriad subpopulations, ranging fromextremely broad groupings (Type I or Type II diabetics) to narrower ones (Type Idiabetics with chronic renal insufficiency and cardiovascular disease). Or the populationof individuals with a fatigue condition can be grouped into approximately 160 diagnosticsubpopulations (such as individuals with Addison's disease), as explained in part Error!Reference source not found. above.Population-based knowledge may be either explanatory (principles of patho-physiology) or descriptive (statistical information without an explanation for what isdescribed). In either case, population-based knowledge is fallible. Consider, forexample, clinical trial results showing statistically significant favorable outcomes for adrug in a randomized population of individuals with a given disease and without co-morbidities. The outcome data are descriptive; they do not explain why the drug issuccessful for some individuals and not others in the clinical trial population. Nor doesoutcome data explain when the drug is appropriate for individuals with co-morbiditiesor other differences from the clinical trial population. Nor does outcome data explainwhen off-label use of the drug is appropriate. Pathophysiologic explanations to answerthese questions may be offered. But the answers must be tested against the results ofactual use with patients. And those results will not yield trustworthy feedback withoutmeticulous medical records providing detailed data about the patients receiving the drug.06/27/08b. Knowledge about individual variationPopulation-based knowledge as just described has become extraordinarilyvoluminous and complex. But a further category of medical knowledge exists \u2014medicalknowledge about variations at the individual level. This occurs with individuals whoseem anomalous in some way, that is, whose characteristics depart unexpectedly fromsome relevant subpopulation. Such knowledge often takes the form of case reports suchas the New England Journal article we have discussed, where the patient's presentation ofAddison's disease was described as atypical. In addition to such reports, medicalknowledge of variations at the individual level could, in principle, take the form ofpatient data in medical records. But those data are not accessible for research purposesin the way that published case reports are accessible, and therefore cannot be consideredpart of the body of medical knowledge (although that could change, as discussed below). By comparison, genomic and proteomic information about individuals may becomeaccessible for research purposes and therefore become part of the body of medicalknowledge.Variations at the individual level are usually viewed as exceptions from the norm. The norm, we are taught, is \"the textbook case,\" the model that other cases are expectedto resemble. Yet, \"the textbook case is so rare that everyone runs to look at it in themedical center when it is found,\" as Dr. Ken Bartholomew has observed. In reality, thetextbook case is the exception, and variations from it are the norm. \"Patient presentationsare not one textbook scenario but thousands of similar, yet unique, combinations ofpresentations that our experience enables us to categorize.\" The dilemma is that personalexperience is limited, and the mind categorizes experience simplistically. The textbookcase thus becomes \"a self-fulfilling prophecy\"; unexpected variations from it are notsearched for or recognized.66 The Addison's disease case study discussed above illustratesthis phenomenon. Individual case reports are important to the progress of medical science. Reports ofvariations from known patterns can lead to uncovering new diseases, rare manifestationsof known diseases, drug side effects, and new understanding of disease mechanisms.67 But poor feedback mechanisms block this progress at multiple levels. The unaided mind,following textbook knowledge, may not even recognize variations; or variations maybe misclassified; or medical records may too incomplete and unstructured to generate 66 Bartholomew K. \"The Perspective of a Practitioner,\" in Knowledge Coupling, note 2 above, p. 240.67 Vandenbroucke J. In Defense of Case Reports and Case Series. 2001. Annals of Internal Medicine. 134:330-334 (Feb. 20, 2001).06/27/08adequate case reports; or published case reports may not be considered by caregivers orpatients when those reports are directly relevant. To reiterate, no caregiver can be aware of all the known patterns to consider, muchless variations from those patterns. Pattern recognition in the face of such complexityrequires tools external to the mind. Once those tools are employed, the mind developsnew perceptions of both the patterns and the individuals with whom the patterns arecompared. The next section describes those new perceptions.2. The concept of individual uniquenessAs the Addison's disease case illustrates, medicine involves pattern recognition. Thedilemma is that known patterns are rough generalizations about large populations, andas such are usually an imperfect fit with unique individuals. Every individual is a uniquecombination of myriad similarities to and differences from other individuals. Whatconstitutes a similarity or difference depends on the particular diagnostic or therapeuticcontext. The similarities mean that different individuals can be medically classifiedtogether in the same category\u2014 a trait or set of traits in common with other individuals. The differences mean that various individuals classified in the same category arenevertheless different from each other in various respects that may be key to solving themedical problem they seem to have in common.68 The similarities and differences arise initially from each individual's unique geneticheritage and unique developmental history. Each individual is a recombination of pre-existing biological elements, which are built into an enormously complex set ofinterconnected structures and interacting processes. The recombination of elements is notstatic but continuously evolving, subject to both internal and external forces. Animportant internal force is the human body's extraordinary capacity for self-regulation(known as homeostasis) and self-repair. As a result, the normal physiology of healthypersons become increasingly differentiated over time. This complexity increases by orders of magnitude when normal physiology isdisrupted by pathophysiologic processes, psychological processes, the physical environ-ment, the social environment and medical interventions. These interacting elementsintroduce multiple layers of complexity and disruption. As stated by Dickinson Richards,in words that apply both to human physiology and its external environment: 68 The following discussion draws heavily on Weed, CC. The Philosophy, Use and Interpretation ofKnowledge Couplers, note 2 above.06/27/08Man's power became ever greater, but this curiously made matters worse notbetter, because his power became too great for his understanding, and moved evenfurther beyond his awareness of consequences. ... Man's unbridled use of histechnological armament throws whole segments of the natural order out of balance,with the full meaning of this obscure, the outcome unknown. 69These realities mean that each person's illness will be a unique course of events,never precisely reproduced in any other person. Chronic illness in particular becomeshighly personalized in this way. Consequently, when different individuals are labeledwith the same illness, their medical condition and therapeutic needs may in fact differradically. Diagnosis and treatment of each person's illness must take into account myriadresemblances to and differences from many other persons' experiences of the \"same\"illness. Doing so far exceeds the capacity of the human mind. None of these points are surprising. Indeed, they are consistent with intuition,common experience and basic scientific knowledge. But without the tools needed to acton these points, their implications elude us. C.Some implications of individual uniquenessShe could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as thedoctors made them feel, was in danger. They could not think ofanything but how to help her. Doctors came to see her singly andin consultation, talked much in French, German and Latin, blamedone another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all thediseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to anyof them that they could not know the disease Nat\u00e1sha wassuffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be known,for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has hisown peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown tomedicine\u2014not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves andso on mentioned in the medical books, but a disease consisting ofone of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of thoseorgans. \u2014 Leo Tolstoy70 69 Richards D. \"Hippocrates and History: The Arrogance of Humanism,\" Hippocrates Revisited, note 9above, pp. 25, 26.70 Tolstoy L. War and Peace (1869), Book Nine, Chapter 16 (Maude trans.). 06/27/08And generally, let this be a rule, that all partitions of knowledge beaccepted rather for lines and veins than for sections andseparations; and that the continuance and entireness of knowledgebe preserved. For the contrary hereof hath made particular sciencesto become barren, shallow, and erroneous, while they have not beenmaintained from the common fountain. \u2014 Francis Bacon71To reiterate, each person can be viewed medically as a unique combination ofresemblances to and differences from other persons. This reality is significant epis-temologically. The unique combination embodied in any individual is \"unknown tomedicine,\" in Tolstoy's words, for three reasons. First, \"every living person has his ownpeculiarities\" in how a known disease occurs and manifests itself (as the Addison's diseasecase study illustrates). Second, different persons have different combinations of knowndiseases (this difficulty was absent from the Addison's disease case study). When two ormore known diseases combine in a single person, their effects are likely to interact witheach other and with the person's unique physiology so that the disease processes andmanifestations to some extent depart from prior knowledge about the interactingelements. Third, disease may involve elements unknown to medical science, such asnewly evolved pathogens or unidentified disease processes, interacting with knownelements and the person's unique physiology. Thus a person's total medical conditioncan be regarded as a single, aggregate, new disease entity, described by Tolstoy as thatperson's \"own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine.\" Within that person's complex, unique pathophysiology are elements that medicalscience is able to understand and/or manipulate therapeutically, to some degree. Thisscientific knowledge is expressed in terms of elements occurring across a population,abstracted from the unique individuals to whom they apply. But effectively applyingthat general knowledge to specific individuals very often requires delving into theiruniqueness.How can caregivers and patients apply population-based knowledge to uniqueindividuals in an organized way without being overwhelmed by complexity? And howcan clinical researchers and basic scientists systematically test existing knowledge andharvest new knowledge from caregivers' daily encounters with unique patients? The 71 Bacon F. The Advancement of Learning, IX(1), at http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Advancement-of-Learning2.html06/27/08solution to both these problems lies in the tools and standards we use in recording,communicating and processing information. We have discussed at length how the combinatorial standard for conducting theinitial workup and the POMR standard for medical records make it possible to cope withthe enormous complexity of medically unique individuals. Here we would reiterate howthis happens with the combinatorial standard. A diagnostic or therapeutic problem isdefined in terms of sets of clinical findings, based on the medical literature. Then the taskis to match the set of findings in the patient with the many sets of findings defined in theknowledge coupling software. The software performs that matching directly. In contrast,the unaided mind resorts to various indirect shortcuts, such as logical inference andprobabilities derived from large populations. The difference between these twoapproaches is like the difference between using an X-ray to view a chest lesion directly,and using a stethoscope to find indirect evidence of what cannot be viewed directly. Using the more direct, combinatorial approach to match patients against medicalknowledge, we constantly encounter individuals who turn out not to match neatly withreported patterns in the medical literature. For example, the finding sets may varydramatically at different points in the course of a disease, and finding sets frequentlysuggest numerous diagnostic or therapeutic possibilities, none of which turns out be agood match with the patient. These frequent discrepancies call into question whetheraccepted \"diagnoses\" are consistently reproducible, and whether standard treatmentsshould be accepted as such. This kind of uncertainty in medicine exists elsewhere inbiology. Taxonomies established with a tentative and provisional status are thenrepeatedly applied in a self-reinforcing, circular manner, investing them with anappearance of objective and definable reality that they do not possess.72 In medicine,knowledge coupling tools can protect against this kind of misconception.As further example of how new tools change our view of medical reality, considerthe central component of the POMR\u2014the problem list. The list as a whole presents thepatient's unique combination of conditions, thereby summarizing the patient's \"ownpeculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine\" as Tolstoydescribed it. At the same time, the items on the problem list separate out distinctelements of the patient's personal condition in terms of what is known to medical science. Planning for each item on the problem list can thus be conducted with full awarenessof other items on the list, including the potential interactions and unmet needs associated 72 See Seath P.H.A and Sokal R., Numerical Taxonomy: The Principles and Practices of NumericalClassification (San Francisco: W.H. Freeman & Co., 1973), p. __.06/27/08with those other items. The problem list is thus simultaneously holistic and reductionist,providing the benefits of both perspectives. As described by Dr. Ian Lawson: the POMR system is affecting nosography, the way in which disease and disabilityare described. ... the interrelationships of problems are as important as theindividual problems themselves. Symptoms and problem profiles, rather thansummary diagnostic labels, often prove more sensitive in therapeutic managementand may eventually lead to a different kind of care organization andepidemiology.73With the ongoing revolution in genomics and proteomics, the myriad resemblancesand differences among individual human beings are becoming far more sharply definedat the molecular level. The massive scope and intricacy of this knowledge, and itsinfinitely variable applicability to individuals, make it increasingly obvious that theminds of highly educated physicians cannot be relied upon to recognize the patterns thatdefine unique individuals and their medical needs. In that environment, we will heedBacon's warning not to \"falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind,\" andwe will embrace the use of external tools to empower the mind.Both the human mind and external tools use language to reference clinical concepts. Lack of precision and consistency in the use of language has long been recognized as anobstacle to semantic interoperability among disparate health information technologies,particularly electronic health records. Accordingly, major efforts have been underwayfor many years to develop standardized medical terminology, taxonomies of medicalconcepts and corresponding coding systems. These efforts, however, valuable as they are,leave unresolved the problem of unstructured clinical judgment by physicians. Forexample, using standardized terminology to record the results of an initial workup doesnot assure that the contents of the initial workup will be complete or accurately coupledwith medical knowledge. Assuring those goals requires some form of knowledgecoupling tools as described above. Standardized terminology and coding is pursuedmost fruitfully when it is driven by needs that arise in developing knowledge coupling tools and using those tools in medical practice. Knowledge coupling tools are derived from and linked in detail to an underlyingelectronic \"Knowledge Network,\" which in turn is derived from and linked to the medicalliterature. The Knowledge Network is composed of explicitly defined medical entities 73 Lawson I. Comments on the POMR. In Driggs MF ed. Problem-Directed and Medical Information Systems.New York: Inter-Continental Medical Book Corporation, 1974, p. 40. Dr. Lawson goes on to observe: \"More to thepoint, this will also create immediate conflicts with \"third party\" agents and their prototype definitions of\"eligible\" illness. Indeed, the sooner their computer experience gets wise to (or gets \"blown\" by) therealities of multiproblem interrelational analysis and management, the better for us all.\"06/27/08(findings, disease conditions, medical procedures) and interrelationships among thoseentities. Standardized terminology and coding of these entities and relationships, whenmapped to the Knowledge Network and applied through knowledge coupling software,has far more utility than the same standardized terminology and coding employed in an unstructured manner by physicians. For example: Building a module of knowledge coupling software (a \"Coupler\") for a givenmedical problem involves defining relationships among numerous medicalentities (for example, a disease entity and the finding entities used to diagnose thedisease). As the Knowledge Network is built up, it naturally reveals new entityrelationships that may not be apparent from reviewing the medical literature (forexample, a diagnostic entity may also be a finding entity in relation to anotherdiagnosis, so that the original finding entities indirectly are related to the seconddiagnostic entity). When a new Coupler is built for a different medical problem,the existing Knowledge Network is traversed for relevant entities andrelationships among them (to continue the example, the indirect relationshipbetween the finding entities and the second diagnostic entity might be relevant tothe building of the new Coupler, though not to the first Coupler). Traversing theKnowledge Network may thus reveal connections that medical literature searcheswould not reveal or reveal only with great difficulty. The Knowledge Network content includes not only entity and relationshipinformation but also (1) classifying information that allows entities andrelationships to be grouped and retrieved in various ways, and (2) textualexplanation of the significance of the entities and relationships. The KnowledgeNetwork thus provides a highly efficient repository of distilled medicalknowledge useful for constructing clinical guidance tools\u2014the Couplers. Couplers organize information from the Knowledge Network in a problem-oriented manner, that is, in a manner relevant to the specific problem-solvingcontext for which the Coupler is built. The ability to traverse the KnowledgeNetwork for knowledge relevant to the problem context makes it possible topartially automate the process of building Couplers. But this automated elementis only the first step. Much thought goes into selecting and editing KnowledgeNetwork content to make it maximally useful in the problem context addressedby the Coupler. The volume of medical literature is growing exponentially, much more so than thevolume of actionable medical knowledge within the literature. A primary reasonis that each article devotes much space to explaining the context and significance06/27/08of its subject matter, so that related articles consume much space with overlappingexplanation. Yet, that explanation does not usually address all of the variousmedical specialties to which the subject matter is relevant. In contrast, knowledgecoupling software and its underlying Knowledge Network enables each piece ofactionable knowledge to be expressed concisely and then viewed as needed in thecountless medical contexts and specialties to which it may become relevant. Enabling such access to directly relevant knowledge in specific problem solvingcontexts is far more efficient and effective than ordinary medical literature as amechanism for storage, retrieval and transmission of medical knowledge. Enormous time, money and talent are currently invested in graduate medicaleducation, publication of medical literature, medical libraries, and conferences. All these are mechanisms for transmitting medical knowledge to caregivers usingthat knowledge. The voltage drop in these transmissions is enormous. Patientshave no assurance that the information residing in the minds of their caregiverscorresponds to their individual medical needs. In contrast, knowledge couplingtools and the underlying Knowledge Network make it possible to reallocatescarce resources from futile attempts at transmitting medical knowledge toproductive use of knowledge.
