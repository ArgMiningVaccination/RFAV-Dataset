The purpose of the therapy is to improve your overall state of health and well being through internal cleansing and purification. We use detoxification therapy because it is our belief that each person has a particular ability to tolerate the toxins that are the result of an industrialized society-whether it's air pollution, heavy metals, pesticides, or the additives and preservatives found in many of the processed foods we eat. When our tolerance level is exceeded, the body's natural waste removal process becomes overtaxed and incapable of functioning adequately. It is extremely important for everyone to undergo routine detox therapy to improve and maintain optimal health. Common Signs That You Need to Detox: - Low energy - Headaches - Joint and muscle aches - Depression - Digestive issues - Decreased cognitive function - Severe inflammation - Inability to remain in a disease-free state of health. Benefits of Detox Therapy Detoxification treatments come in many forms and can include the simplest protocols; from drinking 8 oz of warm lemon water per day to undergoing complete system detox such as a 28 day herbal detox with infrared sauna treatments several times a week. The benefits are countless and can include: increased energy, improved immune function, healthy cellular generation, reduction in food cravings, clean clear skin, reduction in headaches, decreased toxic burden, pain management, reduced cellular oxidation to promote healthy aging. What to Expect * Depending upon the type of detox therapy that is tailored to your needs, the expectations can vary and is based upon your level of toxicity and the depth of treatment. Expectations will be discussed with your medical treatment provider prior to beginning your therapy. \"After 52 years of life I guess I had a lot of toxins built up in my body.
