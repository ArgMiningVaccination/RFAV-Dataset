I pursued a master's degree in oral science at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry. I also taught in the clinics, which made me realize what had been missing was being involved in academics. This was affirmed when I received the Teacher of the Year award. When a faculty position opened up, I decided to take the leap. I have not looked back. I love it! I teach in the fourth-year clinics and see patients in my faculty practice. I also do clinical research. I had my first article published in the Journal of Dental Research last summer. My journey to academic dentistry started while at Tufts, as I had great men - tors in my group leaders, Richard Allen, D69, and Louis Farrugia, D66. They were excellent examples of how to teach and mentor dental students. All of the experiences that I had at Tufts and over the past 10 years in private practice have made me a better educator. I have many fond memories of my time at Tufts, and my education prepared me well. I would not change that experience for anything. BRIAN J. HOWE, D06 IOWA CITY, IOWA a triCK y sUBJe Ct I read the article in Tufts Dental Medicine on frenectomies related to poor latching of infants (\"The Ties That Bind,\" Winter 2016). I am a first-year pediatric dental resident in Providence, Rhode Island. I was recently approached with questions related to the subject and did not have much to offer. I consulted with a local oral surgeon whose conclusion was it is not worth the risk of general anesthesia to complete the procedure. I enjoyed the article and especially liked that writer Julie Flaherty included different thoughts on the subject from all the specialties. It would be better if there were agreement by pediatricians, ENTs and pediatric dentists as to whether the treatment should be completed, and not conflicting views, as is currently the case. NICHOLAS PAQUIN, D15 PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND mind -Body ConneC tion I presented three lectures at the Yankee Dental Congress in January. The first two were part of the Massachusetts Dental Society's first Dental Health and Wellness Symposium. I presented with William Jackson, one of Professor Ronald Kulich's residents. Our lectures were the most well-attended of the symposium. The fol - lowing day I gave another presentation. Being a first-time presenter at Yankee, I had hoped to fill half the room, and the course ended up being sold out, with people who couldn't purchase a ticket asking if they could stand in the back. All of this goes to show that there is clearly a need for incorporating mind-body practices in dentistry. I want to thank Dean Huw Thomas and the administration for believing in the mission statement I presented two years ago on the importance of incorporating mind-body practices into our dental students' training and for creating the position I hold as director of mind-body wellness. I find this work very mean - ingful, and I am seeing the impact it is having on our students, faculty and staff.

I have been involved with this association throughout my career and as a result have gained a valuable perspective on many aspects of dental educa - tion and, in particular, the interdependent relationship between dental education and the practice of dentistry. Our profession has served the oral health of the nation admirably\u2014most Americans enjoy good oral health. This reflects well on our educational programs, demonstrating that the training our students receive is well-suited to their practice experience. However, our profession is also facing some significant challenges that are not only affecting the practice of dentistry but our educational programs, too. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published \"Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General.\" Several themes emerged from this report, including the fact that oral health is integral to general health and that one cannot be healthy without good oral health. But while the report noted that prevention measures had resulted in marked improvements in the nation's oral and dental health, it also highlighted the \"profound and consequential\" disparities in the oral health of our citizens, amounting to a \"silent epidemic of dental and oral diseases.\" Some population groups, including the poor of all ages, are particularly vulnerable, especially poor children and poor seniors. The lack of access to care was cited as \"highlighting the oral health problems of disadvantaged popula - tions and the effects on their well-being.\" In the intervening 15-plus years, the access-to-care issue has been addressed by a variety of constituen - cies both within and outside our profession. Academic dentistry's answer has been to graduate more dentists by opening new dental schools (14 since 2000, with at least two more planned) and by expanding class sizes in existing schools. In 2000, approximately 4,200 students were enrolled in U.S. dental schools; in 2015 that number increased to more than 5,800. These numbers still do not reach the number we enrolled in 1977 (6,301), despite the U.S. population experiencing a 45 percent increase in the same time period. Given recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that 23 percent of children ages 2 to 5 had caries in their primary teeth and that the rate of untreated tooth decay in primary teeth among children ages 2 to 8 is twice as high for Hispanic children and non-Hispanic black children compared with non-Hispanic white children, it's clear that access to care is not being adequately addressed. What impact will this have on the number of dentists we'll need in the future? We have long debated whether this issue is one of undersupply or maldistribution. The discussion continues. A federal Health Resources and Services Administration analysis of the future supply and demand for dentists predicts that increases in the number of dentists will not meet demand. In contrast, the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute maintains that unless demand for dental services increases significantly, the current workforce is able or perhaps over-able to meet demand. With these thoughts in mind, how do we ensure that dentistry continues to be one of the most desirable professions? How do we manage our applicant pool? As always, I welcome your thoughts on these issues by phone (617.636.6636) or email: huw.thomas@tufts.edu. HOW MANY WILL WE NEED?HOW F.

The findings are sure to contribute to discussions among dental professionals and policymakers on issues such as increasing access to care and expanding the dental workforce. Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president of the Health Policy Institute and an author of the report, explained the findings during a webi - nar broadcast at the School of Dental Medicine in January. \"We hope this can change the fundamental conversation of what we mean by oral health,\" said Vujicic, a visiting professor at Tufts. Among the other key findings was that an overwhelming majority of American adults\u201495 percent\u2014agreed that they want to maintain good oral health. The report covers a wide range of topics, such as dental visits, knowledge about oral health, community water fluoridation and Medicaid reimburse - ment rates. It offers recommendations on a nationwide level. First among them is introducing proven reforms into Medicaid. From 2000 to 2013, the percentage of Medicaid children across the country who had been to the dentist increased from 29 percent to 48 percent\u2014in some states, the increase was as much as fivefold. The states with the largest gains, the report says, introduced measures such as broad outreach to recipients and providers, higher reimbursements to providers and streamlined administrative procedures that made it easier for dental offices to file for reimbursement. Vujicic presented a graph that plotted, by state, the number of Medicaid-participating dentists against the number of Medicaid-enrolled children who visited the dentist. For the most part, there was little correlation between the two\u2014North Dakota, for example, had a high per capita number of Medicaid pro - viders, but low rate of Medicaid children who went to the dentist. \"Why is that?\" ADA paints a mixed picture of oral health care in America By helene rago Vin Some goo D news: The number of children from low-income families in the U.S. who are seeing the dentist is on the rise. In some states, just as many children covered by Medicaid are receiving dental care as those with private insurance. When it comes to adults, though, the trends are not as encouraging. The gap in dental care between adults with private insurance and those on Medicaid is far wider than it is for children. And in much of the country, fewer adults with private dental benefits are seeking oral health care. Those conclusions are contained in a sweeping state-by-state analysis released by the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute 45971_IFC-Pg7.indd 4 6/22/16 12:30 PMNews Bites From the w orld o F deNtistry PHOTO : MATTHEW HEA lEy summer 2016 | tufts dental Medicine 5Vujicic asked. \"Do [the providers] have appointments available? Are they in the right geographic area?\" The key, he said, is \"getting the right dentists at the right times in the right places.\" And that, Vujicic says, touches on the question of whether access-to-care issues can be addressed by training more dental care providers, or by more strategic use of the existing workforce. \"I feel like we need to move the conversation,\" he said. The data suggest that fundamental changes are ahead for dentistry, says Mark Nehring, the Delta Dental of Massachusetts Professor and chair of public health and community service at Tufts School of Dental Medicine. \"The traditional dental practice\u2014namely, a place you have to get in your car and drive to and make some effort for an appointment\u2014is difficult for many patients,\" he says\u2014and not just for the poor. The decline in dental visits by middle-age people with private insurance also indicates that the current \"work-week, business-hour\" office model isn't as accessible as one might think, he says. Some of the same approaches that have contributed to the increase in children receiving dental care\u2014expanded school-based and mobile care, for instance\u2014could also be adapted for adults, Nehring sug - gests. He mentions dental facilities based at large employers, or mobile offices that visit workplaces or retirement communities, especially those integrated with primary care and that are focused on prevention. \"The current system of care is evolv - ing to one that's team-based,\" he says. And the more convenient this com - prehensive care can be, the more likely people will be to take advantage of it. you can read the full h ealth p olicy i nstitute report at bit.ly/hpi report.3 Questions 3 Questions In her junior year, Mandy Alamwala, D16, was elected one of 11 trustees of the American Student Dental Association (ASDA), representing the five New England dental schools. Since then she has served on numerous councils and committees for the American Dental Association, the Academy of General Dentistry Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Dental Society, where she is taking part in a two-year Leadership Institute program. We talked with her about why dental students should get involved in organized dentistry. what D o asDa representatives D o? One of the big events we partake in is National Dental Student Lobby Day, where dental students come together in Washington, D.C., to advocate for issues that dental students care about. [ASDA] teaches dental students how to lobby and gives us all kinds of tips and tricks to be successful. Then we meet with our legislators and let them know what's on our mind. Having strength in numbers and having all 65 dental schools [in the country] come together, it really does make a difference. what sort o F things D o you L obby F or? One of the big topics is student debt. Dental students are graduating with much more debt than our colleagues who graduated 30 to 40 years ago. It limits our professional choices. If someone is passionate about dentistry, he or she shouldn't have to worry about the tuition. That's why we're going to legislators and pushing for reform. We worked closely with the American Dental Association, and the ADA is listening. It recently announced a collabora - tion with Darien Rowayton Bank to help students refinance their loans. When you have those small victories, you know that you're doing something right. what e Lse Do you get out o F organize D Dentistry? I get to meet other students who are equally enthusiastic and really want to make a difference. It's easy to just focus on clinic and on the books and not realize that things happen - ing in the dental landscape today are going to affect us longterm. We must be the ones fighting for our profession. And to start during dental school is the best way to go about it. The administration at Tufts is so supportive. With their support you can make a differ - ence\u2014and you can still manage dental school. Getting involved with organized dentistry changed my dental school experience, and I couldn't imagine dental school without it. I encourage everyone to get involved. -JUlie Flaherty Mandy Alamwala 45971_IFC-Pg7.indd 5 6/22/16 12:30 PMWord of estimated to have private dental insuranceestimated to have massHealth estimated to have no dental insurance PHOTO : jOHN SOARES (l OCATION COURTES y Of THE SOUTH STREET DINER IN B OSTON ) 6 tufts dental Medicine |summer 2016In the spotlIght In the spotlIght tuFts Denta L FoLks watching the Academy Award-winning film \"Spotlight\" may have noticed a familiar face: Anthony Paolucci, D85, D11P, D15P, an assistant clinical professor of comprehensive care, who has developed a nifty avocation acting in movies and on TV.

Here's a proven method: Get your degree in psychology, finish law school, become an endodontist, get married, raise three kids and establish a thriving dental practice in Canton, Massachusetts. Follow this simple path, and you, too, will see your stories come to life on the silver screen. OK, so maybe Eric Weinstock's circuitous route isn't for everyone, but for him, it's worked pretty well. Since this movie buff first started dabbling in scriptwrit - ing nine years ago, he has completed screenplays for eight feature films and five shorts, many of which have been optioned by filmmakers. Two of them, a family comedy and an action flick, Eric Weinstock is a 'root canal guy' who knows his way around a screenplay, with two movies set for release this year. Cue the burping pig. BY JULIE FLAHERTY 8 TUFTS DENTAL MEDICINE |SUMMER 2016After Office Hours PHOTO: JOHN SOARES (LOCATION COURTESY OF THE DEDHAM COMMUNITY THEATER) Eric Weinstock has found success writing for the silver screen, but don't expect him to say goodbye to dentistry. \"The running joke has always been, 'Don't quit your day job.' \" 45971_Pg8,9,16-19.indd 8 6/22/16 1:42 PMrecently finished filming and are sched - uled for release this year. This dentist-goes-to-Hollywood story began when Weinstock, D00, DG02, a devoted movie fan (ask him to recite the complete dialogue from \"Rocky\" sometime), sat through a spate of bad new releases and won - dered if he could do better. He sent his first attempt, an intricate thriller, to a professional screenwriter to critique. It was then that he found he had some - thing all successful screenwriters need: a thick skin. The reviewer trashed his character arcs, the setting, the length of scenes and the superfluous dialogue. \"I deserved the flogging I got,\" Weinstock says. \"I didn't appreciate the science of screenwriting.\" Despite the mistakes, the bones of the story were very good, the reviewer said, so Weinstock kept on. He worked on fulfilling the screenwriting maxim of \"show, don't tell.\" For example, you could have a character talk about how poor her family is, Weinstock explains, \"or the mom can take the unfinished orange juice from the breakfast table and pour it back into the orange juice container. That says much more than what you can say with words.\" Nothing in a film, he says, should happen without a reason. \"Every single thing is choreographed. There isn't a chopstick on the table that isn't meant to be there. Every comment, every wink of the eye, every nod of the head means something,\" he says. \"I love the idea of creating that.\" Weinstock's next script, a drama called \"Bad Blood,\" caught the atten - tion of a producer, who paid to \"option\" it\u2014giving him the exclusive rights for a certain period of time to make it into a movie. That option ran out. The next, a dramedy, won a screenplay contest and was optioned twice, but hasn't moved to the next step. Eventually, he was approached by a producer who wanted to do a kids' movie. Would Weinstock like to write it?Weinstock, whose cinematic tastes run more toward a gritty Brian De Palma flick or the dark comedy of the Coen brothers, was reluctant at first to write a film for children. \"I usually don't like them\u2014too saccharine sweet with a bow on top,\" he says. But he considered it a challenge. The result, with the working title \"Arlo: The Burping Pig,\" filmed in Los Angeles in January and has already been sold to a distributor and is scheduled for release later this year. A different producer commissioned him to write his next film, about an underground fight club. \"House Rules,\" which stars Tom Sizemore (\"Saving Wick\") and Vincent Pastore (\"The Sopranos\"), began film - ing in Connecticut in February. He's learned a lot about fundraising, casting and why some films are quicker to get the green light than others (e.g., an adorable little girl and a talking farm animal, as in the burping pig flick, is a golden formula). But while he's fascinated by the movie-making business, Weinstock is in no hurry to run off to Hollywood. \"The running joke has always been 'Don't quit your day job'; usually that joke is said with a little bit of bite from my father-in-law,\" he says. \"And I get that, now that I have kids.\" Plus, he says, \"if this were my full-time job, I think I would like it a lot less.\" Weinstock stills loves dentistry, a profession he chose very deliberately. After graduating from Brandeis with that degree in psychology, he was undecided about what to do. He liked the idea of caring for people, but was scared off by the science requirements needed for medical school. So follow - ing the old wisdom, \"you can do any - thing with a law degree,\" he went to law school at the University of Virginia. He spent summers working in law firms. But the long hours and taking the office worries home? Not for him. Dentistry, on the other hand, looked like it would let him help people as well as give him time for other pursuits. This time, while still in law school, he shadowed some dentists and weighed the pros and cons (including more student loans) before committing. He graduated from law school on a Sunday, and on Monday was sitting in his first predental chemistry class. He doesn't regret the law degree, which he draws on as the course director for Tufts' Ethics and Professionalism in Dentistry and Law class, which he has taught since 2002. Dentistry shows up in some of his scripts, including Arlo, which features a dentist as the dad (Joey Lawrence), and one of his favorites, \"Perfect Smile,\" a screwball comedy about a womanizing dentist on the run (a fictional account, he claims). Being a root canal guy\u2014an introduction that makes some people take a step back\u2014Weinstock thought he could capitalize on the inherent, uncomfortable humor that surrounds his job. \"I'm sorry, there's just something very funny about dentistry. I can say that. Everyone can relate to it in one way or another... Almost everyone has been to the dentist; everyone has their own dentist stories. So I thought it would just be kind of funny to have that woven into the story.\" Besides, a womanizing lawyer on the run? Not nearly as fun.

Sure, they have four years to develop clinical expertise, but, it's likely that they will be tested during their careers by changes in technology, practice models, government regulation and patient demographics. That means dental students must now be taught with an eye on both the fundamentals of today and the possibilities for tomorrow. \"If they're learning techniques right now that in 30 years will be obsolete, how do we prepare students for that eventuality?\" saysNadeem Karimbux, associate dean of academic affairs at Tufts School of Dental Medicine. \"What are some of the charac - teristics and skills students will need in order to deal with change and an uncertain future?\" The current curriculum stresses prob - lem-solving, critical thinking and collabo - ration\u2014qualities that Karimbux says will support lifelong learning and allow dentists to thrive in the evolving health-care landscape. Dental students were among the first at the university to use software to improve interaction in the classroom, he points out. In the clinic they are learning to use new technology and to employ evidence-based dentistry in making treatment decisions. And in keeping with new national accredita - tion requirements, Tufts students are also being taught to communicate with their patients in culturally appropriate and easy-to-understand ways\u2014for instance, drop the jargon and use \"cavities\" not \"caries.\" They are also encouraged to share their talent with the world beyond One Kneeland. \"I find the student body has become more genuinely interested in community service,\" says Executive Associate Dean Mark Gonthier. Gontheir says that what motivates Tufts students to pursue dentistry has remained consistent: the desire to provide care for patients, and, for many, the ability to work more autonomously than in other branches of medicine. What's changed, though, are the demographics: more women and underrepresented minorities; more students from outside New England; more stu - dents who publicly identify as gay or lesbian. \"Our students come here for the traditional dental career, but I think Tufts School of Dental Medicine changes people in ways they don't fully anticipate,\" Gonthier says. \"They become more open-minded; they develop a more fundamen - tal respect for diversity in all of its dimensions and they develop a better under - standing of the complex - ities of the world.\" Educating the next generation of dentists By Helene Ragovin illustrations by sam chiv Ers 10 tufts agazine |summer 2016 45971_Pg10-15.indd 10 6/22/16 12:34 PMWhen it comes to creating a racially and ethnically diverse class, \"our greatest recruit - ers are our students,\" says Robert Kasberg, associate dean of admissions and student affairs. \"I've seen our students do yeoman's work convincing Latino and African-American applicants that the climate here is one that is friendly and welcoming other* tufts national 13% Midwest4% Mountain states 2% international13% West c oast*Native Hawaiia N, Pacific i slaNder; two or more races; do N ot wis H to re Port; N oNreside Nt alie NA Climate for Diversity Women Lead Women may remain a tick behind men in national dental school enrollment numbers, but they account for 57 percent of Tufts' D18 and D19 classes. \"More women are going to college, and on the average, are better students,\" says Robert Kasberg, the admissions dean.

Also different: they have information at their fingertips. \"We need to teach them how to take that information and use it in a meaningful way,\" says Nadeem Karimbux, associate dean for academic affairs. These ideas are reflected in a more integrated basic science curriculum, part of the school's 2020 Vision strategic plan . Setting a New Course The Basic Science/Clinical Science Spiral Seminar Series (BaSiCSsss), which started in 2014, brings together teams of students from all four years to study and design treatment for clinical cases. The teams then present their findings to faculty and fellow students. Using case studies forces students to draw on knowledge across subjects, and first- and second-year stu - dents get early exposure to the clinical experience. Less Stress is Best A little mindfulness in between anesthesiology and epidemiology? Yes, please. Mid-day meditation is one component of Tufts' increasing emphasis on student wellness. First-years are now introduced to stress reduction strategies during orientation, and a faculty member oversees mind-body wellness efforts for all students, faculty and staff. \"The idea that we have to make you tough to survive in this profession no longer exists,\" says Associate Dean Robert Kasberg. \"We want people to find healthy ways to handle the rigors of dental school, and to develop healthy habits that can carry into their professional and personal lives.\" 45971_Pg10-15.indd 12 6/22/16 12:34 PMAll Together Now Dentists love to point out that the mouth is attached to the rest of the body, a truth that is finally beginning to show up in new health-care delivery models that emphasize integration of specialties. Dentists are being taught to function as part of a team that cares for the entire body. Dental students now do externships at community health centers, work alongside hygiene and nutrition students in the Tufts clinics, volunteer with their health-sciences peers at outreach sites like the Sharewood Clinic and help treat psychiatric patients at Tufts Medical Center. \"The isolation of the dental school from the rest of the academic health center is going away,\" says ADEA's Valachovic. Tufts was one of the first dental schools to sponsor a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender student group. And to this day, it remains one of just a handful of the nation's 65 dental schools with one. A 2004 study in the Journal of Dental Education found two schools reporting LGBT groups; when Tufts researchers took another look in 2015, that number stood at 10. \"We're definitely headed in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go,\" says Associate Professor Amit Sachdeo, an adviser to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies group. At a time when it's still not uncommon for profession - al-school applicants to scrub their public personas of indications that they are gay, having an affinity group signals an accepting environment, Sachdeo says. \"If the dental school and university administration were not supportive, our group would not exist,\" he says. \"I think that's an important message to get out to other institutions.\"2004 2015 u.s. Dental sc Hools W itH lgBt gRoups Instant Feedback in the Classroom Using interactive classroom technology, faculty can display images or radiographs and students can ask or answer questions on their devices. \"Faculty immediately know if the class is following along,\" says Jennipher Murphy, educational technology senior administrator. The software can instantly assign a large class to teams, allowing for collaborative work. The dental and medical schools were the first health-sciences schools at Tufts to use ExamSoft, a computer-based testing system that allows for a greater variety of questions than standard multi - ple-choice tests, along with instant grading. The point, Murphy says, is to find the technology that will best enable learning. \"Sometimes technology is not the answer.

Clinical Technology on the Cusp Keeping pace with technology can be challenging for a private practice\u2014so a newly hired associate may find herself greeted by either digital intraoral scanners with the latest software, or tried-and-true trays and elastomeric impression materials. That means clinical education now has to straddle the line between proficiency in traditional methods and preparedness for the future, says Ali Muftu, professor of prosthodontics. A prime example is the use of CAD/CAM\u2014 computer-aided design and manufacturing\u2014to produce restorations. While CAD/CAM den - tistry has been around since the late 1990s, Muftu says that with the development of new materials and better scanners, software and manufacturing systems, it has become easier and more common for dentists to take digital impressions and make restorations chairside. The technology was introduced in the predoctoral clinics about five years ago, but many established practices have not made the investment that CAD/CAM requires. Partially for that reason, Muftu says, graduation requirements stipulate that the bulk of a student's restorations must be done the \"old-fashioned\" way. \"We have the old curriculum to teach, and the new approach to teach, and that is a challenge,\" he says. However, \"the fundamentals are still the same.\" 91% Digital radiography85% technology soft in u.s.

The majority will still pursue private practice, but for many it will be in the form of a large group or corporate-managed practice. If trends continue, they will treat fewer middle-age adults, and more seniors, youngsters and patients with special needs or complex medical conditions. And their focus will extend beyond the dental office. \"We will need to appreciate more than ever before that the mouth is connected to the body, and that body is connected to a family and a commu - nity,\" says ADEA president Richard Valachovic. As the overall health-care system changes, it's expected that dentists will become engaged in collabora - tive care. Students are being educated with this in mind, but the shift could alter the independence traditionally valued by the profession, says Mark Gonthier, executive associate dean. \"Is that going to create a change in the kind of person attracted to pursuing dentistry?\" neW Dentists sta Rt private practice advanced education government service Dental s chool faculty/ staff public Health unsure/ other Money Isn't Everything What steers the direction of a new dentist's career? Paying off the cost of education is one consideration, but it appears that other factors weigh even more heavily. A 2015 study in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that while graduates with higher levels of debt are more likely to enter private practice, loan repayment is not the driving force behind career choices. \"Gender and race were huge compared to debt,\" says Marko Vujicic, vice president of the Health Policy Institute of the American Dental Association. According to the JADA study, white, male graduates are statistically more likely than their female and non-white classmates to go into private practice and to own a practice eventually. So, too, are those graduates whose parents were also dentists. Women, meanwhile, are more likely to pursue teaching, research and public health. African-American graduates are more likely to go into public health, public service or specialty training, while Asians are more likely than other racial groups to join a dental school faculty.

I was just 6 and playing in the street with friends when my Aunt Ruth opened the screen door and yelled \"Travisss!\" I rushed home and stationed myself on the couch by the living room window, anxiously watching every car that passed by. Finally one pulled up. It was Dan! He took me for ice cream. As a kid, I looked forward to spending a Saturday or Sunday with Dan because I knew we would have fun\u2014even if I just went out with him for lunch or a movie, or watched him play pickup basketball (he needed the He never gave up on me BY TRAVIS THOMAS, D17 Continued on page 19 \u00bb \u00bb 45971_Pg8,9,16-19.indd 17 6/22/16 1:42 PMboy living in an impoverished Miami neighborhood I knew only as a place to avoid driving through. That's how I met Travis.Travis was abandoned by his father at birth, and his mother struggled with substance abuse. He bounced around among relatives, neglected so much that a great aunt eventually took him in and agreed to care for him. She became his only caretaker and called Big Brothers Big Sisters to give Travis some additional influences in his life. Our backgrounds couldn't have been more different, but we found common interests during our weekly get-togethers: sports, hanging out at the mall, going to bad Steven Seagal movies (a redundant phrase) and cruis - ing around in my 1966 Wimbledon white Mustang convertible. I liked having a little kid I could boss around; he liked knowing some - one who could drive; we both liked having a brother. And I finally had someone to give my hand-me-downs to. Travis looked good in my over - sized Tufts Jumbo T-shirts. I also appreciated getting a view of a world I knew little of. I had an interest in public service, and while I was able to return home after our weekend outings, what Travis confronted all the time was both eye-opening and moving. Travis' life wasn't easy, and his pros - pects were uncertain. Through the years, I watched as his childhood friends went to jail, or died, or faded into the vortex of the inner city. His aunt\u2014whose home was surrounded by abandoned dwellings that usually hosted crack dealers\u2014did all she could to keep those influences away from him. She also made sure Travis had faith in his life. But I always held my breath, hoping he would escape the fate of so many others. I had become a federal prosecutor, and in that role had seen my share of people whose lives had jumped the tracks. Travis had a work ethic but lacked a seriousness of purpose, especially about school. I tried to push and prod and even bribe, but it didn't seem to take. But we stuck together through the years. When I met Joan, he proudly stood by me at my wedding. He was only 13. Over the next decade, Travis watched me grow a family and saw the joy it brought me. He saw my vintage Mustang get replaced with a Honda minivan, and saw Hannah Montana elbow out Steven Seagal. He held each of my infant children, and saw me embrace the responsibility of being a spouse and a parent. But Travis couldn't seem to find his own way. He graduated high school, but each time he enrolled in a junior college, he quickly withdrew to return to the Miami streets. Like half the kids in his neighborhood, he developed a life plan based on pursuing a career as a rap star. At best it was a pipe dream. At worst, it would lead him nowhere good. I was beginning to lose hope. Travis was slipping away. Then Travis met a girl and fell in love, and things seemed to change. They wanted a family, so he shelved his rap career and asked me for help getting a job. I found him a position working for a friend's extermination company. Travis was assigned the night shift. After three nights of chas - ing rodents in the dark he called, told me he'd had enough, and asked if he could go back to school, again. We enrolled him at Miami Dade College with hopes he could earn a two-year degree. This time he didn't walk away. He soon married his girl - friend, Wilsa, in a beautiful ceremony. I was his best man, beaming in my rented Creamsicle-colored tux.As Travis and Wilsa prepared for the birth of their child, he became even more serious. He told me he wanted to become a dentist, a profession that had interested him since childhood, when he'd been teased about the large gap between his front teeth. I worried his goal was totally unrealistic. I even suggested to him that maybe he was aiming too high and should consider something more attainable. My wife, Joan, really let me have it when she heard I'd tried to tamp down his aspirations. So we went all in and, more importantly, so did Travis. He studied for every test like it would decide his future\u2014like he would be left chasing rats on the night shift if he failed. He graduated from Miami Dade College with a two-year degree and enrolled at nearby Nova Southeastern University on an academic scholarship. There he sought out health science courses. By now, Travis was a driven student, regularly making the dean's list and never giving up on his dream of being a dentist. During all this time he continued to live in the same tiny house he was raised in, sharing it with his elderly aunt and other relatives. His young family made do by living in the dining room, which provided only a smidgen of separation from the angry neighborhood outside. As he had vowed, Travis took the dental school admission test. I held my breath again. What would happen to him if he fell short? I wished Joan had not convinced me to bless this path. They gave Travis his scores as he left the testing center. He called me as he walked out. He scored in the 93 percen - tile overall, and his organic chemistry score was over 97 percent. He was so proud. I was without words. Joan wept. Travis applied to dental schools across the country. Friends chipped Continued from page 16 18 TUFTS DENTAL MEDICINE |SUMMER 2016 45971_Pg8,9,16-19.indd 18 6/22/16 1:42 PMmoral support). Our outings usually concluded with a trip to the bookstore and a few words of wisdom. Dan never missed the opportunity to sermonize about reading and educa - tion. Public service is huge in his family, and he shared its importance with me, whether that meant I tagged along to a festival for children battling cancer or helped him distribute gifts to other kids. I remember the time I got two garbage bags filled with toys, only to find out he expected me to keep just one toy and give the rest away to the kids in my neigh - borhood (Dan was a star on my block!). As I grew older, though, Dan's influence seemed to reach me less and less. I was no longer the adorable 6-year-old Dan took for ice cream. Like most of my friends, I sported a gold grill, had a hip-hop swag and knew all of the drug dealers on my block. Clearly, I was going in a different direction. Maybe I had lost faith in myself and figured I wasn't worthy, but I began to let go of the person I had called my big brother for more than a decade. Dan was starting his own family, and once I turned 18, I decided our relationship would end. Dan would have none of it. He continued to remain a fixture in my life. No matter what I thought of myself, Dan let me know he believed in me. Whatever doubts I had about myself, Dan had none. Eventually all those bookstore visits and sermons started to sink in. I met my wife, and we had our son\u2014and for the first time I believed that maybe I could control my future. Since my father didn't raise me, I looked to Dan for guidance. I saw his honesty, his drive, his humility and most of all his love for his family. And when I decided to return to college for the third time, his family supported me in every way. There was no way I was letting them down! His wife, Joan, became one of my big supporters, and when I men - tioned becoming a dentist to her, she urged me to \"go for it.\" And that's when I realized she was smarter than Dan. Dan didn't have to volunteer to spend his time with me. He could have said coming into my neighborhood was too risky. Or he could have simply given up on me when I had given up on myself. But he didn't. That is why I am paying it forward by caring for my own half-brother, who is in a situation nearly identical to the one that I was once in. I know that I am succeeding in school because I work hard. But I also know that I would not be here if I didn't have a big brother who taught me to believe in myself. Dan, your little brother is going to be a dentist! in unused frequent flyer miles to get him to his interviews, and he borrowed luggage, ties and overcoats to look professional. Here is how he answered a dental school application that asked if he believed he grew up \"disadvantaged\": I grew up in one of Miami's poor - est neighborhoods. I was abandoned by many who you would think would have nurtured me, and raised by my grandmother's aunt. I remember, as a young boy, hiding inside my house for days after a drive-by shooting. But through it all, people\u2014some - times perfect strangers\u2014inspired me to never give up and to always believe in myself. So yes, I did have a disad - vantaged life by most definitions, but that life has made me better prepared and more appreciative of the oppor - tunities and blessings I do have. Dental programs across the country wanted him. Many offered scholarships. I thought staying in Florida made the most sense, believing it would be too difficult for him to start anew in another state. Once again, Joan disassembled my argument, contending Travis and his family had every right to define their future on their terms. So Travis pulled out my old hand-me-down T-shirts and decided Tufts was where he wanted to be. It wasn't because of me at all. Rather, it was because after his inter - view, a dean had pulled him aside, put his hand on Travis' shoulder, and told him that the school believed in him. That's all Travis needed to hear. That's all he's ever needed to hear. At the conclusion of his first year at Tufts School of Dental Medicine, I attended his white coat ceremony, marking his transition to the clinical side of his education. I think I must have got some dust in both eyes. Travis recently announced he might become an oral surgeon or a prostho - dontist. I believe him.

And how could these products move as quickly as possible from an idea in the laboratory to use in the dental office? Those are the questions driving an initiative at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) aimed at put - ting the latest advances in dentistry into the hands of practicing dentists and other health-care providers sooner. The project, called the Dental, Oral and Craniofacial Tissue Regeneration Consortium, or DOC-TRC, involves mul - tidisciplinary teams from numerous research sites engaged in what is known as translational research. That's work undertaken with a specific end product in mind that can make the trip, as scientists say, \"from bench to bedside\"\u2014or, in the case of dentistry, chairside. Mainstays of modern dentistry, such as titanium implants, amalgam fillings, CAD/CAM prostheses and restorations, tetracycline wraps to treat periodontal disease and mouthwashes to relieve dry mouth and halitosis are all products of translational research. In the case of DOC-TRC, the emphasis, as the name suggests, is on regenerating functional tissue of cra - niofacial bone, gums, teeth and the temporomandibu - lar joint. Tufts School of Dental Medicine received a $125,000 planning grant for the first phase of the project, one of 10 awarded by the NIDCR, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. There will be far fewer grants for the sec - ond stage; participating institutions are expected to submit joint proposals and work collaboratively for the duration of the project. The idea is to take advantage of the resources of research, clinical practice, industry and government to spur new work and to speed up work in progress. The goal is \"to create a continuous con - veyor belt to bring products from bench to bedside,\" says Pamela Yelick, G89, director of the division of craniofacial and molecular genetics at the School of Dental Medicine and the lead Tufts researcher for DOC-TRC. Investigators on the Tufts team include Athena Papas, J66, chair of the den - tal school's division of oral medicine; Gerard Kugel, D85, M.S.93, professor and associate dean for research at the dental school; and Andrew Hoffman, direc - tor of the regenerative medicine laboratory at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Traditionally, it has taken decades for products to move through the research and development stages, Yelick says. The timetable for products promoted through DOC-TRC will vary, depending on how far along they are when NIDCR fund - ing begins. But many could be available to dental offices within 10 years. Discoveries already in clinical trials would obviously have a head start, she says\u2014such as Papas' work on treatments for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder 45971_Pg20-22.indd 20 6/22/16 12:35 PMwhere ideas take root lonG/science source summer 2016 | Tuf Ts d en Tal medicine 21characterized by dry mouth and dry eyes. \"That work is the closest that we have to reaching the public, and that could be in five years or less, depending on how her clinical trials go.\" Yelick's own research involves using dental stem cells to regenerate craniofa - cial bone and teeth, which, she says, would be prefer - able to synthetic implants (read more at go.tufts.edu/growyourown ). \"Even if we could fabricate a living root and put a crown on it, it would be a huge improve - ment over a fixed dental implant,\" she says. Kugel is developing new materials, such as silk coatings, to improve the way dental implants fuse with the jawbone. Such an advance would address a significant concern dentists face: While the success rate for implants is high in healthy patients, in those who smoke, have diabetes or osteoporosis or have had radiation treatment for head or neck cancers, the risk for implant failure is as high as 25 to 30 percent. His Tufts collaborators on the research are David Kaplan, the Stern Family Professor of Engineering and chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Driss Zoukhri, a professor in the department of comprehen - sive care at the dental school. What distinguishes the DOC-TRC project is its focus on clinical needs, says Kugel, who also maintains a practice in addition to conducting research at Tufts. With pressure to spend research dollars wisely, the NIDCR needs to concentrate on science \"that is clinically relevant to get these products into our patients' mouths,\" he says. \"We need research that addresses everyday issues.\" Insight into a rare disease could lead to treatments for the world's most pervasive cancer by shannon fischer When she W as just 12, Julie Breneiser had her first skin cancer removed and three large tumors carved out of her jawbone. Since then she has undergone surgeries for two more jaw growths and many, many more basal cell carcinomas\u2014\"hundreds, probably close to a thou - sand,\" she estimates. \"You lose count.\" Such a proliferation of malignancies is typical in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome (BCCNS), a rare genetic dis - ease that affects between one in 18,976 to one in 55,600 people. Breneiser is board president of the BCCNS Life Support Network, which connects 850 families in the U.S., most of whom have three relatives with the syndrome. Skin and jaw tumors are hallmarks, but patients also typically suffer from several of nearly 50 other conditions, including malformation of the bones in the feet and ribs, brain tumors and glaucoma. BCCNS is poorly understood, in part because it's so rare. Most of the research about it consists of case studies, not scientific investigations into how it develops and progresses. A team of Tufts researchers led out of the School of Dental Medicine is seeking to learn more, with an eye toward finding an effective and long-lasting treatment. Right now, treatment options are few. The basal cell carcinomas can be cut out\u2014but for a BCCNS patient, that means many, many surgeries over the course of a lifetime. \"You start to look like a very interesting puzzle because your skin becomes a series of scar tissue,\" says Kristi Schmitt Burr, the BCCNS Life Support Network's exec - utive director. She stopped counting her own basal cell carcinomas after the 300th occurred three decades ago. One relatively new chemo - therapy drug does seem able to halt the skin cancers, but it means enduring all the usual side effects of chemo - therapy. Another drawback: It can be used only for a few months at a time\u2014and then the malignancies start coming back. The Tufts team is marshaling the resources of cancer biology, metabolo - mics (the study of chemical changes that result from cellular processes) and genetics, among other fields, to identify the molecular underpinnings of BCCNS. The first target is its name - sake manifestation, basal cell carcinoma. The research is funded by the Michael J. Light micrograph showing basal cell carcinoma. 45971_Pg20-22.indd 21 den Tal Family Foundation. The lead scientist is Addy Alt-Holland, an assistant professor of endodontics and a cancer researcher who is an expert in engineering live tissue models of human skin to study squamous cell carcinoma, which is similar to basal cell carcinoma. The group spans Tufts institu - tions and includes James Baleja, an associate professor of developmental, molecular and chemical biology at the School of Medicine, and Janet Cowan, director of the Cytogenetic Laboratory at Tufts Medical Center. the faulty s onic h edgehog It's known that BCCNS is linked to a specific mutation in the cell signaling pathway known as the sonic hedge - hog, which is involved in cell growth. Undoubtedly there's more to learn, says Alt-Holland. \"Cancer is a very complicated dis - ease. More often than not, it doesn't start or end because of just one signaling pathway or one molecule going awry.\" One goal of the research, she says, is to figure out what else causes basal cell carcinoma, and then apply those findings to the many other tumor types associated with BCCNS. The researchers are using human cell lines instead of mouse cells so their findings are likely to be more directly applicable to the disease. But that approach also comes with challenges. Human basal carcinoma cells are partic - ularly uncooperative\u2014one reason so little work has been done with them\u2014and it took Alt-Holland and her collaborators a year to figure out how to get these cells to grow robustly. As it turns out, unlike most cancers, these carcinomas do not rely on glucose as their main source of fuel. Instead, they prefer certain amino acids\u2014and they seem to require the pres - ence of certain supporting cells, like fibroblasts, for their growth. Once they cracked that puzzle, Alt-Holland and her team began building more complicated cancer models that mimic real-life environments\u20143-D mod - els of the cells' matrices built on scaffolds of colla - gen. The models, she says, allow the researchers to eavesdrop on the molecu - lar conversation between the cells, and then tweak it. The work holds hope for BCCNS patients like Breneiser and Schmitt Burr. But it may also lead to treatments for the more sporadic cases of basal cell carcinoma, the most com-mon cancer in the world. In otherwise healthy individ-uals, these cancers gener - ally can be treated with a one-off surgery, but in more complicated or advanced cases, better therapeutics are needed. And because these malignancies are a form of epithelial cancer, and epithelial cells constitute the layer of cells lining organs throughout the body, the findings may someday have wider implications. \"It's a great opportunity,\" says Baleja, of the medical school, whose expertise in metabolomics helped the team figure out the com-ponents needed to support the growth of human basal cell carcinomas in cultures. \"What we learn from these can apply to more general diseases, because very often, the same pathways are involved,\" he says. This summer, the group will welcome more collaborators, including Daniel Oreadi and Archana Viswanath from the depart - ment of oral and maxillo - facial surgery at the dental school, to study BCCNS-associated jaw tumors. Biologist Michael Levin will lead one of two new Allen Discovery Centers in the nation by jacqueline mitchell tufts u nIvers Ity has received a $10 million grant, one of only two in the nation given by Microsoft cofounder Paul G. Allen to fund research at the frontier of the life sciences. Tufts developmen - tal biologist Michael Levin, whose groundbreaking work on the bioelectrical control of development and regener - ation could lead to medical breakthroughs in areas such as birth defects, cancer, trau - matic injury and degenera - tive diseases, will lead one of two Allen Discovery Centers. The other is at Stanford University. The Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University for Reading and Writing the Morphogenetic Code will focus on the role bioelectrical signaling plays in orchestrating how cells communicate to create and repair complex anatomical shapes\u2014an area of inquiry that Levin says is \"the key to most problems in biomedicine.\" The ability of cell networks to process information and make group decisions is imple - mented by bioelectrical, chemical and other signals. Errors in this process can give rise to birth defects and cancer. \"We're going to under - stand how cells and tissues decide what shape they're supposed to build, how they figure out what to do in order to make that shape how they know when they've achieved that shape and can stop growth,\" says Levin, A92, the Vannevar Bush Professor in the department of biology and director of the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology. The Allen Center will likely be a game changer for the life sciences at Tufts, says President Anthony P. Monaco. \"We expect this center to drive a funda - mental change in how we investigate, teach and learn the quantitative biological sciences, and how we extend that knowledge,\" says Monaco, who also holds faculty appointments in biology and neuroscience. 45971_Pg20-22.indd 22 6/22/16 12:35 PMuniversity, school & alumni news timothy kim, d18 , who switched careers from photography to dentistry, chronicled a service trip to Jamaica with three other Tufts dental students in February.

I would tell you more, but what happens at mentorship night stays at mentorship night. Wallach, D85, is one of 30 faculty members taking part in the dental school's popular mentorship program this year. The school matches inter - ested students with a willing faculty member and gives them a stipend to get together casually every month or so to talk about whatever is on their minds. Some groups go out to a restaurant; others order pizza and hang in a spare classroom. \"It's a nice interaction with the students outside of school where you can discuss things freely,\" says Wallach, explaining that office hours, while great, are inherently more formal, and chats in the elevator are often rushed. The students ask her about where to do their externships, when to take their boards (the earlier the better, she says) and what life is like after dental school. \"When you have free time, come down to the clinic and assist,\" she encourages a student as they are shown to their table. \"The more time you have in the clinic the better prepared you'll be when it's your turn.\" Lauren Gerkowicz, D18, says that knowing Wallach from the mentorship dinners when she was just starting dental school helped her when she was grappling with whether to specialize. \"I wanted some other opinions, but at that point you don't know a lot of fac - ulty, you don't know a lot of staff. And so having this, I felt comfortable being able to talk to her and hear about her story. I enjoyed having that outlet.\" The program, started in the early 2000s, is aimed at first-year students, but many of Wallach's mentees continue coming to the gatherings throughout their time at the dental school.

Students can request a mentor in a specific postgraduate program, which is why Paul Levi, D66, DG71, A95P, associate clinical professor of peri - odontology, often gets aspiring perio - dontists and researchers in his group. His mentor group seems to grow every year; at a recent dinner (deli sandwiches at the Glickman Library), a couple dozen students from vari - ous class years showed up. \"I tend to hold onto them,\" he says. Some of his mentees have gone on to do research with him, help present at the Yankee Dental conference or contribute to his recent textbook, Non-Surgical Control of Periodontal Diseases. \"They learn from each other and I learn from them,\" he says. Recently, he and his mentees debated the pros and cons of lecture capture. The students praised the flexibility of being able to watch lectures at home while doing laundry, and Levi made the case for the dynamic exchange that happens with a live audience. The mentorship program has become something of an institution. When the school scaled back funding for the program last year, many of the mentor groups decided to meet on their own, paying their own way. Funding was reinstated this year, which means that the next time you're out at a restaurant near campus, you're likely to hear things like, \"Yeah, the worst part is that lower injection,\" or \"I'm in Exeter, too!\" Contact Julie f laher Ty at julie.flaherty@tufts.edu . expanding worldviewexpanding worldview With new exchange programs in Japan and Turkey, Tufts now has ties with 30 dental schools the school of d ental m edicine has added two more coun - tries to its already long list of international collaborators. Two dental schools in Japan and one in Turkey have signed memos of understanding to establish student exchanges, and are now among the 30 dental schools in 16 countries with which Tufts has formal ties. Noshir Mehta, DG73, DI77, associ - ate dean of global relations, and Dean Huw Thomas visited Asahi University and Meikei University in Japan and Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey, a year ago. They join dental schools in Australia, China, Kuwait, Mexico and Scotland. The interna - tional programs may take the form of three-week student exchanges in places like Japan or Spain or semester-long service-learning and community-outreach programs in the Dominican Republic or Haiti. \"Tufts\u2014and the dental school especially\u2014has always been an international school,\" says Mehta. \"We've been actively engaged in having foreign students coming to and learning at Tufts and then going back home and becoming ambassadors [for Tufts], but we never actively engaged with other schools.\"At some of the sister schools, says Mehta, Tufts dental students, who pay for the exchange experience, will learn from some of the world's best researchers and clinicians working in state-of-the-art facilities. In other locations, Americans students will have the chance to see how schools with fewer resources \"can still get the work done,\" he says. Students from abroad \"are all eager to learn the American way, if you will,\" from dental techniques, to filling materials, to electronic health record keeping, Mehta says. The experience can also give exchange students a leg up when applying to American dental schools. The Japanese students from Tufts' sister schools in the cities of Urayasu, just outside Tokyo, and Mizuho, in central Japan, will spend some time at One Kneeland Street this summer. Four Tufts stu - dents went to Japan last semester. \"My goal has been to expand the average American dental student's global focus so that they can go out and be ambassadors for Tufts as well as come back and give their classmates a feel for what goes on in the rest of the world,\" says Mehta. -JaCQueline MiTChell ILLUSTRATION: INGIMAGE.COM 45971_Pg23-38.indd D18; Timothy Kim, D18; and Tahira Williams, D16, traveled to Jamaica earlier this year to provide dental care through the Tufts Global Outreach program.

An MIT-educated engineer whose expertise is in soil behaviors and reusing waste, Swan will lead initiatives on fac - ulty engagement, community outreach and student programming. He is a longtime advocate of ser - vice learning, an approach that marries community service and instruction. He has done research on the impact of civic engagement on engineering education and evaluated the benefits for engineering faculty who employ community engage - ment in their teaching and research. \"I have always felt inspired by Tisch College and its mission to infuse the university culture with the values of community engagement. I've seen those values at work at the School of Engineering,\" says Swan, who has been involved with Tisch since its beginnings and was one of its first Faculty Fellows. \"Engineers impact society\u2014their designs have civic purpose,\" he says. \"We better prepare our students when we incorporate civic-based learning into our curricula. I look forward to championing these ideas and exploring new academic possibilities across all our schools.\" In 2008, Swan received a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to assess the impact of ser - vice learning. When he compared student teams that combined problem solving with community service and reflection versus those who did not engage in ser - vice learning, he found that civic engage - ment helped students develop a \"holistic approach\" to their design process, which in turn made them better able to assess problems from many perspectives.civic life risingcivic life rising Jonathan and Lizzie Tisch invest $15 million to help Tufts graduates shape a better future as the nation continues to engage in increasingly fractious political discourse, it's more important than ever to develop a community of leaders who are able to rise above the fray and bring positive change to the public sphere. Fostering such change has been a cornerstone of Tisch College, and now, with a $15 million gift from Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch, A76, and a new name that more clearly describes its mission, the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life is poised to extend its reach, both on campus and in the world. The Tisches' gift will endow professorships in the emerging field of civic studies, which examines why people get involved in causes and what happens when they do; support ongoing research on youth vot - ing and political engagement and expand opportunities for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in service learning and leadership development programs. \"Lizzie and I believe in the evolution of Tisch College and wanted to help ensure that it has a bright future, offering even more to the students at Tufts for decades to come,\" says Tisch, vice chair of the university's Board of Trustees. \"What we're seeing here at Tufts is that young people today want to be engaged. They want to make a difference.\" Tufts takes seriously its role as an engine for social good. \"We believe that higher education has a responsibility to act to help young people become agents for thoughtful advocacy, action and positive change,\" says Tufts President Anthony P. Monaco. \"Jonathan and Lizzie Tisch share this belief. Their generous support will enable us to help prepare every student for this important role, whether they're studying to be a dentist or a diplomat, an actor or an engineer.\" Jonathan Tisch, cochairman of the board and a member of the office of the president of Loews Corp. and chairman of its sub - sidiary, Loews Hotels, has been a longtime champion for addressing society's problems via the civic engagement of individuals and corpo - rations. Ten years ago, he made a $40 million gift to Tufts to endow the first institution-wide college of its kind, the University College of Citizenship and Public Service, as the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service. In the decade since Tisch's initial investment, the college has emerged as a leader in education, research and practice and has gained recognition as the foremost authority on youth voting patterns and civic engagement in the U.S. -Taylor M Cneil Jonathan and Lizzie Tisch PHOTOS : ALONSO NICHOLS 45971_Pg23-38.indd 27 6/20/16 10:31 AM\"If you have access to the magical solution that the [silkworm] has, then you can morph it into many different shapes rel - evant to technology today,\" he said. \"That's the beauty of bottom-up assembly.\" Among the projects his team is work - ing on is an implantable chip that can be switched on and off via an external remote control, like a cell phone. Left in a patient after surgery, the chip can be activated to heat up after an operation, killing off localized bacterial infection and eliminating the need for antibiotics. His lab is also looking at how implantable silk-based devices in the form of reflec - tive prisms could deliver chemotherapy drugs and, via optics, report back on how much of the drug remains in the device. \"Light comes in and is bounced back by faces of the prism,\" he said. \"As the drug is delivered, the reflectivity changes, and there's a correlation between the amount of drug released and a change in reflectivity. So it's a nice way to monitor what is happening,\" he said. This tightly controlled drug-delivery could change the way chemotherapy is given or potentially open up new forms of treatment that respond to conditions within the body. Diaphanous and pliant, silk is also For 5,000 years, humans have hijacked the fibers the little silkworm needs for its cocoon to produce fine textiles. Before spinning it into its familiar fibrous form, the worm stores its silk in a liquid solution in its body. Fiorenzo Omenetto, a bioengineer who works with lasers and fiber optics, was intrigued by silk's transition from liquid to solid. \"To me, it was similar to the way glass is made into optical fiber,\" he said. \"We can take this manufacturing process and hack it.\" Omenetto, the Frank C. Doble Professor of Engineering and associ - ate dean for research at Tufts School of Engineering, gave the keynote address at the 2016 edition of Bates-Andrews Day, the dental school's annual student research symposium. Describing myriad projects underway in his lab\u2014\"It's a bit of a laundry list,\" he said\u2014Omenetto said the dizzying array of sci-fi-sounding solu - tions to many of our problems rest on the malleability of the silk protein. His research team manipulates silk's molecular structure as it changes from its liquid state into a solid. The scientists can produce liquids of vary - ing viscosities, or clear plastic-like sheets, or prism shapes that reflect light.

It's also nontoxic and biocompatible. \"Cells like interfac - ing with it,\" he said. Omenetto and his colleagues have produced silk-based inks and circuitry that can sense the presence of bacteria. Most interesting to the dentists in the room, these tiny sensors could be \"tat - tooed\" on teeth to provide information about levels of bacteria in the mouth\u2014information that would help determine treatment protocols for periodontitis, for example. The biodegradable inks and circuits can also be embedded in materials like surgical gloves or stuck onto foods, ensuring that doctors and diners alike are aware of the presence of deadly microbes. Speaking of foods, the researchers are also working on a silk-based coating for perishable foods. By locking oxygen away from fruits and veggies, the coating could keep them fresher at room temperature for much longer. Omenetto and his team are looking into similar technology to help stabilize vaccines, which typically depend on refrigeration to remain active\u2014something that can be hard to come by in developing countries where vaccines are often most needed. Similar technology could be used to stabilize blood for easier transport and testing. Silk's potential could extend beyond biomedical applications, Omenetto said. Because the material dissolves in water and is absorbed easily by living organ - isms, silk devices can be programmed to dissolve once they've served their pur - pose, he said, showing a video of a model plane with silk-based wings dissipating in water after a test flight. But these sustainable materials will not be widely accepted unless they perform at least as well as the less-green ones in our devices today, Omenetto said. \"We are taking small steps towards what could be done in this arena.

Known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Peer Review, the new twist allowed students and visitors viewing the student posters and other projects on display to offer real-time feedback via their cell phone, tablet or computer. All presenters were provided with an individual web address and QR code\u2014a scannable square code akin to a supermarket barcode\u2014that they could display on their posters. Visitors to the poster were able to type in the web address or scan the QR code to access a survey specific to the presentation and provide immediate feedback. Presenters were able to access the surveys immediately after Bates Day. \"Large numbers of people are moving through the exhibits, and it can be hard to engage with students directly and difficult to ask questions and give feedback,\" says Jennipher Murphy, education technology senior administrator at the School of Dental Medicine. \"BYOD gives visitors the opportunity to reflect on the presentation and to give immediate, mean - ingful feedback to the student. It can also motivate people who might be hesitant to give feedback face-to-face.\" With meetings of the American Dental Education Association and International Association of Dental Research just days away, student presenters were eager for input. Mansi Jailwala, D17, said a lot of people who stopped by her poster used the new technology. Her project surveyed her classmates about their experiences with and attitudes about domestic violence as well as its role in the dental curriculum.

Risha M. De Leon, DI16, MPH16, wanted to change that. She has spent much of the last year getting to know the teachers, children and their families in the Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) Chinese Church's Head Start program, just down the street from Tufts' health sciences campus in Boston. De Leon created a survey to gauge the emphasis parents of children in the program put on oral health and dental care. Their responses, she hopes, will point to interventions that could improve overall oral health in Chinatown. She's doing the work for her Schweitzer Fellowship, which supports students across the country in developing sustainable programs that improve the health and well-being of people in underserved communities. Poor children often have more cavities than their wealthier counter - parts. Based on mandatory screenings at the 45 Head Start programs in Greater Boston, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that more than a third of the 3- to 5-year-olds who participate in Head Start have cavities. That's compared to 28 percent of children in that age group throughout Massachusetts. (The screenings are supported by the DentaQuest Foundation.) Research suggests the disparity is primarily because low-income people either can't afford dental care or simply find it too difficult to get to the dentist. But neither of those explanations fits the Asian-Americans, often new immigrants, who use the ABCD Chinese Church Head Start. These families are usually covered by MassHealth, says De Leon, and many live within walking distance of the Tufts dental clinics. De Leon wants to figure out why children in this community still have higher rates of decay, even though they do not face traditional barriers to care. Although her analysis isn't com - pleted, it appears that language barriers may be a big hurdle. De Leon also says the community does not have enough knowledge about the importance of oral health care. Few parents realize they should bring their children to the dentist as early as age 1. De Leon figured that out pretty quickly at her initial meetings with the Head Start children. Wearing her light blue scrubs, she asked the preschoolers what they thought her uniform signified. \"They thought I was a mailman,\" she says, laughing. De Leon is developing basic oral health education seminars for the Head Start community. Right now, she is working with the dental school's pediatrics department to establish presentations by a pediatric resident to the parents. Building bonds between the school and the people of Chinatown was abso - lutely essential to success in this kind of public health arena, says De Leon. \"If you want to do good community-based research, the key thing is having a good relationship,\" she says. -Jacqueline Mi Tchell Risha DeLeon, Boston's Chinatown.From All Corners PHOTO : MATTHE w HEALE y 30 tufts dental Medicine |summer 2016 30 6/22/16 1:24 PMTUFTS TUFTSTRAVELLEARN.ORG ACCOLADES FROM OUR TRAVELERS: Great choice of sites to visit and superb guides and lecturers Educational as well as entertaining Great to travel with people who also wanted to learn Absolutely Fabulous!

Before 1980, the pediatrics depart - ment trained two or three residents each year; after that, there were up to a dozen. \"Many of our students excelled professionally,\" Tsamtsouris says. \"We are very proud of them.\" Among them is Marc Saadia, DG81, now a prominent pediatric dentist in Mexico City. Saadia chaired the postgraduate and residency programs in pediatric dentistry at the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de M\u00e9xico and later became director of postgraduate programs there. \"Dr. White taught me not what to think, but how to think,\" says Saadia. Tufts' pediatrics program, he says, was unique in its emphasis on evi - dence-based dental medicine. In particular, White was a strong proponent of dentofacial orthopedics, a specialized branch of orthodontics that begins the process of correcting misaligned bites as early as age 7 or 8. \"Everybody thought it was just a fad, but it was really a change in paradigm in the way orthodontics was done,\" Saadia says. White understood that it was important for the field to have its own peer-reviewed professional jour - nal, and so in 1976 he launched the Journal of Pedodontics , later renamed the Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry.(Saadia took over as editor- in-chief when White stepped down in 2005.) Today, pediatric dentistry is the third most popular specialty among dental school graduates nation - wide, according to the American Dental Association. Enrollment in postgrad-uate pediatric programs has nearly doubled since 2001. That's in part, says Carapezza, because of White's foresight. \"The specialty would not have advanced without its own journal,\" says Carapezza. \"Today pediatrics is the most valued of specialties.\" -JaCQueline MiTChelltheir students called them Papa White and Mama Tsamtsou. When they stepped down as co-chairs of the pediatrics department after more than 30 years, George White and Anthi Tsamtsouris had not only transformed Tufts School of Dental Medicine, but the field of pediatric dentistry as well. White became department chair in 1973, fresh off completing his Ph.D. in nutritional biochemistry at MIT. He brought to Tufts an emphasis on research that would set it apart from other pediatrics departments. In addition to training stu - dents to rely on scientific evidence, he also launched the field's first peer-reviewed journal, which helped pediatric dentistry gain its footing as a mature specialty. White and Tsamtsouris, DG73, DG76, J85P, J87P, D91P, DG94P, were also pioneers of the \"whole-child\" approach to pediatric dentistry, which takes a child's overall physical and psychosocial well-being into account, in addition to the mouth. \"George had a lot of foresight,\" says Leonard J. Carapezza, an associ - ate clinical professor of pediatrics at Tufts. \"The program kept looking ahead. George and Anthi set that tone.\" The couple is retired and lives in Florida. To commemorate their three decades at Tufts, alumni, friends and family, led by Carapezza and William Chan, D75A, DG82, D10P, DG13P, M.S.13P, established an endowment fund, now valued at more than $78,000. The money will be used \"to support the department's most basic needs and help us maintain our high-quality pediatric dentistry residency program and clinic,\" Dean Huw F. Thomas says. In 1973, the couple's first task was to make room for pediatrics in the school's then-new building at One Kneeland Street. Before the move, the department consisted of a dozen chairs at the Floating Hospital for Children. The lighting was poor, the equipment out-of-date. Tsamstouris lobbied Dean Erling Johansen, D49, to allow them to book one or two appointments a day for children using a few chairs on the third floor. She figured it would be easier for parents to bring their children in for treatment at the same time as their own appoint - ments. She was right. \"It turned out we had more [pediatric] patients there than at the hospital,\" she says. Soon the pediatric services at One Kneeland Street became so popular that Tsamtsouris rounded up some volunteers to roll filing cabinets and other office furniture\u2014everything but the dental chairs\u2014onto the elevators and up to the eighth floor, space used only at night for continuing education. The dean was notified the George White and Anthi Tsamtsouris helped the field of pediatric dentistry grow up Current pediatrics chair Cheen Loo, DI10, says White and Tsamtsouris built a strong foundation for today's graduates.From All Corners 32 tufts dental Medicine |summer 2016 45971_Pg23-38.indd 32 6/20/16 10:31 AMsummer 2016 | tufts dental Medicine 33tufts s chool of Dental Medicine has joined a statewide effort to curb opioid and other prescription drug abuse.

See our full schedule tufts dental Medicine |summer 2016When advocacy and dentistry converge along a career path By ABDUL ABDULWAHEED, E97, D02 I grew up on stories of how my grandfather, an ethnic Pakistani living in China, served the American volunteer squadron of the Flying Tigers during World War II. Today, many in Kunming, where those aviators were based, reminisce about the doctor who stayed behind after the war for the sake of improving health care, one patient at a time. Inspired by my grandfather's pursuit of service through medicine, I aspire to improve access to care for the marginalized. However, I took the path of entrepreneurship to do more for many. It was at Tufts School of Dental Medicine where I developed the con - fidence to become a change agent. The residents of Boston's Chinatown neighborhood, which the school also calls home, face cultural, financial and political barriers to care. As an ethnic Chinese, Indian and Pakistani who speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin and Yunnanese, I understood the community and felt obligated to challenge the status quo. I founded the Boston Chinatown Outreach Initiative to screen, educate and provide referrals to thousands of patients. After graduation, I was a postdoctoral fellow/resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where I managed trauma vic - tims, gave clearance for organ transplants and treated cancer patients with orofacial pain. Then I took a different path. In 2006, I founded Lux Dental in Quincy, Massachusetts, a practice that would embody what I believe: We shall provide the highest standards of dental care to a needy segment of the population in a sustainable, responsible and profitable manner. The name is derived from Tufts' motto, Pax et Lux (peace and light). With $7 to my name, I took out a loan and recruited my girlfriend, LoAn Huynh, and best friend, Saeed Kashefi, to help me establish the business. We incorporated through LegalZoom, the cheapest option. We networked the computers, all three of them, and set up the only operatory. We bought all the furniture from a foreclosure. No one had a clue about how to handle insurance back then. Our \"patient spe - cial\" was the $1 exam. We promoted it by putting fliers on car windshields and moving a sandwich board around the neighborhood. Everyone who walked through the door was treated like fam - ily. By the end of the year, we had more than 5,000 active patients. There have been many struggles along the way\u2014managing staff, patients and different personalities has always been the most difficult. Yet nearly a decade later, the practice has expanded into Cambridge and Saugus, and there now are 12 dentists.My commitment to providing care to Medicaid and Medicare benefi-ciaries has remained firm, but the unstable nature of dental benefits from MassHealth, the commonwealth's Medicaid program, has been challeng - ing. The economic cycle determines what the state allocates for MassHealth dental benefits. Historically, these have ranged from providing near-compre - hensive coverage to just cleanings, exams and extractions. From the legislative perspective, dental care is seen as an option, not a right or even a need. As a clinician, I see firsthand the results of decisions made in the halls of government. Many of my patients have lost their dignity and their opportunity to find a job and live a normal life. My diagnosis was that legislators did not understand the value of oral health and that the public did not fight hard enough to ensure access to care. We have the responsibility to change this. With no experience in advocacy, but armed with a nice suit and tie, I headed to Beacon Hill in 2010 to speak on behalf of my patients. I was inef - fective. MassHealth dental benefits were eliminated completely for adults starting that year. In the years since, I have become a student of policy, serving on the Massachusetts Dental Society's Political Action Committee and Council on Public Affairs. Our profession and the MDS have had some success. Most recently, MassHealth has expanded coverage to include dentures and restorative treatment. I would like to see dental coverage for the elderly become an essential benefit, similar to the pediatric coverage included in the Affordable Care Act. Along with all of you, I aspire to do more.
