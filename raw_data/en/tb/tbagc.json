Now, in 2023, we are starting to really understand and appreciate the healing power our natural world offers. It's why natural retreats are more popular than ever. Consider an adventure into the forest to reconnect with [mindful meditation](https://bookretreats.com/s/meditation-retreats/mindfulness-retreats) at one of many nature retreats around the world. We know a [good website](https://bookretreats.com) for booking ;) Interested in a wellness retreat promising true healing nature? You can't do much better than [Volcano Hot Springs Yoga Center at the Blue River Hotel](https://bookretreats.com/center/blue-river-resort-hot-springs), an award-winning eco-resort offering the ultimate combination of relaxation, an abundance of nature, and eco-adventures. Look at all their retreat package offers: Located in the Sierra Nevada mountains east of San Francisco, this one-of-a-kind, private retreat is specially tailored to meet your individual needs.

I would definitely recommend it!\" Best of all this retreat is extremely affordable (starts at only $599) and available all year round! There are 50 states. That means 50 options of different geographical regions for frolicking adventure awaits. Especially when you visit a National Park. On the east coast, check out Acadia National Park in Maine. The camping, hiking trails and overall natural beauty of looking down on the Atlantic Ocean make for an outstanding experience at most places in Maine, from Mount Katahdin (the end of the famous Appalachian Trail that starts in Georgia) to Acadia National Park. Plus, while out forest bathing you just might see a moose doing some forest bathing on his/her own (because that's what a moose in Maine does most of the time). And then there's the Great Smoky Mountains or the Blue Ridge Mountains in the eastern U.S. From Pennsylvania down to North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia these great mountains cover a vast area. It's also a great region for visitors wanting a yoga retreat, meditation retreat, wellness retreat and, of course, camping and hiking to establish a deeper connection with the natural world. Ask a [traveling yogi](https://www.facebook.com/groups/yogiswhotravel) the best places for a wellness retreat in natural beauty somewhere in the U.S. and many will say you have to go west. There's a lot of truth to that. And visitors to the Grand Canyon would definitely agree. Some people say hiking up Colorado's Rocky Mountains make a Smoky Mountain hike feel like a stroll in rolling hills. Maybe you're looking for a silent meditation retreat in Oregon at a spiritual retreat center with vegetarian meals? Perhaps a luxury retreat in Montana with spa treatments is more your style? I say the U.S. is so diverse, there's amazing natural experiences for all tastes. And we haven't even mentioned spiritual California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains yet. Yoga retreat and meditation retreat participants love going to the San Francisco Bay Area. Southern California as well has upcoming retreats in natural beauty from San Diego to Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to Palm Springs. Bottom line, the U.S. has your retreat, your way. A cabin in the woods, red flannel and warm socks with a hot cup of tea. What comes to mind when you envision a stay at an eco-lodge in Canada? Explore accommodations from the banks of Pacific Coast Vancouver Island, glacial lakes in Alberta, and rigid trails of Ontario. And Canadians are SO nice. If you're looking to experience breathtaking views at every turn with like-minded participants then put Canada on your list. Did you know that a quarter of this rugged Central American country is covered by protected jungle? Home to 4% of the world's biodiversity you're bound to have a spiritual awakening in the jungle amongst monkeys, jaguars, tapirs, and iguanas. From the banks of the Pacific Coast to the blue waters of the Caribbean, Costa Rica is a nature junkies dream. Guests repel through jungle zip lines one day, jump off waterfalls the next, and snorkel next to sea turtles in their free time ;) You can't judge a book by its cover. The world's smallest continent has a wide variety of geography ranging from the lush, green peaks of the blue Mountains to red, desert sands of the Outback. Miles of white sand beach can also be found in the land down under accompanied by crystal clear water and of course, the Great Barrier Reef. Let's not forget the extreme biodiversity that comes with a stay with other like minded guests in the Daintree Rainforest. With so many activities available outside one place you're bound to return to daily life totally refreshed and renewed! Random, we know but this East African country is famous for its vast wilderness areas. Take a trip to safari wonderland Serengeti National Park and get up close and personal with elephants, lions, leopards, buffaloes, and rhinos (just to name a few). Maybe mountains are more your thing? Head to Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa's highest mountain. Just offshore lie the tropical islands of Zanzibar with their magical coral reefs and shark population. Head south, and we mean the southernmost tip of America. Patagonia is shared by Argentina and Chile using the Andes Mountains as a border. This southern bell has a split personality. While the Argentine side sports arid steppes, grasslands, and deserts, the Chilean side boasts glacial fjords and temperate rainforest. Imagine a hot tub gazing at Argentina's famed Monte Fitz Roy or meditating near Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park? True nature is medicine. Who doesn't love to fill their lungs with fresh air? **Cue songbirds and a cool gust of breeze. Nature retreats are for men, women, friend groups, couples, or just you to explore your inner Self while guided through activities, like meditation, in a natural environment. Go forest bathing, hiking, mountain climbing, or just take in panoramic views of any area outside! It's easy. Whether you're looking for an ocean vacation in the tropics or the spiritual healing of a Buddhist retreat up on a mountain, natural retreats are sweeping throughout the world to declutter, destress and reconnect with yourself. Connecting with nature has a huge positive effect on our mental health. This theory was tested and published in the Journal of Positive Psychology. Many of us spend the majority of our workday in an office, under fluorescent lighting only to scurry home to the comforts of blue light from our television screen. Here are just a few ways nature helps your brain. Meditating on a regular basis can help connect the left and right hemispheres of your brain, melding analytical and artistic thinking. Aside from aesthetics, being outside allows you to connect with the natural elements that surround you. Close your eyes. Envision swaying trees, hear flowing water, birds singing, and smell rich soil A little reminder there is far more to life than the walls of your cubicle or home. Subtle reminders are key for opening your thought process and can be very beneficial to your career, personal life, and day to day brain power. Once you open your mind to a new perspective a strange sense of connection may creep in. Let it! Mindfulness to the world around you, especially within nature, provides reality to how all is connected in the life cycle and promotes a warm feeling of wholeness. Even better? Science says people need to feel a connection with other people. Going for a hike alone is peaceful, but going for a hike with friends promotes a natural feeling of wellness through community and belonging. When was the last time you thought about nothing? Meditation acts as a buffer between being pulled into thoughts about the past and worries about the future. Without these thoughts what do you have to think about? Exactly. Meditating is made even easier with the soothing sounds of a raging river or the fresh scent of pine in the crisp mountain air. You can meditate in a variety of ways in nature, including walking, sitting, scent, sound, or visuals. It's safe to say we can all use a little more sleep. Being active helps to promote deeper sleep and when most of us are outside we're also being active. Hit biking trails, swim in hot springs, explore nature trails or maybe horseback riding. No matter what your go-to outdoor activities are getting your body moving in its natural element in key. Many of us spend the majority of our workday in an office, under fluorescent lighting only to scurry home to the comforts of blue light from our television screen. All that fake light can mess with circadian rhythms, which tell you when to sleep and when to be awake. Simply by being outside and immersing your body in natural light, those broken sleep-wake cycles can heal. Nature is neat. Let's [browse our benefits](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvfk70arkR9) so far: your mind is calm, you're sleeping better and feel a sense of connection to the world around you. Great! It's only natural that your focus and attention span start revving their engines. Once you learn to clear the unnecessary clutter and get your body's rhythm on track to enjoy your new superpowers: FOCUS. Try taking 30 minutes a day for an afternoon stroll, sit on a park bench, or people watch in the park. Researchers have found that those in the forest experience a decrease in both heart rate and cortisol levels compared to those in the city. Just being in nature without meditating has a de-stress effect on the body. But we recommend combining the two for optimal wellness. There have been major studies on the effect of green environments and mental illness. We're really excited about it \"Every green environment improved both self-esteem and mood,\" one analysis of 10 earlier studies about \"green exercise\" found. The same review indicated that \"the mentally ill had one of the greatest self-esteem improvements.\" Furthermore, water had an even MORE enhancing effect on their findings. Try it out yourself! A few more ways the healing power of being outdoorsy can make your life better are: increases memory, lowers blood pressure, heightens the mood, decreases the risk of cancer, reduces inflammation, eliminates fatigue, and enhancement of creativity and mindfulness.
