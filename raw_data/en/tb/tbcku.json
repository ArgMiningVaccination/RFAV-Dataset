Thirty primary care clinics, including Federally Qualified Health Centers, across Maryland will recruit 63 patients each (total=1,890). We will use patient and broad stakeholder engagement and apply principles of community -based participatory research to refine and adapt intervention protocols and materials to the needs of participating organizations, clinic sites, and po pulations. 2. 07/01/16 - 06/30/21 , Behavioral Research in Heart and Vascular Disease National Institutes of Health, NHLBI T32HL007180- 41A1 Total Direct Costs for year 1: $603,414 Principal Investigators: David M .
