The CARES Act allowed these credits for wages paid after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021. See [Notice 2021-20](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-20.pdf)PDF, [Notice 2021-49](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-49.pdf)PDF, and [Revenue Procedure 2021-33](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-21-33.pdf)PDF. - The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (Relief Act), enacted December 27, 2020, amended and extended the employee retention credit (and the availability of certain advance payments of the tax credits) under the CARES Act for the first and second calendar quarters of 2021. Like the credit for 2020 under the CARES Act, you can get immediate access to the credit by reducing the employment tax deposits you are otherwise required to make. If your employment tax deposits are not sufficient to cover the credit, you may be able to request an advance payment from the IRS. See [Notice 2021-23](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-23.pdf)PDF, [Notice 2021-49](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-49.pdf)PDF, and [Revenue Procedure 2021-33](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-21-33.pdf)PDF. - The ARP modified and extended the employee retention credit (and the availability of certain advance payments of the tax credits) for the third and fourth quarters of 2021, See [Notice 2021-49](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-49.pdf)PDF and [Revenue Procedure 2021-33](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-21-33.pdf)PDF for guidance on the third and fourth quarters of 2021. See [Notice 2021-24](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-21-24.pdf)PDF for guidance on the ability to reduce deposits and, in some cases, request advances for the employee retention credit through December 31, 2021. - Those who are still eligible to claim the credit, may want to see how the credit has changed since it was originally enacted by the CARES Act. The [Employee Retention Credit - 2020 vs 2021 Comparison Chart](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/employee-retention-credit-2020-vs-2021-comparison-chart)shows the eligibility requirements for when the credit was first enacted, then changed by the Relief Act and then the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
