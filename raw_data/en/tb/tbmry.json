Referral laboratory recommends that post-immunization specimen be collected 30 days after immunization. Pre-immunization sample is stored frozen for 90 days. If the post-immunization sample is received within 90 days, the pre and post immunization samples are submitted together for testing. If the post-immunization sample is not received within 90 days, the pre sample is removed from storage and submitted for testing. If the post-immunization sample is received within 90 days, the pre and post immunization samples are submitted together for testing. If the post-immunization sample is not received within 90 days, the pre sample is removed from storage and submitted for testing. Collection Medium: |Red top tube 5 mL (Clot Activator)| Minimum: Preferred Minimum: 1.0 mL serum in a red top tube Absolute Minimum: 0.2 mL serum in a red top tube Absolute Minimum: 0.2 mL serum in a red top tube Rejection Criteria: Plasma or other body fluids. Contaminated, hemolyzed, or severely lipemic specimens. Delivery Instructions: Submit specimen to laboratory as soon as possible after collection. Turn Around Time: 1-2 days upon receipt at reference laboratory Reference Range: Antibody concentration of > 0.1 IU/mL is usually considered protective. Interpretive Data: Responder status is determined according to the ratio of a one- month post-vaccination sample to pre-vaccination concentration of Tetanus IgG Abs as follows: 1. If the post-vaccination concentration is less than 1.0 IU, the patient is considered a nonresponder. 2. If the post-vaccination concentration is greater than or equal to 1.0 IU, a patient with a ratio of less than 1.5 is a nonresponder, a ratio of 1.5 to less than 3.0, a weak responder, and a ratio of 3.0 or greater, a good responder. 3. If the pre-vaccination concentration is greater than 1.0, it may be difficult to assess the response based on a ratio alone. A post-vaccination concentration above 2.5 IU in this case is usually adequate. Comments: Include patient immunization status (pre or post immunization) on requisition. Analysis includes both the Pre and Post status if paired specimens were submitted. Serum must be removed from cells as soon as possible after blood draw. Methodology: "}
