Even the body that regulates chiropractors in Ontario is worried. A group of chiropractors sees warning patients about the dangers of vaccinating their kids as part of their job. Martha Collins, a chiropractor in Kingston, Ontario, says chiropractors like her are family doctors for many of the patients they see. Dyan McKeown has brought her 18-month-old son for regular chiropractic treatment. She says it's improved his immune system. She sought information on whether to vaccinate her son against childhood diseases. \"Suddenly she flooded me with e-mails and web sites and things that I could go to, to get more information.\" Many of those recommended sources warned of serious harm from vaccinations. Sad stories where everything from autism to attention deficit disorder and epilepsy are all blamed on childhood vaccinations. Health Canada calls the warnings against vaccinations misleading. The entire Canadian medical establishment says the risk of a serious side effect from vaccination is extremely rare, compared to the risks from a severe bout of measles, whooping cough, diptheria or polio. These potentially deadly diseases have been re-emerging as the anti vaccination movement has spread across the United Kingdom, Russia, and Africa. Jason Busse, a licensed chiropractor who is going for his doctorate in epidemiology, wonders why chiropractors are giving advice on vaccinations. \"We're not taught to administer it or manage it in any clinical or managerial way. I don't understand why chiropractors feel they should be offering advice on this.\" In London, Ontario last year there were nine cases of pertussis, or whooping cough. At least one was a child who had not been vaccinated. The child's mother works for a chiropractor. Maryanne Simpson, the public health nurse who investigated the case, believes the chiropractor had an influence on the decision not to vaccinate. \"It's stepping across the line of practice in my mind. They need to be sure they're practicing within their scope.\" The debate has created a split among chiropractors. The Canadian Chiropractic Association maintains the anti-vaccination view is a small minority that is out of line. The College of Chiropractors of Ontario is proposing new rules banning chiropractors from advising patients on vaccinations at all. The college had planned to put the new rules to a vote next month. Now they say it's premature to discuss the issue publicly. "}
