For most of us, it is quite common to feel under the weather every once in a while. For a significant number of people, illness becomes a permanent part of life in the form of a seemingly incurable disease. It is natural and logical, therefore, that attention to healthcare is one of the most important aspects of any civilization. Through time, people have had at least some form of medical intervention prevalent in their society. In modern times, we are at the pinnacle of medical advancement and technology. Not only is the science behind diseases better known than ever, but treatment options are also multiple and elective. Today you have the option of choosing multiple factors, from the tests you have to undergo to the treatment you have to take. Conventional medicine, or allopathy, is not the only option anymore. You have the choice to go for so-called alternative treatments, like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and of course, Homeopathy. Side Effects of Allopathy As the side effects and complications of allopathic drugs become clearer and more evident than ever, more and more people now choose alternative methods of treatment. Allopathic drugs will, perhaps, always have the upper hand when it comes to emergency management, but we now live in the era of chronic diseases. Today, diseases have taken a more chronic, relapsing, and persistent course. In such cases, allopathy fails to provide a very satisfactory result, hence the turnover to natural methods of treatment. Over the years a significant shift has been seen in India towards homeopathy and other alternative medicines. As per reports, the number of people gravitating towards homeopathy will only rise in the coming years.

Few instantly come to mind, like the fact that side effects are minimal with homeopathy. This is true, as [homeopathic medicines](https://www.schwabeindia.com/) are typically prepared in such small doses that the chances of adverse reactions become virtually nil. There are no chemical reactions seen after taking homeopathic medications, and these remain safe for use even among infants. One of the principles of homeopathy is to treat the patient, not the disease. As illnesses become more complex, we frequently see multi-organ and multi-system disorders. In such cases, the allopathic protocol is to refer the patient to a specialist in each system. This makes the patient stuck in a pool of shifting from specialist to specialist every time a new symptom comes up. Such is not the case with homeopathy. A homeopath is well-qualified and equipped to treat cases involving multiple systems singularly. Homeopathic remedies have a wide sphere of action and the same remedy is capable of addressing all the symptoms of a patient, provided it is well selected. Therefore, the right homeopathic prescription obliterates the need for multiple specialists for different problems. This saves time, this saves money, saves taking ten different kinds of medicines, but most importantly, this saves the hassle of shifting between doctors. Another important factor in favor of homeopathy which is often overlooked is that it has a vast arsenal of medicines capable of acting on almost all parts and systems of the body. Barring emergency cases, homeopathy can impact virtually any symptom of a patient. Homeopathic remedies act on the brain, the connective tissues, the skin, the vital organs, the digestion, the emotional sphere, and on many more systems. It is also not merely limited to chronic cases, contrary to popular belief. Even acute cases show good response to homeopathic drugs provided an accurate prescription has been made. Be it fevers, pains, colds and coughs, or even infections, homeopathy can lead to rapid resolution of symptoms. That too without leading to any gastric upsets or aphthae etc. that allopathic medications often cause. Another advantage that homeopathy has over allopathy, and indeed other systems, is the simplicity of administration. Homeopathic medicines are generally dispensed in the form of sweet pills, and these pills make homeopathy a favorite among children (and even adults). However, there are methods of dispensing homeopathic remedies that remain just as easy. Water doses are often prescribed, and sometimes doses in the form of powder may be taken. These are all relatively easy to take for young and old alike. This is in stark contrast to the tablets, syrups and even injections given by allopathic physicians in terms of administration, taste, or effects. It is no surprise to anyone that the side effects of these may be serious, or make the patient uncomfortable for quite some time. Even Ayurvedic or Unani remedies have very complicated administration methods.

If you have ever been to a classic homeopathic physician you know that their case-taking is a lot more than merely noting your presenting complaints. In fact, that is just the beginning of a series of enquiries made by the doctor. The homeopath scrutinizes your clinical history, the causation behind your complaints, the factors modifying your symptoms and precisely what kind of symptoms you have, and then moves on to your past medical history. After that come the questions about your preferences regarding food and weather, your general processes like digestion and sleep, and then, the emotional factors. For a homeopath taking the mental picture of a patient and understanding a patient's personality is imperative. This is because homeopathy believes that the mind rules the body, and almost all diseases come from a restless mind. Therefore, emotional factors like anxiety, apprehension, fears, sadness, loneliness, anger, and many more are all elaborated upon to hit the major reason why the disease is presented in the first place. This attention to the mental symptoms and treatment in accordance with a person's unique characteristics gives homeopathy an edge and delivers crisper, sharper, and longer-lasting results. Healing the mind heals the body. Why People are choosing Homeopathy over allopathy? For people suffering from chronic diseases who do not prefer to continue allopathic medications or newly diagnosed people who do not wish to start a perpetual cycle of allopathic drugs, homeopathy comes as a gift. Today, there is no lack of qualified homeopathic physicians in India who combine modern diagnostic tools with proven homeopathic remedies to deliver the best results. Also, genuine and original remedies are available in the country and easily accessible. It is advised that you begin any medication only after thorough consultation with a registered homeopath. Not only does a visit to the doctor exclude any serious condition you may have lurking inside, but you also get advice about the management of a condition with diet and lifestyle changes. The doctor can also advise you about the best dosage and repetition of a remedy so that you could get the maximum benefit out of it. Self-medication often turns out to be more harmful than good.
