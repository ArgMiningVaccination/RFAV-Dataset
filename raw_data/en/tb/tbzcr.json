Processing of Chinese medicines with liquid excipients is a pharmaceutical technique that transforms medicinal raw materials into decoction pieces which are significantly different from the original form. During processing, significant changes occur in chemical constituents, which inevitably affects clinical efficacy. At present, the liquid materials in processing mainly involve wine, vinegar, honey, saline water, ginger juice, herbal juice, etc. Objective: This review introduces the typical methods of liquid excipients processing, summarizes the influence on chemical composition, pharmacological efficacy, and expounds the ways and mechanisms of liquid excipients to change the properties of drugs, enhance the efficacy, eliminate or reduce toxicity and adverse reaction. Methods: English and Chinese literature from 1986 to 2020 was collected from databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015, and CNKI (Chinese). Liquid excipients, processing, pharmacological effects, synergism, chemical constitution, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were used as the key words. Results: Liquid excipients play a key role in the application of TCM. Processing with proper liquid excipients can change the content of toxic or active components by physical or chemical transformation, decrease or increase drug dissolution, alter drug pharmacokinetics, or exert their own pharmacological effects. Thus, processing with liquid excipients is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of TCM in clinic. Conclusion: This article could be helpful for researchers who are interested in traditional Chinese herbs processed with liquid excipients.
