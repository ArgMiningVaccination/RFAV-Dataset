One of the most fundamental parameters characterizing a macromolecule-whether it be naturally occurring or syntheticallyMolecul ar W ei ght D ete r m i natio n produced-is its 'molecular weight' or 'relative molecular mass,.The former term is preferred when the parameter is used in a thermo-dynamic sense since it is not a dimensionless quantity but hasdefined units: g/mol in the c.g.s. system. Despite ln. runaamentalnature this parameter, for certain classes of macromolecules- including polysaccharides-it has proved very difficult to determine.In the case of polysaccharides this is principally because of fourbasic properties: (a) They are polydisperse, that is consist of species of differentmolecular weight (b) They are highly non-ideal in the thermodynamic sense. Thishigh non-ideality can arise from two sources: (i) high thermo-dynamic exclusion volumes resulting from laige u-rry--.try or high solvent affinity and (ii) polyelectrolyte behaviour.(c) unlike globular proteins they can have a conformation in solu-tion that is difficult to define or determine with any precision. This can seriously affect the accuracy of those techniques which require assumptions to be made about the confo.-uiion in solution for obtaining molecular weights. (d) A further complication is that some polysaccharides self-associate, particularly at higher solute concentrations. Indeed, it is fair to say that a single determination of an averagemolecular weight or even more so, a molecular weight distribution,of any new polysaccharide preparation can still require a researchproject of some difficulty and duration. These difficulties are unfor-tunate since knowledge of the morecular weights of polysaccharides is in general of fundamental importance foi the und.irtunding oftheir biotechnological applications and rheir role in living ,yrtl.*,as we know them today. Such knowledge is important also in alarge number of medical and commerciar applications Il] as detailedin the following paragraphs. Application in the food industry. The performance of pectins andalginates as gelling and thickening agents is diminished by thepresence of 'low molecular weight tails' in the molecular weightdistribution (see, e.g. Launay et al. tzl). Another example of the iailwagging the dog is the current concern of possible toxicity of lowmolecular weight forms of carrageenan (see, e.g. Engiter and Abraham [3]]-this product has been banned trom food products in certain countries.66 S. E. HARDTNC er a/. The oil industry. polysaccharides have lound their way into theoil industry mainly as additives ro drilling muds-to pr.u.nt fluidloss, for suspending particres and for rheorogicar contror-andas additives to injected fluids for mobility control to improvesweep efficiency in flooding operations. The Lffectiveness of u'porv_saccharide for mobility control is to a large extent determined iy itsmolecular weight [4]. Pharmaceutical apprications. polysaccharides are increasinglybeing used in drug delivery systems, both as carrier systems for(intravenous) drug targetting is1, for increasing the transit time ofnovel dosage forms in the small intestine to] ana controlled releaseforms [7]. In all three cases the perfor.un.. of the delive$yr*-is closely related to the transport properties of the carrieruvr,.rnwhich depends. amongst other factors, on the molecular *\"iiht ofpolysaccharide vaccines [g]. . .Medical applications. hyaiuronic acii, ro having some ipecific physiological prop.rti.,depending on the chemicar structure of the polymer, confinewithin a narrow set of values for physical properties like osmoticpressure, viscosity, gel or fibre properties, eic.;^all properties criti_cally dependent on molecular weight and molecular *.iglrt distri_butions. The specific medical response may also be molecularweight dependent as suggested for the immune stimulatory effeci ofschizophyllan where the existence of the triple helix, ,tubl. onlyabove a certain molecular weight, is the basis for the immuneresponse [9]. Biological significance of molecular weight. Hyaluronic acid,which is a major constituent of the synoviai-Ruia in all our joints,is responsible for the rheological contiol of such fluids. It is remark-able that the friction coefficient in our knees is lower than that ofmost man made machines [10]. Both the molecular weight and theconcentration level of hyaluronic acid is crucial for [10]. As the viscoelastic properries are strongrydependent the molecular weight in the concentration .urg.found in synovial fluids (2.2-2.img/ml). changes in molecularweight strongly affect the rheological froperries and thereby lubri_cation properties of such fluids.Molecular Weight Determination The perforrnance of polysaccharides in other applications is alsoinfluenced by their molecular weights. For example, in the woodpulp/paper industry there has been an extensive literature on thedetermination of molecular weight distributions of cellulose andcellulose derivatives, largely using gel permeation chromatography F ll. other examples include the performance of polysacchar-ides in shampoo il2], paint U3] and wine. There are now several techniques-some independent, some not-at our disposal for polysaccharide molecular weight analysis and in Table 1 we have cited the mostimportant of these. They have been classified into either 'absolute', 'relative' or 'combined'. Absolute techniques such'as membrane osmometry, 'static' light scattering or sedimentation equilibrium require no assumptions about macromolecular conformation anddo not require calibration using standards of known molecular weight. Relative techniques, such as gel permeation chromatography, sedimentation velocity, dynamic light scattering and visco*.try or pullulans). Absolute molecular weights can also be obtained by combining information from twoor more 'relative' techniques, for example sedimentation velocity with dynamic light scattering (diffusion coefficient) measurements(Svedberg equation-see, Tanford viscosity (Scheraga-Mandelkern equation il4-l6l) although the latter still requires the use of u pu.u-.ter (p) which is taken for the purpose of molecular weight measurement asinsensitive to shape. off-line and on-line combined approaches for obtaining absolutemolecular weight distributions directly and moleculir weightaverages indirectly, from conservation-of-mass type calculationsbased on the form of these calculated distributions, are becomingincreasingly popular (Table r ) and these are based on either one oftwo relative techniques: gel permeation chromatography (Gpc) or aparticular type technique as sedi-mentation field flow fractionation (sFFF). An absolute molecularweight method is used to give either off-line calibration VYVc .; qJ c L < rmination calibration curve)] or on-line calibration of sFFF (using a light scattering detector). It is the primary intention of this review to alert both academics and industrialists alike to the principal techniques available for thedetermination of polysaccharide molecular weights, and to identify the possibilities and limitations of them; their limitations havesometimes been overlooked in the recent literature. It is not thepurpose of this article to give a treatise on the theoretical orexperimental details of the techniques: such treatments can befound in the many standard texts and reviews identified in theindividual techniques considered in turn below. It would be instruc- tive first, however, to define the problem in terms of heterogeneity, polydispersity and thermodynamic non-ideality. 2. WHY DIFFICULT? Heterogeneity and polydispersity Polysaccharides are heterogeneous substances. By heterogeneity we mean any deviation from single molecular weight behaviour ofa polysaccharide preparation no matter what the cause of the vari-ation may be (Fig. I tlTl). (Definitions of rhe terms .heterogenity, and 'polydispersity' vary in the literature: thus our u., herediffers from that of Gibbons tl7l.) one contribution will be from 'polydispersity', i.e. the presence of non-interacting components ofdifferent molecular weight or composition. This can arise fromtwo causes: a quasi-continuous variation in ('secondary latter applies to polysaccharide preparations containing mixtures of polysaccharides. A secondcontribution to sample heterogeneity can arise from potential self-association phenomena e.g. with guar Ilg].The molecular weight heterogeneity of polysaccharides canbe described by several types of averag. weight. molecular weight averages are: number average, z-average. For an ensemble of macromolecules with n,70 llSu.re t Types [)iscrete mixture. Adapted .from nef. ttil. components whose molecular weights are M, and, whose concen_trations are ci, the number, Lr,M, Alternatively, these principal averages can be expressed in terms ofthe general formulation, where k is an integer fl9]: non-integer k to inciuoeS- E.

In Table I we identify what principal averages the varioustechniques can provide. For example membrane osmometry is acolligative property, i.e. a function of the-numbers of molecules,whereas sedimentation equilibrium and light scattering giveaverages that are principally dependent on th. weight .ln..n_trations of the components and hence yield weight av\"erages. Therelative techniques provide a type of mo-lecular wiight on the conformation adopted by the insolution. Table I also shows that potential moleculaiweight resolu-tion depends on the conformation and the particular relativetechnique chosen: The stronger the molecular weight dependence ofthe observed property, the better the resolving power. This shouldbe taken into account when selecting a rerative\"method to determinemolecular weight. Polydispersities are in many cases reported as the ratios /on = Y:!Y\": o,t /o*. : M,lMn, and are often referred to as .potyiis- perstty rndeces' by commercial manufacturers of polysa\".iruria.r.Their values can be obtained as estimates from Gpc or fromabsolute methods for determination of molecular weights. Theseratios might shed some light on the rype of molecrilar weightdistribution, i.e. /on t /0,,, ior a nonnal distribution. The ratiosprovide a useful rule of thumb as to whether the material is 'polydisperse' (Ie > 1.6) or nearly monodisperse (Ie < l. I ), butshould never be substituted for the characteiization of the wholemolecular weight distribution. For polysaccharides that are copolymers or form mixtures cifpolysaccharides some caution is advised when interpreting ultra-centrifuge or (static) light scatrering data. This i; beciuse ofpossible polydispersity in the partial specific volume (ultracentrifu-gation) or specific refractive increment (light scattering) both corre-sponding to variations in compositton if a given polysaccharidepreparation.S. E. HARDTNC er a/. 2.2 Thermodynamic Non-ideatity one distinguishing feature of polysaccharides when comparedwith relatively well behaved macromolecules such as manyproteins is that they are very non-ideal in the thermodynamicsense because of their large exclusion volumes and in ,nuny caseshigh charge. Since physical measuremenrs on polysaccharides haveto be made at a finite concentration, there *itt u. a contributionfrom these effects. For example the expression for the osmoticpressure of a solution, correct to first order in the virial coefficientexpansion, is [20]: fllc:[RflM\"l(t+BM^c)(2.6) where ^B is Equation is normallyadequate for polysaccharide solutions of ,on..ntrations less thanl0_mgiml, except in extreme cases. Although the equation hererefers specifically to osmotic pressure, other similar relations existfor other solution physical measurements, notably static light scat-tering (section 4.1) and sedimenration equilibrium lSectiJn s.ty.Expected ranges of values for the thermodynamic secondvirial coefficient, B, for various polysaccharide-solvent systemsare given in Table z. rn Table 3 [2]-31] we have compared thenon-ideality parameters, B and BM for several polysacchar-ides and also included (to demonstrate the orderu oi *ugnitudeinvolved) values for a protein (haemoglobin) and a hypoiheticalunhydrated spherical particle. we have also given -values forthe term | + BMc for a weight concentration ic) of 0.4 mg/mr:this term (l + BMc) represenrs the factor by which the appfrentmolecular weight is diminished compared with the ideai value.(For sedimentation equilibrium and tight scattering the correctionfactor is - I -F 2BMc.)

The reader is referred to Tanford [14]for a more detailed discussion of the variation of the second virial coefficient with the shape and molecular weight of a macro- molecule. 2.3 Concentration Measurement Determination of weight concentrations precisely is not easy for polysaccharides, and this is not always appreciated in the literature: one of the principal contributors to data error is error in concen- tration. Errors can largely be minimized in sedimentation velocity. or diffusion coefficient determinations through 'serial dilution' extrapolations to zero concentration, but will affect the evaluation of partial specific volumes (from the slope of plots of density versus concentration), refractive index increments (from the slope of refractive index versus concentration), static light scattering plots and also evaluations of intrinsic viscosities.74 S. E. HARDTNC er a/. Because mosr polysaccharides do not absorb in (usable) UV,concentrations are freq uently determined refractometricaily [29], orby for polyuronides t32]). However, all these methods requirecalibration at some stage using a dry-weight type of evaluation.Correction for moisture conteni in poiysacJhariae samples i, -ortfrequently done by drying the sample in an exicator until a constanrweight is achieved- It is, however, a problem that such samples maybe strongly hygroscopic. one alternative is to determine the amounrof carbon in the sampre by means of an elemental analyser andconvert that data to polysaccharide concentration. In ourtpinion,whatever method is used concentrations can be measured to nobetter than + 3-5oA.A given determination of the molecular weightfor a polysaccharide preparation has therefore, for most of thetechniques, a rather large uncertainty associated with it due to theuncertainty in the concentration deteimination. This should arwaysbe recognized when evaluating a molecurar *.ighi. 3. OSMOSTS osmotic pressure measurements are relatively easy to make and,provided care is taken to obtain reliable values, the results can beinterpreted with reratively high confidence. The method is the majortechnique for determining the number-average molecular weilht(M,) of polysaccharides, together with end\"-group analysis. Inaddition to determination ol the Mn, the *.ihod^ also providesestimation of the osmotic second viriai coefficient, which may yieldinformation on the shape, the net charge and possible interactionsbetween the macromolecules. However, the relatively low sensitivityof the method to high molecular weight polysaciharides, as theosmotic pressure at high dilution is sensitivl onty to the number ofparticles in the solution, will in practice limit its use to polysac-charides with molecular weights of less than 500 000. There is alsoa lower limit of molecular weight that can be determinea uy irrismethod, which is related to th; type of membrane which is used.The principal requirement for reliable molecular weight determi-nation by osmosis is that the membrane is impermeable to themacromolecules of the lowest molecular weight in the sample.Molecular Weight Determination 3.1 Ceneral Background The distribution of diffusible molecules across a semipermeablemembrane is governed by the requirement that theii chemicalpotential is equal on both sides of the membrane. We will treat thetheory of osmotic pressure for neutral and charged polysaccharides separately. For a more detailed treatment of the thiory, the readeris referred to Neutra/ a situation where the porysaccharide solution is placedon one side of a semipermeable membrane, which is not permeable to the polysaccharide (Fig. z). The polymer will ,.d,r\". thechemical potential of its solvent and, bicause it cannot passthrough the membrane, the solvent molecules will tend to .diiute' the polysaccharide solution by flowing through the membrane fromthe solvent side until the chemical pot-ntial for the diffusible solventmolecules is equal on both sides of the membrane. The initialdifference in chemical potential for the solvent over the membranewill be compensated for by a build up of the osmotic pressure, fI.In dilute solutions (see, e.g. Tanford U4l), it can be-shown thatthe osmotic pressure is related to the wiight concentration ofpolysaccharide, c, through the equation fI : RZ(clM, + Be * Cc3 +...)

T-he slope of such agraph provides a value of the second virial coefficien t. B. 3.1.2 Charged polysaccharides polyelectrolytes) An important effect caused by charged polysaccharides is thedistribution of small ions across the r.*ip..-.lut. membrane. Inaddition to the requirement of identical ciremical potential at bothsides of the membrane for the diffusible salt, the presence of thepolyelectrolyte also adds the zero net electrical charge requirementto the equilibrium situation. polysaccharides are very oftencharged, and are accompanied by thlir corresponding neutralizingcounter-ions, but the number of charges can uu.y from one (or evenmore) per monosaccharide unit to only a few.ir\".g., per polymermolecule. we will treat the polyelectrolytes with and withoui th.presence of a salt that can diffuse through the semipermeablemembrane.Molecular Weight Determination Figure 4. schematic polyelectrotyte with positive charges. without salt. we will consider a polycation, a positively chargedpolysaccharide (Fig. 4). The results will be urrulogou, fo, polv-anions for the co-ions (salt-ion with the same charle as the porv-saccharide) and for the counter-ion charge of the polysaccharide).(salt-ions with the opposite when such a polycation dissolves in water, the counterions willdissociate according to the equation: Pol X- : Pol'+ * zX- (3.3) where Pol is the polymer molecure (with z positive charges) andX is the counterion. Each polymer molecule will disso\"Lt. into(1 + z) particles. The counterions will not diffuse freely across themembrane, but are kept at the polymer side of the- membranebecause of the zero net electrical charge requirement. From (3.2) weget (when c --+ Q); TIlc : RTIM^ * zRTIM^ where RTIM^ is the contribution from the polymer molecule andzRTIM^ from the counterions. obviously, uni.r, z is accuratelyknown, the molecular weight cannot be determined, and osmoticpressure measurements are not suited for determination of molecularweights of polyelectrolytes in salt-free aqueous solutions. Even verylow and sometimes unexpected and unknown amounts of chargeson polymers may obscure completely molecular weight determi-nation if performed without salt. An example is given ii rig. s I)ql,where the osmotic pressure of a (l-3)(F0-0-o-glucan from oat isgiven as a function of concentration. This polysaccharide wasbelieved to be a neutral polymer, and the osmotic pressure measure-ments were first performed in distilled water. As can be seen from theupper curve in Fig. 5, the reduced osmotic pressure (fl/c) increases asthe polymer concentration decreases. However, the method mav ,.17B5. E.

This is due to the well-known counterion condensation effecroccuring above a critical value of charge density ofthe polyelectrolyte [35, 36]. with salt(Donnan equilibrium). we will now treat the equilibriumin the osmometer with the presence of a freely B*X- addition s.

The result from the differ_ence in concentration for co-ions (in this example B+ ) thea is: G(a) -Cr(F) - -zC,(a)C'(u)emret(3.6) where cr(a) is the molar polymer concentration on the a side, cs@)the molar concentration of B on the a side and so on. In Eq. (3.6)it is assumed that all the counterions on the huu.dissociated, yielding a contribution zco(a) to ih. \"on\".ntration ofcounterions. As discussed earlier, only a fraction (o) of the counter-ions may be dissociated, and reduce the contribution from thecounterions to oz. In any case, this expression will always benegative, so the conclusion is that the co-ions are partially ,riludrdfrom the polymer side. The analagous expression for counterions is: C*(a) - Cx6) : shows that counter-ions are concentrated onthe polymerside. The conclusion is anaragous when dealing with potyunionr.co-ions, which are now x-, are partially excluded from thepolymer side, and the counterions, which u.. no* 8\", will beconcentrated on the polymer side.5. E. HARDINC er a/. The Donnan effect will also contribute to the second virial coef-ficient, which we will now discuss in some detail. In the presence o[ a salt, it can be shown that the osmotic pressure is proportional to the sum of the differences of the molar concentrations of allparticles presenr at equilibrium [14]: tI : R?\"{C,(a) + tcr(a) - G(B)l + [c*(a) - c*(B)]] (3.8) where the symbols are as in (3.6). combining (3.6), (3.7) and (3.g)gives: fr:Rr @l (7. r{cnta)+ffi+c*(ilJ \\-.e) In most practical situations, the salt concentration is much larger than the polymer concentration, which implies that c, (oi: Cr(f) - substituting the concentration (c) instead of the molarconcentrations (C), we get: (3.1 r) By comparing Eq. (3.1 l) with Eq. (3.2), the second virial coefficient can be identified as z2l4MlG*, which is called the ideal Donnan contribution. The observed virial coefficient is: Bour: BDonn\"n*Bn.ut,\"t l2) where \"utor is the contribution from the excruded volume effect for a neutral polysaccharide, as discussed in Section 2. when determining osmotic pressures on polyelectrolytes experi- mentally, an ionic strength of 0.1 is sufficient to suppress the effect of the charge on the apparent molecular weight, but the Donnan contribution to the second virial coefficient will generally dominate over the excluded volume effect at this salt concentration. Returning now to Fig. 5, the lower curve shows the normal behaviour of the reduced osmotic pressure as a function of polymer concentration. The solvent here was I M LiI. Another example of the precautions that need to be taken when determining molecular weights of polysaccharides by osmometry has been demonstrated by Fishm an et at.l3sj.

STATIC LIGHT SCATTERINC This method is arso known as 'crassicar light scattering, and .total intensity light scattering', but we prefer static right sca\"ttering as itoffers a clear distinction from the differenr teclinique of Jviumi\" ligh, scattering (section 6.3). when a solurion of macromolecules isilluminated with a beam of light at wavelength ,r, the poryme,chains will scatter right in direct proportion to their weight-averagemolecular mass (M*) and, mor.ou.{ the angular depenJence of thescattered light at low angles can be related Jirectly io the z-averageof the'radius of gyration'(Ro).

The main experimental difficulty ofthe method is the demand for high quality roiuii.n,lree of dust andaggregates. 4.1 General Background 4.1.1 Light scattering f rom solutions of Smalt Macromo/ecuies(R\" ' 1120) In l87l Lord Rayleigh published [a3] the theory of the scarteringof light by free and independent ,oouirrg gaseous particles muchsmaller than rhe wavelength of right. we witt-only givl the equationsfor the excess scattering of the pJy.., molecules, where the solventscattering is subtracted out. For a more detailed treatment of thetheory, the reader is referred to Tanford [14] or Kratochv n v4l.Molecular Weight Determination For a small particle (Rc < 1lz0) in the limit of infinite dilurion, it can be shown that the ratio of the intensities between unpolarized incident light (1) and scattered light (/,) is:B3 where no is the refractive index of the solvent, dnldc is the specific refractive increment of the solute-solvent system, g is the angle of observation, No is the Avogadro numbet, Mnis the weight-au..ug, molecular weight of the solute, ,t is the wavelength of iniident tight and r is the distance between the sample and the detector. If vertically polarized light is used the ir + cos2g) term is not required. The specific refractive increment (dnld,c)is a characteristic of a polymer-solvent system at a given temperature, and can be experimentally determined in a differential refractometer, or in many cases it can be found in the literature fa5l. Equation (4.1) can be rearranged:IlI. : 2n2ni(dnldc)'(l + cos2g) ^., NTcM* (rtr,) #o:1ry],r_(4.1) (4.2) (4.3)The term in brackets on the right-hand side turns out to be a constant (K) for a particular solute-solvent system. and the left- hand side is called the Rayleigh ratio (Rr), which can be evaluated in absolute terms, simplifying Eq. (4.2) to Ro : KcMn or KclRs : llM* which is valid for an ideal solution. At this point it is necessary to say something about the scattering of light in a crystal, in an ideal gas and in a pure liquid. A perfect, infinitely large, crystal does not scatter right at all, but real crystals scatter light due to the occurence of crystal lattice defects. The intensity of light scattered by a unit volume of an ideal gas (highly diluted) is directly proportional to the number of molecutes inlhis volume. Pure liquids scatter light substantially less than the same number of molecules in the gaseous state but more than a real crystal. The reason for this is that in a real solution it will be fluctu- ations in the number of particles in a volume element which give rise to fluctuations in the density of the liquid and therefore also the refractive index.84 S. E. HARDINC er a/. Returning to a sorution, where we will again only consider theexcess scattering from the solute molecules, it can be shown that theintensity of the scattered light is related to the increase of theosmotic pressure with concentration (dfl/dc) [a6]: Ro : * 2Bc ^B is second viriar coefficient and c the third virial coef-ficient. By analogy with osmometry, we need only to *ZBc This equation is the molecular weight and thesecond virial coefficient for polysaccharides where no- is smallerthan 1120. If, for example, ,i : 500 nm it means Ro has to be lessthan 25 Rc A/2) The equations considered so far are only varid for polysaccharideswith Ro less than i120. For larger molecules there wilr be more thanone point in each molecule that will scatter light, making theangular dependence more complex. The effect can be visualizedwhen observing a beam of sunshine in a dusty room. The dustparticles are much easier to see when the obseru.i i.looking againstthe sun compared to tooking away from it. The reason is that thelarge dust particles scatter more light forward (small angles) thanbackward (large angles).

Theintensity of the scattered light as a function of the scatteringangle [which is -called the particle scartering function p(g)] iordifferent types of molecules will not be considered here, burcan befound elsewhere [14, 441. An important conclusion from these calculations is that atlow scattering angles and low polymer concentrations, the dimen-sions of the molecules can bi calculated as a z-average of theradius of gyration, without any assumptions about the shape ofMolecular Weight Determination I I\\ \\ t---- - \\--\\-/ Figuy.B.

(4.6) can be modified to (dilute solutions): KclRs : UIP(0)101M* +2Bc) The particle scattering function tp(0)l can be shown to be: | | lz185 & angles. Combining Eq. (4.7) with (4.S) we get KclR6 : [l + 2Bc) (4.9) The validity of Eqs. (4.7)-(4.9) depends on there being no signifi- cant changes of phase or other distortions of the incident electric vector induced by the particle. This is known as the ,Rayleigh- Gans-Debye' criterion (see, e.g. ref. M), and is generally satisfied for polysaccharides of M S Z0 x 106. Now, since Eq. (a.9) is only valid at high dilution and low scattering angles, it is necessary to extrapolate data at each angle to zero concentration before the radius of gyration can be calculated, and to extrapolate the data at each concentration to zero angle to calculate the molecular weight and the second virial coefficient. fnis is most conveniently done in a Zimm plot where KclR, is plotted against sin21F.p1 * kc, where k is an arbitrary constant (positive or negative) which is used to spread the data on the graph. Therefore, in a light scattering experiment the scattering from a number of concentrations of polysaccharide is measured at different angles. Figure 9 shows a schematic drawing of a light scattering photomiter.B65. E. HARDINC er a/. LASE R Figure 9. Schematic diagram of apparatus for (static) light scattering measurements. Equation (4.9) is the basis for the conventional way of presenting light scattering data, the Zimm plot [47], which uses biaiial extra-polation. An example (Dextran T-500) is shown in Fig. 10. points with constant c !: tr) are extrapolated to g : 0, which is the abcissavalue where sinz10lZ1: 0, i.e. kcr,. points with constant g(: 0..) areextrapolated to c : 0, which is the abcissa value rn. iin., COMPUTERMolecular Weight Dete rmination87 for zero concentration and zero angle are then extraporated to thesame ordinate value, which equals rlM*. The slope of the zeroconcenrrarion line equals (l I M*)(16n2 RL Bl), and the slope of thezero angle line equals 28lk, thus providing estimates of the radiusof gyration and the second virial coefficient. As mentioned above, optically clear solutions are required forlight scattering experiments. An example of the extreme caution\"\"r_d:g in interpreting light scattering data is provided by smidsrsdand Haug [48]. They investigated fiItered aiginate solutions andobtained reasonable for both the moleiular weight and theradius of gyration. However, the small negative value obtained forthe second virial coefficient made the authors suspicious, as alginateis a highly charged polyelectroryte. centrifugation of the solutionsshowed that the second virial coefficient increased markedly withthe time of centrifugation. The authors were also able to isolate theimpurity that had caused the anomalities. The work clearly demon- *ratgs the importance of the clarification procedure and the needfor skilled experimentalists. 4.2 Polyelectrolytes In general, the light scattering theory is valid for polyelectrolytesif neutral salts are added to the system as in osmometry. However,some precautions specific to the light scattering system should betaken. when determining dn/dc (the specific relractive increment)for a polyelectrolyte this should be done in the same sart system asuled in the light scattering experiments. Moreover, measurementsof the difference in refractive index of the polyelectrolyte and thesolvent should be carried out at constant chemical potential ofboth the polyelectrolyte and the salt molecules. This means that thepolyelectrolyte solutions must be extensively dialysed againstthe solvent containing the salt molecules p.ior to refractiveindex measurements [49, 50]. As in osmometry, molecular weightscannot be determined at very low salt conlentrations, but fora completely different reason. At very low salt concentrations(below 7: 0.01) polyelectrorytes may shlw liquid crystal behaviouror correlated molecular movements even at extremely low poly-electrolyte concentration [51]. This will violate the basic urru*p-tions made by Rayleigh about free and independent movement ofthe particles.S. E. HARDINC et al. 43 Clarification of Solutions Light scattering methods were described by Flory [52] to be painstaking and the work needed for obtaining clean solutions cannot be overestimated. Even traces of dust and/or aggregates may lead to incorrect estimates of the molecular weight, as light scattering yields the weight average M*. A more detailed procedure for clarification and preparation of polymer solutions is given by Tabor [53]. We will here propose a rather simple and general procedure for preparation of polysaccharide solutions. 4.3.1 ultrafiltration A large variety of membrane filters with well-defined pore-sizes are commercially available. we recornmend the following sequence of pore sizes to be used in series: 1.4,0.8,0.4 and 0.2 pm. Depending on the size of the polysaccharide under investigation, the upper or lower pore size may be excluded. Disposable filters are practical, but also more expensive. It is also important that the light scattering cells are free of dust. This may conveniently be done by flushing the cells with air filtered through a 0.2pm filter. The dust free cells are then covered with Parafilm, and the polysaccharide solution may then be filtered directly into the cell through the Parafilm by the use of a needle. The solution in the light scattering cell is then covered with another layer of Parafilm. 4.3.2 Ultracentrifugation It is necessary to use high speed centrifugation if the solutions after ultrafiltration contain aggregates. Caution must be taken to ensure that the individual polysaccharide molecules do not sediment together with aggregates and dust, as this technique is also used for sedimentation analysis of polysaccharides (Section 5). Dependent on the particular polymer-solvent system under investi- gation, centrifugation times between 30 min and 4-5 h are needed and a centrifugal force of at least 30 000 g shouid be used. For the removal of all aggregates, up to 300 000 g may be necessarv. The best option is if the solutions can be ultracentrifuged directly in the light scattering cells. If mechanical shocks are avoided, the dust and aggregates can be retained at the bottom of the cell duringI 1: ; E tl r- S c) cO Or or ro - O + 6 - + F_rn .n O rn N r F O ot r O O .fc! dS = +r + +r SS o>' ;T go U (o vl oo C t,) (nc'u o (! o o- the time it takes to collect the light scattering data. Alternatively, if the necessary precautions are taken, the solutions may be trans- ferred from the centrifuge cell to the light scattering cell. but it is then recommended that this is done in a dust-free environment, e.g. a sterile bench where the air is filtered through a 0.2pm filter. 4.4 Recent Developments and Applications Most modern light scattering experiments are performed using a laser as the light source. Indeed it is fair to say that the advent of the laser has provided a major stimulus to the light scattering technique over the last 10-15 years. The properties of high intensity, collimation and monochromaticity were immediately recognized as advantageous in improving the quality of the angular intensity envelope. The additional property of coherence gave rise to the new technique of dynamic light scattering, and the consequences of this in the context of polysaccharide molecular weights is discussed in Section 6.3. Commercial instruments, although. principally designed for dynamic light scattering, can also be used as a static device provided that the appropriate calibration checks and realign- ments are made Examples from the literature of polysaccharide molecular weights determined by SLS are numerous. Table 5 154-571gives only a selection and contains values from various instruments. Where serious disagreement with other techniques (yielding M*) occurs, it is normally associated with problems of clarification of solutions with the former technique (see, e.g. Smidsrsd and Haug t48D.Our view is that light scattering should not, where possible, be used in isolation but in conjugation with other techniques. s. SEDIMENTATION EQUIUBRIUM If polysaccharides are the 'Cinderella molecules' personal communication) then sedimentation equili- brium is the Cinderalla technique. It is flair to say that there is less than a handful of operators actively engaged in applying the tech- nique to polysaccharide analysis. Indeed the same is true for all other classes of macromolecule, both naturally occurring andfrftr$Molecular Weight Determination synthetic, and indeed for other types of analytical ultracentrifuge measurement such as sedimentation velocity or zonal diffusion. Atthe time of writing, analytical ultracentrifuges, such as the Beckman Model E, the MsE Mk. II or the MSE centriscan are no longer commercially available, although scanning schlieren or absorption optics attachments have been availabre for some preparative machines (such as the Beckman LX80). The methodology ho*.u., continues to be developed (particularly for low speed sedimentation equilibrium) as a powerful tool for the characterization of difficult heterogeneous polymer systems-the hallmark of polysaccharides-whose molecular weights cannot be obtained ty simpte elec_ trophoretic techniques or simple calibration of columns. Significantly, a new generation ofanalytical ultracentrifuge is being planned [5g]. 5.1 Some Basic Theory There are many books t59-631 and reviews [64-67] on rhe sedi- mentation equilibrium technique. One particularly useful source is that of creeth and Pain [66] from which the following summary ofbasic theory is given. For a solute at sedimentation equilibrium there is no net transport of solute: the distribution of solute is solely a function of the thermodynamic (rather than hydrodynamic) proper- ties of the system. For polysaccharides such an equilibrium oistri-bution is generally achieved in z4-4gh depending on the nature ofthe solute and the experimental conditions (rotor speed, tem-perature, etc.). The most accurate method of recording solute distri- butions at sedimentation equilibrium is the Rayleigh Interference optical system which gives a direct record of solute concentration relative to the meniscus as a function of radial displacement from the centre of the rotor. using an appropriate data- capture facility Rayleigh patterns such as shown in Fig. I I can be transformed intoplots of log-I versus 12, where ,I is the absolute concentration (expressed in fringe displacement units) and r is the distance of a given point in the cell from the centre of the rotor (see, e.g. Fig. l2). no*these plots the various molecular weight averages (uiually the weight average) can in principle at least be extracted. other (less preciie) optical systems are available (see Schachman [59] and Lioyo josl ror a discussion on these). The absorption optical system, popular in91925. E. HARDTNC et a/. Figure '1.7. Rayleigh interference fringes for pectins (from ripe tomatocell walls) at sedimentation equilibrium.

Air fringes (pirt thereof) to theleft; solution fringes to rhe right. protein and DNA biochemisrry, principally because of the smalleramounts of sample required, is not generally usable for most poly- saccharides (because of the lack of an appropriate chromophore). The schlieren optical system, most populai with sedimentation velocity (see below), can be used to record solute distributions atsedimentation equilibrium. The record is one of the refractive indexgradient versus radial displacement and can be most readily trans- formed into 'Lamm plots', i.e. ln IIlr(d,Jldr)] versus ,t, ani yields the z-average molecular weight as the primary parameter. Its prin- cipal disadvantages are that solute distributions cannot be recorded as accurately as with Rayleigh optics and that higher solute con- centrations are generally required. The fundamental equation representing distribution of solute at sedimentation equilibrium can be written, for an as [66] dln,I M*(l - op)o] d(l) zRr displacement, ro is the rotor speed (rad/s), d thepartial specific I 0.80.6o.4o.2 L.O f Figure 12.

Smidsrod, unpublished observations.) This represents the distribution of solute at equal total potential throughout the centrifuge cell. From a simple rearrangement of this equation the point (weight) average molecular weight can be defined: M*(r) as a function of f can thus readily be obtained from, for example, sliding strip quadratic fitting procedures to the In-/ versus I data. It is also possible to obtain-provided the data is good enough-the point number-average molecular weights (see, e.g. Teller er a/. where /(a) is the concentration (fringe numbers) at the meniscus and Mn(a) is the number average at the meniscus. It is also possible to obtain the z-point-average for Mn(r) or M,(r) requires data of thehighest possible precision or very heavy dutu smoothing: point number averages involve a difficult extrapolation to the meniscus toobtain M,(a); z-averages require essentially a double differentiation of the basic fringe data unless schlieren optics are used to yield aLamm plot which gives z-averages directly (see, e.g. Bowen t69l).The second basic way of obtaining molecular weight informltiln is to define an average slope for the whole distribution (e.g. creethand Pain [66]): (5.5) (s.6)r number [M*(b)J(b) - M*(a)J(a)]ll,J (b) - J (a)l(s.7) (whole-cell z-average) where a and b are the radial displacements at the cell meniscus and base respectively, and -I0 the initial loading concentration(in fringe numbers). The most extractable whole cell average from this technique is the weight average (Eq. 5.5), but its extraction can involve a difficultextrapolation of the fringe data to the cell base. The use of arecently described operational point average (M*) appears to be ofsome value here. The M* function, defined bV t70l M*(r) : [whereT(r) is the (tringe) concentration relative ro that at the meniscus] has several properties which may be advantageous for the handling of polysaccharide data-one of these is that its value exrraDolated(s.4)Molecular Weight Determination Table 6.

E. HARDINC et a/. J(a).A very popular alternative in the protein biochemistry field has been to employ the high speed or meniscus depletion method of Yphantis [71] based on an earlier proposal by wales et al. [72]. This yields an effective J(a) of 0 and also permits the direct extractlon of M^(r) and M! values without rhe need for Mn(a). yphantis, in his original paper [71], gave the many conditions for the applicability of the method, conditions which are unfortunately sometimes ignored in the literature. The same conditions have been further stressed by Fujira [63]. The chief disadvantage with the high speed method is that the fringe displacements are compressed into a relatively short region of the cell making data capture difficult. It should also be stressed that for polydisperse systems like polysac- charides the method is not generally applicable becausi ol tne normal impossibility of getting proper depletion at the meniscus without losing optical registration of the fringes at the cell base. The high speed method also magnifies the effective non-ideality of the system because of a speed dependence effect (see, e.g. Fujita [63],creeth and Knight [73] and Eq. 5.1 I below). A common pitfatt is to assume depletion conditions when clearly this is not valid-the temptation being the analyses are a lot easier to perform. There are, however, now available routine procedures for obtaining meniscii concentrations by appropriate mathematical manipulation of the fringe data. For example, -r(a) can be obtained from twice the ratio of the intercept of a graph of j l(r2 - at) versus (!i rjdr)l(rz - a2) to the limiting slope [70]. Teller et al. [74] list orher minipulations which similarly yield J(a). Simulations of model polydisperse systems have shown that over the upper third of the solution column at an appro- priate speed a linear extrapolation gives J (a) to better than t s*r. as speeds are such that ./(c) is approximately 0.5 or less this is quite adequate for most purposes. For very polydisperse systems a linear extrapolation becomes less appropriate: the value of automatic data capture and multiple data acquisition/statistical smoothine forpolysaccharides is therefore clearlv indicated. 5.3. sedimentation Equilibrium Thermodynamic Non-ideality ln Section 2.2. we discussed the non-ideality of polysaccharides in relation to molecular weight determination. For the case of sedimentation equilibrium, all the molecular weight averages '.,..,: il .i'.i'3t.,'trFi.rl'.'.-,1:'Molecular Weight Determination referred to in Section 5.1 above are apparent values, i.e. influenced by thermodynamic non-ideality: the relation between apparent and ideal weight averages can be written, correct to first order in the virial expansion as [75, 76]: IIM*.^oo : 0lM*)U where ^B is the colligative second virial coefficient. Similar expressions are available for the number and z-averages. The u term is missing in Tanford [5], Tombs and Peacocke [21] and Fujita [63] but is present in Ross and Minton [75] and Harding and Johnson [76] (although it is not generally siguificant for most macromol- ecular systems, apart from compact globular macromolecules). Fortuitously, if the solvent density po is used in Eqs. (5.1-5.8) instead of the solution density p the u term to a very good approxi- mation disappears (see Eq. 5.12 of ref. 63). If the initial cell loading concentrations c0 are used in Eq. 5.10 (and the Mn, Mn,^oo refer to M!, MI,^r, values, respectively), the complete equation for departure from ideal behaviour also includes a speed dependence term, which may be significant at high speeds or for relatively large solution column lengths [63]: B\"n*B(l+|'\u0000M:llz) (s.1 l) where 4n is the effective virial coefficient and ,t a term defined by l: (t -op)e)2(bz -a21l2nf (5.r2) This extra term can be minimized by using low rotor speeds and short (3 mm or less) solution column lengths. This has been discussed in some detail by Fujita [63] and Suzuki [77]. However, if the high speed method is attempted this parameter can become significant. Non-ideality can be tackled in several ways. (a) Firstly by working at very low solute concentrations (0.2-0.4mg/ml or less) in long path length cells (e.g. Beckman 30 mm, MSE 20 mm). The high speed meniscus depletion method should of course be avoided and small column lengths should be employed (3 mm or less). These precautions are normally sufficient to avoid serious error in the calculated molecular weight parameters. For more extreme cases one of the following further steps can be taken. (b) Extrapolate the point (normally weight) average molecular weight (or the reciprocal thereof) to zero concentration, data taken from a single experi- ment. Although this counters non-ideality, if there is significantq98 \"5. E.

[23], with permission.) redistribution of the solute components relative to each other, the resulting extrapolated value will be biased towards the low molecular weight end of the distribution. Again this bias can be minimized by use of low speeds and short solution columns. (c) Extrapolate the whole cell weight average to zero concentration (several experiments). This is illustrated by Fig. 13. This is the most rigorous method of dealing with non-ideality but is also the most time consuming. However, the use of multichannel cells (e.g. of the'Yphantis' type t78l) can be a great time saver. (d) The use of compound point-average molecular weights (such as Mrr, Mrz) which are free of first-order effects of non-ideality (but alio poiy- dispersity). yphantis [79]. 5.4 Polydispersity versus self-association phenomena lt is normally impossible to distinguish in a single sedimentarion equilibrium experiment between the effects of polydispersity (i.e. the presence of non-interacting components of different moleculara10o-o ot Xq (ovoMolecular Weight Determination weight and/or partial specific volume) and self-association phenomena [79]. Although for many cases this may not be important since only a small proportion of polysaccharides are thought to self-associate, for some like guar the ability to distinguish these effects may be significant. There are two possible routes. (a) Use of non-dissociating versus dissociating solvents. Depending on the nature of the suspected interaction appropriate dissociative solvents could be used; e.g. change of ionic strengih or pH for suspected charge interactions, inclusion of SDS to supress hydro- phobic interactions or guanidine hydrochloride for hydrogen bond interactions. The latter has the advantage that because of the high molarity required (6 M), and since this reagent is almost totally dissociated the ionic strength is also high (/: 6.0). Use of this type of assay is of course not exclusive to sedimentation equilibrium! (b) use of diagnostic plots. There are several diagnostic plots available to distinguish polydispersity from self-association behaviour (see, e.g. Roark and Yphantis t79]) and all involve a combination of different experimental data sets of point averages taken at dif- ferent initial loading concentrations. These can be applied even if non-ideality is significant. Although this has had application in the related field of glycoconjugates [80,81] it has not, as far as we are aware, been applied to systems of polysaccharides: the potential for the analysis of, for example, guar or p-glucans-both of which are thought to self-associate-is, however, clearly indicated. The effects of either self-association or polydispersity can be supressed by the effects of non-ideality which tends to produce opposite curvature in plots of ln.I versus r2. Linearity of one of these plots is therefore insufficient criterion-taken by itself-for sample homogeneity or thermodynamic ideality [g2]. A simple diagnostic check is, however, available involving the use of multi- channel cells and different cell loading concentrations [g3].Assuming polydispersity and/or association behaviour have been diagnosed in a particular system it is possible to obtain more specific parameters to represent such behaviour. For example, there is an extensive literature on the characterization of associating systems by sedimentation equilibrium, a literature which also includes a proper consideration of thermodynamic non-ideality (for a review, see Kim et al. t84]). For the case of polydisperse charac- terization-in terms of molecular weight distribution analysis- several approaches are available. The simplest is to use ratios ofq5. E. HARDINC et a/. (whole cell) molecular weight averages, e.g. M.f M* or M*lM^ (cf . Section ?.t.l.The second way is ro model directly plots of ln,r versus 12, but this involves the solution of non-linear equations which are linked in a complicated inter-dependent way, and this generally takes a great toll on computer resources [85]: it has not yet been applied to polysaccharides although it has been used to model discrete distributions of molecular weight which at least partially describe mucus glycoproteins [85]. The third and easiest method-and by the far the most successful-is to use sedimentation equilibrium as an oFline calibration procedure for GpC and this is considered in Section 8.1. 55 Other Advances in Theory and Methodology Besides improvements in the methodology for the modelling of molecular weight distributions there have been other advances potentially advantageous for polysaccharide analysis. we note here: (a) The ability to model solute distributions for systems that are both polydisperse and associating [86]. (b) Improvements in the data handling of self-associating systems t87]. (c) Improvement in the resolution of the fringe data: all commercial analytical ultra- centrifuges have, to date, been supplied with conventional Hg-arc light sources or similar. In the 1970s several users replaced these with small lasers to enhance the quality of the Rayleigh patterns (see, e.g. williams [88], Laue t91D. For polysaccharides this is important, particularly if more sophisticated analyses invotving rtumber, zand 'compound' averages are being sought. (d) Improvement in data capture facilities. one of the reasons for the decline in popularity of sedimentation techniques has been the tediousness of manually measuring up Rayleigh fringes patterns. This has been ably illustrated by a classic quote of Teller in his 1973 review [67]. In the 1970s auromatic plate readers appeared 192-941but were never commercially available. A much more recent development has been the adaptation of a commercially available scanning laser densitometer-primarily intended by the manufacturer (LKB, Bromma) tor the capture gel equilibriurn o.3Q 0.25 4.20 0.15101 LI X,o Is 4 2 Jg Figure 14.

Depending on the quality of the Rayleigh fringe data the improvement in precision compared with manual data capture systems would again appear to be highly advantageous for the determination of polysaccharide molecular weights. It is felt that this development could open up the possibility of the use of a whole series of analytical procedures which, although previously mathematically available, have been in practice unusable because of the severe requirements on the preci- sion of the basic fringe data. 5.6 Applications Compared to light scattering, examples of molecular weight determination using sedimentation equilibrium are not numerous for polysaccharides-and the situation is not likely to improve in the forseeable future. Examples of applications to the determi- nation of M*data for a range of polysaccharides is given in Table 7 [98-106]. In general, results flrom sedimentation equilibrium are in good agreement with others, notably static light scatteringIq Iq102 5. E. HARDINC et a/. Table 7.

Where disagree- ment occurs it is normally associated with either clarity problems in light scattering or severe non-ideality in sedimentation equilibrium. Despite its lack of popularity it does provide absolute molecular weight data complementary to light scattering, and when used in conjunction with, for example, sedimentation velocity or intrinsic viscosity data provides also a powerful tool for conformational analysis. It is worth pointing out that the sedimentation equilibrium study of Kawahara et al. [23] has provided the basis of the commer- cially available pullulan standards which are now used worldwide for calibrating GPC columns (Section 7). 6. RELATIVE TECHNTQUES These are so called because they require either (a) knowledge or assumptions concerning the conformation of the polysaccharide in solution, (b) calibration with the use of 'standard' polysaccharides of the same conformation and similar molecular weight to the sample whose molecular weight is being sought or (c) calibration using an absolute method coupled on- or off-line. 6.1 Viscometry Viscosity is a molecular weight sensitive method that has been widely used most because it is rather easy to the experimentalist and does not require expensive instrumentation in its simples form. Although the measurable quantities are easy to obtain, converting them to molecular weights and comparison with other samples is not always a straightforward task, and in many cases the use of intrinsic viscosity ,lnf, as a hydrodynamic property is justified on its own without conversion to molecular weights. Experimental set- ups for determining viscosity range from the simple Ubbelhode- type viscometers, where the viscosity is evaluated from the flow rate for the Poiseuille flow [29], computer controlled capillary viscometers concentric cylinder (viscometers operating with a cone-and-plate or parallel plate geometries) through to the low shear concentric104 cylinder viscometer crothers and Zimm Each of these has operationai rangesfor shear rates, ease of use. temperature control, sampie voiume,etc. The precautions needed to be taken in using t,r] in determin-ing molecular weight will be stated here in terms of molecularproperties rather than operational properties for each type ofexperimental more compreh.ntiu. presentation of theinstrumental details.

These two latter approaches are particularly useful in situations where a series of dilutions are difficult to obtain, i.e. in on-line column applications (see later). If such a one point concentration [4] is, in fact. concentration dependent, this is reflected in the vaiidity of truncating the Taylor expansion after the second term. The basis for using viscosity as a molecular weight sensitive method is the relation between the intrinsic viscosity (limiting viscosity number) and an average of the molecular weight. The dependence of the intrinsic viscosity of a homologous series of polysaccharides on the molecular weight is classically described in terms of the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada (MHKS) equation: [ry] : K'Mo (6.s) where K' and a are empirical parameters which are constants at a given temperature, for a specified solvent within each polysac- charide for a limited range of molecular weights. Equation (6.5) forms the basis for using viscosity to determine molecular weight. From a series of calibration substances which should be nearly monodisperse, determination of molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity yields estimates of K' and a for the given polysaccharide- solvent system. The coefficient a is a conformation sensitive par- ameter changing from 0.5 for randomly coiling polymers in 0 solvents to 0.8 for polymers in good solvents, and increases with increasing chain stiffness attaining a value of 1.8 for the stiff rod conformation. This implies that the (a, K') parameters have a limited range of validity. To circumvent this iimited validity of the parameters (a, K') and the MHKS equation. the intrinsic viscosity can be described in terms of the (helical) wormlike coil where rhe stiffness and the hydrodynamic diameter are the relevant par- ameters F201. This latter descriprion is valid ranging from the stiff rod limit to the random coil limit. In addition to the advantage of specifying only one set of parameters, the same type of parameters can also be used for the sedimentation coefficient and the translation diffusion constant Il2l]. The persistence length can also be used to calculate the radius of gyration obtained from light scattering. As we have stated above, polydispersity is an inherent property of almost any polysaccharide preparation, and when dealing with an average measure, what type of average as well as deviations due to differences in molecular weight distribution should be indicated. The intrinsic viscosity of a polydisperse sample [4]*, with a weight105 #106S. E.

Forpolysaccharide chains of intermediate siiffness corresponding to a molecular weight range with a : l, the viscosity au.rug. molecular weight equals the weight average molecular welght. For a > l, the viscosity average exceeds Mn, and does not correspond to any of those obtained by osmometry, or static light scatiering. A more detailed discussion on the type of average provided by tiis formu- lation for different model molecular weight distributions is given by Bareis ll22l. The M, evaluated in terms of the helical wormlike coil corresponding to a molecular weight range where the MHKS does not describe well the [a]-M reiation in terms of a single set of a and, K' coefficients is even more complicated. Nevertheless, the M, wormlike coils has been formulated [123]. Thetotal in solution would affect the calibration par- ameters either using the MHKS coil for polyelectrolytic polysaccharides [25], but as long as the unknown sample is characterized under the same solvent conditions as those used to obtain such calibration parameters, thepolyelectrolytic nature would not introduce major errors in the determination of Mr. Chemical heterogeniety occuring in many classes of polysaccharide, e.g. alginates, locust bean gum andpectins, may cause problems in using such an indirect method. The calibration parameters (a, K') are reported to depend on the chemical composition for locust bean gum [2], and are expected to depend on the M lG ratio for alginates because of their difference in chain extension U261. Differences in branching character. for poly- saccharides such as dextrans [127] and glycogen Il2g], between the calibration substances and the unknown substances may likewise affect the proper conversion to molecular weights. Th,rr, the chemical composition and the degree of branching for the material to be tested should resemble those of calibration substances to validate the use of such an indirect method. The theories relating the intrinsic viscosity to the morecular weight is formulated for the low shear Newtonian intrinsic viscosity, [rl]r_0, where 1; is the shear rate. The onset of non-Newtonian behaviour depends on theMolecular W eight Determination rotationai relaxation time, z*, which depends on the molecularweight. onset of non-Newtonian behaviour has traditionaily notbeen utilized as an indirect method for molecurar weight determi-nation. we would only use rR to estimate an upper shear rate limitfor obtaining the lower Newionian piateau uutu..

Sedimentation velocity is perhaps a more famiiiar technique. However, unlike sedimentation equilibrium-and like intrinsic viscosity-it is a transport property: the rate at which a polysaccharide sediments under high gravi- tational fieids is a function of its molecular weight and its con- formation. Conventional schlieren optics are normally used to record the position of the sedimenting boundary [68] and an example is given in Fig. 16. From the rate of movement the sedi- mentation coefficient s., at a given concentration c, can be obtained. Two corrections are normally necessary (see, e.g. van Holde [21]). Firstly a correction to standard solvent conditions-normally water at 20.0'C. The second correction necessary is an extrapolation of s. to zero concentration: s. = s(l - k,c) or equivalently i = l(l + k,c)(6.e) Figure 16. Schlieren boundaries for an treated manucol DM).

The direction of sedimentation is from left to right.112 S. E. HARDINC et al. where s is the 'infinite dilution' value and ft, the sedimentation concentration dependence regression coefficient. For non-spherical macromolecules normally the reciprocai value (Fig. 17) is extra- polated (see Rowe [39] for a discussion on this). It is also possible -at least in principie-to determine a distribution of sedimenting coefficients g(s) from the shape of the sedimenting e.g. Fujita [63] and Hascall and Sadjera [140]) but besides concentration effects having to be taken into account this also requires a further correction for diffusion effects: some form of extrapolation to zero concentration and infinite time is required. A distribution g(s) obtained after these criteria had been satisfied has been obtained by, for example, Iso er al.$a\\ for alginates. Provided that the macromolecular conformation is known mol- ecular weight data can be obtained from the sedimentation coefficient directly, and a distribution of molecular weights g(M) from g(s). For example the sedimentation coefficient has been related to the mole- cular weight by an MHKS type of relation: s : K\"Mh (6.10) 1.0 : 0.9 I 0.3 0.00.5 t.o L5 2.9 2.5 c (mglmL ) Figure 17.

For a given polysaccharide series these constants can be found from a 'double-log' type of calibration plot for these materials where the calibrating molecular weights (normally isolated fractions of these materials) have been deterarined by an independent absolute technique, such as static light scattering or sedimentation equilibrium. Examples have been given in Fig. 15(b) for fractions of pullulan [23], pectin [08] and alginate By MHKS plots from intrinsic viscosity (Fig. l5) the value of the exponent in Eq. 6.10 defines a conformation for the polysaccharide. For exampie, the value of 0.17 X 0.07 for citrus pectin is consistent with an extended (rod) conformation and not a compact sphere or random coil. In some other cases-notably xanthan [129]-the conformation can change with increase in molecular weight (e.g. from an extended conformation at low molecular weight to a semiflexible coil at longer chain lengths). There are other ways of obtaining absolute molecular weight data from sedimentation coefficients. One is to combine with transiational diffusion coefficient data as described beiow (Section 6.3). The other is to combine with intrinsic viscosity data using a relation defined by Scheraga and Mandelkern [5], provided that the polysaccharide is not too asymmetric. This latter method relies on the insensitivity of the Scheraga-Mandelkern p function to shape [4, 16]. 6.3 Translational Diffusion Coefficient Determination: Dynamic tight Scattering As noted above (section 4) the advent of the laser, and the properties of high intensity, monochromaticity and collimation provided a major stimulus to the static light scattering method. The further property of high coherence provided the basis of a new type of scattering rnethod in the 1960s [a2]. Since macromolecules in dilute solution are subject to dominant Brownian diffusion, they impose a Doppler component on the otherwise almost mono- chromatic incident light. A spectrum analyser may be used to investigate such a wavelength spread and the diffusion coefficient may thus be determined. More usual is the study of the fluctuating intensity which arises from the beating of the components oi dif- ferent wavelength amongst themselves, and this is the basis of correlation techniques or'dynamic light scattering'.114 S. E. HARDINC et al. (6.11)Dynamic light scattering comes under a number of different pseudonyms all meaning very much the same thing: quasi-elastic light scattering (QLS), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS)' intensity fluctuation spectroscopy (IFS). The principies of the technique are well described in a series of books 1143,144] and review articles U45-147], and the experimental aspects of applica- tion to biological macromolecules have also been considered in detail U48-1501. The principal feature of the apparatus illustrated schematically in Fig. 18 is a purpose-built digital correlator, and several instruments with this facility are commercially available e.g. Malvern 4700 equipment, Malvern Instruments, UK). For a system of spherical particles the (apparent) translational diffusion coeffi- cieni D\", ata given concentration c, canbe related to the normalized intensity autocorrelation function tQl via the relation [151]: V@ - 11'rz : exp( -D\"l*t) where k is the Bragg wave vector. For a polydisperse system the (translational) diffusional coefficient will be a z'average For polysaccharides which are not in general spherical scatterers there will be a finite contribution to the autocorrelation function from rotational effects. This contribution can normally be eliminated by extrapolation of the normalized autocorrelation function to zero Figure 18. Schematic dynamic light scattering aPparatus.

By analogy with the sedimentation coefficient, D\" is convention- ally corrected to standard solvent at 20.0oC- and simple correction formulae translational diffusion coefficient-like other one, i.e. concentration dependent: D\":D[+(2BM-a-k,)cl (6.r2) (see, e.g. [76]), where B is the osmotic pressure second virial coef- ficient and k, is the sedimentation concentration regression coefficient-the same parameter as in Eq. (6.9). The ideal value, D, is normally found from a linear extrapoiation of D\" to zeto concentration. The transiational diffusion coefficient, by analogy with the sedi- mentation coefficient, can be used to obtain molecular weight information if the conformation is known. A similar MHKS type of expression exists to that for intrinsic viscosity and sedimentation velocity: D : K\"'M-\" and a double logarithmic plot of diffusion coefficient versus mol- ecular weight (the latter from static light scattering) for a series of alginates has been used to produce a calibration plot for these substances (Fig. t5c). The slope (-e) is again a function of con- formation. The diffusion coefficient can also be used with the Scheraga-Mandelkern equation as discussed in Section 6.2 above although again we have no direct knowiedge of its application. However, when combined with the weight-average sedimentation coefficient, s, this yields an absolute measure of the weight average molecular weight via the Svedberg equation: ltt - (slD[Rrl(l -tpo)] (6. to several alginates (e.9. Wedlock et al. [31]), giving values for the molecular weights in agreement with Zimm plot values. We would like to stress that, just as for static light scattering problems of dust or supramolecular aggregates can lead to serious error with dynamic light scattering: the method has to be treated with extreme caution. Apparent agreement with results from SLS is not a sufficient criterion for correctness of results since contaminating(6.13)S. E. HARDINC et a/. particies wiil produce resuits biased towards the spuriousiy high moiecular weights in both cases. The problems with dynamic light scattering have been considered in detail by Comper et al. U52]. These latter workers have proposed that boundary spreading in the ultracentrifuge may in certain cases be preferable, but this too is not without difficulties for polydisperse materials. An estimate for the molecular weight from the Svedberg equation for guar and locust bean galactomannans, where the translational diffusion coefficient was measured by the boundary spreading in the ultracentrifuge, has been given by Sharman and Richards U531. The results obtained (0.66 and 0.32) x l0-ucm2s-r are in reasonable agreement with those from sedimentation equilibrium (see Table 7), but much lower than that from light scattering U541. In a later study good agreement between the two techniques was obtained for dextrans [155]. It is also possible to define distributions of diffusion coef- ficient and hence, if the parameters of Eq. (6.13) are known, a ' distribution of molecular weights [55], and an example of applica- tion to a bacterial polysaccharide has been given by Chu et al. [8]. Software packages are commercially available permitting these calculations on microcomputers. These analyses, however. besides being subject to the usual problems of solution of multi-exponential equations without constraints, do not in general take into account effects of non-ideality, which will be considerable as noted above for concentrations (c I 1.0 mgiml). 7. GEt PERMEATION CHROMATOGRAPHY Knowledge of the molecular weight distribution, and not only molecular weight averages as provided by osmometry or classical light scattering, is needed to give a detailed description of molecular weight properties of a certain polysaccharide sample. As discussed earlier (Section l), the polydispersity of polysaccharide preparations might yield point-average molecular weights obscuring molecuiar, weight tails in either direction, which is of significance in certain applications such as for the use of carrageenans as food additives. Among the techniques available to provide information about the whole molecular weight distribution , calibrated gel permeation chromatography (GPC) has been-for several years-the mosr1i6Molecu lar W eight D ete r m i n atio n popular in the field of polysaccharides. When the stationary phase in the column is carefully selected to the problem at hand, and when appropriate caiibration methods and data handling procedures are applied, this approach has the potential of resolving the 'true' molecular weight distribution. However, there are several experi- mental hurdles to overcome to meet this uitimate goal. We have chosen to give a practical and applied approach in using GPC to characterize carbohydrate polymers and, for this reason, we will not go into detail of the separation mechanisms involved which can be found in textbooks [56, 157]. However, a brief account of fundamentals necessary to understand the separation process relevant to polysaccharides is provided. This is necessary as a basis for the discussion of calibration methods, data handling procedures, etc., which can be found eisewhere [57, 1581. In GPC, components migrate through the column matrix with different velocities and consequently elute at different times after injection. The difference in migration velocities occurs due to retention of the molecules by the stationary phase. Ideally, the retention of the molecules depends on the hydrodynamic volume of the molecules relative to the accessible pore volume for the given hydrodynamic volume, un. For molecular species with un in excess of the largest available pore size of the stationary phase, sepa- ration based on accessibility of interparticie pores occurs. This is also referred to as hydrodynamic chromarography (flow-field fractionation) and occurs essentially due to steric exclusion of the polymer molecules from the particle walls. This latter retention mechanism is utilized for high molecular weight polysaccharides with very large hydrodynamic volume [138, 159, 160]. In con- ventional GPC the hydrodynamic chromatography effect is one mechanism leading to band broadening [157]. Separation mechanisms not governed by the size of the molecules will tend to decouple the molecular size-migration velocity relation, and the experimental elution profile will not reflect differences in size. Such non-size separation mechanisms can be a result of, for example, charge effects and adsorption. These phenomena and the necessary precautions to minimize their influence are described by Barth [ 58], and have recently been reviewed when using GPC to characterize polysaccharides il61]. In conventional GPC, a small applied amount of a monodisperse polymer ideally elutes as a sharp peak at an elution volume determined by its characteristic migration117118S. E. HARDINC er a/. veiocity. In practice this is not observed due to different broadening mechanisms. This implies that an applied Dirac-d molecuiar weighiprofile (this is the mathematicar representation of a monodispersepolymer) elutes as a broadened band where the peak position represents the most probable molecular weight and ttre width of the distribution represents the system (column, tubes. valves and detector) impulse response. An experimental elution profile obtained from a concentration sensitive detector can be converted to a molecular weight distribution provided that the column usedis properly calibrated for the polysaccharide under experimentation. The most complete approach requires that the experimental elutionprofile is first corrected for system dispersion, in which caiibration data for dispersion as a function of elution volume is required. and,secondly, that the corrected chromatogram is converted to a mol-ecular weight distribution using a calibration equation relating theelution volume to molecular weight. Before we present differentways of calibrating columns, we first deal with the seiection ofcolumn materials in view of polysaccharides to be studied. 7.1 Selection of Column Material Manufacturers of commercial column materials provide sepa- ration ranges for their different products mainly in terms ofseparation ranges valid for globular proteins or dextrans. It iswell documented in the polysaccharide literature that most poly- saccharides have more extended conformations than the highiy flexible and branched dextran molecule, and certainly ,io*extended than the compact conformation of globulu, prot.ios. The hydrodynamic volume of the stiffer polysaicharides is therefore larger than for the corresponding moiecular weight of dextran asillustrated in Fig. l5 where the intrinsic viscosity of five differentpolysaccharides are shorvn versus molecular weight. The separation range is therefore expected to differ from that of dextrans and theguidelines given by the manufacturer for dextrans are not generally reliable for the stiffer polysaccharides. It is a necessary require- ment that the molecular weight range in the sample is within the separation range for the column material to be able to separate on molecular weight and thereby obtain the E Xc)o Vr 'd o- |! -o oc (! 5o(o (o o; S. E. et al. Based on the principie of universai calibration (see below) and reported constants in the MHKS equation (Eq. 6.5, Table 8), separation ranges fior different column materials have been converted from those for dextrans to other poiysaccharides (Table 9). A more comprehensive tabulation is given by Barth U581. The actual vaiues should be considered as only approximate guides because they depend to some extent on the actual values of the MHKS parameters both for dextran and the other polysaccharide (and they have a limited range of validity as stated above, Section 6.1, which is not met in some of these calculations). Table 9 demonstrates that the separation ranges become narrower the stiffer the polysaccharide (larger MHKS exponent), and particularly that the upper limit of the separation range is lowered by up to a decade from that for dextran. The three polysaccharides considered in Table 9 were selected partly because they are among the most studied, partly because puilulan represents a widely used calibration standard and, lastly, because they span a large range of chain stiffnesses. When either sample average Mn or Mn are known, columns should be selected to resolve M from below 0.2 M^ and up to 5 Mn or even a larger range. A proper determination of the void volume, i.e. the elution volume for totally excluded polysaccharides, using a very high molecular weight preparation, and the total volume, using a low molecular weight compound such as glucose, is necessary to ensure that the chosen column(s) is able to resolve the molecular weight distribution. By combination of columns in series it is possible to improve the linearity of the separation range and the effective sepa- ration range when the pore size distributions of the two columns are properly adjusted to each other U621. This will, firstly, diminish the resolution and, secondly, not increase the upper resolution limit of column with the largest resolution limit. This upper resolution limit is one of the limiting factors in characterization using GPC of high molecular weight polysaccharides such as xanthan, scleroglucan and others. The selection of column material is in many cases balanced by the two mutually excluding aims of having the highest possible resolution and a wide as possible separation range. 7.2 Calibration using Standards The earliest attempts to convert chromatograms to molecular weight distributions were based on calibration procedures where standards, either synthetic polymers or dextran, were utilized.Molecular Weight Determination 121 For molecules eluting between the void and total voiume, the molecular weight is adjusted to a polynomial in elution volume, V: N log(M) : I a,V, t:0(7.1) calibration equation (.|/ - I ) will flor many instances fit the data adequately, whereas non-linearities occuring in particular close to the void and the total volume can be taken into account incorporating higher order terms. The coefficients d, can be deter- mined either based on the peak position of near-monodisperse fractions covering the whole molecular weight range separable by the column/solvent system. The peak position method is considered as one of the best methods to obtain calibration equations [ 57]. In this context it should be noted that the peak position method is not affected by system dispersion if it is described in terms of a Gaussian band. However, one should be aware of what kind of average is known for the calibration standards and the type of detector used (concentration sensitive, number of particle sensitive or other). Once the coefficients in Eq. (7.1) for a given column-polysaccharide- solvent system have been determined, experimental 'true' chroma- tograms can be converted to molecular weight distributions. The experimental limitations in applying the peak position-off- line calibration method are mainly in the experimental uncertainty in the molecular weight and peak position determination of the standards. Error propagation to the M averages of the unknown sample have been studied using computer generated data U9, l57l and show that the relative error is larger the higher the molecular weight moment. Calibration using dextran fractions and then estimation of mol- ecular weight distributions of other type of polysaccharides is the simplest, although not truly correct, implementation of such an approach. When using columns calibrated with dextran fractions to determine molecular weight distributions of pectins [163], hemicellu- lose [ 64] or other polysaccharides, the molecular weights obtained should be regarded as equivalent dextran molecular weights rather than absolute for the substance in question. Or, in other words, the unknown samples elute at a volume corresponding to the specified molecular weight of dextran. Table 9 (and Fig. 19) show that the actual molecular weight for other substances is expected to differ from that of dextran and the absolute values of these other poly- saccharides should, in such cases. be treated with some caution.122 S. E. HARDINC et a/. The caiibration using the peak position method is limited by availability of homoiogous fractions of the polysaccharides studied. Off-line calibration in these cases can be obtained either using a broad molecular weight standard or based on the principle of universal calibration. Calibration using a broad molecular weight standard is affected by the system impulse response. Correcting for this line broadening can be taken into account in obtaining the calibration equation assuming that the 6 is transformed into a symmetric Gaussian band, using the 'GPCV2' method [165], or even skewed column dispersion, using the 'GPCV3' method u57, 1661. Calibration using broad molecular weight standards can be performed either based on the integral molecular weight dis- tribution or using specific, known averages of the standard. The integral molecular weight distribution method requires that the complete molecular weight distribution is known. This method is scarcely utilized in the field of polysaccharides and we therefore omit any further description of it. The latter is recom- mended when the column material is selected to yield a linear catbration equation because, thus far, it has been limited to assuming a linear calibration equation, i.e. N: I in Eq. (7.1). Both the integral method and the peak position method based on the linear calibration equation (N: I in Eq. l) are presented in detail elsewhere [157]. Off-line universal calibration is based on the concept of use of the hydrodynamic volume of non-homologous series of polymers. The hydrodynamic volume can be expressed as the product of the molecular weight M and intrinsic viscosity [4] and the calibration equation has the form: /v tog(M^[ry]) : L p,v' i:0(7.2) where B, are adjusted based on the calibration data. For slightly polydisperse polymers it is the Mn and the elution volume for the Mn that should enter this calculation 11671. When the universal calibration approach is utilized, additional information about the polysaccharide must be provided to obtain molecular weight distri- butions. This can be the a and Kparameters in the MHKS equation (Eq. 6.5). The principle of universal calibration is shown to work well for a limited ranse of chain stiffnesses. whereas extremes ''r.,'1Molecular Weight Determination 123 vo 3t 35 40 45 Vrot Elution volume (tt) Figure 19.

The use of universal calibration for polysaccharides should therefore be tested prior to application, at least for stiff chain polysaccharides in combination with more random-coil like examples.124S. E. HARDINC er a/. The universal calibration concept has been utilized tl69] to deter-mine the moiecular weight distribution of, for exampie, hyaluronicacid, and values for M* obtained from the Gpc eiution profiieswere within reasonable agreement with that determined bv Such 'off-line' caiibrated columns have been wideiy used forpolysaccharides. As an illustrative example we present some elutionprofiles obtained on TSK columns several fiactions of p-o-(l-3), (l-4)glucans [l 69a]. The void and totalvolume were determined using a high- molecular weight xanthanfraction and glucose respectively. Figure lg shows that thecomplete elution profile of each of the fractions elute between thevoid and total volume, that most of the fractions elute as near-symmetric Gaussian shapes, and the range of molecular weight inthe fractions span a rather large range. 7.3 Calibration for System Dispersion The column dispersion smears out any sharp peaks and theexperimental chromatogram F(v)can be expressed as the convolu-tion of the true chromatogram w(v) and the wg)G(v - Y)dY (7.3) A deconvolution method can in principle be used to obtain the truechromatogram when the system dis ersion function is known.However, it has been a problem for a long time to avoid oscillationsin the true chromatogram close to sharp peaks (high frequencycomponents), and analytical approaches where the Gaussian shape('GPcv2') or skewed Gaussian ('Gpcv3') are assumed for thedispersion function are most prevailing. Au these methods relyon experimentally determined values describing the systemdispersion. Assuming that the system dispersion is adequatelyrepresented by a Gaussian function, and that the column .ulib.u-tion equation can be piecewise approximated by a two-parameter fit estimares can be obtained. Niote that different q.i values can be used for different substances I.: I'..'1Molecular W eight Dete non-overiapping regions of V. Under these assumptions [71],1727, the ratio between M* and M\" dep'ends on the same ratio calculated from the uncorrected chromatogram, and the standard deviation o is the system function: M*lM^ : (M*lM,)n exp( -aidlz) the uncor- rected experimental chromatogram and calibration equation. It is not corrected for system dispersion and thus reflects an increase in the polydispersity index. This is valid irrespective of the complexity of the molecular weight distribution of the sample used to calibrate o as long as the above stated assumptions are satisfied. Corrections for instrumental spreading are not widely applied and represent in some cases minor corrections for narrow molecular weight standards such as pullulan (0.8-l .9o/o conection [173]). The correc- tion is more significant for the resolution of the molecular weight distribution than for actual values of M,, Mn and M, calculated from the chromatograms. 8. MAXWELL'S DEMON: COMBINED FMCTIO NATION/ABSO LUTE APPROACHES Interpretations of the data from the 'absolute' techniques we have discussed above-osmotic pressure, sedimentation equilibrium and total intensity light scattering all coloured by problems of polydispersity of polysaccharides. This polydispersity problem is largely dealt with by sedimentation velocity and gel permeation chromatography which can, if appropriate conditions are chosen, provide a satisfactory fractionation or resolution of the components of different molecular weight, but insofaras molecular weight deter- mination is concerned, these are only 'relative' techniques-the separations are dependent on conformation as well as molecular weight. The revolutionary step has been to use a 'flractionation' technique as a 'Maxwell's Demon' in conjunction with an absolute molecular weight technique to give absolute molecular weight distributions. 'Maxwell's Demon' was in its original conception $74; see also Klein [75]) an intelligence able to separate gas molecules moving at different velocities. By analogy, in system of*+,#126S. E. HARDINC er a/. molecules polydisperse by rveight (as opposed to veiocity) this'Demon' is able to separate molecules of different weight prio. toanalysis. In the case of poiysaccharides this Demon is not an'intelligence' but either Gpc or sedimentation velocity. It is fair tosay that this particuiar 'Maxrvell Demon' has provided a majorimpetus to the determination of molecular weight distributions, andin the case of on-line GPC/light scattering has largely solved the dust problem. These methods are generally valid piovided that non-ideality effects are properly taken into account and provided that the polysaccharide system is not reversibly associating: samples will simply redistribute after fractionation leading to serious .riorc of interpretation. The other complication that can occur is that if Table 10. Combined fractionation/absolute techniques for molecular weight distribution analysis.

Polydispersity in composition will be manifested by poly- dispersities in partial specific volume for sedimentation equilibrium and polydispersity in density increment for total intensity light scattering, &s indicated in Section 2.1 above. In Table l0 U76-1871 we have cited the five main approaches involving either off-line or on-line calibration of GPC (principally) or sedimentation velocity. We will now consider them in a little more detail. 8.1 Off-line Calibration of Gel Permeation Chromatography by Sedimentation Equilibrium This was considered implicitly by Wasteson [ 88, 189] for chon- droitin sulphate fractions, by Kawahara et al. l23l for pullulan fractions and has been considered in detail by Ball et al. Ul3l. For example, the idea is to isolate several (typically five or six) fractions of narrow bandwidth from the column and determine their molecular weights using ultrashort column low speed sedi- mentation equilibrium in multi-channel cells (to accelerate the acquisition of data) U l3]. This defines a calibration plot of logM versus ( which can be used to define a distribution of molecular weights from the GPC elution profile. 8.2 Off-line Calibration of Gel Permeation Chromatography by Total Intensig Light Scattering This follows almost exactly the same sort of principle as Section 8.1., except that Zimm plot analyses are performed on each of the fractions (see, e.g. Ekstrom et al. U76D. This also facilities the determination of distributions of size (via Ro) and a check on variation of the second virial coefficient ^8. It is generally more difficult to perform than 8.1 because of the larger amounts'of material required and because of the usual dust problems although the fractionated material itself will be 'cleaned' by the GPC. For example, for the case of a series of citrus pectin fractions, results from this procedure are in excellent agreement with those from sedimentation equilibrium [08].S. E.

Kaye and Havlik U90] announced in 1973 the revolutionary approach of installing a low angle light scattering detector 'on-line' with a GPC column-differential refractometer arrangement. The device, orig- inally available from Beckman Instruments (Palo Alto, Ca) is now available as the 'KMX-6' (Milton Roy, Florida) and Fig. 20(a) gives a simple outline of the method. It has been applied to a wide range of polysaccharides as Table l0 illustrates. Figure 20(b) and (c) give two examples of distributions obtained in this way for scleroglucan and hyaluronic acid, respectively. One of the chief difficulties is thermodynamic non-ideality. The second virial coeffi- cient, B, is normally determined separately on unfractionated material with either accurate dry weights or a properly calibrated refractometer for concentration measurement. .B is normally taken as constant for given fractions from the polysaccharide and provided that the concentations can be recorded on line with the GPC/LALLS using the refractometer, non-ideality can be allowed for. The other assumption that is made is that the angle is low enough that the angular dependence is totally eliminated. 8.4 On-line Calibration of Get Permeation Chromatography by Multi-angle Laser Light Scattering With low angle light scattering, even on samples directly from a GPC column, there is still the lingering doubt over residual bits of dust, small pieces from the column, etc., still appearing in the scattering cell, and also problems of 'flares' from the walls of the cell. The appearance of GPC/multi-angle laser light scattering (Dawn-F, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara) appears to represent a considerable improvement, although as yet there are few examples of application to polysaccharides (Table l0). Figurc 2l gives the calibration plot and molecular weight distri- bution for a Pullulan fraction P-800. The results are in good agree- ment with data from, for example, sedimentation equilibrium t231. The same attention to thermodynamic non-ideality noted in Section 8.3 above has to be applied. It is also possible to obtain from these types of analyses distributions of root mean square radii, Ro 1.0 10\u20acx M4.0 Figure 21. CPC (SEO/MALLS for molecular weight distribution derer-mination.

It is therefore possible to define very rapidly a plot on double logarithmic scaie of Mn versus Ro, which as noted above defines a conformation for the poiysaccharide. It is not unreasonable to say that the appearance of GPCIMALLS couid represent one of the most sigriificant developments for the determination of absolute molecular weight distributions of polysaccharides. 8.5 On-line SFFF/Light Scattering Sedimentation field flow fractionation (SFFF) is a sedimentation velocity type of process performed in a modified preparative type of ultracentrifuge. These are commercially available (DuPont Instruments) and consist essentially of on-line pooling through suitably designed radial channels in the rotor system. SFFF achieves much the same goal as GPC but is better suited for larger macromolecules where GPC separations are generally poor (see Section 1). Oppenheimer and Mouray [187] have built an 'evaporative light scattering detector' on-line to the SFFF channels and obtained a molecular weight distribution for a dextran (Fig. 22). The possibility of incorporating a MALLS detector instead is now being considered (P. Wyatt, personal communication). Viscosity detectors are also becoming increasingly popular [119, l9l] but since these yield only a relative measure of moiecular weight they are inferior to those detectors which give absolute - \u20ac 0.5 M Figure 22. Molecular weight distribution of a dextran obtained from SFIF coupled to an evaporative light scattering detector. (From Ref. [iB7], with permission.)*{132S. E. HARDINC et a/. molecular weights when molecular weight distributions are concerned. The main advantage of using a viscosity detector to a GPC coiumn in combination with a M detector is that it provides estimates of 4, rI and c for a range of lractions as they elute from a column. rhereby obtaining a calibration plot analogous to Fig. 15(a) for the polysaccharide in question Il9l].However, as these on-line viscosity detectors are usually of the capillary type, there might be significanr deviations from low-shear Newtonian viscosity for high molecular weight polysaccharides (Section 6. I ). 9. OTHER METHODS In addition to the techniques presented in some detaii above. there are a few others that should be described briefly. End group analysis is one such technique. If the molecular weight of a macromolecule should be determined through a group analysis, it is required that the polymer contain a known number of determinable _qroups per molecule. For polysaccharides such analyses are, in practice. limited to end groups and the method is referred to as end group analysis. Since the method counts the number of molecules in the sample, it is M\" that is determined. The type of groups that can be determined depend on the type of polysaccharide. and therefore no general method can be given. However, linear polysaccharides have a non-reducing end which is suitable for derivatization. e.g. by a fluorescent or radioactive agent. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) may also yield specific signals from end groups which can be quantified. The latter method is, however, limited to rather low molecular weights (10000g/mol or less) due to the signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum. Any physical measure rvhich shows a molecular weight depen- dency could in principle be used to characterize molecular weight. The greater the dependency (i.e. larger exponent in a power law relationship), the better the potential resolving power. Tomka and vancso il9] have listed some mechanical properties of polymer molecules in the melt concentration regime which may be used to characterize molecular weight. So far, these melt properties have seen limited use in obtaining molecular weights of polymers and in the case of polysaccharides (which in many cases deviateMolecular Weight Determination 133 significantly from the underlying theories as suggested to measure molecular weight) no reports on using this kind of approach are known to us. The measured molecular weights are also affected by polydispersity in a somewhat different way than, for example, obtained by classical light scattering or osmosis. This may hamper the correlation of data obtained on the same sample using different techniques, but has also the potential of gaining more information as the average is weighted to other ranges in the molecular weight distribution than, for example, Mnobtained from osmometry. Tomka and Vancso [19] also discuss the potential of applying the correlation between the random polymer coil-stretch transition and the effect of this molecular process on the elongational viscosity as a molecular weight sensitive method. This concept is explored by Keller et al. [192-195]. Polymer molecules exhibiting entropic nature can be induced to go from the coil form to the fully stretched form in an elongational shear field provided that the elongational strain rate, e, exceeds l/r and the residence time of the polymer in the high strain rate field is sufficient for the transition to occur. The characteristic relaxation time ? was predicted to be identical to the first relaxation time in a free draining or non-draining coil. Applying this technique to molecular weight determination of polymers requires calibration using nearly monodisperse polymer molecules of the same chemical composition as those to be inves- tigated. Deviation from entropic dominated nature would make data interpretation difficult in distinguishing between effects of poly- dispersity and effects of chain stiffness and therefore ambiguous. This is exemplified by Pfeiffer et al. tl96l for xanthan. The feature that sets this experimental approach apart from the previous ones is that it is sensitive to molecular weight and molecular weight distributions in the range from 106 and upwards, where the available packing materials for GPC clearly have their limitations (Table 9). In spite of the experimental hurdles and possible ambiguous interpretation, this technique should be worth exploring for characterizing polysaccharides. The high molecular weight limit in the microrheology-elongational shear field technique corre- sponds to the value where the critical elongational strain 'rate needed to induce the coil-stretch transition exceeds the one to induce chain scission U92). For such high molecular weights another technique also based on the polymer molecule relaxation times can be employed.134 S. E. HARDINC et al. For native DNA of different origins having molecular weights in the range 107 to 10\" g/mol, molecular weights have been deter- mined using the creep recovery phenomena as observed in a low shear Cartesian diver viscometer [197]. In this molecular weight range, the structural features of DNA with a persistence iength of about 50 nm are adequately represented by Gaussian chain models. For the creep recovery after controlled upwinding of the molecules, the movement of the Cartesian diver is governed by the relaxation of ensembles of individual polymer molecules in the limit of infinite dilution. This type of decay can be analysed to yield the molecular weight. The main experimental difficulty with such a technique is in the handling of the high molecular weight macromolecules without inducing any shear damage. For DNA this was accomplished by lysing the cells directly in the measurement cuvette. The technique can be extended to the characterization of polysaccharides. For example, raw extracts of alginates from Aschophyllum nodusum fruiting bodies are observed (Smidsrod, unpublished observation) to cause creep recovery in a Zimm type viscometer which indicate that they may contain very high molecular weight polysaccharides. The rotational relaxation time can also be measured using either shear flow birefringence or electrically induced birefrin- gence (see, e.g. Morris U98]). To our knowledge these methods are not widely used to determine molecular weights of polysaccharides, and since they are relative methods, w\u20ac will not consider them further. Different electron microscopic approaches can be used to deter- mine macromolecular weight, but electron microscopy (EM) has not as yet had a prominent position for the determination of molecular weight of polysaccharides unlike for the case of DNA [99]. There are mainly two basically different approaches that can be used. one is based on mixing a specific concentration of the polysaccharide under investigation with a certain amount of another macromolecule with known molecular weight. provided that the two types of molecules are clearly distinguished by the electron microscope, that they are non-interacting and assuming that they are equally spread on the surface used to prepare the specimen to be observed an average molecular weight can be obtained by counting the two types of molecules in a certain field. To our knowledge, again there are no examples of this approach in the determination of molecuiar weight of polysaccharides in the literature. The second approach using EM is analogous to a ffi j I.\"',1Molecular Weight Dete rmi nation 135 technique used to determine the molecular weight of DNA. It is based on the principle that if the linear mass density is known, contour length distributions from calibrated electron micrographs can be converted to molecular weight distributions. This technique requires assignment of the whole polymer contour and is therefore limited to rather stiff chains. This application of the electron microscope, together with other applications to carbohydrate polymers, as well as experimental hurdles associated with poly- saccharide specimen preparation will be described elsewhere in this volume [200]. Throughout this article light scattering has featured strongly and rightly so-it is arguably the most poptrlar technique for polysac- charide molecular weight determination. It is, however, worth indicating a very simple type of light scattering measurement which as far as we are aware has had no application in polysac- charide molecular weight determination. This is simple turbidity (i.e. total intensity loss of an incident beam through scattering). This would be particularly suitable for very large polysaccharides (larger than 106 g/mol) providing that Rayleigh-Gans-Debye criteria referred to in Section 4 are still valid. The theory has been worked out, e.g. Doty and Steiner [201], and applied to several viruses, e.g. by Camerini-otero and Day 12021 and Bahls and Bloomfield [203]. Although it is likely to yield only approximare values for polysaccharides, the instrumentation is simple compared to SLS, dynamic light scattering and sedimentation methods: a good quality spectrophotometer (with the proviso that appreciable amounts of low angle scattered radiation are not detected) can be used. 10. coNclustoNs As stressed at the start of this article, polysaccharides are charac- terized by large deviations from ideal behaviour in the thermo- dynamic sense due to expanded or asymmetric conformations compared to globular proteins, often due to single or multistranded stiffchains and/or high linear charge densities. In 'Haug's triangle' (Fig. 23), where the three idealized macromolecular conformations are put at the corners of the triangle, the polysaccharides generally behave somewhat intermediate between the randomly coiling and136S. E. HARDINC et ai. soLl S PH ERE STIFF ROD RANDOM COI L Figure 23. Haug's triangle. The three idealized macromolecular conformations are put at the corners of the triangle. the stiff rod conformation. and the near ideal behaviour of a polysaccharide is only encountered for the random coil in a g solvent. when selecting one particular method for molecular weight determination it is mandatory, as a general rule, to have a general understanding of the conformation to be expected from a knowledge of primary structure. For instance, if rapid measure- ment of the molecular weight should be sought for by one of the'relative' methods and the molecule is suspected to have a stiff extended conformation, this would suggest the use of viscometry and not sedimentation transport since the scaling exponent to the molecular weight in these two cases differs by more than a decade (Table 2). Another problem is that thermodynamic non-ideality (manifested in large second viriai coefficients) may be compensared for by a concentration driven aggregation of the macromolecules. Such systems may behave pseudo-ideal in an experiment as a resuit of two compensating effects. In such cases the use of different experimental methods with different responses to this behaviour is recommended.D oMolecular Weight Determination 137 Accuracy in moiecular weight determination must also be considered critically. The non-ideality in itself may cause large errors in any extrapoiation procedure. In addition. the lack of a simple accurate concentration determination technique (Section 2.2) can be the source of rather large uncertainties. Uncertainties in concentration determinations propagate to uncertainties in the determined molecular weight in addition to the measured physical quantity (osmotic pressure, scattered light). This means that molecular weights of polysaccharides can rarely be determined to a higher precision than 5-10% relative uncertainty. This is in contrast to proteins and DNA whose mol- ecular weights can be determined precisely from their primary sequence. When looking ahead. what are the improvements to be forseen in the near future? For protein characterizatron the advent of the SDS-gel electrophoresis system has made possible rather accurate molecular weight determinations with minute sampie requirements. Are any such developments to be expected in the polysaccharide field? The first answer is no. A poiydisperse macromolecular popu- lation cannot be determined and described with the same simplicity as the monodisperse proteins. The on-line techniques (Section 8), where molecular weight separations and molecular weight deter- minations are performed in sequence, promise a future with more of a routine approach to the present difficult molecular weight, molecular weight averages and distribution determinations of polysaccharides.
