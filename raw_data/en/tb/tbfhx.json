But evidences support their specific [biological]and [therapeutic effects]. The reason behind this is [thought]to be [water]structure characteristic of the original [drug]. Spectroscopic studies indicate that the specific [water]structure in HDs can be resolved into serial [dilution]and mechanical agitation, and are called potencies. The objective of the present study is to further confirm the presence of CHCs in the two potencies of three [drugs]. [Electronic]spectra of the HDs of the potencies indicate two broad peaks and marked difference in intensities of [absorption]. Furior Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the test potencies and their control show difference in intensity shift and contour shape of OH stretching and bending bands. All the experimental data indicate the presence of CHCs in varying amounts in the test potencies. Full text: Available Collection: "}
