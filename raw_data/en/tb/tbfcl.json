His writing reveals his decades-long career in healing as well as his own spiritual experiences, encounters with elementals, and his deep understanding of spiritual streams. Are's work has helped me understand so much of what I have experienced personally and professionally, through the Akashic Records, working with clients and throughout my life. It's part of a larger conversation regarding the spiritual world: That it's not something outside of us... but rather as spiritual beings, it informs every aspect of our lived experience, especially our health. In this potent interview, we talk about Are's experience being able to see spiritual beings, including elements, nature spirits, and demons - he does a breakdown of the spiritual world and dimensions, including the elemental, etheric and astral worlds, as well as the layer that contains demons. We discuss how demonic beings are created and humanity's great burden and destiny in this process. How disease patterns are connected to demons, and created and \"translocated\" from person to person, especially from adults to children and animals. Are shares the important difference between translocating vs transforming disease and demons, and why most modern forms of medicine only translocate (which according to Are is not enough). Are tells us how to truly transform demons, and therefore access real healing, and the power of Christ Consciousness. Our chat includes practices to assist in expanding one's intuitive gifts including clairvoyance, advice on best practices for spiritual protection, and Are and I share our own personal experiences with demons and navigating the spiritual realms. We touch on curses, addictions, genetic disease patterns, karma and so much more.
