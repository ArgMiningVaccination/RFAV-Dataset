While millions of people across Ontario have received their COVID-19 vaccine, we know you may have questions about vaccines for children (aged fve to 11) and youth (aged 12-17). Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions. 1. Why should my child get the COVID-19 vaccine? V accinating children and youth will provide them with a strong level of protection against COVID-19 and the highly contagious Delta variant, keep schools safer and open, and stop the spread of the virus. This will help protect other family members t oo, such as those under fve years old who can't get vaccinated yet, or more vulnerable elderly individuals. 2. Has the COVID-19 vaccine been thoroughly tested for children and youth? How do I know it's safe? Health Canada has one of the most rigorous scientifc review systems in the world and only approves a vaccine if it is safe, works, and meets the highest manufacturing and quality standards. After a thorough and independent scientifc review of the evidence, Health Canada determined that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and efective at providing a strong immune response against COVID-19 in children and youth. For children aged fve to 11, Health Canada has authorized a two-dose series of the paediatric Pfzer vaccine, which is a distinct formulation at a lower dose designed specifcally for the paediatric population, than the two-dose regimen authorized for people ages 12 and older. 3. Aren't COVID-19 symptoms milder for children and youth? While children and youth who get infected with COVID-19 typically experience mild symptoms, some can get very sick, require hospitalization and/or ICU admission, and can experience more serious and longer-lasting symptoms (i.e. long COVID, post-acute COVID-19 syndrome). The COVID-19 vaccine will help your child fght of the virus more easily if they are infected and make their symptoms milder. Not only will the vaccine protect children and youth from the harmful impact of COVID-19, it will also lower the risk of transmission to others and allow them to continue fostering their mental health and well-being through in-person learning, extracurricular activities and social interactions with family, friends and peers.

Children aged fve to 11 will receive the paediatric Pfzer vaccine, which is a distinct formulation at a lower dose of one-third the amount given to individuals aged 12 and older, in a two-dose series at a recommended interval of eight weeks. 5. Have the long-term side efects of the COVID-19 vaccine for children been determined? The benefts of getting vaccinated and being protected against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks of any side efects from the vaccine. COVID-19 infection may cause longer-lasting symptoms and health problems for some people, including children, which is why it's important to get vaccinated as soon as possible. 6. How common is myocarditis and/or pericarditis in youth? A very small number of cases of myocarditis (infammation of the heart muscle) and/or pericarditis (infammation of lining outside the heart) following vaccination have been reported. Most cases occurred in young adult males between 18 and 30 years of age after the second dose of vaccine, and most had mild illness and recovered quickly. Myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines remains a rare adverse event following immunization (AEFI), which is defned by the Canadian Immunization Guide as occurring at frequency of 0.01 per cent to less than 0.1 per cent. The N ational Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) continues to recommend vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for all individuals aged fve and older since the vaccines are highly efective at preventing symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, death) from COVID-19. Myocarditis and pericarditis are more likely to occur after a COVID-19 infection than after COVID-19 vaccines. 7. What will the vaccination experience be like for my child? A number of locations ofering the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged fve to 11 will be customized to ensure a child-friendly environment. This includes providing sensory-friendly clinic options such as reduced noise and reduced bright lights, and setting up clinics to ofer privacy like cubicles or family pods so you can be with your child when they receive the vaccine. In addition, all public health units will ofer select clinics at or near schools to facilitate access and provide another safe environment to administer the vaccine to this age group. Clinics will be ofered primarily after school hours (e.g. evenings and weekends) to support convenient and welcoming options for children and families. Parents or substitute decision makers of children aged fve to 11 will, for the most part, have to provide consent on behalf of your child at the time of the appointment or fll out a paper consent form for your child.

Like any vaccination, your child may experience mild side efects and reactions that will subside anywhere from a few hours to a few days after vaccination. These side efects are part of their body's eforts to build immunity to COVID-19 following vaccination. Common side efects may include redness and swelling on the arm where the vaccine was given, tiredness, muscle soreness, headache or mild fever. If your child develops side efects that are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days, please contact a health care provider. 9. What should my child do if they experience side efects after getting the vaccine? Applying a cool, damp cloth where the vaccine was given may help with soreness and swelling. If needed, speak to your doctor about over-the-counter pain or fever medication, which may help with side efects such as headache, muscle pain and fever. It is generally not recommended to take medication before vaccination to try to prevent side efects. 10. Will the COVID-19 vaccine impact my child's fertility? COVID-19 vaccines do not cause male or female infertility and there is no evidence to suggest that they will cause future infertility. 11. Won't the COVID-19 vaccine put my child at risk for an allergic reaction? Serious allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are very rare and can be treated. To be safe, everyone who gets vaccinated is monitored for at least 15 minutes in case an allergic reaction occurs. If you think your child might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, go to the nearest emergency department or call 911. Signs of an allergic reaction could include having trouble breathing, developing hives or swelling in the face and throat. If your child has a history of allergic reactions to vaccines or medication, please discuss this with your child's doctor prior to vaccination. 12. Will children receive proof that they are vaccinated? Yes. Vaccine certifcates with QR codes will be available for children aged fve to 11 on the COVID-19 vaccination portal as a record of their vaccination. However, there are no requirements for children aged fve to 11 to show proof of vaccination in Ontario. There may be diferent requirements in other jurisdictions. 13.
