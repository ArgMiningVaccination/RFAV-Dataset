The HSS Focus Group HSS believes an Glenn S. Podonsky Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer The Office of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) is the Department of Energy's (DOE) corporate organization responsible for health, safety, environment, and security providing corporate leadership and strategic vision to coordinate and integrate these vital programs. HSS is responsible for policy development and technical assistance; corporate analysis; corporate safety and security programs; education and training; complex-wide independent oversight; and enforcement. The Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer advises the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary on all matters related to health, safety and security across the complex. Through its research on sustainability and industry's successful use of its concept, HSS has a clear idea of the types of organizations with which it would be beneficial to collaborate on sustainability. Such outreach efforts provide a cooperative advantage of sustaining an organization's efficiency and vitality by bringing together creative thought and diverse viewpoints toward common goals while demonstrating leadership's commitment to listening to and reflecting the concerns and issues of its As the first phase of its outreach efforts, HSS created a Focus Group forum. forum integrates senior HSS managers from across the organization to discuss and address topics and issues of interest to DOE managers and stakeholders. The objective of the Focus Group is to establish a means for responding to questions and concerns regarding HSS initiatives and activities for improving, the health, safety, and environmental and security performance within the Department and to maintain an ongoing dialogue with involved parties supportive of these efforts. outcome of these continuing discussions and collaborations will be improved worker health and safety programs and the solidification of a safety culture at DOE sites. HSS Visiting Speaker Program The next phase of HSS outreach activities is the creation of the Visiting Speaker Program. The Visiting Speaker Program consists of presentations by leaders drawn from a variety of disciplines to include business, organizational theory, performance management, sustainability, and organizational resilience, made to HSS management and selected attendees from other interested organizations (i.e., Office of Science, Office of Environmental Management, and the National Nuclear Security Administration). The program is intended to focus agency attention at the management level to the emerging challenges and issues threa tening the national security and economic prosperity of the United States. DOE's mission, supported by HSS and other agency organizations, requires the most efficient and resilient leadership and organizational structure for successful mission completion and the continued safety, se curity, and prosperity of the nation. By inviting and having presenters from the wide range of public and private sector organizations, HSS is encouraging the transformation of government and demonstrating the various stages for change. This includes understanding the depth of the global issues, need for change, tools and means for transformation, and knowing the appropriate performance measurements to deter mine success and implement evolving management initiatives.

This report provides a compelling, short and easily accessible analysis of the key trends underpinning future skills challenges and oppor- tunities in the United States. Drawing upon the Council's leadership in innovative capacity, Thrive is the rst in a series of targeted benchmarking reports published by the Council's Compete 2.0 Initiative. These reports will illuminate key areas of competi - tive advantage for Americans to succeed in the 21st century and provide an important framework for charting a path to prosperity for American citizens. Grounded in the Council's overall policy agenda, the Compete 2.0 Initiative was launched in January 2008 to dive deeper into some of the key issues at the cutting-edge of global competitiveness that the Council highlighted in its 2006 Competitiveness Index: Where America Stands: skills; manufactur - ing; nancial markets; infrastructure; and healthcare. With the Compete 2.0 Initiative, the Council will set a concrete action agenda to ensure that the United States can compete in the 21st century. To achieve this, the Council will publish benchmarking reports for each of these areas over the next two years and convene a series of outreach events centered on each report, targeting a diverse audience. Com - pete 2.0 will culminate with the publication of the Council's 2009 Competitiveness Index. For this initiative, the Council convened a diverse and distinguished group of thought leaders from industry, academia and labor. We are very grateful to these advisors for so generously giving us their time and wisdom, providing guidance and feedback on this report, and serving as spokespeople for the initiative's outreach efforts. I would also like to acknowledge the Council's Compete 2.0 team for their outstanding work: Debra van Opstal, senior vice president for programs and policy; Chad Evans, vice president for strategic initiatives; Bill Bates, vice president for government affairs; and James Knuckles, research associate. The United States is approaching a tipping point as the competition becomes ever more innovative, and the Council's Compete 2.0 Initiative will address how the United States can harness its intellectual, nancial, entrepreneurial and human capital to en - sure prosperity for all Americans in the 21st century. As we move forward, we welcome your participation and support. Sincerely, Deborah L. Wince-Smith President 5 Norman R.

Policy-makers must recognize that the margin of advantage will flow from the fusion of cutting-edge capabilities with entrepreneurial, creative and interdisciplinary talent. Four potential areas to start with to create competitive advantage: More integrative scientists and engineers More entrepreneurial scientists and engineers More business-savvy service scientists and engineers More computational scientists and engineers to leverage America's IT advantage Create Skills for Sustainability Sustainability will become a more important determi - nant of global hiring and investment patterns. Where new and growing companies locate and where jobs are created will depend in large measure on which countries successfully anticipate these opportunities and take steps to educate and train workers in these elds. America must get out front and move fast to develop the talent and skills workforce to capture these opportunities. Competing in the Global Economy Globalization is a game-changer. The competition has evolved and the playing eld is more competi - tive. Global enterprises and networks that transcend national boundaries, hundreds of millions of middle- class consumers that reside outside the United States, and millions of new, sometimes highly credentialed workers whose average salaries are typically lower than the average American salary, all increasingly shape and mold the world's competi - tive landscape. The United States' human capital, entrepreneurial culture and can-do spirit are some of the nation's strongest assets. But America will need new and proactive skills for success to ensure that we optimize those assets. These Choices Are Ours to Make. The Future Is Ours to Lose. 7 Creating the Contex t As in the past, America today faces a period of economic transition and turbulence. Globalization and trade decits, unprecedented competition in the world economy, an accelerating pace of technol - ogy change, and volatility in energy and nancial markets pose great economic challenges as well as opportunities. There is no question that America needs to respond. America's strength lies in a spirit that says: \"The difcult we do immediately; the impossible might take a little longer.\" 1 America should concentrate its ingenuity, innovation and pragmatism on creating the strategies that will enable the country to com - pete successfully in the 21st century. Some of the most critical strategies must focus around talent and skills\u2014to ensure that America's workers have the tools to compete against anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world. In the emerging global economy of the 21st century, human capital is becoming the dominant competitive differentiator\u2014 for countries, companies and citizens. Thrive: The Skills Imperative lays out a roadmap of the skills priorities for Americans to prosper in the jobs of the future. Wanted: A National Skills Strategy There are major demographic, educational and technological changes underway that could impede America's economic growth in the decades ahead: slowing growth in the U.S. workforce and fl atten - ing growth rates in educational attainment; growing competition from skilled workers around the world; and the ability to locate operations around the world wherever the right skills, infrastructure and incen - tives exist. A national skills strategy could mitigate many of these trends. Such a strategy has become an imperative to ensure that Americans have the skills to respond to current demands and to ensure that global companies invest in the United States. The trajectories and potential impact of each of these trends are briefly described in this report. Economic Impact of a Slower Growth Workforce For more than ve decades, a growing labor force was one of the key drivers of the expanding U.S. economy. Driven by the baby boom generation and the entry of women into the workforce, the sheer growth of new entrants grew the economic pie by about 1.7 percent each year between 1948 and 2001. 2 Council on Competitiveness8 Norman R.

In the early part of the present The Skills Imperative Falling Off the Flat Earth? Retired Chairman & CEO Lockheed Martin Corporation Global leadership has come to be accepted by many Americans as our country's birthright. However, we would be wise to keep in mind that in the 16th century, it was Spain that was the dominant nation; in the 17th century, it was France; in the 19th century, it was England; and in the 20th century, it was America. The book hasn't been written on the 21st century yet, but it is clear that no nation has an entitlement to the future. The United States is entering a global era in which Americans will have to compete for jobs in a global marketplace\u2014not only with their neighbors down the street, around the world. The change stems from what some have called \"The Death of Distance.\" In the last century, breakthroughs in aviation created the opportunity to century, we are approaching the point where the communication, storage and processing of information are nearly free.

Today, it is possible that our nation's adult generation will, for the rst time in history, leave their children and grandchildren a lower sustained standard of living than they themselves enjoyed. Should that occur, it will and indicate that we have entered a new era, a global era, an era in which Americans must compete in the marketplace not merely with each other but with highly qualied people around the planet. It will represent a change of seismic proportions with commensurate implications for America's economic well-being, national and homeland security, health care and overall standard of living.

Growth in the labor force is slowing down as baby boomers retire and participation rates (especially by women) level off. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor force growth will slow to below 0.5 percent by 2020 before increasing again to only around 0.5 percent by 2040. 3 If the U.S. economy must rely on fewer workers to sustain growth and support baby boom retirees, then those workers must become more productive if they are to preserve their living standard and that of their fellow citizens. Absent accelerating improvements in productivity, a slower growing workforce could put a drag on future GDP growth. Flattening Growth of Educated Workers The economic impacts of slower growth in the labor pool can be offset by improvements in technology infrastructure that enhance productivity, by higher quality skills or skills better matched to demand, or PR O J E C TE D )'(' s )')' s )'*' s )'+' s by game-changing innovations that open up new high-value markets. 4 Higher education and skills tend to make workers more productive.5 For most of the 20th century, education drove steady increases in workforce quality; in every successive generation, the workers entering the labor force were more educated than those they replaced. That influx of better educated workers allowed employ - ers to exploit new technologies and create fl exible, adaptable workplaces that could respond better to a more dynamic business environment.6 But the growth rate in the number of educated workers entering the workforce is beginning to fl at- ten. Between 1980 and 2000, the increase in the number of workers with more than a high school education was 19 percent. For the next 20 years, the growth in educated workers is expected to slow to just 4 percent. Indicators point to a mismatch be - tween the demand for higher skills and the supply of skilled workers. 7 Council on Competitiveness10 The Skills Imperative The Global Skills Competition Perhaps the most profound change is the growth in educated and skilled workforces around the globe. Today, American workers at every skill level\u2014from low-wage, low-skilled to high-wage, high-skilled\u2014face growing competition from workers around the world. The global labor supply effectively quadrupled between 1980 and 2005. For example, China's labor force\u2014 those working or looking for work\u2014reached nearly 800 million in 2005, more than ve times the size of the U.S. labor force. China's manufacturing employment alone exceeds the manufacturing employment of the entire G7 by 30 million workers. The entry of lower-wage workers from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics is also changing the dynamics of the global labor pool. 8 2.

If a product, service or process is routine or can be broken down into a series of rules; if it can be digitized or reliably codied, it becomes a commodity. And its production is easier every day to ship digitally and rapidly to workers and consumers in other locations around the globe. Princeton economist Alan Blinder notes that the offshorability factor should play a role in determining what kinds of skills to cultivate for national competitive advantage. k11 3.

Increasingly, the critical distinction may no longer be between high-skilled and low-skilled jobs. Both are now offshorable. Blinder postulates that, in the future, the dividing line might fall between occupations that can be performed at a distance with little or no diminution in quality and those that cannot. By that denition, as many as 30-40 million U.S.-based jobs might be vulnerable to offshoring.9 Bottom Line As Compete 2.0 advisor Joseph Bordogna notes: competition, ultimately leading to a downward spiraling competition for low wages and lower margins. a dimension of innovation beyond competition is ensured.10 science and engineering.

Council on Competitiveness12 The Skills Imperative Skills Strategies for the Future America must be more strategic about charting the path of future opportunities for workers, prioritizing around skills that do not offshore easily and are hard-to-replicate, that enable a faster pace of innovation, and that are emerging with new technologies and industries. Key areas of opportunity for the future prosperity of America's workers include: Untapped Opportunities Service Economy Skills The Innovation Advantage Skills for Sustainability Untapped Opportunities The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that between 40 percent and 45 percent of all job openings in the economy through 2014 will be in middle-skilled occupations, compared to one-third in high-skilled occupations and 22 percent in low-skilled service occupations. 11 As professor Harry Holzer of the George - town University Public Policy Institute observes, many of these jobs do not offshore easily and pay relatively well. And a number of these occupations face critical shortfalls in skilled workers.12 Two trends affect this job category signicantly. Retiring baby boomers will create large vacancies in the low- to middle-skilled jobs. And immigrants are likely to ll the bottom- and top-skilled jobs more easily than those in the middle. Together, these trends will leave growing shortages of workers for middle-skilled jobs\u2014 those that require postsecondary education and training, but not necessarily a bachelor's degree. 13 13 U.S. E M P L OYM E NT (M I LLI ON S) 4.

Maintenance technicians are `bout to retire, Company executives got no one to hire, How safe does it make you feel? How safe does it make you feel?\" \"The Maintenance Crisis Song\" by Joel Leonard Many experts, including myself, believe that America is in the midst of a major maintenance crisis caused by: 1) the millions of retiring skilled maintenance technicians and maintenance profession- als; 2) lack of interest by future generations; 3) companies that are installing increasingly complex, new equipment with no or minimal budget allocated for additional training; and 4) old equipment that continues to age and requires more maintenance. A perfect maintenance storm is brewing\u2014 and is forming largely under the radar screen. The basic question that every company should be asking is: \"What is the product of the maintenance depart- ment?\" The typical answer will be reactive\u2014to repair broken equipment. But the real product of the main-tenance department is not repair; it is capacity. Even as companies are substituting technology for labor in machine operations, they need more maintenance workers for the machines themselves. The highly sophis- When people think of this eld, they see Bubba and Skeeter. But the maintenance stereotype of grease monkeys is way off the mark.

We cannot neglect the proper maintenance of the hydraulic, electronic and electrical sys- tems that sustain us today as we strive to develop biotech and nanotech solutions for tomorrow. If we can become the \"Reliability Nation\" by building a strong foundation of skilled technicians, uptime performance 15 Looming Shortfalls Demand for these types of skills will only grow dur - ing the next decade with the retirements of current workers. For example: Maintenance Workers For every 10 workers who retire, there are only three to seven to replace them, creating a shortage of skilled men and women who are trained to keep complex machines operating. 16 Auto Mechanics The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that auto repair shops nationwide face an annual shortage of about 35,000 auto technicians through 2010. 17 Welders According to the American Welding Society and other industry research, average welders are in their mid-fties, with many approaching 60 years old. Estimates suggest that more than half of the indus-try's highly trained workforce is nearing retirement, creating a potential shortage of more than 200,000 skilled welders by 2010. 18 Electric Power Workforce The average age of the power workforce is nearing 50\u2014half of the country's 412,000 power workers are expected to retire in the next 10 years. A 2004 Edison Electric Institute survey shows that approxi - mately 20 percent of the electric transmission work - force is expected to retire in the next ve years.19 The society that scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a humble activity, and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because philosophy is an exalted activity, will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy.

The Changing Landscape of Education Judith F. Cardenas President Workforce development, a key role of the comprehensive community col-lege, is about more than just providing training for existing jobs. It is about building capacity for new jobs, about developing an educated and entrepre- neurial population, and about creating ladders for learners to access learning throughout their entire lives. It is tied tightly to the community college/four-year transfer function, community responsiveness and developmental course- work roles of colleges. These functions bundled together create a strong response to community needs. Workforce and economic development activities are fueled both by those who are creating work and by those who need work. This urgency reminds me of an African proverb from Thomas Friedman's book about the changing nature of work, found in It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. It knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn't matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle.

But it is time for a reality check. During the period that America was making a transition to a service economy, the GDP more than doubled from $6 trillion in 1991 to nearly $14 trillion today, and the economy accommodated millions of new college graduates. 21 Service Economy: Engine of Economic and Job Growth The service economy is an engine of wealth cre - ation. It now accounts for the lion's share of U.S. jobs and gross domestic product. 22 The stereotype of low-skilled service jobs actually represents only a small percentage\u2014just 22 percent \u2014of the large and growing service employment in the United States. More than 30 percent of service jobs are in the highest skill category of pro - fessional, technical, managerial and administrative occupations which tend to be knowledge-intensive, using the latest collaboration and communications technologies. 23 Services account for 75 percent of all jobs in the United States today.

James C. Spohrer Director of Service Research We hear a lot about the service economy, but what is it really? To understand the nature of the service economy, get a piece of paper and start making a list of all the times you're in the role of a customer during the course of a day. Start commute to work (transportation services), boot up your computer (information services), grab a sandwich at your desk (retail food services), check your bank balance (nancial services), or put your feet up and watch TV (entertainment services). We are all in the role of customers of service systems about 40 times a day.

These mass-production successes required rigorous discipline and narrow skill. As the world got richer, the competition shifted rapidly to new kinds of add - ed value that required new kinds of skill. More of the value-added of manufacturing began to come from the services associated with production: marketing; nancing; This approach to the service economy embraces, and does not exclude, manufacturing. To a large extent, the demarcation line between services and manufacturing is a relic of an outmoded data collec - tion system. The most competitive companies today bundle products and services\u2014and with good reason. With the rapid pace of technology diffusion, even advanced products can be commoditized. Integrat - ing services into the mix changes the value hierarchy and transforms the revenue stream. In the wireless industry, the prots come from voice and data services, and not from the sale of phones and devices. Jet engine manufacturers do not just sell engines and spare parts, but also propulsion services that continue to generate revenues through the product's lifespan\u2014ve times more revenues than the original sales price. Manufacturing companies are transforming themselves from product suppliers into solutions providers and com - peting on customer satisfaction and innovation. What they need are workers with the skills to meet these new demands. Council on Competitiveness20 The Skills Imperative That growth in value-added services is driving de - mand for higher-skilled and more educated workers.

Education and Market Advantage For many people, \"globalization\" conjures up images of worldwide compe- tition for jobs, resources and markets. It holds out the promise of a more equitable, interconnected world and the challenge of preserving our position of economic, political and cultural leadership. It is only when we start to tease apart what globalization is that we start to get a better understanding of Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich recently said: \"Underlying all the debates you are advantaged in the global economy. You have a larger and larger market for your intellectual capital.\" by its problems, the successful global workforce is one that excels at problem solving\u2014and solving today's complex, global problems requires innovation. Developing a globally attuned, innovative workforce involves widening the scope of educational experiences for our students beyond our borders, giving them opportunities to confront and solve real-world problems and bring together other disciplines, insights and approaches in novel ways. Such opportunities are not Interdisciplinary education, research and collaboration help students expand their world view, as does cre- ating opportunities for students to be entrepreneurial and work with practicing professionals.

Other countries are building innovation ecosys - tems that have been successful in generating new knowledge and patents, producing technical talent in large quantities, attracting higher-value investment, and building local industrial capacity in cutting-edge technologies and services. There is no question that the capabilities of innovator nations are getting better\u2014in some cases, much better. Consider that: R&D employment by American multinationals overseas is growing\u2014about 76 percent during the last 10 years\u2014while the growth in R&D employ - ment by foreign multinationals in the United States peaked in 1999 and has been declining. The U.S. share of the world's scientists and engi - neers is projected to fall from 40 percent in 1975 to 15 percent in 2010. 29 America's share of global foreign direct invest - ment (FDI) inflows has declined from its peak of 21 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2005, although FDI inflows to the United States have recently been on the rise. In 2000, the United States accounted for 20 per - cent of the world's high technology exports while China accounted for only 4 percent. As recent as 2005, however, the U.S. share of global high- tech exports dropped to 15 percent while China's share increased to more than 14 percent. 30 In recognition of this changing competitive land - scape, Congress passed the America COMPETES Act in 2007 , which sought to restore technological leadership with signicantly increased funding for frontier research, math and science education, and incentives to graduate more scientists and engi - neers. The critical issue going forward is to ensure adequate funding for these programs. Sustaining America's competitive edge requires both committ - ment and action. 8.

The U.S. margin of leadership may depend not just on doing more, but on a strategy for doing things differently. If the competition has successfully imitated the American innovation model, then we should be thinking about the new model that will differentiate U.S. capabilities from the rest of the world. America must be as innovative in talent as it is in technology. Certainly, it will be critical to lead in the elds that are reshaping the global competitiveness landscape\u2014for example, nanotechnology, biotechnology and information technologies. But America must also build on core talents and combinations of skills that differentiate and create a margin of advantage at the innovation frontier, including: Educating Renaissance Scientists and Engineers Creating a Cadre of Service Scientists Leveraging Leadership in Computational Technologies Educating Renaissance Scientists and Engineers Science and engineering have become part of global enterprise, and for the rst time, American scientists and engineers are competing head-to-head with their counterparts in other countries.

Duderstadt notes that: America does not need just more engineers, it needs a new kind of engineer. To compete with talented engineers in other nations, in far greater numbers and with far lower wage structures, American engineers must be able to add signi cantly more value than their counterparts abroad through their greater intellectual span, their capacity to innovate, their entrepreneurial zeal and their ability to address the grand challenges facing our world. 31 When faced with robust competition from scientists and engineers from around the world, American scientists and engineers must augment their creden - tials with other capabilities to sustain a leadership position. Today's science and engineering students need to have a robust knowledge not only of disci - plines, but of other combinations of skills as well\u2014 effective communications, entrepreneurial initiative, creativity and inventiveness. To sustain America's margin of leadership, 21st century scientists and engineers need to be innova - tors with an understanding of business value and an ability to work in multi-cultural environments. They need leadership skills with a flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and a willingness to engage in lifelong learning. This requires a commitment by America's leading educational institutions to a different curriculum in both the sciences and engi - neering than we have today. Creating a Cadre of Service Scientists Although the knowledge-intensive service economy is a principle driver of economic growth, there is a dearth of research, funding, and educational cur - riculum to accelerate America's capacity for service innovation and productivity. A recent essay, \"The Service Imperative,\" notes that: Even today relatively few rms have formalized services R&D practices. When Business Week annually reports the list of the World's Most Innovative Companies, few service companies appear on that list. A major academic review article on product innovation reveals little explicit attention to service innovation in the academic literature. According to a 2005 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: \"The sector has traditionally been seen as less innovative than manufacturing and as playing only a supportive role in the inno - vation system.\" 32 Y et, the ability to drive innovation in services is going to be increasingly important to economic competitiveness. Services are in the early stages of \"industrialization.\" The industrial age was enabled by three factors: cheap energy; transportation networks; and stan - dardized parts that enabled mass production. The infrastructure for services is evolving along roughly comparable paths. Computing is the analogue for cheap energy that powers the service industry. The Internet and worldwide communications networks provide a global infrastructure backbone. And stan - dardization is already becoming available in some sectors. In the travel sector, for example, Web sites such as Travelocity or Expedia.com customize travel packages assembled from discrete providers.33 The challenge is that the assembly of complex ser - vice systems still remains a trial and error process rather than a predictable discipline. Proponents of a new discipline of service science seek to create a more systematic understanding of how to drive 25 Choose to Compete National Academy of Engineering of the world. Charles M. Vest President Look back about 25 years and think about what was not going on. There was no World Wide Web. Cell phones and wireless communication were in the embryonic stage. The big challenge was the inability of the American manufacturing sector to compete in world markets; Japan was about to bury us economically. The human genome had not been sequenced. There were no carbon nanotubes. Buckminster Fullerines had been around for about ve years. We hadn't even begun to inflate the dot-com bubble, let alone watch it burst. And terrorism was something that happened in other parts Some of the grandest accomplishments in human history were engineered in the century just passed. The widespread development and distribution of electricity and clean water, automobiles and airplanes, radio and television, spacecraft and lasers, antibiotics and medi- cal imaging, and computers and the Internet are just some of the changes that transformed virtually every aspect of human life. The century ahead poses even more formidable challenges. As the population grows and its needs and de- sires expand, the problem of sustaining civilization's continuing advancement, while still improving the quality of life, looms more immediate. Old and new threats to personal and public health demand more effective and more readily available treatments. Vulnerabilities to pandemic diseases, terrorist violence and natural disasters require serious searches for new methods of protection and prevention. Breakthroughs in energy security and sustainability\u2014whether a revolution in solar cells or sequestering carbon generated by burning fossil fuels or nuclear fusion\u2014would be game-changing in important ways. The world is changing remarkably fast, and leadership in science and engineering will drive it. Where will this leadership come from? China? India? The United States? That choice is ours to make. Choosing to compete means that United States must lead in brainpower, organization and innovation.

How to make innovation and creativity inside the company\u2014intrapreneurship\u2014as relevant to national competitiveness and growth as entrepreneurship? 35 How to anticipate customers' demands and un - derstand their real needs? Henry Ford once said: \"If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have said a faster horse.\" 36 How to create an organization in which collective learning becomes a practice, not just a process? 37 How to design metrics for effectiveness, not just ef ciency? 38 How to understand the fundamentals of service sector productivity and develop models to accel - erate productivity growth? 27 The principles of service science remain nascent. But the country that masters this discipline\u2014and produces a cadre of service scientists and engineers who are able to accelerate innovation and productiv - ity in service industries\u2014has a clear advantage in attracting high-value service investments and creating high-value service jobs. The Japanese were the rst to master product quality, but so far, no nation has mastered service science, management and engineering. Leverage Leadership in Computational Technologies Ongoing research at the Council on Competitive - ness is demonstrating that, in the 21st century, \"to outcompute is to outcompete.\" America clearly has the technological edge. The most powerful comput - ing systems in the world are in the United States, but America lacks sufcient numbers of computational scientists to exploit its leadership position. Accord - ing to Council surveys, the biggest single constraint on the deployment of advanced computation tools is the lack of computational scientists. At the frontiers of science and engineering, ad - vanced computation has become a major element of the third leg of discovery tools\u2014the other two legs being theory and experimentation. Computer model - ing and simulation dramatically accelerate the pace of innovation\u2014and enable new-to-the-world knowl - edge and insights. But the business benets of advanced computing are also becoming clear to the minority of compa - nies that are able to use it. Leading companies are proving out the advantages of leveraging compu - tational capabilities: accelerating design and engi - neering of new products; reducing time to market through virtual prototyping; and increasing supply chain efciency and fl exibility. Consider that: In 1980, Boeing tested 77 wings in wind tunnels for the 767 . Thanks primarily to high performance computing (HPC) simulation, Boeing needed to physically test only 11 wings for the 787 Dreamliner series, dramatically cutting costs and design time. Entertainment leader DreamWorks Animation SKG would not even exist without powerful computer graphics technology. Every movie is generated on a HPC system. At The Proctor & Gamble Company, computation - al analysis is used for everything from increasing absorbency in Pampers \u00ae diapers to designing the right geometric shape for Pringles\u00ae potato chips\u2014 one that allows the chip to drop gently into a con - tainer rather than flying off the conveyor belt.39 Wal-Mart optimizes its entire supply chain on computer models, including daily data analysis to determine what to stock in every store worldwide. 40 On any given day at the NASDAQ Exchange, more than two billion transactions are processed at rates of more than 200,000 transactions per second. The secret sauce is the ability to use computer modeling to increase volume and trans - action speed reliably.41 America's innovation advantage rests not just on having the most advanced tools and technologies in the world, but the people to use them.

Information technologies, nano- technologies and biotechnologies all hold out tic talent as well as technology and creating the competitive difference that will concentrate cutting-edge investments in this country. Council on Competitiveness28 The Skills Imperative Skills For Sustainability Looking ahead, skills for sustainability could become a key competitive differentiator. As Joseph Stanislaw has noted: \"We are at the very beginning of a global race to create dominant green economies.\"42 Global warming and competition for resources could very well change the ground rules of globalization\u2014at the very least, the need to reduce carbon footprints and achieve higher resource productivity could alter corporate calculations about where and how to distribute operations and assets globally. This trend may have already begun among the leading compa - nies. Consider that The Proctor & Gamble Company is putting its rst domestic green eld manufacturing plant in the United States in more than three de - cades to be proximate to West Coast consumers. America could get out in front of this paradigm shift. But it is not clear that the United States will have enough talent with the right set of skills, or has even dened the path forward on skills for sustainability. America's Scarcest Sustainable Resource? An Energy Workforce Ironically, many of the \"green skills\" that have re - ceived the most attention are not actually new skills, but relabeled ones. Nowhere is this more evident than in the energy industries. The lack of energy workers actually constitutes one of the greatest barriers to more sustainable energy, according to a recent Council report, Dene: The Energy-Competi- tiveness Relationship. Consider that: The average age for energy workers is 50, nearly a full decade older than the average age of all U.S. workers. At least half of the country's utility workers are expected to retire in the next 10 years. 43 More than half the oil and gas workforce is ex - pected to retire in the next 10 years at all skill levels, from equipment operators and truck drivers, to scientists and engineers. Enrollment in under - graduate engineering programs fell by 79 percent between 1982 and 2004.44 A 2005 study by the Nuclear Energy Institute found that half of the industry's employees were more than 47 years old, while less than 8 percent of employees were younger than 32. The survey found that more than a quarter of nuclear workers were already eligible to stop working. The number of nuclear engineering majors at colleges around the country has risen to 1,800 last year from just 500 in 1998, according to the Energy De - partment, but that is still not enough to feed current needs. 45 In many of these areas, new skills are not required, just adequate numbers of workers who have them. For example, the skills needed to operate a turbine do not depend on whether wind or petroleum turns the blade. Boiler maintenance does not change because solar power heats the water. And the need to have an efcient and effective electric power grid does not change by what generates the electrons. Sustainable energy requires, rst and foremost, a workforce capable of supplying America's basic energy needs. 29 Skills for Sustainability: Training for the U.S. 's Workforce David F. Carney Chairman and CEO Lincoln Educational Services Corporation The common perception in America today is that you need a college education to obtain a rewarding career. Consequently, parents and high school counselors are increasingly pushing students to attend college even when they know that college is not the right choice for many young people. As a result, tens of thousands of students every year drop out or graduate without skills to obtain a job. This focus on college has created a shortage of skilled workers across the United States in many careers from nurses to automotive technicians and welders. For example the American Welding Society predicts that by 2010 the demand for welders will exceed supply by approximately 200,000 workers. Entry level welders with some skills can earn up to $30,000 while more advanced welders with experience can earn $60,000 to $100,000. Here is a job that is in demand and pays well. However, if current trends continue, the U.S. will be importing welders in order to meet demand. For Lincoln Educational Services, the key to sustainability and competitiveness is a skilled workforce. Since our founding in 1946, Lincoln has been committed to providing students with quality, hands-on skills training needed to succeed in an ever-changing employment landscape. We are proud to be providing enterprising men and women the ability to become mechanics, electricians, HVAC repair technicians, welders, and practi - cal nurses amongst other professions. We understand that many people prefer to work with their hands and to learn in an environment that incorporates industry experience with hands-on training. Additionally we understand that workers need to upgrade their skills without leaving their jobs, and that is why we have developed online degree programs. Specically we see a need for online management pro - grams that will enable workers who have started at the bottom of the company ladder to acquire skills that will enable them to move into management positions. These online degree programs enable working adults to better manage the pressures of job, family and education. Today we need to ensure that America has enough people with the skills to create, build and maintain a sustainable and growing economy. We need to educate parents, students and society as to the many job opportunities that continue to be available and to support training in these elds. Council on Competitiveness30 The Skills Imperative Educating for Sustainability In fact, sustainability may demand more profound changes in higher education than it does in skills training. Virtually every profession needs to embed principles of sustainability into its core curriculum. Although some leading institutions are experiment - ing with new programs, these have yet to become widely available or accepted practice. MBAs for Sustainability With new C-suite positions in sustainability, energy and environmental impact springing up across the country\u2014as well as demand for carbon analysts and carbon traders in the nancial sectors\u2014business schools will play a key role in educating a new generation of business leaders in sustainability. (At present, there is evidence that the principles are not always integrated across the enterprise. See Note 48.) Y et, the Aspen Institute survey, Beyond Grey Pinstripes, demonstrates that although business schools have begun to adopt course modules on the environment, much more needs to be done. The percentage of schools surveyed that now re - quire a course dedicated to business and society issues has increased dramatically from 34 percent in 2001 (when the survey began) to 63 percent in 2007 . And the proportion of schools offering envi - ronmental content in one required course has in - creased in most disciplines\u2014accounting, economics, management, marketing and strategy. 46 But sustainability practices have been slow to nd their way into the mainstream curriculum. Only 35 of the 112 business schools surveyed offer a concentration or major in these areas. According to Rich Leimsider, director of the Aspen Institute Center for Business Education:47 What we are not seeing in most schools is an ex - amination of these issues through the lens of risk management and strategy and the realization that mainstream, for-prot business can be a force for positive social and environmental change.48 Sustainable Design and Architecture William McDonough, Founding Partner of William McDonough + Partners, challenged the current col - lege curriculum in design and architecture, writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2004: Each year American colleges and universities hand out design degrees by the thousands... Have their college educations prepared them to be the designers of the 21st century world?... At a moment in our history when the scienti c community has warned of some technologies' negative consequences\u2014global warming, wa - ter pollution, the loss of biodiversity and natural resources\u2014designers have a crucial role to play in the creation of a more just, healthful and sustain - able world. Our colleges, by and large, are not preparing design students for that challenge. While design for sustainability is increasingly seen as an im - portant element of both basic and specialized courses, we still have a long way to go. Consider, for example, the 2003 Metropolis magazine sur - vey of more than 350 deans, department chairs and professors on the relevance of sustainability to design education. Although 67 percent of the respondents strongly agreed that sustainability is relevant to their design curricula, only 14 percent 31 said their institutions were developing programs to educate their instructors about sustainable design. When asked how many graduate courses their department offered that included consider - ations of sustainability, 28 percent said none and 45 percent said they did not know.49 McDonough envisions a world in which sustainable design is not limited to simply trying to become more efcient. Rather than teaching architecture students and designers how to reduce the impact of their work to meet environmental standards, colleges and universities, he argues, should create industrial and architectural systems for the 21st century that set wholly new standards that would: 50 introduce no hazardous materials into the air, water or soil measure prosperity by how much the positive effects of the human footprint are enhanced measure progress by how many buildings have no smokestacks or dangerous effl uents generate more energy than they consume These principles could be embedded across all disci - plines. Green chemistry could encourage the design of products and processes that reduce and even eliminate hazardous substances. Green engineers could apply sustainability principles to industrial processes and products that diminish environmen - tal and human hazards and reduce waste and cost. The accounting profession could play a central role both in providing the needed information for social and environmental reporting and helping to verify its accuracy. Public policy analysts can begin to connect ecological variables to economic ones. For example, the Brookings Institute recently completed a study that shows that an increase of a few percentage points in the water quality in the Great Lakes could drive billions of dollars in regional economic value. 51 Higher education institutes will play a pivotal role in assuring that Americans can understand and apply innovative new concepts for sustainability in every discipline and profession.

Council on Competitiveness32 The Skills Imperative Last Thought s Most Americans understand that globalization is a game-changer. But many are not sure that they are going to like the new game. For better or worse, the modern econ- omy is a global economy, which the United States can influence given the sheer size of its market. But America is no longer the sole economic superpower. The new global landscape is increasingly shaped by global enterprises and networks that transcend national boundaries, by hundreds of millions of new middle-class consumers that reside outside the United States, and by millions of new, sometimes highly credentialed workers whose average salaries are typically lower than the average American salary. What this enables is a redistribution of assets and operations on a global scale. The old rules no longer dictate who wins or loses. What is clear is that new strategies for success are needed to create the kind of platform that will en - sure that America's next generations enjoy a rising standard of living\u2014in short, to ensure that Americans can compete successfully. That requires that the focus be put on: Enabling the supply of middle-skilled jobs to match future demand Integrating the more complex skill sets required in service economy jobs into education, training and research programs Extending America's innovation leadership with a focus on integrative, interdisciplinary, computa - tional and entrepreneurial skills\u2014and with a new emphasis on supporting innovation in service industries Anticipating future skills trajectories at the cutting edge of sustainability The Goal Posts To create a skilled workforce, strengthen existing industries, launch new rms and attract high-value investment into the United States, we must act and invest wisely. America needs to prioritize around the kinds of investment that generate high-wage jobs. Success in the 21st century means looking for-ward\u2014positively and proactively\u2014at where the coun - try is going, not backward at who is catching up. The rest of the world has been copying the Ameri - can innovation model\u2014investing in talent, research, education and technology, and building a policy infrastructure that protects IP, opens markets and supports investment. Their success in attracting jobs and investments is, in some measure, due to the fact that they copied a great American roadmap. 33 When everyone is copying this model, it is time for America to invent a new one. Human capital is the nation's strongest asset. In assuring America's prosperity in the future, it is necessary to build from a position of strength\u2014not just economically, but culturally. America truly is the can-do country. From the nation's founding, explora - tion and experimentation has been part of its DNA. Americans need to get out in front and get out fast to translate that can-do spirit into wealth creation\u2014 creating a new roadmap that will: Embrace the freedom to test the frontiers of knowledge and technology Create the spectrum of skills that keeps a complex infrastructure humming Nurture the entrepreneurial spirit that risks a step into the unknown Enable the innovation that creates whole new industries, and Celebrate an innovation nation.

In a survey of over 1,000 exec - utives, the Economist Intelligence Unit found that almost one-third of all respondents report that their chairman or CEO is responsible for the company's sustainability policies, far more than any other position in the company. But the survey also shows that the amount of interaction with the person leading any sustainability efforts tends to shrink further down the management hierarchy. While the majority of board-level executives say they collaborate with the sustainability chief, only one third of junior managers do so. And two-thirds of respondents have not been consulted by their companies regarding how sustainability issues can be integrated into their daily jobs.

We believe that the insights generated at Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship, add a valu - able new dimension to the national debate about our energy future\u2014and our future competitiveness. The ESIS Initiative was launched in July 2007 in recognition of the fact that energy security and sustainability have become increasingly important factors of competitiveness in the 21st century. The overarching goal of this undertaking is to enhance U.S. competitiveness and energy security by shaping a public-private agenda to drive private sector de - mand for sustainable energy solutions and support the creation of new industries, markets and jobs. A diverse and distinguished Steering Committee comprised of leaders from industry, academia, labor, national labs and other prominent organizations is guiding the Council's efforts. The Steering Commit - tee is co-chaired by Shirley Ann Jackson, President of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; D. Michael Lang- ford, National President of the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO; and James W. Owens, Chair - man and Chief Executive Ofcer of Caterpillar Inc. We would like to thank the U.S. Department of Ener - gy for underwriting the Progressive Dialogue Series. We greatly appreciate the time and expertise that the Department's leadership is personally dedicating to this undertaking, particularly Secretary Samuel W. Bodman, Assistant Secretary for Energy Ef - ciency and Renewable Energy Alexander A. Karsner, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efciency and Renewable Energy John F. Mizroch and Ofce of Industrial Technology Programs leader Douglas E. Kaempf. We are also very grateful to the more than three dozen high-level experts and several ESIS Initiative Steering Committee members who gave so gener - ously of their time and wisdom over the course of two days at the Airlie Center. We are honoured to have had Daniel Y ergin deliver the evening's keynote address. Within the Council, I would like to acknowl - edge Susan Rochford, Lars-eric R\u00f6d\u00e9n and Kara Jones for doing the \"heavy lifting\" in conceptualizing and organizing the Dialogue. In 2008, the Council will conduct two more Pro - gressive Dialogues that will explore the role of the private sector\u2014as the leading innovators, investors and adopters of new energy sources, technologies and management practices and powerful change agents of our national energy system. The desire and ability of the private sector to move forward on these fronts are absolutely pivotal to our nation's success in achieving a more secure, sustainable and competitive energy future. As such, we will work to understand what influences organizational decision- making and investments related to energy and iden - tify the conditions that will drive and enable greater demand for sustainable energy solutions. We rmly believe that by creating the conditions that will foster private sector innovation and investment in more sustainable energy approaches, we can improve America's energy security and economic productivity and prosperity. As we move forward, we welcome your participation and support. Sincerely Deborah L.

Council on Competitiveness6 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship Executive Summary In the past forty years, worldwide energy consumption has nearly doubled, driven by population growth, rising living standards and the invention and wide-scale deployment of technologies, prod- ucts and services dependent upon energy to function. If present trends continue, global energy consumption will double again by mid-century. These demand pressures, coupled with periodic vol-atility in energy supplies, has put an upward pressure on energy prices in many parts of the world including the United States. The cost of energy is clearly impacting the competi - tiveness of the United States. But the story does not end there. The economic toll exacted by maintain - ing the current state of U.S. energy use, as well as the prospective windfall for ending it, has not been adequately captured or communicated in the context of national competitiveness. A more fulsome under - standing of the various ways in which energy is now impacting\u2014and driving\u2014U.S. productivity and global competitiveness will add a critical new dimension to the national debate. This articulation of the business case for action and a policy path forward will cre - ate the foundations of a public-private sector action agenda, while also adding momentum to the case for energy system change. To bring these issues to light the Council on Com - petitiveness convened 44 senior ofcials from U.S. industry, labor, government, academia and non-gov- ernmental organizations at the Airlie Center outside of Washington, D.C., to participate in the rst in a se - ries of three Progressive Dialogues being conducted under the auspices of the Council Energy Security, Innovation and Sustainability (ESIS) Initiative. The Dialogue series is made possible through the gen - erous support of the U.S. Department of Energy's Ofce of Energy Efciency and Renewable Energy. Over the course of two days a number of major competitiveness themes emerged from the expert discussions. These ndings are instructive, pointing a way for - ward for constructive action and change at the national, regional and enterprise level. National Competitiveness Findings The United States Is a Global Laggard in Energy Productivity. The United States is the most energy-intensive developed region today and lags behind its OECD competitors in improving energy productivity. At the same time, many developing regions are mak - ing rapid progress in reducing their energy inten - sity. To the extent that energy is an important part of production costs, the United States is losing competitive ground relative to its global competi - tors. Energy productivity, like labor and capital productivity, is important for wealth creation. The United States has underinvested in energy ef - ciency. American business leaders in general are not as knowledgeable or open to the economic opportunity inherent in improved energy manage - ment as they should be. U.S. Government Policies and Regulation Can Inhibit Energy Competitiveness. There are current policies in place that serve to maintain existing energy technologies, such as depreciation cycles meant to keep old coal plants running, input-based emission standards, rules against hanging wires over streets and subsidies. It may be better to reassess and reform or disas -Executive Summar y 7 semble these policies rather than simply layer new policies over existing ones. Lack of credible policy commitments, those that are sustained over adequate periods of time, can fail to motivate business behavior as intended. Local codes and state government policies can also inhibit the de - ployment of cleaner energy and energy ef ciency technologies. Transparent, Positive Price Signals Are a Key Ingredient in the Innovation Formula. To maintain competitiveness and pro tability go - ing forward, businesses increasingly need to un - derstand the signicant \"energy cost\" of products they make or resell. The assignment of a market price to carbon, done carefully, can be a driver of innovation. Rather than being framed as a puni - tive measure to curtail energy use, energy/carbon pricing will work best if businesses or consumers see it as a positive, motivating force to get more value for their money (example: miles-per-gallon ratings of automobiles). Public utilities should also expand the use of motivational pricing. It is impor - tant to build excitement around reform and tran - sition by carefully crafting policy and regulatory commitments that seek to motivate not through punitive measures but through incentives that reward innovation and action. America Faces a Severe Energy Workforce Challenge. Even as the demand for electricity continues to grow, the United States stands to lose half of the electric power industry workforce within the next ve to ten years due to retirement. America's oil and gas workforce averages 50 years in age. Half are likely to retire in just three years. New energy technologies will not compensate for this workforce shortage. There is also more competi -tion for talent today across countries and across sectors. Undergraduate students are not aware of the important role that electrical/mechanical engineers will play in addressing environmental challenges and that they could help solve real problems in this arena. More students are choos - ing careers in nance and business, and fewer are choosing science and engineering. Advanced placement courses are the key to college admis - sions, yet they are nearly devoid of engineering content. Much more needs to be done in K-12 education and beyond to promote careers in the energy eld. Consumers Are a Crucial Part of the Energy-Competitiveness Solution. More than 60 percent of energy demand growth is driven by individual consumers. The economy continues to grow despite rising energy prices, and American consumers keep absorbing the higher prices suggesting that the price elasticity threshold has not yet been crossed. To address the consumer role, we need to nd attractive ways to modify consumer behavior\u2014not primarily to use less energy, but to get more productivity out of given amounts of energy. We need energy- efcient products whose value to consumers can be articulated simply and concisely. We need to educate consumers better so that they can make wiser and more effective decisions, and we need better information about consumers so that we can pursue smarter innovation. An Integrated Policy Framework is Vital to Ensuring Economic Prosperity, Energy Security and Environmental Sustainability. We are confronted with the need to address mul - tiple imperatives at the same time. It is important that we take a systems approach to the various Council on Competitiveness8 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship choices and decisions ahead of us. This includes the assessment and design of public policy mea - sures. As state, regional and international energy and sustainability initiatives proliferate, we need to better understand how these are impacting the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete at the national and global level. This also applies to energy and related technology choices, as each source has its own benets and limitations. There are trade-offs across these areas, and it is important to employ life-cycle analysis to underpin decisions. Enterprise Competitiveness Findings Climate Change Is Becoming a Critical Driver of Business Competitiveness. Climate change is viewed as an unpredictable, disruptive force (\"Hurricane Katrina in slow mo - tion\") that has focused attention on the pragmatic need to better manage energy use. Leading companies recognize that climate change con - cerns will impact their energy costs and business competitiveness, and they are preparing for that future by assessing their carbon footprints and building these issues into their business strate - gies. Climate change is having a profound affect on business models and operations, investment decisions and the management of critical indus - tries such as energy and agriculture. Leading U.S. Corporations See Energy and Sustainability Challenges As Opportunities for Competitive Gain \u2014and Are Not Waiting To Act. Although industry experts participating in Dia - logue I see a pressing need for public policy advances related to energy and sustainability, leading rms are not waiting until these measures are proposed and implemented to act. A number of the rms already have relevant internal pro - grams and initiatives in place across their world - wide operations. These companies typically view such initiatives not merely as compliance activities but as opportunities\u2014seized or missed\u2014for busi - ness development, innovation and competitive advantage. In fact, the ability to exploit energy and sustainability-related opportunities is becoming a barometer for a well-run company. Energy Efciency Powerfully Impacts the Abil- ity of All Companies to Compete. The rapid rise in energy costs in recent years has added signicantly to the costs of U.S. goods and made it more difcult for U.S. rms to compete with countries with lower energy costs. Higher energy costs have a pervasive effect on the busi - ness ecosystem. For example, the transportation, manufacturing and information technology sec - tors are highly sensitive to the cost of energy. In the agricultural sector, energy prices ripple up and down the supply chain, affecting the cost of producing crops, feeding animals and transporting foodstuffs. Initiatives that increase energy ef - ciency can powerfully benet the competitiveness of U.S. business. Energy quality and reliability are also crucial. According to a study by Sandia Na - tional Laboratories, annual nancial losses from power disruptions in the U.S. amount to $150 billion and one-third of all computer problems are related to poor power quality. Supply Chains Are Being Pressed to Align with Customer Energy Initiatives. U.S. industry participants indicated that they are increasingly extending their interest in improv - ing their energy management and reducing their carbon footprint to apply across their supply Executive Summar y 9 chains. Companies have become much more conscious of the energy costs and related risks that are passed along through the supply chain, and they are actively working to improve practices in this regard. The best rms design processes and innovative technologies with both their suppli - ers and consumers in mind. Dialogue participants noted that opportunities to optimize energy use exist across all industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and retail. Participants ob - served that companies that manage their energy well tend to be better managed companies. The supply chain represents a very potent vehicle for promoting energy efciency across the economy. Summary It is clear that the United States faces serious challenges and a new competitiveness land- scape as it contends with the twin challenges of energy security and sustainability. America's continued economic growth and prosperity is at risk if we do not improve our energy productiv- ity. Though the policy and regulatory response to these issues is still in flux-and can vary con-siderably at the state, national and international levels-leading companies are not waiting to act. As they do so, they are realizing signi cant cost savings and new opportunities for top line growth. It is becoming evident that business is a power- ful agent for promoting change in energy and sustainability practices, particularly as compa- nies begin to push their energy and sustain-ability initiatives through the supply chain. In- creasingly, effective environmental and energy management is viewed as an indicator of good business management. The private sector more broadly would be wise to be alert to these new competitiveness drivers and customer expecta- tions. The ability of companies to respond to these trends would be enhanced by the devel- opment of transparent and positive price signals and a greater understanding of the true cost of energy inputs. While companies can play a leading role in the transition to a more competitive and sustainable energy future, there are other issues the United States as a nation must tackle. America must elevate the importance of energy productivity as a measure of its economic competitiveness. The impending energy workforce shortages must be acknowledged and aggressively addressed by both the public and private sectors. Consum- ers must become part of the energy solution, and concurrently, a more influential factor in the energy innovation process. Finally, the importance of a rational and inte-grated policymaking process cannot be under- stated. This may include retiring policies or regulations that serve to inhibit innovation or the deployment of more sustainable energy practices, products and technologies. It may involve greater coordination and harmonization of state, regional and federal policies. It will cer-tainly require a greater level of systems think- ing about the choices and trade-offs involved in reconciling our comprehensive need for energy security, sustainability and competitiveness. Council on Competitiveness10 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship Dialogue Proceedings Energy and Competitiveness \u2014 The NeedFor Action Deborah Wince-Smith Council on Competitiveness The Role of the Council on Competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness celebrated its 20th anniver - sary last year as the only group that brings together CEOs across all sectors, leading university presidents and labor leaders to under - stand the drivers and the evolving agenda needed to ensure America's continued prosperity, security and success in global markets. The America COMPETES Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation signed into law by President Bush in 2007 , is already beginning to have an impact across the nation and directly reflects work done by the Council's National Innovation Initiative (NII) since its inception in 2003. The purpose of the NII was to really understand how innovation is the key to U.S. prosperity, economic growth and standard of living. In this process, we identied a number of critical over- the-horizon issues, including this nexus between energy security, innovation and the ongoing move - ment for sustainability. The ESIS Initiative is a result of this important recognition. We are very grateful to have one of the principals of the NII, Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, serving as a Co-Chair along with James Owens of Caterpillar and Michael Langford of the Utility Workers Union of America for this new effort. The work of participants in Progressive Dialogue I will be essential for advancing the understanding of the major energy and sustainability-related chal - lenges and opportunities facing the nation. Susan Rochford Council on Competitivenes The Council Launches A Progressive Dialogue Series. The concept for the Progressive Dialogue Series was born of the recognition that we are operating in a dynamic and rapidly evolv - ing environment. We are witnessing record levels of private and public investment into new energy technology ventures in the United States and around the world; signicant shifts in public sentiment regarding the urgency of our energy and climate change challenges; the introduction of new energy policy initiatives at the state, federal and international levels; and continuing concerns about energy price and supply volatility and the reliability of our energy infrastructure and supply chain. The aim of the Progressive Dialogue Series is to harness the knowledge of a diverse range of experts from around our nation to forge well-balanced and objective answers to a number of important\u2014but heretofore unaddressed\u2014questions about America's energy future and America's future competitiveness. Participating experts are taking part in a hands-on, real-time research and analysis process that will bring forth new information, insights and analysis about the increasingly critical importance of energy as a factor of competitiveness at the enterprise, national and international level. 11 Energ y n and Competitiveness--The Need For Actio STEERING COMMITTEE PERSPEC TIVES Shirley Ann Jackson Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and ESIS Initiative Co-Chair The Need for Energy Security. Worldwide energy consumption has nearly doubled in the past 40 years driven by population growth, rising living standards, increasingly energy-dependent new technologies and greater energy consumption. If this trend continues, energy consump - tion will double again by mid-century. Energy independence is not fea - sible because the challenges are interdependent and global. What must be fostered is energy security, which recognizes the interlinked effects of global business, global competition, global energy supply chains, vulnerability to supply disruptions and cost within a global marketplace. For the foreseeable future there will likely be a mix of solutions that includes innovative extractive and transportation technologies for fossil 1.

We must advance discovery and innovation. We need to understand the essential linkages between energy policies and initiatives at the federal and state levels, on the one hand, and, on the other, the competitiveness needs of U.S.-based multinational rms and U.S. rms that operate only domestically but are affected by global market - place and energy dynamics. We need to understand energy security as a business enabler and business driver. At the end of this Progressive Dialogue Se - ries, we hope to have a policy framework or at least the key questions that need to be addressed by the next Administration. The results of each Dialogue will stand alone (as well as contribute to succeeding Dialogues) so that we can begin to inform and infl u - ence the policy framework as we go along. Michael Langford Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO and ESIS Initiative Co-Chair Talent as a Natural Resource. Ameri - cans can feel the im - pact of energy price and supply volatility at gas pumps and elsewhere as indi - vidual consumers and as manufactur - ing and other busi - nesses. We cannot wait any longer to address these challenges. Our efforts to do this will have competitiveness implications. Our success will depend not only on innovation but also on the men and women who build and operate the energy infra - structure. New technologies will not compensate for worker shortages caused by the expected retirement of half of the country's 412,000 power workers over the next 10 years. This represents a vast amount of knowledge walking out the door. Many of these are highly skilled jobs. We will need to attract hun - dreds of thousands of new workers into the energy industry. We will need more resources for education and on-the-job training. We must encourage in - novation and also invest in our workforce. This will move America toward real economic security. This Dialogue is important because it is posing questions that haven't been asked before. 13 Lou Anna Simon Michigan State University The Hidden Opportunity Cost. Capital export is a daunting, seldom-dis- cussed problem for the United States that is inherent in our conventional, petroleum-based economy. Capital export results in the loss of American jobs and greater foreign control of U.S. rms and real estate. In 2006, oil imports were the largest component of the U.S. trade decit, accounting for 33 percent. The 2006 petroleum decit was roughly $270 billion, which was an increase of roughly $42 billion (or 18 percent) from 2005. Each $1 bil - lion of trade decit costs 27 ,000 U.S. jobs; hence, this increase in oil imports translates into the equivalent of 1.1 million American jobs. This transfer of wealth is expected to continue. Capital export must be considered in combi - nation with other strategic factors, such as the instability of the Middle East and the nite supply of petroleum. 2.

At some level, we've been here before. Most of us, I think, are de - nitely old enough to remember the 1970s when we had our en - ergy crisis. When we talk about the word 'sustainable' it also applies to our \"stick- with-it-ness\" on focusing on problems-like what we do about energy supply. Americans didn't stick with the energy-saving habits we formed during the '70s-and here we go again. It is crucial to sustain energy initiatives. This is a very serious issue. The role of innovation is also critical. Innovation comes up in all the baseline scenarios for how to move forward in our energy future in an environ - mentally benign way. And yet, the process of driving innovation is not well understood and needs to be discussed more. John Treat Alternative Hybrid Locomotive Technologies Small Steps, Substantial Effects. Efciencies could be applied in many areas, such as transporta - tion, home and of ce climate control, manu - facturing and electric - ity generation. If we really turn on innova - tion within the Ameri - can business and academic communities, we can nd ways to improve energy productivity. Improving our energy produc - tivity also has policy implications, including foreign policy. Even though many people believed the Star Wars program wouldn't work, the Soviets believed it would, and this contributed to the breakup of the Soviet Union. If we increased our energy productivity, this could have a tremendous effect on other coun - tries' attitudes toward us. 15 Energ y n and Competitiveness--The Need For Actio A VIEW FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY John Mizroch Ofce of Energy Efciency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy The Secretary of Energy is anxious to hear from Pro - gressive Dialogue I participants. Energy is the number one issue facing the world today. It is framed by two different issues: energy security and climate change. The importance of energy security is reflected in the fact that eight countries in the world control 80 percent of the world's oil. We need to diversify our fuel sources. Climate change will be addressed by a combination of policy, tech - nology, capital markets and nance. I am thrilled to be at the Dialogue and part of the illustrious group the Council has brought together. I hope the group will realistically discuss how America can transform energy use while improving competitiveness. The 21st century may be the century of cleaner en - ergy. The incandescent light bulb was invented in the 19th century, and we're still using that technol - ogy even though transformational technology is available for power generation and energy ef ciency. I would like Dialogue participants to address ques - tions such as, why can't we deploy the transforma - tional technology, and not just in the United States? And how do we look at the future, say, 20 years from now, adding jobs while improving the economy and addressing climate change? The results of this Dialogue will be offered to decision-makers and opinion leaders. We will all work together to keep America competitive. Council on Competitiveness16 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship Settin g The Sta ge \u2014Expert Presentations The purpose of the stage-setting presentations was to equip all Dialogue participants with a common baseline of information and a high-level perspective on the state of the major energy segments and related competitiveness issues. HOW ENERGY BECAME A COMP ETITIVENESS CHALLENGE Larry Chorn, Platts Developing countries use large amounts of energy to fuel their GDP growth. Over time, they become more efcient in using energy. But as you become more efcient, your energy dependence decreases through conservation and by refocusing your GDP on less energy-intensive industries. U.S. energy use per capita rose until the 1970s, dropped during the 1970s energy crisis, and then gradually resumed through the current decade because the United States didn't sustain its energy ef ciency efforts. Power usage is growing in all sectors but more slowly in the industrial sector. In 2006, the United Sates im - ported 60 percent of its crude oil needs. The price shocks started in 2000, moving from roughly $18 to $80 a barrel today. It's not clear that the United States is using less energy, even though the price has gone up at least four-fold during this period. Jumps in price are usually associated with economic recessions. The impact occurs quickly, within a few months. But in the U.S. energy market, not much price elasticity is evident yet. 3.

If we proceed with \"business as usual,\" projections through 2017 show the price of everything going up: crude oil, natural gas, coal and electric power. Our demand for all fuels is increasing and this drives the pricing. And after 2025, the projections for electric power get quite ugly. 4.

Regional power pool prices, which transcend state borders, will grow based on the fuel requirements portfolio and the ability to build new generation and expand transmission capacity. The United States is increasingly competing for en - ergy supplies and energy security. Take for example, the following potential scenario: Russia regains control of some former Soviet Union states and periodically restricts natural gas flows into Western Europe. This could increase European demand for liqueed natural gas (LNG) from European sources, which in turn could restrict the U.S. ability to import LNG. Gas prices in the United States would \"rocket up\", and they would stay there. The implications for the economy would be enormous. Today about 80 percent of power comes from fossil fuels and about 20 percent from nuclear. Unless we start building nuclear plants more aggressively, or NE \u001b/-%*, NY \u001b0.

A nuclear plant takes seven to 12 years to get in place, and a large power plant also takes seven or more years. We have some decisions to make very quickly or we will nd ourselves behind the eightball. The largest problems are those that can not be re - paired quickly, such as losing a world-scale re nery. This can cause prices to rise dramatically. But there is reason for optimism. The United States has historically shown a great ability to innovate once it achieves consensus. Council on Competitiveness18 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship PROSPECTS FOR RENEWABLES Scott Sklar, The Stella Group There is no one technology that deals with the energy issues we face; a blend of efciency and renewable technologies will be needed. Recent studies showed that far more private venture capital is now going into clean energy than into fossil energy. Renewable portfolio standards now exist in 20 states. The big-population states are taking the initiative. As renewable technologies scale, they go down in cost. However, biomass is the laggard. Although the United States has a large biomass capacity (for example, ethanol), there are many competing uses for it. A new Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study shows that America is using 5,000 megawatts of geothermal energy and has a capacity of nearly 90,000 megawatts. Traditional hydro power use is declining, but in the next decade other water technologies will be deployed, such as tidal energy and freefl ow hydro without dams or diversions. Wind power is good but is not always where the populations are. Concentrated 5. Global Investment in Sustainable Energ y, by Type and Region, 2006 in Billion s Source: SEFI, New s the Sta e--Expert Presentation solar power is a Southwest technology and has been a reliable resource for California. The United States has enough for about 9 million megawatts. Grid tied renewables are growing at about 10-15 percent a year, and overall renewables are growing at about 30-35 percent a year in terms of invest - ment and output. Not all of this is tied to the grid. The question is whether the grid can handle the expansion. A very important consideration is power quality. Twenty years ago, when we weren't a digital eco - nomy, the sags and surges in the grid and the tran - sients did not matter as much. But today, according to a Sandia National Laboratory study, losses from power disruptions cost more than $150 billion a year. As a result, the private sector and the military is turning to on-site power generation for every - thing from data centers to telephone systems and even basic HVAC equipment. Sophisticated digital equipment cannot be run with poor, unpredictable power quality. One-third of all computer problems are due to power quality. We may see that there will be several systems, with the richest part of society, companies and individuals, getting the most reliable power quality. Will we have a system that can provide the same level of power quality to the bottom third of our society as it does to the upper third? \"Ultimately, having choice in the market place changes things. We still have supply constraints, but once you have choice, every option costs less. In another 15 years, two-thirds of energy users will probably have options that cost less than what they're paying now.\" Scott Sklar, The Stella Group we will see paint applied to buildings that gy delivery systems (pipelines, electricity\u2014all ternet, cellular phones and the seamless and vehicles.

Council on Competitiveness20 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship CA PA CITY FA C T OR (%) FORECAST FOR THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY Angelina Howard, Nuclear Energy Institute We need all our energy sources to generate electricity. Each source has advantages and disadvantages. In the United States, there are 104 nuclear plants that produce 20 percent of our power generation (16 percent worldwide). No nuclear units are under construction in the United States today, but about 40 are in the planning stages (although it's uncertain whether all will be built). Nuclear baseload power is a 24x7 reliable source. Today, America's nuclear plants are operating at 85 percent to 90 percent of capacity\u2014as high as can be expected. We've brought down the cost of generation to about 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour, lower than everything but hydroelectric generation. The foremost concern is the safety of these facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission put together a rigorous process for license renewal. There is strong public support for nuclear power, but NIMBY [not in my backyard] is always a factor. Major investments are being made in the design and engineering for new plants. One challenge is getting the investment to build these plants.

Although the number of students wanting OPEN DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS Electricity demand is driving decisions about new nuclear plants more than whether the states in question are regulated or deregulated. The number of nuclear engineering students and other types to major in nuclear engineering is going up, the number of graduates is still small. The issue is the scarcity of professors, many of whom have been retiring because of the hiatus in building plants. Union apprentice programs have been re-started on the construction and operation sides. THE ENERGY P RODUCTIVITY OPPORTUNITY Matt Rogers, McKinsey & Company Based on recent McKinsey Global Institute research, energy productivity will be the single largest ap - proach to meeting global growth in demand over the next 25 years. There are 135 quadrillion BTUs of positive NPV (net present value) energy productiv - ity investments available on a global basis that could improve the competitiveness of the United States, and competitiveness and growth on a global basis. Looking at the data, country by country, sector by sector, shows that this is a developing market story. 85 percent of energy demand growth is going to occur in developing nations. It is also important to note that it is a consumer story. Consumers drive 60 percent of global growth. To address climate change and think about the energy equation on a global basis, we must think more about how to address the consumer. And this is a different problem than we faced in the 1960s and 70s. If we look at this just as a U.S. problem, we won't have much impact on it. China will pass the United States in energy consumption by 2020 or before. By \"Fundamentally, in the United States, we have not had either the price signals, the regulatory is - sues, or frankly, the commercial focus on energy productivity as an important source of economic competitiveness. Therefore, our rate of change historically, and our rate of change on current course, is not as rapid as our major economic competitors.\" Matt Rogers, McKinsey & Company Council on Competitiveness22 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship 2020, Middle East consumers will use more oil than Europe. The United States needs to engage China, India and the Middle East to solve this problem. U.S. energy demand growth is accelerating to 1.6 percent per year from 1 percent per year over the past two decades, and this is good news about our economy becoming wealthier. There are very substantial energy productivity invest - ments that could make U.S. demand growth fl at over the next 20 years. Our recent study shows residen - tial and commercial energy efciency in the United States improving over the next decade, but at a much lower rate than in China. On its current course, America will remain the most energy-intensive developed economy over the next 20 years, even as developing regions are making very rapid prog - ress bringing energy intensity down. The U.S. rate of change is not as strong as its OECD competitors. This is where we get into the competitiveness ques - tion, because if energy is an important part of pro - duction costs, and our rate of change is slower than our major competitors, then our delta in eco - nomic wealth creation will go against us during that time period. There are market failures due to policy distortions, lack of information among consumers, \"agency\" issues between landlords and tenants and related nancing issues as to who has access to capital\u2014all of which affect investments in energy productivity. The goal should be not to make consumers use less or suffer more but to get more productivity out of a given amount of energy. If we can do this, it will improve our overall productivity and economy over time. It was the demand-side phenomenon that took us here, and we would argue that if the prices stay at high levels, the demand-side responses will hold the basis for taking us out of the current oil situation. We are starting to see behavioral changes in response to higher prices. It takes about three years for these to become apparent. In the 2010-15 period, the most powerful force will be substitution, such as bio-fuels in the transportation sector. The 2015-2020 period will see the accelerating impact of innovation, with regulators also taking action. tivity measures the output and quality of goods and services generated with a given set of inputs.

This is evident in the mil - lions of new cars sold in Russia and India, let alone China. All this growth requires a lot of energy. Each week, China adds the equivalent of two coal- red power plants. Modern societies are good at solving problems\u2014for example, cars with lower emissions, according to a National Petroleum Council study. Energy will certainly loom large in U.S.-China rela - tions. There are also energy security issues, as for example the natural gas question between Russia and Western Europe. Resource nationalism is once again at the fore. In many ways, the real issue is en - ergy insecurity, accentuated by the access question \u2014can you get in and develop the resources\u2014and the huge problem of the rapid rise of costs in the energy sector. For example, according to the new IHS/CERA Cost Index, an upstream oil project started today will literally cost double what the same project would have cost had it be started three years ago. One reason for the high cost of oil is the short - age of people and equipment. One sees similar forces at work on the cost structure in the electric power industry. There are two positive factors. First, we have never seen so much stress on energy ef ciency, across the board. This is true in Europe and in the United States. China is changing, too, although price is a complex issue for Beijing. Another new thing is what I've dubbed \"The Great Bubbling\" in energy R&D. Especially interesting is the entry of the venture capital community. VCs are now investing billions annually in clean energy, far more than just a couple of years ago. Council on Competitiveness26 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship Former Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Ralph Peterson, Chairman and CEO, Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, President, Chairman, Johnston & Associates CH2M Hill The National Petroleum Council (NPC) recently completed a major study entitled \"The Hard Truths about Energy.\" The starting thought for the study was concern about the future of oil and gas supplies. There were 350-plus participants\u201465 percent from outside the oil and gas industry\u2014who looked at more than 100 other private and publicly commissioned energy studies to arrive at a balanced assessment of the outlook for energy supplies in the coming de - cades. The study concluded that: World energy demand will probably grow about 60 percent over the next 25 years unless there are very dramatic changes in energy ef ciency. The energy mix will include oil, gas, coal, renew - ables and nuclear. The world is not running out of oil, but there is an access issue, as well as technical challenges. The risks are growing around energy\u2014where it's located, the supply chain, the scale and cost of the environmental impact. These risks are adding to the challenges for the global economy. The solution is to use everything, including demand moderation, oil and gas, renewables, nuclear, etc. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Energy independence is not foreseeable in the near future. The issue is about enhancing U.S. energy security, including by such means as strengthening U.S. trade relations. We need well-functioning global energy markets. We must address the reality that 55 percent of the U.S. oil and gas workforce is 10 years or less from retirement\u2014similar to the power industry. Carbon constraints will be a very important part of the future energy equation. The NPC report made ve major recommendations: 1 Pursue both energy efciency and conservation. 2 Expand and diversify the U.S. energy supply. Ex - ploit marginal oil and gas well. Another example: Although exploration is not allowed off the U.S. East Coast today, it would be constructive to at least assess what might be there, using today's technology and environmental practices. 3 Strengthen U.S. and global energy security. 4 Promote science education and technology leadership. 5 Address the need for carbon constraints. 27 T y y n he Hard Truths About Energ --A Ke note Presentatio who believe the world is running out of oil, security system, India and China need to see this as a global market that is not rigged against them. OPEN DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS Since its publication, the NPC report has generated debate, especially from people about the weighting of the recommenda- tions. There has also been debate about the report's push for strong fuel ef ciency in autos. Regarding a possible fuel tax, noth-ing is likely to happen ahead of the Presi-dential election. An MIT study on coal said it is still too early for reliable data on carbon sequestration. There has been considerable surprise on the macroeconomic side: as prices rose, demand didn't seem to fall; there was no elasticity. This raised the question, have we hit the threshold yet or is there a lag? We need to develop a consensus on the elements of energy policy and how to move it forward. The Chinese are very concerned about energy issues. They are heavily oc- cupied with their own environmental issues. In order to participate in the global energy Governor John Engler, President, National Association of Manufac - turers and Council President, Deborah Wince-Smith Richard Meserve, President, Carnegie Institution and Angie How - ard, Vice President and Executive Advisor to the President, Nuclear Energy Institute George Manoogian, Director of Strategic Planning and Special Proj - ects, Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO; Michael Langford, National President, Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO; Ann Randazzo, Director, Center for Energy Workforce Development Council on Competitiveness28 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship The Energy- Competitiveness Relations hip INDUSTRY PER SPECTIVE S Moderator: Robert Fri , Resources for the Future When familiar information on energy is viewed through the lens of competitiveness, it takes on a new dimension. The NPC report concluded that the energy system is consumer driven. Energy policy that works is policy that serves the consumer. And because oil and gas resources are mainly in the hands of the non-private sector, energy depends as much on foreign policy as energy policy. We all understand that energy technology will be a big part of the solution, but how it comes to be and how it gets deployed is a process that we don't understand very well. As others here have commented, maybe we need to think about how innovation really works. We are now going to get away from the big picture of the scene-setting presentations and get to some ground truth. We are going to ask real competitors in the global marketplace, who are facing real threat and real oppor- tunities from the changing energy system, to tell us what they see. James Fischer, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Marilyn Brown, Georgia Institute of Technology; Gene Huang, FedEx Corporation; Robert Fri, Resources for the Future; Peter Evans, General Electric Company. Gene Huang FedEx Corporation By 2030, transportation will be the largest consumer of energy. Today, transportation depends almost ex - clusively on liquid petroleum fuel. Industry has been relentless in pursuing fuel efciency. Hybrid engines are being tested for truck fleets. Real growth for transportation volumes is projected at roughly 6-6.5 percent per year but fuel consumption at only 2-2.5 percent. Part of the fuel efciency comes from new materials, part from operational measures. It is much more difcult to apply new technology to air fl eets because the average life of a plane is 25 years. For trucks, the life cycle is roughly three years, so it's easier to adopt new technology. An uninterrupted fuel supply is essential. Jet fuel imports account for 12 percent of U.S. demand, so a goal of zero imports would be unrealistic. Major international oil compa - nies provide less than 20 percent of global oil, with the other 80 percent government-controlled. Most new sources of oil are in Asia and Europe, not the United States. Within NAFTA, Canada and Mexico have oil and natural gas, and this might help meet U.S. demand. FedEx increased its storage capac - ity after Katrina, as did most U.S. companies. In our case, this included storage at airports. We also de - veloped contingency plans on a worldwide basis. James Stanway Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Wal-Mart operates the rst- or second-largest pri- vate truck fleet in the United States and is China's 29 y y s The Energ -Competitiveness Relationship--Industr Perspective seventh-largest trading partner. We are the largest private electricity consumer in the United States. Our goals are to reduce cost and exposure by moving to 100 percent renewable energy consumption and decarbonizing our supply chain. We've boosted our energy efciency within our own footprint by, for example, using LED lighting in collaboration with GE. This close collaboration has brought about signi - cant reductions in energy consumption. We also have goals for making our truck fleets more ef cient, such as using hybrid 18-wheel trucks. With projects this big in the United States, local policies and codes can prohibit more energy-ef - cient changes. We need something that's standard - ized if we're going to get energy technology out there quickly. Compact fluorescent light bulbs can make a big difference on the customer side. In our Sam's Club operation, the cost of sales to small businesses has historically impeded new technology adoption. We're testing ways of marketing energy services to small businesses. For our supply chain, we have a technology transfer program that could be very powerful if it works. For the products we sell ourselves, we've asked about 50 supplier companies for information on the energy embedded in their products. Many lack expertise and see this as com - pliance issue rather than a business development issue. It is not about compliance. It's important to understand where the energy is in your supply chain. The companies that are good at this today tend to be European. Scott Brown Exelon Corporation In the electric industry, energy is our business. Con - gress passed an Energy Policy Act in 1992, and af - ter it was implemented in 1999, this act opened up the wholesale marketplace in our industry. It allowed competition to replace command-and-control in lo - cal markets. It allowed companies to sell into other markets. It led to new players, including indepen - dent power producers and independent transmis - sion companies and resulted in the consolidation of companies along with new technologies, such as the combined cycle gas turbine. There were winners and losers. The Exelon nuclear fleet in the late 1990s had availability of 50 percent. By the end of 2000 this had risen to more than 90 percent. Availability is over 96 percent today in our fleet of 17 nuclear plants. We also saw the emergence of organized regional markets, thanks to the formation of a large transmission highway where the best products can be sold over a wide area. Over 70 percent of the wind energy in the United Sates is sold in these or - ganized markets. On a macro basis, since 1990, U.S. electricity prices have decreased 15 percent with inflation accounted for, yet demand has increased. With new science, we now know that climate change is real, so the electric industry has a big challenge. There is also the challenge of the global economy that's produced double-digit increases in fuel costs. Federal legislation will call for the reinvention of how \"We haven't abandoned the Bentonville legend. We're still going to drag you in and talk to you about price. But there are going to be environmental metrics now, too. And we want to reward those high per - formers. So if there's a product with environmental attributes, delivers a great customer value, then we can give it some extra shelf space. And we rmly believe that the companies that go through the kind of processes and thinking in taking this risk out of the supply chain and down to the individual companies- these are going to be the better companies to work with in the long run.\" James Stanway, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Council on Competitiveness30 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship \"I heard a theme throughout the talks, and it was one of the ones I circled. And my walk-away was the value of looking at the supply chain. And I think we have to look at the supply chain on energy production as well.\" Scott Brown, Exelon Corporation we produce and deliver energy in this country. We need to see consumer behavior changes. The big challenge for policymakers is whether to go forward with market competition or command-and-control. We think the struggle of competition has to be there. Jody Howard Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar is involved on many sides of the energy issue. Our products and technologies are used worldwide to harvest, transport and convert fuels. Our power generator products represent one-third of our business. We are also the world's largest producer of clean diesel and natural gas engines. Our key choices have been around operational ef - ciency in plants/facilities, energy ef cient products for our customers and advocating policy decisions that are environmentally friendly, but economically sound. Conservation is a critical step to buy time, but it is not enough. We need to fully leverage existing technologies and resources. In my lifetime, today's main fuels will remain the main fuels, so we have to use them efciently. We need the flexibility to de - velop more energy supplies, including nuclear and diesel fuel. And we need to invest in developing new technologies and sources, including alternative and renewable fuels. Ultimately, we need a balanced energy portfolio that includes traditional and new energy technologies. We need not just national, but global, legislation. Glen Lewis University of California, Davis Energy and climate change issues are critical in all aspects of the food and agriculture supply chain, including the energy costs of crop production and animal feeding. California is the world's fth-largest producer of food and agricultural commodities and the largest producer in the United States. People take food safety and availability for granted, but this system is very fragile. After 9/11, food safety and security received more attention. This is really a national security issue. Only certain areas of the world can produce food, and climate change can affect weather patterns critical for food production. Increased soil temperatures require more irrigation, and that creates higher energy costs. Logistics are another concern: the fresher produce people want, the greater its perishability because of increased transportation frequency. The food industry is heavily regulated, but it has a strong history of innovation\u2014 and as many business case studies can reference, industries and countries that are heavily regulated are typically the most innovative and competitive. \"What we found in Dupont was we rst set our energy efciency goals in the pretty early '90s, and it really took putting a thumb on the scale to get people to actually pay attention to that as a preferred place to put their dollars. Because in the manufacturing segment, the rst place you want to put your dollars is in more pounds. What we did is say, 'You know what?... Figure out how to make more pounds with less energy. Make energy efciency a productivity tool. You're going to do better that way.' But it really does take a level policy and focus to bring even those cost- effective investments up to the top of the pile so people look at them differently.\" Michael Parr, Dupont 31 y y s The Energ -Competitiveness Relationship--Industr Perspective John Keith P zer Inc. The pharmaceutical industry is not a major user of energy because its products are low in mass\u2014there is not as much to make or ship. Still, energy is a major and growing cost for pharmaceutical rms. On a pound-for-pound basis, pills are very energy- intensive products because of their long, complex manufacturing processes and supply chains. P zer conducts extensive R&D that is very energy-focused. The pharmaceutical industry is global and highly competitive. No one has a dominant share in any market. Competition from Indian pharmaceutical companies is very real, for example. In the United States, more than 50 percent of prescriptions are from generic pharmaceutical companies. Over-the-counter medicines have even higher volumes. There is growing sensitivity to the cost of energy and the \"Our experience has been that the more we look into energy efciency, the more we nd opportuni - ties, conventional opportunities, like making our buildings more efcient, and process opportunities, by making greener processes. In fact, we're not seeing a bottom to this well. We're not seeing that we're running out of low-hanging fruit.\" John Keith, P zer Inc. cost of goods. We've looked at energy ef ciency for more than ve years and have teams focused on this around the world. As energy prices and competition with generics have increased, we have paid more attention to energy- efcient, green operations. The availability of the energy supply is critical. Any interruption could result in the loss of product through lack of refrigeration or other factors. On the R&D side, an interrupted en - ergy supply could mean the loss of a year's work. To ensure reliability, we focus on back-up suppliers, but there's only so much you can do on site. A lot has to come from the grid. Hospitals and clinics have very high energy costs and opportunities for improving efciency. The cost of health care is a major con - cern in the United States, and energy is a big factor in health care costs. I've seen little evidence that people are paying attention to this. Elizabeth Cheney Shell Energy Resources Company Fossil fuels are at the heart of the energy system and should continue to be part of the mix. The world produces 85 million barrels a day of fuel and consumes a bit less than this. We need near-term access to untapped energy sources, such as off the continental shelf. Shell is developing technology to get more out of current sources. We expect uncon - ventional sources to grow within our portfolio, includ -Council on Competitiveness32 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship ing technologies that are not oil-based, such as wind, solar, hydrogen, and second-generation biofuels. Our goal is to make a substantial commercial business out of at least one of these. Unconventional sources could grow to one-third of our supply mix by 2015. The key is to manage our carbon footprint. We are doing many things in this area. We have a corporate commitment to sustainable development, which we dene as meeting current needs without compro - mising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This includes safeguarding the health of our employees and the communities where they work. We also have workforce challenges, especially the \"crew change\" that will be needed because of the retirement of the aging workforce. \"We see Shell's ability to remain competitive as greatly impacted, or maybe dependent upon, our ability to access new resources; expand our own conventionals; develop technologies around al - ternatives; manage CO2 emissions; maintain our license to operate through economic, environ - mental, and social responsibility; and continue to develop our workforce. And these things not only have to be done, but have to be done very well.\" Elizabeth Cheney, Shell Energy Resources Company CO2 OPEN DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS Decarbonization of the supply chain is very complicated. The rst step is to understand how much energy is in the products we get from suppliers. We need to start bringing the supply chain up the learning curve. A lot of energy is embedded through feedstock use. As we think about energy costs, we need to think about feedstocks. There is little difference between the energy efciency performance of overseas foreign suppliers and U.S. factories. Some companies have standards that call for terminating any supplier in any part of the world that intentionally disregards environmental standards. If a coal-red plant increases its efciency by 1 percent, that means 100,000 fewer tons of . These are the types of efciencies to look for. To get to signicant scale in biofuels, signicant breakthroughs in innovation are needed. There ought to be open access, transparency and opportunity for innovators to take the business risk and be rewarded for it. 33 y s The Energ -Competitiveness of Energy Efciency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy The United States has ve percent of the world's population yet accounts for 25 percent of the world's energy use today. The most signicant global developments in the 20th century were not the invention of the computer, the Internet or penicillin, but population increase and urbanization. These developments have had incalculable effects and will drive what happens in this century. In 1950, there were 191 cities in the world with a population of one million or more, and two megaci - ties (8 million or more), New York and London. Today, China alone has over 40 cities with populations of four million people. In 1950, there were 70 million vehicles in the world. Today, there are more than 800 million. China alone\u2014which had around one million privately owned vehicles in 1992, and sold over seven million in 2006\u2014now has as many as 30 million vehicles and is projected to have over 200 million in two decades. Department of Energy estimates show that in a short time, the world will add half a billion vehicles to today's one billion. Three of the world's largest, most important nations have not signed the Kyoto Protocol. At least 50 per - cent of what multi-nationals make is outsourced. The rest of the world has the means, the capital and the right to develop. How do we influence things under those circumstances? Whatever we do in the United States is ne, but we're less than 5 percent of the world population. We're playing a multidimensional chess game, where we see the nationalization of energy resources and their potential use for political purposes. Peter Evans General Electric Company Global energy dynamics include rapid economic growth, rising prices, workforce shortages and global warming concerns. There is a basic structural change in the marketplace. The need to develop new technology solutions is driven by higher energy prices, the need for energy security and for more di- verse solutions and concern about the environment. GE has a strong commitment to developing new energy technologies through worldwide acquisition and organic growth. About four years ago GE bought a wind business. It was considered kind of a small thing but not really part of the main business of supplying power to the Council on Competitiveness34 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship energy generation system. That has changed. We have grown that business from about a half a bil - lion to four billion dollars. And a lot of investment is going into making wind a mainstream generation technology. There are two types of government policies that breed demand: \"demand-pull\" policies such as environmental regulations, administrative measures, tax incentives, and subsidies; and \"supply-push\" policies such as providing market information to address market failures and diplomacy engagements with other countries. Some government interventions can distort markets and lead to policy failures. Lack of credible commitment is one example. Another is protectionism. A concern I have is that environmental regulations are often a mask for protectionism. We need to be vigilant about green industrial policy. The United States has maintained an open trade system, and we need to keep this up in a carbon-constrained world. 8. Energy Security, Innovation and Sustainability \u2014What is the Optimal Policy Focus ? Source: GE Energy Energy Security Environment Sweet Spot Prosperity \"Obviously there are multiple goals that we are trying to achieve. One is energy security. One is environment. One is prosperity. I think that these overlap. And so what we need to focus on is thinking about how we can develop policies that hit that sweet spot that combine all of those. But certain policies can-if they are too far out of that sweet-spot-lead to the dead rat syndrome, where you are concocting products or policies that maybe achieve some but not all of the goals that you are trying to achieve.\" Peter Evans, General Electric Company Jayant Santhaye Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory On the technology front, our lab does a lot of R&D. We signed a $500 million contract with BP recently. We expect a lot of new biofuels science in the next ve years. Tech transfer from the labs to industry has grown in our lab and other DOE labs. For private sector rms, intellectual property rights are a major challenge for competitiveness. But an even bigger problem is unequal environmental controls. If American manufacturers put controls into their plants but Chinese manufacturers don't need to do it, the Americans are at a competitive disad- vantage. Developing countries have resisted, from a government perspective, dealing with emissions con- trols. But they have been trying to reduce local air pollution. If we develop technologies that allow them to do both, it would be an enormous benet. Many technologies exist today but are not being imple- mented in developing nations. Many of these are negative cost solutions. We need to gure out what the transaction costs are and work around them. 35 y s The Energ -Competitiveness Relationship--International Dimension Michael Walsh Chicago Climate Exchange, Inc. We operate the European Climate Exchange and Chicago Climate Exchange. A capital markets-based, posi - tive mechanism for managing emissions creates enormous advantages for those that embrace that pricing and management mechanism. The country in the world with the most emissions under contractual commit - ments by the end of this year will be America and no longer Germany. The potential for terrestrial carbon sequestration (for example, trees) is largely ignored in the United States. We need to focus on a business emissions budget. There should be aggressive mitigation goals with solid enforcement. We should let the market work. Many improvements are very low-tech and just require organizing. Robert Estill, Marathon Oil Corporation and John Amdall, Caterpillar Inc. \"So, if we let the market work, encourage grabbing of that low-hanging fruit, use a positive pricing sys - tem, you're going to get competitive advantages thrown off as a result-better materials used, better energy used, smarter management of both quanti - ties and prices. These are things we are seeing from a cap and trade tool.\" Michael Walsh, Chicago Climate Exchange, Inc. Mark Petri, Argonne National Laboratory and Michael Parr, DuPont Council on Competitiveness36 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship for perfection. OPEN DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS Top-down solutions are not going to emerge. Progress will occur company by company, and the private sector can show governments what to do. An excit-ing side benet of an emissions budget is that people want to beat it. They take ownership of the problem. Cap-and-trade could be the dominant tool, al- though not the sole tool. The market responds powerfully to innovative incen-tives, not to punitive policy. The implementation details of a carbon pricing mechanism are extremely important and that is where a lot of the debate will happen. It may make more sense to do cap-and-trade within nations rather than as a global regime. Quantication of emissions is not so difcult, but the denition of what we cover and how we allocate is difcult. It is unlikely that we will go to a single standard. There are different types of crude oil, for example, and different ac- counting methods in the United States and Europe. The National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP) has spent time discussing the cap-and-trade system. The NCEP endorses it because it promotes innova-tion and carbon reductions of the cheapest nature. For example, if a company can not afford to reduce their carbon they can focus elsewhere and buy emis- sion credits from someone else. We need to put a cap on the cost of a permit and have this cost rise over time. We need to put a cost on carbon. Tax and cap-and-trade are not that much different in that respect. There is a powerful tool in supply chain management to change the dynamic around carbon. As supply chains become more global and interlinked, cus- tomers are telling companies what to do and what not to do. Whether we implement carbon taxes or cap-and-trade, if global businesses have price structures driven by this and competitors are not subject to it, that creates an incentive for outsourcing to those places. We may not get cap-and-trade right the rst time, but it is better not to wait 37 y s The Energ -Competitiveness Relationship--Workforce Challenge WORKFORCE COMPETITIVENE SS WITHIN AN ENER GY SECURITY FRAMEW ORK Moderator: Carl Van Horn, John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Many ambitious plans have been discussed in this Dialogue, and none can be achieved without an effective workforce strategy. On the labor demand side, there is more competition for talent across countries and across sectors. Other sectors are demanding the same kinds of skills. Also, there has been a decline in the number of U.S. laborers. College attendance is probably at maximum level. There are also many examples of dislocation in the American workforce. On the supply side, there is debate about immigration policy in the United States. All of this is happening in the context of a complex, local-state-federal intergovernmental structure. If some government intervention is needed, what are those policy pearls? We also need to think about the consequences of energy changes in dislocating industries: which workers will pay the price? problems are more severe than in other sectors of the economy: America's oil and gas workers average 50 years in age. Half are likely to retire by 2010. Retirements By 2010, the shortfall in the supply of electric lineworkers may be as high as 10,000-21 percent of the current number working for utilities or outsourcing companies. Limited Natural Resource-A Well-Educated and Skilled Workforce Energy companies are experiencing all of the workforce challenges faced by other U.S. rms, but the The average age for workers in the energy industry is near 50, whereas the average age of all U.S. workers is just above 40. At least half of electric utilities' technical workforce may retire in the next 5 to 10 years. will occur at all skill levels\u2014from equipment operators and truck drivers to scientists and engineers. There is an inadequate supply of qualied replacement workers. For example, enrollment in U.S. un-dergraduate engineering programs fell 79 percent between 1982 and 2004. Demand for 250,000 replacement workers in the energy utility eld (2007-2017) is projected to far exceed current supply\u2014not including thousands more needed to ll related construction jobs.

Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Council on Competitiveness38 Progressive Dialogue I: The Energy-Competitiveness Relationship Ann Randazzo Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) The CEWD, formed in March 2006, is consortium of major national associations for the energy industry. It also has members who are electric and natural gas utilities. The organization came together around a single issue: creating a new energy workforce. It decided to pursue strategies that could be devel - oped regionally. Baby boomers will start retiring in ve years. This will hit utilities four years earlier than other industries. We face losing half our workforce in the next ve years while the demand for electricity is increasing. Energy companies are willing to invest in bricks and mortar; the obstacle is nding new workers to build and run new plants while we are also replacing retiring workers. There is a signi cant need for more skilled workers in the electricity and natural gas industries. Some companies are already having problems with this. CEWD identied the most critical job categories and conducted a survey to quantify how many new workers would be needed in each category. Some of the results: 30,000 new line workers, 30,000 new power plant technicians and 15,000 new technicians will be needed. We must understand what skills are involved so that we so can develop the right training programs and partner - ships with educational institutions. We also need to look at mid-career hires and the military.

Science educa- Career progression needs to be better enough; you need to also retrain workers from other sectors. The necessary quality of education is not there. In the eighth grade, kids choose col-lege over the technical track. Undergrads are not hearing about the re- lationship between electrical and mechani- cal engineers and the environment. They are not being told they can help solve real problems in this eld. The teachers and textbooks do not do this. The National Science Foundation has been grappling with this education issue for some time. More students are choosing nance and business, and fewer are choos-ing science and engineering, which pay much less. The teachers themselves need to be educated.

In the course of these small group discus-sions, the experts developed conclusions, \"take-aways\" and also put forth ideas and suggestions for how both the government and private sector could step up to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the need for energy security and sustainability. The group's output is refl ected in the themes that have been articulated in the Executive Summary of this proceeding. They have also been integrated into the ongoing deliberations of the Steering Committee for the Energy Security, Innovation & Sustain-ability Initiative. The Council would like to express its deep appreciation to all who participated in Progressive Dialogue I for their active engagement, thoughtful contributions, good will and for committing their valuable time to this Initiative. \"My take-away from this Dialogue is that the carbon footprint is going to be a key element of competitive - ness for businesses; they are going to start to focus on it. I am going to look for that in the business plans and annual reports that I get and see if companies have a strategy for this or not.\" Nag Patibandla, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute g Committee Lis t 41 ESIS Initiative Steerin Energy Security, Innovation and Sustainability Initiative Steering Committee (As of January 1, 2008) Shirley Ann Jackson Co-Chair Douglas J.

Finally, our his design. As ever, all errors 1 Growing Opportunity Skoll Foundation foreword Fast forward: it's 2020, and the world has changed. With perfect hindsight we take stock of what we did, or didn't, to bring about what's different \u2014 good, bad and negligible. It's a good bet that we will be saying that 2007 marked a turning point, and that John Elkington, SustainAbility, and a relatively new phenomenon called social entrepreneur - ship can take the credit for changing the way we think about business, investment and social progress. Sally Osberg For two decades, SustainAbility has tuned its radar to pick up signals of what the future might hold, and then used this intelligence to advise mainstream corporations on how to re-tool for long- term competitive advantage \u2014 with that advantage encompassing what founder John Elkington has termed the 'triple bottom line' of economic, social, and environmental performance. So when John began tracking signals from social entrepreneurs and considering their relevance to corporations doing business in a globalized world, we at the Skoll Foundation took note. This report is the first product of the Skoll Foundation-SustainAbility partnership, and we hope our fellow travelers in the worlds of business and social entrepreneurship find it informative, useful, and provocative. On one level, the report probes familiar themes: social entrepreneurs feel hamstrung by their lack of access to capital, concerned for the visibility and differentiation of their solutions in a competitive landscape, and worried about their ability to attract the talent and commitment needed to expand their impact. No surprises here, but humbling, even sobering reminders for those of us committed to investing in these folks, their models and their ventures. Serious challenges persist, challenges that constrain what social entrepreneurs will be able to achieve even as their ranks increase and their champions multiply. The report becomes more intriguing in the soundings it takes of the healthcare and energy sectors. Here the increasingly complex environments \u2014 geographic, economic, socio-political \u2014 in which business must operate today seem to cry out for what social entrepreneurs have to offer: innovative, highly adaptive models that directly and indirectly serve mainstream business's larger interests. Forewords Social entrepreneurs who are changing the landscapes of these industries, SustainAbility suggests, have a distinctive way of 'reperceiving' many of the enormous and urgent challenges before us \u2014 climate change, access to and delivery of healthcare for developing world populations, and overwhelming poverty \u2014 as opportunities 'to leverage the power of markets and business to have transformative, system- wide impacts. ' The report dubs this emergent, integrated approach 'Mindset 3.0, ' differentiating the advance from predecessor 1.0 compliance-focused and 2.0 'cause related' stakeholder-involved modes still dominant even at progressive corporations. Mindset 3.0, of course, is fundamentally entrepreneurial; in 'reperceiving' well- entrenched but unsatisfactory systems as opportunities, Mindset 3.0 cracks the code of resistance inherent in any well- established equilibrium \u2014 from fossil fuel dependence to health care delivery to over - consumption. That social entrepreneurs should excel at 3.0 thinking comes as no surprise. After all, social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs first and foremost; it's just that their value propositions target neglected, disadvantaged or suffering segments of society. Underlying Mindset 3.0, I'd suggest, is the realization that this segment of society matters, that it is no longer possible to ignore two-thirds of the planet's population or fail to account for the consequences of industrialization in the developing world. Our very survival as a species and as a planet is at stake. Yes, mainstream business absolutely needs what social entrepreneurs know and do. And social entrepreneurs need much of what corporations have and take for granted. Ultimately, this first SustainAbility report suggests that a better future \u2014 for business, society, and the planet \u2014 may very well depend on how well both learn and work together. Onward! Sally Osberg President and CEO 2 Growing Opportunity Forewords Maggie Brenneke Elkington www.sustainability.com/sa-services/ sectors.asp SustainAbility foreword The entrepreneurs we surveyed are experiencing growing pains, but their capacity to see new market opportunities and experiment with novel business models and leadership styles makes them an amazing source of insights for mainstream business. A growing array of apparently insoluble socio-economic, environmental, and governance challenges presses in on decision-makers \u2014 including climate change, the risk of global pandemics, the growing threat to natural resources like water and fisheries, and the ever-present issues of poverty and hunger. Growing Opportunity \u2014 the first in an annual series of surveys conducted by SustainAbility in partnership with The Skoll Foundation 1 \u2014 explores the potential for more entre - preneurial solutions to such challenges. The key messages: At a time when such challenges seem to narrow our horizons, they are creating a wealth of new opportunities, but to enjoy them longer term we must ensure real opportunity for a very much greater proportion of the global population. This first survey has been financially supported by Allianz and DuPont, as noted in our Acknowledgements. We are proud to work alongside these partners and, over time, we believe that a growing number of mainstream business and financial institutions will follow their lead in recognizing the extraordinary potential value of what social and environmental entrepreneurs are doing. That said, it is clear that many people in mainstream business still struggle to understand what is going on in this space and its relevance for them. More positively, a number of recent developments have helped ensure that growing numbers of business people do at least invest the effort to learn. 2 Indeed, these are extraordinary times, with social and environmental entrepreneurs alike on a roll. Muhammad Yunus \u2014 probably the world's best-known social entrepreneur \u2014 won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize,3 following in the steps of Wangari Maathai in 2004. The work of social entrepreneurs is also increasingly spotlighted at events like the World Economic Forum in Davos, by the Clinton Global Initiative and at summit meetings organized by Acumen, Ashoka, Endeavor Global, the Schwab Foundation, and the Skoll Foundation. The efforts of social entrepreneurs are extensively covered in the media \u2014 in the pages of Time, Newsweek , Fast Company, and the Financial Times . New initiatives network them in novel ways, among them xigi 4 and i-genius.5 And a growing wave of money chases for-profit cleantech investments and markets for healthy living, such as organic food. Growing numbers of mainstream corporations are switching on to the area \u2014 and trying to work out what the business case might be for investment, partnership, or other forms of engagement. Take DHL, with its new initiative, the Young Entrepreneurs for Sustainability (YES) Awards, initially launched in five Asian countries and designed to support young entrepreneurs working to help meet the UN Millennium Development Goals. 6 Or take the case of Groupe Danone, the French dairy company, which is leading the new trend with its breakthrough partnership with the Grameen Group in Bangladesh. The aim: to supply fortified yoghurt products to the nutritionally deprived. Coincidentally, the launch of Growing Opportunity at the Skoll World Forum will mark the 20th anniversary of SustainAbility's founding. The report is a companion piece to an ongoing study of the future of globalization, due to be published in mid-2007. Through its evolving Skoll Program, SustainAbility plans to develop and communicate a deeper understanding of the links between social entrepreneurship and the six sectors on which we now focus: Capital Markets & Finance, Chemicals; Energy; Food & Beverage; Healthcare; and the Knowledge Economy. 7 Our overarching aim: to help build bridges between the mainstream corporations and financial institutions, which make up most of our client and partner base on the one hand, and \u2014 on the other \u2014 the extraordinary entrepreneurs and enterprises described in the following pages. Maggie Brenneke Director and Skoll Fellow John Elkington Founder and Chief Entrepreneur Sophia Tickell Chair 3 8 Growing Opportunity Forewords Allianz foreword As a leading financial services and insurance company, Allianz is acutely aware of how global trends such as aging populations, climate change and the globalization of supply chains are affecting our customers and our communities. The sorts of questions we address on a daily basis include: How can people ensure that their loved ones and assets are protected from the full spectrum of risks, including ever-increasing manmade and natural disasters? Do people have access to affordable and Paul M. Achleitner reliable health care \u2014 and, if not, what can be done to meet their needs? And where will the processes of globalization take our customers, our industry and our company? We see it as our responsibility to empower our customers to prepare for and respond to these and other challenges. But we cannot do this alone. While we bring significant experience, knowledge and passion to bear, we also seek inspiration from partners who can help us to think outside the box and act as catalysts for innovation. Social entrepreneurs are one potential wellspring of insight and inspiration. Linda Fisher Individuals from Bonn to Bangalore are seizing the chance to turn challenge into Note: unless otherwise stated, opportunity, in the process identifying and all $ references are to US$. pioneering new markets. Microfinance, as an example, is now a $9 billion market that is increasingly empowering citizens to realize their full potential in society. Our hope is that collaborating with creative thinkers will help our people to realize their full potential \u2014 and to better serve the needs of present and future customers. We are delighted to work alongside The Skoll Foundation and SustainAbility. This project has helped us to take a first look at what collaboration between mainstream business and social entrepreneurs might look like. While this is new territory for us, it is exactly the sort of opportunity space that our business needs to explore. We look forward to ongoing conversation on ways to develop and deploy new generations of sustainability solutions. Paul M. Achleitner Member of the Board of Management DuPont foreword The need for truly sustainable options for 21st century life remains one of the most critical challenges facing the global community. The work of the social and environmental entrepreneurs profiled in Growing Opportunity is truly inspirational. As a science company, DuPont has an interest in being part of the solutions by putting our science to work in ways that can design in \u2014 at the early stages of product development \u2014 attributes that help protect or enhance human health, safety, and the environment. Through our science, we will design products and processes that pass rigorous criteria for the use of renewable resources, energy, water, and materials. We believe this is a direct route to a successful, profitable business that adds value to our customers, their customers, consumers, and the planet. DuPont has broadened its sustainability commitments beyond internal footprint reduction to include market-driven targets for both revenue and research and development investment. The goals are tied directly to business growth, specifically to the development of safer and environmentally improved new products for key global markets, including products based on non-depletable resources. And we are investing to ensure that DuPont moves towards sustainable growth. By 2015, we have committed to: \u2014 Double our research and development investment in environmentally smart market opportunities; \u2014 Double revenues to $8 billion 8 from non-depletable resources; \u2014 Grow annual revenues $2 billion or more from products that create energy- efficiency and/or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for its customers; and \u2014 Introduce at least 1,000 new safety products or services.

The terms label different The survey findings are discussed in Chapter aspects of the same phenomenon. 2 (pages 11-22) and the \u2014 increasingly persuasive \u2014 business case for mainstream corporations and financial institutions to get involved is explored in Chapter 3 (pages 23-29). We look at three different mindsets that have characterized business thinking in relation to the relevant issues. If 1.0 was about compliance and 2.0 about citizenship, 3.0 is about creative destruction and creative reconstruction. 9 Chapters 4 and 5 then probe a little deeper into two key sectors, health and energy. Our main conclusions are that: 1 Social entrepreneurship is on a roll. Social entrepreneurship is emerging as a powerful catalyst of the sort of change that governments and business are increasingly committed to \u2014 but rarely know how to deliver. 2 The potential for breakthrough solutions is considerable \u2014 and growing. Among the routes to breakthrough solutions and scaling discussed by our respondents, the following surfaced repeatedly: (1) grow individual social enterprises; (2) establish multiple enterprises; (3) get big organizations \u2014 whether companies, public agencies or NGOs \u2014 to adopt the relevant models and approaches; and (4) spur public policy legislation designed to fix market failures.Executive Summary 3 The field is growing, but still relatively small. To put rough numbers on the three areas of social enterprise, cleantech and philanthropy, we estimate that less than $200 million is going into social enterprise worldwide from dedicated foundations each year, compared with over $2 billion into cleantech in the USA and EU and well over $200 billion into philanthropy in the USA alone. 4 Money remains the main headache. Accessing capital is the No.1 challenge for the entrepreneurs we surveyed, with almost three-quarters (72%) putting this at the top of their priority list. Foundations are still the favorite source of funding for social entre - preneurs (mentioned by 74% of respondents), but there is a wide recognition of the need to diversify funding sources. 5 Financial self-sufficiency is seen as a real prospect within five years. The proportion of respondents expecting to be funding their own operations, with little or no dependence on grants, jumped from 8% to 28%. 6 There is a real appetite to partner with business. Social and cleantech entrepreneurs are equally interested in developing partnerships with business \u2014 but with different expectations. Social entrepreneurs, in particular, are acutely aware that they often lack the experience and skills needed. A constant refrain was the growing need for brokering between the entrepreneurs and potential business partners. 7 Beware blind spots. There is a risk that we may become overly focused on narrow definitions of social and environmental entrepreneurship. For example, it's easy to get excited about small start-ups in the renewable energy field, but we should remember the huge contributions already being made by much larger companies like Acciona in Spain, Vestas based in Denmark or GE based in the USA. And there is also a need to focus on ways of supporting social intrapreneurs , change agents working inside major corporations and financial institutions. The potential leverage at their disposal is huge. 8 For real system change, we must focus on government and public policy. Governments need to do more to shape public sector targets, tax incentives and pricing signals to ensure that markets drive change \u2014 and that the sort of ventures covered in Growing Opportunity reach their full potential. 5 1 Growing Opportunity One thing that is likely How do you grow economic, social, educational, and political opportunityto bewilder mainstream to the degree required to ensure that business brains entering the 21st century is significantly less turbulent and violent than the 20th? the world of social enter- Part of the answer will be to invest in prise is the near-fetish entrepreneurial solutions to the world's pressing problems, and to build the for discussing definitions. system conditions in which solutions Huge effort has been are encouraged to replicate and scale.

The sort of questions they raise include: Why all the excitement? How are these people different from NGOs? Isn't entrepreneurship what business already does? How can you expect the world's 10 www.sustainability.com/ poorest to represent any sort of market? downloads_public/skoll_reports/ And how can ventures operating at this business_primer.pdf relatively small scale ever hope to change the world, as they proclaim their ambition to be. All great questions, but before we start looking for answers, it is worth remembering the critics at the time could easily have expressed \u2014 indeed often did \u2014 the same skepticism about the likes of Pasteur, the Wright Brothers or, in more recent times, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who not only founded Apple but also catalyzed the early growth of the personal computer industry. No doubt a great deal of debate went into what a germ was, into what sort of future aircraft might have or whether PCs would ever challenge the computing power of IBM's 'Big Iron. ' One thing that is likely to bewilder mainstream business brains entering the world of social enterprise is the near-fetish for discussing definitions. Huge effort has been invested \u2014 and continues to be invested \u2014 in defining social and environmental entrepreneurship and in identifying and classifying the relevant entrepreneurs. Important work, no question, but you tend to know these people when you meet them. The air crackles with energy. They aim to turn apparently insoluble crises into tomorrow's political, social, and market opportunities.Introduction Some definitions can be found on page 7, but as Jed Emerson \u2014 one of the field's most influential thought-leaders \u2014 warned us, an over-emphasis on definitions can be distracting. 'We risk wasting the coming years in endless discussions of how many angels dance on the head of a pin, ' he argued, 'as opposed to what wonderful garments we might collectively stitch together. ' The key point is that a range of social, environmental, and governance challenges increasingly demand something more than corporate citizenship responses. They require innovative, entrepreneurial, and \u2014 often \u2014 disruptive strategies which incumbent companies are often ill-prepared to develop or deliver. This isn't an either social entrepreneurship or big business agenda, but will involve both together. Looking at the worlds of our three sponsoring organizations, the evidence is clear. A company like the US chemical giant DuPont , with its long- standing 'sustainable growth' strategy, has the capacity to bring new solutions to scale. To take just two of DuPont's 2015 goals: it aims to grow annual revenues from products that create energy efficiency or cut greenhouse gas emissions by $2 billion, and to nearly double revenues from non- depletable resources to at least $8 billion. The involvement of German financial services group, Allianz , underscores the growing role of the financial sector in supporting entrepreneurial solutions to the broad spectrum of sustainability challenges. And Jeff Skoll's background as a co-founder of eBay spotlights the emergence of very different thinking on how business models can be designed to replicate and scale \u2014 even, if the X Prize Foundation has its way (page 29), in such demanding areas as poverty alleviation. 6 Growing Opportunity Introduction 'At its core, the corporate pursuit of sustainable development is not just about \"doing good.\" It makes companies more entrepreneurial, nimble and competitive. ' Bj\u00f6rn Stigson, WBCSD 11 www.sustainability.com/insight/skoll.asp 12 John Elkington, The Chrysalis Economy: How Citizen CEOs and Corporations Can Fuse Vales and Value Creation , Capstone/John Wiley & Sons, 2001. 13 Our Common Future , Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development ('Brundtland Commission'), Oxford University Press, 1987. 14 See Harvard Business Review , December 2006. So why are a growing number of business leaders suddenly so interested in the linked worlds of social and environmental entrepreneurship? And, with intensifying investor interest and lively media coverage, what is the current state of the key sectors now busily developing entrepreneurial solutions to the world's looming sustainability challenges? These are questions SustainAbility is exploring in its three-year Skoll Program (2006- 2009). 11 Growing Opportunity is the first in a planned survey of studies into key aspects of this increasingly important field. Why should business be interested in all of this? We asked Bj\u00f6rn Stigson, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). He replied: 'At its core, the corporate pursuit of sustainable development is not just about \"doing good.\" It makes companies more entrepreneurial, nimble and competitive. One of our largest manufacturing members has taken the concept of eco-efficiency so seriously that it began focusing on selling less material product and more knowledge, with great success. A Latin American member understood base-of-the-pyramid business as a theory, but then found by experience that it makes good bottom-line business sense. Coping with sustainability challenges builds stronger companies. ' In 2001, SustainAbility concluded that the early decades of the 21st century would see a series of interlinked economic, tech - nological, social, political, and managerial transitions that would transform the global economy, in very much the same way as the rapacious caterpillar is transformed inside a chrysalis. We are now embarked on a period of profound economic metamorphosis, of what the economist Schumpeter dubbed 'creative destruction. ' Think of the entrepreneurs profiled in the following pages as the global economy's equivalent of the 'imaginal buds' that drive the process that converts a caterpillar into a butterfly inside the chrysalis. 12 In preparing this study, we interviewed 20 entrepreneurs in depth \u2014 and over 100 more completed an online survey (page 48). It is clear that they are as determined as ever to drive change, but it is also clear that many of their enterprises are experiencing significant growing pains along the way. Key drivers Focusing down on today's world, at least four factors seem to be central in driving the growing mainstream interest in social and environmental entrepreneurship: \u2014 First, 20 years after the Brundtland Commission first put sustainable development onto the political agenda,13 a number of major challenges once seen to be (and often dismissed as) the preserve of activist NGOs and wider civil society have pushed forcefully into the political and business mainstream \u2014 a process often reinforced by the withdrawal or weakening of government activity. Successive summit meetings of the World Economic Forum , for example, have focused on an increasingly interconnected agenda linking such issues as poverty, hunger, pandemic risks, terrorism, human rights, energy security, and the growing threat of climate destabilization. \u2014 Second, despite the huge progress achieved in corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility over the past 10-15 years, there is a growing concern that we may be reaching the 'limits of CSR. ' The Harvard Business Review 14 neatly captured this mood with a twinned pair of articles by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer ('Strategy and Society: The Link Between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility') and Clayton Christensen ('Disruptive Innovation for Social Change'). The conclusion: too many companies have seen the new, interconnected agenda as remote from their core business interests. The reality is that these complex issues pose increasingly strategic choices that need to be addressed in suitably radical and higher leverage ways \u2014 something that most corporate citizenship departments seem ill-equipped to do. 7 Growing Opportunity Introduction Panel 1.1 One key reason why Definitions mainstream business needs to pay attention is that Entrepreneurs are people who, through the practical exploitation of new ideas,these people aim to achieve establish new ventures to deliver goods higher leverage than and services currently not supplied by existing markets. That said, people likeconventional philanthropy Greg Dees (Adjunct Professor of Social and NGOs, often aiming Entrepreneurship and Nonprofit Manage - ment, Fuqua School of Business, Duke to transform the systems University ) argue that there is a spectrum whose dysfunctions help of enterprise, from the purely charitable through to the purely commercial.15 Our create or aggravate major version of that spectrum \u2014 or landscape \u2014 can be seen in Figure 1.1.socio-economic, environ - mental, and political On the purely charitable side, 'customers' pay little or nothing, capital comes inproblems. the form of donations and grants, the workforce is largely made up of volunteers, and suppliers make in-kind donations. At the purely commercial end, all these transactions are at market rates. Most of the really interesting experiments, however, are now happening in the middle ground, where hybrid organizations pursue 'blended value' and where less-well-off customers are subsidized by better-off customers. 15 J. Gregory Dees and Beth Battle Anderson, 'Framing a Theory of Social Entrepreneurship: Building on Two Schools of Practice and Thought, ' in Rachel Moser-Williams (Editor), Research on Social Entrepreneurship , ARNOVA occasional paper series, Vol. 1, No. 3, The Aspen Institute, Washington DC, 2006. 16 www.ashoka.com 17 www.skollfoundation.org/ aboutsocialentrepreneurship/whatis.asp Social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs whose new ventures (social enterprises) prioritize social returns on investment, i.e. improving quality of life for marginalized populations by addressing issues such as health, poverty, and education. One key reason why mainstream business needs to pay attention is that these people aim to achieve higher leverage than conventional philanthropy and NGOs, often aiming to transform the systems whose dysfunctions help create or aggravate major socio - economic, environmental, and political problems. Ashoka16 defines social entrepreneurs as, 'individuals with innovative solutions to society's most pressing social problems. They are ambitious and persistent, tackling major social issues and offering new ideas for wide-scale change. Rather than leaving societal needs to the government or business sectors, social entrepreneurs find what is not working and solve the problem by changing the system, spreading the solution, and persuading entire societies to take new leaps. ' The Skoll Foundation puts it this way: 'Social entrepreneurs share a commitment to pioneering innovations that reshape society and benefit humanity. Whether they are working on a local or inter - national scale, they are solution-minded pragmatists who are not afraid to tackle \u2014 and successfully resolve \u2014 some of the 17world's biggest problems. ' Environmental entrepreneurs may be interested in social objectives, but their main focus is environmental. Many consider environmental entrepreneurship to be a subset of social entrepreneurship, but they are distinct. A major rebranding of the sector began in 2002, as the 'cleantech' sector. The Cleantech Venture Network (CVN) defines cleantech as embracing 'a diverse range of products, services, and processes that are inherently designed to provide superior performance at lower costs, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental impacts and, in doing so, improve the quality of life. CVN includes the following sectors: energy generation; energy storage; energy infrastructure; energy efficiency; transportation & logistics; water purification & manage - ment; air quality; materials & nano - technology; manufacturing/industrial; agriculture & nutrition; materials recovery and recycling; environmental IT and enabling technologies. ' 8 Growing Opportunity Introduction Figure 1.1 The opportunity landscape It's remarkable how much of the financial world's vocabulary relates to water and to hydraulic imagery. We have liquid assets and liquidations, we manage cash flows and solvency, we float companies and exchange rates, there is sunk capital and there are investments below water, money goes down the drain, we try to deflate bubbles, and we \u2014 or at least some people \u2014 launder money. In this spirit, Figure 1.1 plots five zones of the opportunity landscape for entre - preneurs. On the vertical axis, we plot 'Impact' (think leverage, blended value creation, 18 and system change), from Low to High, and on the horizontal axis we plot the degree to which the 'Drivers' of action are 'purely' Moral or 'purely' Financial. Clearly, entrepreneurs of different types will spot opportunity right across this landscape. Zone 5 High Zone 4 Zone 3 Zone 2 Zone 1 Impact Low \u2014 Zone 1 (The Drain) is where money drains from the system, because of poor management \u2014 or because of the bribery and corruption that blights so many economies and new ventures. Enron operated in this space, as do the fraudulent 'briefcase NGOs' that blight countries like India. \u2014 Zone 2 (The Well) is where communities under stress \u2014 or those that help them \u2014 dip into capital reserves and the benevolence of ordinary citizens, although (like wells) public benevolence can be over- pumped to the point of exhaustion or 'donor fatigue. ' M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and the Red Cross are leading players here. \u2014 Zone 3 (The Siphon) is the area of corporate philanthropy, where businesses create shareholder returns, but channel off a percentage, partly to ensure their continuing license to operate. Think of the Danone Communities Fund, Shell Foundation, or Google.org. \u2014 Zone 4 (The Pump) is where predominantly non-profit or hybrid non-profit/for-profit ventures leverage resources to create blended value \u2014 and, through lobbying, promote wider systemic change. Organizations like Grameen Bank, OneWorld Health, and PATH create change here. \u2014 Zone 5 (The Geyser) is where deep-seated seismic forces (think demography, economic development, technology trends, and eco-pressures like climate change) build a head of pressure that powerfully, if un - predictably, erupts in showers of new wealth \u2014 laying down deposits of value and helping irrigate the entire catchment area. Powerful players here include Acciona, GE, Vestas, and much of the cleantech sector.

' This trend aligns decades, but has been given a major boost by the work of Ashoka and initiatives launched by The Schwab Foundation , The Skoll Foundation , Acumen , Endeavor , and Fast Company (particularly its Social Capitalist Awards). closely with the emerging 'Fourth Wave' agenda SustainAbility has been tracking. Just as a series of waves run through the caterpillar to uncover the chrysalis, so the global economy has been powerfully shaped by a series of societal pressure waves \u2014 at least in the OECD region (Figure 1.2).21 Figure 1.2 Upwaves and downwaves Waves record 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Earth Day / US passes Clean Air Act / Tidal wave kills 150,000 Oklahoma City bombing / Netscape goes public US Supreme Court opts for Bush / CSR + SD on WEF agendaUS troops go into battle in Vietnam Mikhail Gorbachev becomes Soviet leader / LiveAidSaigon falls / Oil begins to flow from North Sea / Angolan civil warJFK's 'New Frontier' / Sharpeville massacre, South Africa / U2 crisis Robert Mugabe elected President, Zimbabwe / Solidarity, Poland Nelson Mandela freed / East and West Germany reunite 7-7 attacks, UK / Hurricane Katrina, US World population Waves (average) projection Billions Population record Population projection Total Urban Rural 1 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 10 Growing Opportunity Introduction This report attempts to assess the current state of social entrepreneurship. 22 Four scenarios based on SustainAbility's pressure waves analysis will feature in another report part-funded by The Skoll Foundation, focusing on the future of globalization. Due out in June 2007. 23 www.schwabfound.org 24 www.the-hub.net 25 www.riseproject.org 26 www.fastcompany.com/social Given that 2007 marks the year when the human population becomes predominantly urban for the first time, the three blue lines map the trends in the rural, urban, and global populations. By our analysis, the waves have run as follows: \u2014 Wave 1 (peaking 1969-72) focused on new policies, rules and regulations, largely in the environmental, safety, and health areas. During this period, there was much counter-cultural entrepreneurship, particularly in areas like whole foods and 'alternative' or 'intermediate' technology. The compliance agenda continues to evolve globally. \u2014 Wave 2 (peaking 1988-91) drove voluntary market initiatives in such areas as reporting and certification, including the evolution of standards such as ISO14001 and the Global Reporting Initiative. Here, much of the entrepreneurship focused on environmental and sustainability- related services and socially responsible investment. \u2014 Wave 3 (peaking 1999-2001, before being knocked back sharply by 9/11) drove concerns around globalization and both global and corporate governance. This period saw a dramatic increase in the number of networks linking social and environmental entrepreneurs. \u2014 Wave 4 (which is just getting into its stride) appears to be rebounding energetically, with a growing focus on innovation and entrepreneurial solutions to sustainability challenges. 22 The promise is that mainstream players now get involved, potentially overwhelming or outflanking smaller players. Equally, however, the prospect of alliances, partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions will also likely grow. 2007 survey and report This report attempts to assess the current state of social entrepreneurship \u2014 the possibilities presented by new mindsets, the challenges entrepreneurs face in scaling their organizations and the opportunities for greater collaboration with corporations and others. To explore these themes, we: \u2014 E-mailed a quantitative survey instrument to 400 entrepreneurs, selected from the networks of the The Skoll Foundation , The Schwab Foundation ,23 The Hub ,24 Columbia University's RISE project ,25 and Fast Company .26 Over 100 completed the full survey, representing a 27% response rate. The survey instrument can be found in Annex 1; \u2014 Undertook extensive desk research, including 'Deeper Dives' into the health and energy sectors, and took part in a number of major events in the field; and \u2014 Interviewed 20 entrepreneurs in depth, either face-to-face or by telephone. We rounded out this research with feedback from our growing network. From Acumen to zouk ventures, we invited perspectives about the main challenges and oppor - tunities facing social and environmental entrepreneurs today. The survey findings follow in Chapter 2. 11 2 Growing Opportunity 27 28 29 www.grameenphone.com/ index.php?id=64 www.ashoka.org www.acumenfund.org www.fastcompany.com/social wwwschwabfound.org; www.skollfoundation.org To our surprise, the entrepreneurs interviewed and surveyed were significantly more interested in responding than we had imagined \u2014 and the thrust of our questions was particularly appreciated. Indeed, it soon became clear that even the best entrepreneurs are experiencing real growing pains, mainly in the field of funding \u2014 but also in a number of other areas. For the sake of simplicity, let's boil down the questions to three main areas of interest: 1 Who are these people, what are they trying to do, how do they view the prospects for scaling what they do, and how optimistic/pessimistic are they currently? 2 What are the critical challenges they face in replicating and scaling successful solutions to sustainability challenges? 3 And how do they think of mainstream business in all of this \u2014 whether as a route to funding, a source of potential partnerships, or as a roadblock to progress? We cover the first two areas in Chapter 2, the third in Chapter 3. 1 Meet the entrepreneurs Panel 2.1 Organizational mission Each organization was asked to identify its 'primary area of focus. ' Social equity, selected by most respondents, includes organizations addressing poverty, economic development, and empower - ment of marginalized citizens. Not surprisingly, a significant number of respondents selected 'something else' \u2014 an illustration of how social entrepreneurs see these challenges as interrelated and their solutions as out-of-the-box. Most used the 'something else' response to signal 'several of the above. ' The results are shown in Figure 2.1. Survey Findings Who are these people? For non-experts who know something of the field, Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank is probably the first person who comes to mind. But Dr Yunus is not a typical social entrepreneur, however much many entrepreneurs may see him as their model. Not only does he now have a Nobel Prize, but he has been working in the area for over 30 years, his institution is large, successful and globally known, and already partnering with a number of major corporations \u2014 including Danone and Telenor . 27 By contrast, perhaps the best way to get a sense of the more typical high-performance social entrepreneur is to take a look at Ashoka's website.28 Or, to focus on people who have gone through further hoops, visit the websites of Acumen Fund , Endeavor Global , Fast Company , The Schwab Foundation , and 29The Skoll Foundation . 12 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings Figure 2.1 As far as the respondents to our Primary mission of quantitative survey is are concerned, organizations surveyed their missions and geographic focus are N=109 summarized in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. % How do they think of \u2014 or label \u2014 100 themselves? 90 Many respondents and interviewees clearly considered themselves to be 'social' or 'environmental' entrepreneurs, while others 80 thought of themselves as entrepreneurs, innovators or even campaigners. Here are 70 replies from four US respondents that underscore the diversity of perspectives even among entrepreneurs of the same 60 nationality: 50 \u2014 Rick Surpin, ICS Health Care, New York, NY 'I consider myself a social entrepreneur, 40 but that is an approach to the work; it's not my vocation and no one would give us money, except Skoll possibly, on 30 this basis. If people ask me what I do \u2014 I work on transforming the health care 20 and social service system for low income adults with disabilities and create decent jobs for low income people at the same 10 time. This is how I see myself and what I think is interesting and challenging and generally what makes other people interested as well. ' \u2014 Chris Elias, PATH Health Care, Seattle, WA 'We are a relatively new entrant into this discourse and community of social entrepreneurs. It is clear that there are two groups. There are the organizations that were basically built around an individual social entrepreneur who had a strong vision and charisma and created an organization to meet that vision. Then there are groups like PATH and Technoserve, that may have started that way, but are now big organizations whose directors are certainly entre - preneurial . . . but it no longer makes sense to talk of PATH as the product of any one person. We have 550 staff worldwide with variable degrees of entrepreneurship. If I were to I ask, probably 100 or more of them would raise their hand and say \"Yes, I'm an entrepreneur.\" ' Social equity Something else Education Environment / Energy Tolerance / Human rights Health Institutional responsibility Peace / Security Housing \u2014 Laura Peterson, Hands to Hearts International Health Care, Portland, OR 'Right now there is a ton of hype around social entrepreneurs. There are pros and cons to this, but the reality is that very few social entrepreneurs will ever get off the ground. I am a therapist, a supervisor, and an administrator. Now people call me a \"social entrepreneur,\" but I'm not entirely comfortable with that. This title seems to come with super-human expectations that go beyond talent, innovation, and integrity and into unrealistic extremes of personal self-sacrifice. ' \u2014 Josh Tosteson, HydroGen LLC Cleantech, Cleveland, OH 'We are a commercial business in the clean energy industry. So, we manu - facture fuel cell systems for industrial applications, and as such, I wouldn't characterize our business strictly as a \"social entrepreneurial\" venture. It has clear social benefits that motivate and animate some of the reasons why I and some of my colleagues are involved with it in the first place. On the other hand, we are casting this as a straight up commercial venture subject to all of the challenges and opportunities inherent in that kind of a corporate enterprise. Even though we pay attention at a certain level to the social outcomes of the work we do, and focus intently on how we operate as an ethical enterprise both in internal and external dealings, as an investor-backed, public company we need to retain a first-order focus on business metrics that reflect our principal obligations to shareholders and investors. ' 13 100 90 80 70 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings Figure 2.2 Primary regions of operation N=109 % 60 50 40 30 20 10 North America Asia South America Africa Europe Middle East South Pacific 30 Note: there may be a risk of survey bias, on the basis that those responding could be more optimistic about their ventures, although there could equally be a reverse effect. 31 www.xprize.org Where are they on the optimism-pessimism spectrum? Successful entrepreneurs, by their very nature, tend to be optimists \u2014 highly pragmatic optimists. No surprise, then, to find that, despite the challenges, the entrepreneurs we interviewed were overwhelmingly optimistic. Most cited what some might see as extremely aggressive growth plans, such as doubling their operations in the next three to five years, and taking local programs national or, if already operating at the national scale, international. Our survey results reflect this optimism \u2014 32% believe they will move away from foundation funding to more sustainable source of funding in the next five years. 30 That said, several \u2014 including PATH \u2014 expect to scale significantly mainly on the basis of foundation funding. Reading between the lines, however, we did detect a difference in tone from those addressing poverty issues as compared with the rest of the social enterprise community. We often heard a more frustrated (sometimes even desperate) tone, a sense that the challenges are much greater than currently acknowledged, and that \u2014 because this is an area of intense market failure \u2014 social entrepreneurs have to compete for limited foundation funding. Typical comments noted the need to live a 'hand-to-mouth existence, ' and another spoke of the challenge of, 'Gaining recognition in a very crowded non-profit marketplace. ' More fundamentally still, another respondent argued that, 'There needs to be a paradigm shift in order to reduce world hunger and poverty. ' More positively, the emergence and growth of the base-of-the-pyramid movement is seen as an optimistic trend, an attempt to reframe the issues in terms of the potential commercial opportunities. It will be fascinating to see how The X Prize Foundation , 31 which stimulated a huge wave of private enterprise in relation to space travel and is now working in such Panel 2.2 Regions We asked where each respondent's organization 'primarily' operated, which allowed for multiple answers in terms of geographies. North America came top (54%), with the South Pacific \u2014 perhaps not surprisingly \u2014 bottom. The low positioning of Europe is notable. fields as genomics and automobility, applies the same approach with its planned prize for poverty alleviation (page 29). One key is to set the targets in ways designed to switch on the entrepreneurial juices of a wider group of innovators. 14 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings 'If I had twice as much money, I'd make at least four times as much impact. ' Jim Fruchterman, Benetech How do they view the prospects for replication and scaling? For the new breed of funders, the capacity of social or environmental entrepreneurs to replicate and scale is fundamental. For many, scalability \u2014 of beneficial impacts, business models, and enterprises \u2014 is the Holy Grail. And that also creates a sense of frustration with the current order. Some respondents see the nature of much current funding as part of the problem \u2014 encouraging a sense of dependency. A related comment came from Keerti Pradhan of Aravind Eye Hospitals , in relation to the state of other NGOs, particularly in India: 'NGOs get hooked on a sense of getting when they rely on foundation or non-sustainable funding sources. As a result, people don't apply their brains to different ways to break that barrier of dependency on foundations. The question is: whose responsibility is it to help NGOs with this? NGOs have huge potential, but huge knowledge gaps exist about how to access market-rate funding sources that could help support non-profit work. ' Perhaps not surprisingly, most interviewees and respondents are enthusiastic about the ability of their model to replicate and scale. This trend seems to be independent of geography. Only one entrepreneur suggested that their model is too complex to scale at the pace that the Skoll and Schwab Foundations, and others, are pushing for \u2014 and clearly felt a great deal of pressure to do this beyond the organization's ability. The drive to scale is seen to raise its own very particular challenges. In addition to the financing, marketing, and maturation/development challenges highlighted in the next section, social entrepreneurs underscore issues such as: 'finding the right partners' for joint ventures and franchising; maintaining the quality of service, particularly when working with third parties; and the question of pace of growth \u2014 'How fast can I grow, continue to deliver and not compromise my mission?' Anyone working with mainstream entrepreneurs will recognize the thrust of the questions. Finally, a significant minority of the entrepreneurs stressed the need for government to play a more effective role in making scaling possible. In particular, entrepreneurs suggest that government: \u2014 Needs to provide an enabling environment , through policies that create, as a minimum, a level playing field for solutions and, at best, that strongly incentives the development and deployment of new solutions; partly by developing incentives that allow the most cost-effective solutions to compete, for example by removing perverse incentives. In many countries, more fundamentally still, governments also need to provide basic infrastructure, such as sewers, roads, and schools. \u2014 Must make social and environmental issues a political priority . A number of respondents expressed concern that their issues were not top priorities for politicians in their country. \u2014 Should explore alternatives. Sylvia Aruffo of Careguide Systems in the healthcare sector said, 'It's very difficult for any entrepreneur when you have a breakthrough idea and the structure is already set up for another way to solve that problem. What do you do when your solution is better, but it just doesn't fit?' \u2014 Has a role to play in setting minimum standards for provision , and in scaling solutions, not just as service providers, but as policy makers, procurers of services, landlords, experts, and so on. \u2014 Can be a major stumbling block in some countries , particularly where there is widespread corruption. Some governments, we were told, don't want social entrepreneurs to succeed, because it would make them look bad and accentuate their failures. 15 100 90 80 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings Figure 2.3 Challenges facing social entrepreneurs Respondents select the top two challenges they face in growing their organizations N=109 % 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 Accessing capital Promoting / Marketing Maturing / Professionalizing Recruiting talent Adapting to landscape Other 32 www.stonyfield.com 33 www.danone.com 2 Critical challenges The central thesis of Growing Opportunity is that the undoubted progress of the social enterprise sector is often being bought at the expense of growing human, organizational, and opportunity costs. This is inevitable, given that the same could be said of all entrepreneurial ventures, but the conclusion calls for a thoughtful, coordinated set of responses from those who fund and otherwise support these people. The pains, as Panel 2.3 suggests, come in various areas: funding, promotion and organizational development. The majority of respondents operate in the not-for-profit sector, which intensifies the challenges of raising funding and recruiting and retaining talent. A number of challenges raised by not-for- profit enterprises are clearly much less of an issue for their for-profit counterparts, particularly in terms of the ability to attract and hold talent. But for-profit social enterprises have their own challenges. Since a number of for-profits (both independent and owned by others) were included in our interviews and survey, it is worth focusing on one case which seems to provide a benchmark for quality scaling. Our interviewee: Gary Hirshberg, President and self-styled 'CE-YO' at Stonyfield Farm, Inc. , 32 now part of the 33French food and beverage group Danone . We asked what he had had to give up when Stonyfield was acquired by Danone. 'First, ' he said, 'I don't feel that I gave up very much in doing this deal. They bought out all of my non-employee shareholders, which was something that I needed to do in any case. But even though they were going to own 80% (it is now 85% as I have sold some shares to them) of the company, they left me with majority control by granting me the right to vote three of the five board seats for as long as I remain active as Chairman and/or CEO. In fact, the only veto rights that I did give them were that they had to approve (a) any capital improvements over $1 million and (b) any acquisitions of other companies. ' Panel 2.3 Critical challenges, 2007 1 Raising capital Overwhelmingly, social entrepreneurs cited access to capital as one of their two primary challenges (72%), because capital is what enables the entrepreneurs to hire talent, market, rent space, pursue pilot projects, and carry out other activities related to growing their organizations. 2 Promotion and marketing Promoting or marketing their organizations and offerings was the second most frequently mentioned challenge (41%). The focus: making consumers, businesses, funders, and other relevant stakeholders aware of the good work that the organization is doing. Like mainstream entre - preneurs, however, social and environmental entrepreneurs are usually ahead of the curve and it takes time for the rest of the world to catch up, including funders, government policy makers, and potential mainstream business partners. 3 Developing organizations Key issues here include: recruiting, developing and retaining talent; and balancing professionalism with entrepreneurialism and passion for the mission. Attracting talent was cited by most entrepreneurs as a priority challenge, but more specifically, social enterprises are challenged to find the right kind of talent for their ventures \u2014 a blend of entrepreneurship and pro - fessionalism, coupled with an ability to: (1) work as effectively with the communities served by the enterprise (often very poor and marginalized) as with corporate management/boards; (2) bring leading edge technical capabilities to bear; (3) have business know-how; and (4) buy into the enterprise's mission and vision. A tall order, especially without competitive salaries. 16 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings 'We must find the right leaders for the next phase of growth. We need entrepreneurs who have the business skills, social dedication, and sense of humor that are essential to success. ' 'Otherwise, things today are pretty much the way they've always been, except that we now have access to a global network of resources and talents, and of course we are engaged with that network to create organic enterprises in many other countries. Parenthetically, I have proposed three investments/acquisitions since the partnership began and they have approved all three. ' Danone has stuck to the spirit \u2014 not just the letter \u2014 of the bargain. 'Danone hasEducation Sector not wavered at all from the original deal, even though there have been plenty of opportunities for them to do so, ' Hirshberg commented. 'For instance, we have required far more Cap-Ex [capital expenditure] than anyone ever dreamt back in 2001, and they have fully funded our requirements without seeking any additional advantage or trade-off on my part. Reciprocally, we have grown faster than they or we expected and we have certainly delivered excellent results for them, so everybody has won something. ' 'Additionally, I expect to see many more organic/bio launches in many other countries, and each one will be adapted not only to the local market conditions, but to the various Danone organizational structures. I also expect to continue to have a big influence on Danone's climate and organic policies around the world. ' This sounds like a virtual Nirvana, not only for non-profits but also for most for- profits needing an exit strategy to ensure a financial return on early investment. A more typical response from our survey was this: 'We would like to be free from the rat-race of fundraising and proposal- writing, and have our own private sources of income. They are the most stable and predictable. ' Unfortunately, this is a distant dream for most of the entrepreneurs we spoke to \u2014 and likely to remain so, given the challenges they spotlight. So what are the main financial challenges? Business people wanting to understand and engage these entrepreneurs need to understand the world in which these people operate \u2014 and the challenges they face. 'Attracting top management and, in particular, providing sufficient compensation is a primary challenge, ' said Linda Rottenberg, CEO of Endeavor Global . 'From NYC to Bangalore, people will make the trade-off between making a difference and making money at 2x earnings disparity, but not at 5x or 10x. ' Time after time, research has shown that it is easy to start a non-profit or social enterprise, but very much harder to bring it to scale. It was clear that raising money was the single greatest challenge that most entrepreneurs face \u2014 see Figure 2.3, where 'access to capital' ranks top at 72%. And there were no easy answers. 'All sources of money come with their own challenges, ' was the way one entrepreneur put it. Four key issues surfaced in the survey and interviews: 1 Square pegs: social entrepreneurs don't fit the existing system There is a widely held sense that the unique approaches of social entre - preneurs are hard to fit into existing investor models and criteria, although the same point probably could be made about all forms of entrepreneurship. Foundations and governments are seen as siloed and conservative, with the result that they struggle to take on grantees that don't fit their narrower sense of solution options. More, these groups typically do not lend to for-profit organizations, which leaves out a significant segment of social entre - preneurs. Traditional debt instruments are sometimes used, but can present major challenges in terms of entre - preneurs' ability to service the debt. Current equity investments are seen as shorter term than what is needed \u2014 and are often too expensive for entrepreneurs with a social mission. 17 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings 'We are a small organization that is up against the over - head wall. To get and retain qualified staff we need to pay more than we are able to. To be able to pay more we have to raise more funds, but to raise more funds we need more staff. A perfect vicious circle. ' Poverty Alleviation Sector 2 Lack of consistent, flexible, and long-term financing Nearly every entrepreneur interviewed noted the importance of time horizons. In particular, the work they are engaged in tends to have long time-frames (5-10 years to results was typical) and requires partnerships and funding that match these needs, i.e. is consistent and long-term. The need for flexibility was also a consistent theme: most entrepreneurs are able to access specific project financing, but have a harder time accessing funds that will support more general infrastructure needs. Some current funding sources that appear to be meeting these needs include: Innovation capital This term was used to refer to unrestricted donations from high net-worth individuals that enable the entrepreneur to take risks, enter new markets, hire ahead of the curve or do pilot projects, ultimately helping to leverage additional funding, whether grants or loans. There is a sense that innovation capital only needs to be a small percentage of total funding, but offers the opportunity for incredibly high leverage. Angel investors For profit-making enterprises, Angels (individuals who make very early-stage investments in start-ups) were cited as particularly helpful because they are often patient investors, sharing the vision. Funding from unusual foundations Certain foundations, with Skoll often instanced, appear to 'get it, ' providing longer term funding for entrepreneurs. Still, the maximum grant length is about three years, which falls short of longer term needs. International aid organizations The Asian Development Bank, World Bank and IMF were cited as potential 'patient' investors. A downside to these sources, however, is that they mainly fund non- profits, so entrepreneurs set up as for- profits may fall through the cracks. Private investment funds The New York City Investment Fund was cited as a helpful source. Its investments typically range in size from $1 million to $3 million. The Fund provides equity or debt, structured to meet the needs of the project. It will invest at any stage of business development, but seeks to exit in about five years. The particular focus here is on ventures that provide benefits to NYC. 3 Lack of knowledge about \u2014 and access to \u2014 capital markets Like their mainstream counterparts, at least early on in their careers, most of the entrepreneurs we interviewed lack in-depth knowledge of capital markets and the best ways to finance their organizations. They rely on trusted advisors, mostly on their boards of directors, for this information as well as for access to investors. There is a strong sense, however, that social entrepreneurs could benefit from increased knowledge about the best financing options, as well as better access to open-minded financiers. 4 Sustainable sources of financing bring their own challenges As entrepreneurs move toward more self- financing models, whether for-profit or non-profit, they encounter challenges. Companies considering 'Robin Hood' business models \u2014 where revenues from those able to pay for services subsidize provision to those who can't, or can't pay the full cost \u2014 face challenges in ensuring that as they provide services to customers with a higher willingness to pay, they don't lose sight of their mission. Fees and service-based approaches to financial sustainability may appear promising, but can also pose challenges for some entrepreneurs. They run the risk of stretching too far afield from their core competencies, with the result that the poorest people, whose needs were the original spur to action, cannot access the service. 18 100 90 80 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings Figure 2.4 Preferred sources of financing N=109 % 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 Foundations Sales / Fees Fundraising Government Venture capital Help-in-kind Joint venturing Other Franchising Own pockets Going public 34 www.ransac.org 35 As one of our interviewees noted in response to this point, 'Here is the elephant in the room. Let's talk about the nature of foundation boards. This question reflects the thinking of foundation boards about their own personal clout and their attention levels. When [a named] foundation took a capacity building approach, the staff found the biggest challenge was managing the board's boredom level. It just wasn't very exciting to see a list of performance indicators making an incremental and upward change. The board got bored. The program officer developed a way to utilize the board members as development consultants with the grantees and this helped to stem the boredom tide. Understanding the motivation and stimulation of foundation board members is key to working on this one. ' 36 www.firstbook.org/site/ c.lwkyj8nvjvf/b.674095/k.cc09/home.htm For-profit social enterprises face challenges as both government and investors expect them to act like typical, for-profit companies, and so expect standard income tax payments and market rates of return. Restrictions also apply, such as an inability to access donations from the general public, apply for certain types of foundation/ government funding, and pursue more charitable elements of their businesses. For some, the business case for support is easy to articulate, for others less so. Consider the Partnership for Global Security , 34 which lobbies for more effective action to control weapons of mass destruction. They noted that they are 'looking beyond foundations to joint ventures with local/state government and commercial entities that have a stake in our issues. ' They also want to raise funds from the public and 'venture capitalists' who 'understand that preventing a WMD catastrophe is essential for global economic growth \u2014 and that government structures are currently insufficient for the task. ' Non-profits who have been able to clearly state the benefits of their work have, as a result of clarity of message, done spectacularly well at fund-raising. As an example, Room to Read , which aims to bring books and libraries to countries like Nepal and Vietnam, has gone 'from zero to $12 million of annual revenue in seven years, ' according to its Founder and CEO, John Wood. Room to Read has raised money through corporate relationships, high net worth individuals and over 200 public speeches per year. There is, however, a potential fly in this ointment. Wood expressed concern that, 'some organizations tell us that we have gotten big, \"so you no longer need us\" . ' This reaction, he noted, 'is very different from the private sector, where success attracts capital. Why should an NGO be penalized for being successful, and why should any donor want an NGO they have funded in its early years to remain small?' 35 He went on to note, 'Getting financing for your NGO is a bit like trying to compose a mosaic that is made up of thousands of tiles. Funder A wants to fund tiles #389 and #672, whereas Funder B wants to fund other tiles, but wants different reports on different timelines than those required by Funder A. It eats up a lot of management bandwidth to keep up with it all. ' Others were more positive, among them \u2014 in the same sector, but focused on the US rather than on developing countries \u2014 First Book , whose mission is to provide disadvantaged children with new books. 36 'We have already developed the necessary mechanisms and the enterprises are already successful, ' said Kyle Zimmer, the organization's co-founder and President. 'It is now a matter of scaling up. ' Their business model is worth a close look, as a leading edge example of a financially sophisticated social enterprise, because they have worked out how to target an unmet need at a price point that works for all \u2014 and because they have developed a business model that fits in very well with the interests of the publishing industry. The '10 Routes to Money' (below) are sequenced in the order that a composite entrepreneur might try them out, but the actual ranking by frequency of reported use was quite different, and is shown in Figure 2.4. The question asked here was: 'Thinking about financing your initiatives, which sources of funding do you feel will be the best avenues for you to pursue?' Growing Opportunity 19 Survey Findings Panel 2.4 In-kind help'It is now beyond urgent 10 routes to money Perhaps surprisingly, this came in seventh, that we create a new at 31%.

Developed in partnership with IBLF, the Prize is awarded to 'any not-for-profit, civil society or non - governmental organization based anywhere in the world that is demonstrating a comprehensive approach to addressing, achieving and further advancing economic, environmental and/or social sustainability. ' 50 www.ethicalperformance.net alcan_barefootcollege.html Not all corporate foundations are heading 51 www.shellfoundation.org into the social enterprise space, however. 52 www.fascinating.tv As Kurt Hoffman, Director of The Shell 53 www.earthlink.net Foundation ,51 told us, 'Our main focus, as you know, is \"enterprise solutions to poverty\" in poor countries, where the lack of sufficient numbers of enterprises of all kinds is the major constraint on self- sustaining development emerging in those countries. Rich countries \u2014 and rich donors like The Skoll Foundation \u2014 are best able to afford to focus on promoting \"social\" entrepreneurs. Poor countries mainly need entrepreneurs. So we tend to avoid hooking up or into the social enterpreneuring sector, as worthwhile as it is. ' Governments and public sector This route was favored by a significant proportion of entrepreneurs, coming in fourth place at 43%. Even for-profits saw public sector agencies as a key funding source. 'They represent the shortest paths to the level of funding we require, ' said one solar photovoltaics company, perhaps surprisingly. While some accessing government funding noted upsides, such as collaboration with leading scientists at government laboratories, public relations benefits, and access to government procurement avenues, others felt frustrated by the significant constraints associated with government funding and by its prescriptive nature. Not surprisingly given its accountability to citizens, government is often much less able to offer flexible funding guidelines that would match the needs of most social or environmental entrepreneurs. Sales and/or fees Over half (57%) of the respondents prefer to draw at least some of their revenues from this source, which came in third place. Jim Fruchterman of Benetech noted that, 'Earned income is a mark of the value of your product \u2014 and provides feedback from your customers. ' Easier to do, clearly, where markets are working to some degree, than where there are clear market failures. Some saw their sector as less suited to this model. 'Education is an area where there is a lower expectation of profitability, ' as the Fascinating Learning Factory 52 put it. A fair few respondents mentioned a tension at the heart of social entrepreneurship: on the one hand, there is a desire to give away information for free, while on the other there is a need to earn revenue to be sustainable. 'We've not yet worked out a way to earn income from selling our knowledge, ' said EarthLink . 53 'In the recent book, The Spider and the Starfish , the role of an intermediary, or catalyst, was described. Such people have a difficult time earning income from ideas they give away to anyone who will listen. Our aim is to create a hybrid, where we draw people from around the world to our website because the causes we address are important to individuals, foundations and people in industry, and we earn income by the types of services and tools we use to support the learning and interaction of these people. ' Franchising Both in the qualitative, in-depth interviews and in the quantitative survey, this option seemed to be somewhat outside the mainstream, coming in eighth place (15%). A rare example of a social enterprise that is considering some degree of franchising is Child Savings International , which has at least thought of franchising its Aflatoun brand to banks and other financial institutions. Founder and Chair, Jeroo Billimoria, is pursuing a dual franchise model: one level addressing non-profits and one for-profits. On the for-profit side, where the target is to partner with banks, she is setting up Aflatoun, Inc. , which will own the brand and also, longer term, open up the option of raising money through capital markets. On the non-profit side, Jean Horstman (CEO, InnerCity Entrepreneurs ) reports that, 'We are in the process of testing out licensing as the way to scale our impact quickly while growing our organization at a reasonable pace. We are exploring creating branches in the state of Massachusetts to learn to scale at the state level, while licensing our curriculum and support services nationally. ' 21 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings 'We have had a significant increase in companies wanting to sponsor us. The challenge is to remain selective and not to sell out. ' Anonymous respondent 54 www.landminesblow.com 55 www.drishtee.com 56 www.gexsi.org 57 www.sports4kids.org 58 www.itnamerica.org On the for-profit side, Orb Energy is also using the franchising model to scale its operations in India, preferring this route rather than raising additional capital. The franchise model, based on setting up branches, enables them to get closer to customers, while establishing a common 'look and feel' and affording greater economies of scale. A key challenge in this approach, CEO Damian Miller notes, is to ensure that franchisees do not sacrifice quality for revenues. Joint ventures Around a third (30%) of respondents mentioned joint ventures as a form of resourcing \u2014 and it was clear that a fair few entrepreneurs plan to develop such partnerships, though a surprising number expressed anxiety about their ability to identify suitable partners and strike a balanced deal. That said, they all felt they had significant value to add. And those taking this route saw many non-financial benefits. Such partnerships, said Landmines Blow! , 54 help both parties 'leverage their assets, such as their expertise and client base, with other advantages including sharing knowledge, the cultivation of new relationships, developing a continuum of care, working successfully in different cultural settings, and [gaining] approval from the United States Federal Government and the United Nations. ' Optimistically, perhaps, the vision is that, 'In a new world of virtual integration, the walls between enterprises crumble. ' It is clear that those thinking about this option are concerned about the implications. 'We have had a significant increase in companies wanting to sponsor us, ' said one, who asked to remain anonymous. 'The challenge is to remain selective and not to sell out. To maintain the purity of our program. ' The need to find out how to do such due diligence was an issue often raised. Venture capital One respondent described his challenge as, 'raising money for ideas that others have not accepted as workable. ' One way the mainstream economy deals with this challenge is via venture capital. Surprisingly, this came in fifth place, with more than a third (39%) of respondents saying they plan to draw to some extent on venture funding. If true, this is a striking result, though it may reflect the inclusion of a number of cleantech entrepreneurs in our sample and, possibly also, a mis - understanding on the part of at least some social entrepreneurs of what venture capital funding entails. One respondent even spoke of 'venture capital gifts. ' More typically, Drishtee 55 \u2014 which aims to empower entrepreneurs in India, village-by-village \u2014 spoke for many social entrepreneurs in saying that they look, in all areas of funding, for 'sources of funds that look for a commercial and social return on investment (ROI), simultaneously. ' The problem with the venture capital field, as normally understood, is that considerations about social ROI are likely to be even more squeezed than in the financial mainstream. IPOs and market listings This was very much bottom of the heap, coming in tenth place (2%) \u2014 and with a degree of unease about the implications and constraints expressed by a couple of the entrepreneurs we interviewed in depth. The relatively slow progress of initiatives like the Global Exchange for Social Investment (GEXSI) 56 hasn't helped. As John Wood, Founder and CEO of Room to Read put it, 'The capital markets for NGOs are blatantly inefficient. There is no mechanism that has the efficiency of the private sector (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, private placements, venture capital) when it comes to raising large amounts of capital \u2014 especially unrestricted funding. This, of course, is one reason why SASE (Skoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship) recipients are so grateful for the large, unrestricted, multi-year funding. The NGO world needs to have every large foundation seriously study \u2014 and hopefully emulate \u2014 this model. ' And what is true for NGOs is also true for most social enterprises. 'Other' sources This category was selected by 17% of respondents. The main additional source of funding identified was corporate partnerships or sponsorship, although that could potentially wrap in under 'Sales and Fees' or 'Joint Ventures' . Most suited to this option are enterprises that address issues of interest to high-brand companies. Take Sports4Kids , 57 which argued that, 'because of our emphasis on youth and sports, we are uniquely well-positioned to establish significant corporate partnerships with a range of industries, including footwear/apparel, food, and professional sports. ' Another enterprise, ITNAmerica , which focuses on dignified transportation for seniors, ' noted that corporate sponsorship 'is our riskiest revenue stream \u2014 but we feel it has great promise, as we represent a large and growing market. ' 58 22 Growing Opportunity Survey Findings Figure 2.5 How will funding patterns change over Manner of funding the next 5 years? Current N=92 Expected in five years N=99 One of most striking findings was the % remarkable collapse in the number of entrepreneurs expecting to be relying completely on grants in five years \u2014 100 from 27% to 8%. On the other side of the equation, there is an equivalent jump in 90 those expecting to be funding their own operations, with no reliance on grants \u2014 up from 8% to 28%. In the middle ground, 80 we see a somewhat less dramatic fall in the proportion of respondents saying that they 70 expect to be still relying on grants, but with some income \u2014 27% to 22% \u2014 and a more striking growth in the proportion expecting 60 a significant rebalancing in favor of earned income \u2014 from 38% to 50%. 50 40 30 20 10 What are the main organizational development challenges? 'Social entrepreneurship is still seen by some as a \"niche market\", ' said Jacqueline 59Novogratz, CEO of Acumen Fund , 'comprised of a rather unique sort of individual who feels comfortable straddling business and social incentives. There are thus three main challenges around whether and how it will move along the adoption curve and be accepted by a much larger client base (translated into funders and foundations). First, the circle of visible social entrepreneurs needs to be expanded significantly so that experts are not always pointing to the same examples of success. Second, there need to be more social enterprises demonstrating scale in terms both of the number of people they reach as well as the number they impact indirectly \u2014 and this means better measures to communicate quantitative as well as qualitative impact. Finally, there need to be more enterprises moving toward financial sustainability \u2014 or at least having plans that demonstrate they will be around in the long-term. Associated with this is whether funders will be able to \"exit\" successfully, but this is more derivative of the last point. ' 59 www.acumenfund.org For our sample as a whole, the overwhelming challenge flagged up in relation to developing their organizations had to do with people and talent. Specific points raised included the following: No grants / Completely other income Some grants / Primarily other income Primarily grants / Some other income Completely grants / No other income Attracting talent when they can't offer competitive salaries was cited by many organizations as a key development challenge. But, while the dominant sentiment, it wasn't universal. Some organizations cited high retention rates even though they offered lower than market salaries. They believe that this is due to their ability to offer a work environment that is challenging (including professional growth, learning opportunities), enabling their staff to focus on using their highest and best value skill sets (bringing in lower skilled labor to do less fulfilling work), and providing a culture that is mission-driven. A key advantage of the ability to retain and develop staff is that an organization keeps the tacit knowledge they have built up of the field and players. Balancing entrepreneurialism with professionalism and maintaining a focus on the mission and culture of the organization. As social enterprises mature, they require more professional and business-oriented talent. But this poses challenges in at least two ways. First, existing staff may find it difficult to adapt to the changing environment, when their generalist skills are no longer sufficient. Second, new staff that bring more professional capabilities may not have the highest degree of sensitivity around the mission. Also, not everyone in an organization can or should be entre - preneurial; social enterprises struggle to find the right balance between those who should be creative and entrepreneurial and those (think lawyers and accountants) who need to support the entrepreneurial culture with more professional and structured approaches. Those entrepreneurs who appear to be getting it right are very focused on these elements during the recruiting process, foster a culture of entrepreneurship through storytelling in the organization, and make quick decisions about letting people go who don't fit the desired culture. Succession planning/leadership development. Many entrepreneurs cited challenges around grooming their successors, in particular around finding talent that shared their vision for growth/success of the organization. At the extreme, there were two fascinating responses from Afghanistan that touched on this issue of drawing talent from a pool of people that have been beaten down by war for nearly 30 years. 23 3 Growing Opportunity 60 See Buried Treasure: Uncovering To have any chance of changing the the Business Case for Corporate world, entrepreneurial solutions must Sustainability , SustainAbility and UNEP, offer relatively high leverage, be able to 2001; and Developing Value: The Business replicate and scale, and \u2014 fundamentally Case for Sustainability in Emerging \u2014 become part of the market main- Markets, SustainAbility, the International stream.

Social and environmental entrepreneurs do not have all the answers, but they do see the world and markets differently, and the more innovative are experimenting with new business models that could potentially break out of their niches and help transform key elements of the global economy. There is a real risk that many business people will chalk this up as another fluffy, feel-good fad. There is every reason to be skeptical of any new movement or agenda, clearly, but our industry analyses (summarized in Chapters 4 and 5) uncovered a variety of ways that social entrepreneurs are doing things differently, realizing exciting sustainability outcomes and offering innovative opportunities for business.The Business Case Just as software morphs through successive generations, 1.0, 2.0 and so on, we conclude that the time has come for what we call 3.0 thinking in relation to sustainability challenges. If 1.0 was driven by regulators and promoted a compliance mindset in business, 2.0 has been more about corporate citizenship, based on transparency, accountability and a growing array of voluntary initiatives (Figure 3.1). By contrast, 3.0 thinking, strategy and ventures is different in that it seeks transformative market and sustainability outcomes. It is about creative destruction, as Joseph Schumpeter called it, and about creative reconstruction. In essence, Mindset 3.0 is about seeing \u2014 'reperceiving' 61 \u2014 immense challenges, such as the growing risk of abrupt climate change, as potential opportunities to leverage the power of markets and business to reboot entire economic and political systems. This is exactly what is beginning to happen in the energy field. In some cases the time-scales involved may be generational, but the transformation is under way. While the cleantech landscape is now largely populated with pure-play profit seekers, the industry was pioneered by individuals who saw the opportunity to leverage market drivers \u2014 such as energy security, stability, and cost \u2014 to realize significant environmental outcomes. The situation is different in the developing country healthcare field, where pulling on market levers does not work in the same way, largely due to weak end-markets. But the overwhelming unmet need for good, well-funded, state-provided health- care systems has not prevented social entrepreneurs from experimenting with cross-subsidized business models (rich patients' fees covering the costs of the poor, large companies' assets and talents being loaned for health outcomes). Though their efforts often expose the limits of current market-based social enterprise approaches in areas like poverty, they are spotlighting potential new markets, experimenting with new business models and modeling new leadership approaches. 24 Growing Opportunity The Business Case Significantly, social entre - preneurs are experimenting not only with business models but also with how value is defined and created. 62 www.mbdc.com 63 shop.easybeinggreen.com.au/ categories.asp?cid=71&fromhome=true 64 Figure 3.1 Transformational Towards Mindset 3.0 Sustainability impacts against market drivers Five building blocks If you stand back, Mindset 3.0 thinking and practice seems to have five main components: 1 Systems thinking and design Leading social and environmental entrepreneurs are fabled for taking a systems approach to major challenges and related design issues. Like Michael Braungart and Bill McDonough of MBDC ,62 they pursue 'cradle-to-cradle' solutions. Such systems thinkers ask deep questions with the customer in mind, e.g. how do I provide transportation services to my customer rather than how do I sell more oil? 2 Consumer engagement Market solutions depend on consumers \u2014 but social entrepreneurs have a rather different take on customers. They work with potential customers and consumers to co-create new markets and new product or service categories. In the health field, they champion the rights of consumers to hold service providers to account, even if they are not paying for the service. Villagereach , for example, makes explicit its aim to mobilize communities to take greater ownership of health systems to promote a social atmosphere of higher expectations and greater accountability. They understand that most people, most of the time, want to do the right thing. But things need to be made easier for them. Take a look at what Easy Being Green 63 is doing in Australia. It was founded to help people actively tackle climate change. A crucial key to success here is understanding the power of a million small actions to add up to truly significant outcomes. 3 Business models Much talked about during the New Economy era, an understanding of business models is now central to the debate about how to create tomorrow's value. Significantly, social entrepreneurs are experimenting not only with business models but also with how value is defined and created. Many are pioneers in the social return on investment (SROI) space. 64 They are also maximizing reach with 'Robin Hood' business models that enable services and products for poor citizens to be subsidized by those with a greater ability to pay. Examples here 65include the Aravind Eye . 4 360\u00b0 accountability Any business \u2014 mainstream, SME, or social enterprise \u2014 increasingly needs to work out how to be transparent and accountable to a growing range of real and self-elected stakeholders. Think of the work of such entrepreneurial organ - izations as Transparency International 68 and the Global Reporting Initiative 69 to increase corporate accountability and transparency. 5 Emerging economies At a time when there is growing mainstream interest in base-of-the pyramid markets, these people are in the thick of the BoP action. They aim to evolve new strategies to harness a wider range of resources to the task, while simultaneously experimenting with new ways of meeting the myriad needs of poor people. Their hands-on knowledge of such markets and of the political and regulatory environments potentially offers hugely valuable market intelli - gence to mainstream business. Consider the strategic alliance between Danone and the Grameen Bank 70 to bring valuable products and services to poor communities. Impacts Incremental 1.0 2.0 3.0 Risk Drivers Opportunity 25 Growing Opportunity The Business Case 'We already are seeing a changing zeitgeist among many employees of big corporations. ' Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen Fund 71 www.ksg.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/ publications/workingpaper_20_ nelson_jenkins.pdf Paths to partnership When we asked Acumen Fund CEO Jacqueline Novogratz how she saw the interface developing between business and social entrepreneurs, she replied, 'In many ways. First, we will see more corporations reaching out to social enterprises and traditional NGOs to facilitate the strengthening, expansion, and deepening of their own supply chains. Corporations are designing and developing affordable, useful products for the poor but they lack the real understanding of how poor communities work and, in some cases, lack the flexible distribution systems (and trust) to reach those communities effectively. NGOs and many social entrepreneurs, on the other hand, can have a deep knowledge around markets serving the poor but may lack the infrastructure, resources, or management depth to bring needed products to them. A marriage \u2014 or at least negotiated relationship between business and social enterprises can bring significant synergies with benefits to both parties' objectives. Second, we already are seeing a changing zeitgeist among many employees of big corporations, so we will likely see more activity from employees at all levels of a MNC that are focused on serving social enterprises and the poor directly. NGOs also see that their funding is increasingly dependent on concrete \u2014 reliable \u2014 results, and so we will see increasing activity on that front as well. ' Still, the paths to meaningful engagement and partnership are far from clear. The best work we have found to date on partnerships in this area comes out of Harvard University , and was produced by Jane Nelson and Beth Jenkins.71 Below, we briefly look at two different types of partnership currently being tested: (1) 'Enhanced Corporate Responsibility' and (2) an approach that Ashoka calls 'Hybrid Value Chains. ' The first, sketched in Figure 3.2, is where the company makes investments in social entrepreneurs who are focused on sustainability areas of interest to the company, such as climate change, poverty, or health care. The company provides financial resources to the social entrepreneur, as well as talent and access to the company's networks. In turn, the company potentially achieves enhanced sustainability outcomes and has the opportunity to boost its brand through the promotion of its support for the social entrepreneur. Employees of the company who work with the social enterprise are often inspired by the experience and bring this morale boost and creative thinking back to the company. Given the lack of capital and other critical business resources available to social entrepreneurs, this enhanced philanthropy role is an important one for companies to consider. As an example, the John Deere Foundation recently provided $3 million to KickStart , an innovative social enterprise that creates and markets tools to help end poverty in developing countries. Despite the undoubted attractions of the Enhanced Corporate Responsibility approach, however, a second partnership approach \u2014 the Hybrid Value Chain (Figures 3.3 and 3.4) \u2014 is emerging as potentially even more promising. Anecdotal evidence suggests that greater strategic engagement with social entrepreneurs offers the potential for greater returns to both parties. Figure 3.2 Benefits of enhanced corporate responsibility Financial contribution Management know-how Network access Employee inspiration Brand/reputation boost Enhanced sustainability outcomes MNC SE Multinational Social corporation entrepreneur 26 Growing Opportunity The Business Case Unexpected lessons from With continuing globalization, the potential for social and environmental entrepreneursemerging markets can be to help multinational and more local applied in more traditional companies is growing all the time. Ashoka 's program aims 'to develop a framework formarkets. sustainable commercial partnerships where business and social organizations join forces to make critical products and services available to low-income citizens around the world without being limited by the artificial divide between both sectors. Each partner creates economic and social value by leveraging each other's core competencies. Differing from traditional corporate social responsibility relationships, Hybrid Value Chains are commercial in nature with each partner receiving 72 www.ashoka.org/hvc economic benefit according to their role and transaction in the partnership. ' Ashoka's goal for the approach is to 'tip the system' and to 'create a mind-shift among business 72leaders and social entrepreneurs. ' As sketched in Figure 3.4, potential benefits to the company partner include: \u2014 Outsourcing risk: By outsourcing research into sensitive or unfamiliar areas, such as pharmaceuticals for emerging markets, new energy alter - natives, or enhanced foods, companies can minimize potential brand risks, yet ensure that they stay close to emerging trends. They also may be able to bypass strict internal controls around return on investment criteria that would prevent the company investing internally in high risk, entrepreneurial ventures. PATH and GSK Bio and their joint development of a malarial vaccine is just one example of how a corporation can benefit from collaboration on research and development. Figure 3.3 Ashoka's Hybrid Value Chain TM \u2014 Access to information, markets, and networks: Many social entrepreneurs are working with populations and in communities unfamiliar to large corporations. Collaboration offers companies access to information about potential consumers and partners and in many cases, lends additional credibility. In addition, many entrepreneurs have an interest in helping build markets for affordable and accessible mainstream products. They can provide marketing support for the company. The partner - ship between CEMEX , a cement manufacturer, and SISEX , a sexual education organization, to create affordable housing solutions for low-income Mexican women is indicative of the unique approaches being devised between entrepreneurs and corporations. Interestingly, unexpected lessons from emerging markets can be applied in more traditional markets. Pre-pay mobile phone payment structures applied first in developing countries due to the lack of bank accounts proved imminently transferable to the youth market in the industrialized world. A knowledge and understanding of developing country markets has the potential to yield lessons for the development of new business models, based on the interconnected world, such as health tourism or the use of technologies in healthcare compliance or market data for internet sales. \u2014 Inspiration: Collaboration with social entrepreneurs can help companies to tap \u2014 or recharge \u2014 their entrepreneurial and creative spirits, resulting in innovative new product development (e.g. microinsurance, 'green' products). Consumer goods companies, such as Nike and Marks & Spencer , are looking to social entrepreneurs as a source of innovation and competitive advantage in developing new products. Product development Production Distribution / Logistics Sales and marketing Financing Low-income markets Business Citizen sector organization 27 Growing Opportunity The Business Case 'The potential for cross- fertilization between social enterprise and mainstream corporations is huge \u2014 it's utterly revolutionary. ' Sara Olsen, Social Venture Technology Group 73 www.formulazero.nl 74 The results of a study by Sara Olsen and Paul Herman on the environmental and social performance of 21 mainstream corporations are due to be published in Fast Company , April 2007. 75 See, for example, The 21st Century NGO: In the Market for Change , SustainAbility, The UN Global Compact and United Nations Environment Programme, 2003. Figure 3.4 Benefits of the Hybrid Value Chain Employees can also be remotivated when working on inspiring projects. Many people within companies (in particular the technical experts, engineers, doctors, scientists, etc.) want to feel they are contributing to wider social needs, and support for or engagement with social entrepreneurs can be a way of permitting them time to do so. Through partnerships, employees at big companies get 'infected' with a mindset and energy. Some companies are already aware of this \u2014 witness GSK's commitment of staff to a number of developing country initiatives, or Shell lending engineers to work on hydrogen-powered mobility with pioneers 73at Formula Zero . Those who have worked in this field for some time are excited by the pace of developments at the interface between business and social enterprise. 'The sleeping giant is awakening, ' says Sara Olsen of Social Venture Technology Group . 'The potential for cross fertilization between social enterprise and mainstream corporations is huge \u2014 it's utterly 74revolutionary. ' Rules of engagement While our survey revealed willingness on the part of social entrepreneurs to engage corporations, it also highlighted concerns about the potential for mission creep, brand erosion and power imbalances. Feedback from more seasoned entrepreneurs in our sample offered insights into what would make corporate partnerships most likely to work. \u2014 A number echoed the advice of more traditional NGOs,75 noting that partnerships work best when there is a clear set of principles and expectations guiding the partnership (e.g. we only work on projects related to our mission, we respect commercial confidentiality, we understand our business partner's need to pursue ventures that allow them to make a profit). \u2014 They also stressed that the entrepreneur and partner must have comparable levels of interest in the partnership . Where there is an imbalance of power or interest in the partnership, all-too-likely given the relative scales of the partners, the partnership is very unlikely to achieve intended outcomes. \u2014 Longer term partnerships are typically preferred, with social entrepreneurs seeing their organizations \u2014 and the environments in which they operate \u2014 as complex, requiring time for an outsider to learn. Cleantech companies, in particular, want to bring in corporate partners early to ensure later options for potential acquisition, what they describe as a 'locked-in exit strategy. ' \u2014 The role of internal champions in partner companies is cited as essential to building good partnerships. For Gary Hirshberg of Stonyfield Farm , this has been Danone CEO Franck Riboud. Clearly, however, this approach poses real dangers when the individual moves or leaves. Even with engagements that occur at the senior management / corporate level, there are concerns about partners pulling out, indicating a need for entrepreneurs to be adaptable, have a Plan B, and avoid relying too heavily on any one individual or department for support.

' Colin Le Duc, Generation Investment Management 76 www.generationim.com Next, deeper dives Whatever the sector, global challenges mean that it's time to s-t-r-e-t-c-h (see coverage of X Prize Foundation , Panel 3.1). To get a better sense of how all this is playing out, Chapters 4 and 5 take a closer look at two key sectors: healthcare and energy. Our twin aim is to deepen the dives in these sectors in the future \u2014 and to expand the approach to look at more sectors. There are striking contrasts between the two sectors. As Acumen Fund CEO, Jacqueline Novogratz, put it, 'Health tends to be a more distorted market when speaking of the poor. It is highly subsidized and largely government-driven. There are huge opportunities to create social enterprises in this sector given the significant resources available, but it takes harnessing large government contracts, measuring output effectively and navigating often tricky political terrain. Energy, on the other hand, often overlooks the poor entirely and so markets for the poor are often not distorted, but instead are simply out of reach for poor people. Look at solar energy as an example where many effective technologies exist but very few, if any, are truly viable at household level. At the same time, there seems to be a tremendous surge of resources into alternative energy, including for the poor. These resources still seem to be coming more from private sources and so this differentiating characteristic \u2014 where funds come from \u2014 is still the critical differentiator. ' Most social enterprises tackling health-care continue to operate as charities (i.e. foundation-funded non-profits). While highly outcome-oriented, these organizations \u2014 with a few notable exceptions \u2014 struggle to secure more sustainable modes of financing. Energy start-ups, at least in the developed world, tend to have the benefit of robust capital and consumer markets for their products and services. That said, exceptions remain, in large part among entrepreneurs focused on bringing energy to the world's poorest. Here, too, however, promising examples are emerging, such as Orb Energy , a venture-capital-backed enterprise selling inexpensive solar systems to Indian customers, ranging from farmers to technology companies. Interestingly, much of the business was previously part of Shell India's renewables business, but was spun out. As background to our analysis of the worlds of social and environmental entrepreneur - ship, we talked to Colin Le Duc, Head of Research at Generation Investment Management , 76 and itself a form of social enterprise, about the differences between the energy and healthcare sectors. He noted that they 'see a huge amount of innovation in both sectors, from the full range of companies \u2014 large public to small cap to private. And globally, too. ' On healthcare, he stressed that, 'biotech is where all the innovation is. We see a huge amount of interest in DNA and genomics generally. Plus, we see a major trend around the cross-over between health, food, and energy. The trade offs in biofuels \u2014 i.e. land for food or land for energy \u2014 are well documented, but we also see innovation around nutraceuticals and new genetic materials. In addition, we track companies like CIPLA in India, who are innovating around new HIV drug delivery systems. And Novo Nordisk 's work around diabetes continues to be stunning, too. ' This view from the emerging mainstream illustrates the difficulty faced by social entrepreneurs in the field, because their ventures and predicted returns (where they exist) fall far below the radar of even the most progressive of investors. On the energy front, he noted that, 'The cleantech boom of recent years is manifesting in various ways: large corporates are buying an unprecedented number of private cleantech companies. For example, in 2005 alone Danaher bought 78 cleantech companies. I believe the same dynamic that has happened in the Big Pharma sector - where all the innovation is coming from biotech companies and Big Pharma gets ever less return on its R&D spending \u2014 is also now happening in Energy. New faces, new energy ventures, are beginning to dominate the debate \u2014 and leaving the incumbent big energy companies in their wake on the issue of innovation around sustainable energy. ' 29 Growing Opportunity The Business Case 'Revolution Through Competition' X Prize Foundation 77 www.xprize.org Panel 3.1 Time to s-t-r-e-t-c-h A significant proportion of those we spoke to outside the fields of social and environmental entrepreneurship see a key impact of all this effort as being a useful spotlighting of the need for all parts of business to be more innovative and entrepreneurial in meeting social, environmental and governance challenges. But for a real stretch, try the X Prize Foundation , which really encourages innovators and entrepreneurs to think outside the box. 77 They create and manage prizes that encourage innovators to solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today. Their motto: 'Revolution Through Competition. ' Now the Foundation is moving beyond aerospace (its original area of focus) to tackle some of the challenges that social and environmental entrepreneurs are concerned about. We asked Tom Vander Ark, the Foundation's President, what lay behind this shift. First, how did the decision to move beyond aerospace happen? 'Larry Page, Google co - founder, believes in the power of prizes and joined after we awarded the Ansari X Prize for space, ' Vander Ark recalled. 'He then encouraged the board to consider a broader mission. ' And how are the next generation priorities being selected? 'We're attempting to identify the world's biggest problems, particularly those susceptible to innovation through competition, where it's possible to set a difficult but achievable objective, and where it's likely that we can secure a prize purse. ' Evolving at the moment is the Automotive X Prize, which will encourage car designers worldwide to design, build and sell super - efficient cars that \u2014 crucially \u2014 people want to buy. Why? There are at least five reasons, they say. First, 'because 40% of world oil output fuels the automotive industry \u2014 and, in the US, 65% of oil consumption is in the transportation sector. ' Second, because 'automotive emissions contribute significantly to global climate change. ' Third, because 'there are no mainstream consumer choices for clean, super-efficient vehicles that meet market needs for price, size, capability, image, safety, and performance. ' Fourth, because the automotive industry is stalled \u2014 legislation, regulation, labor issues, manufacturing costs, legacy costs, franchise laws, obsolete technology, consumer attitudes, and many other factors have combined to block breakthroughs. Fifth, because 'increases in engine efficiency have been \"spent\" on increased vehicle power, acceleration, and weight, rather than on increased fuel economy. ' And sixth, and fundamentally, 'because we believe there is great opportunity for technological change. ' The obvious next question: is it any harder to pick suitable targets for social and environmental challenges? 'Setting goals and writing rules is hard in all cases \u2014 it's the secret to a great prize, ' Vander Ark answered. 'The difference between innovation and revolution is large scale adoption. We attempt to create goals, rules, competitions, and public campaigns that result in revolutionary change, not just awards for good ideas. ' Any guesses as to where all this is going to take the Foundation? 'By next year, ' he said, 'we will have launched prizes in four areas (space, genomics/medicine, transportation/energy, and education/ poverty reduction), will have full prize teams, and well-developed shared services. By 2009, we will have developed several revenue engines that will make it a sustainable world class prize platform. ' Watch this space. Growing Opportunity 30 Good health is an important goal in itself \u2014 a key human right. Few things are as important as our health and the health of our families. A hundred and fifty years ago life expectancy at birth in the rapidly industrializing and urbanizing countries of Europe was just 40 years. Since then, income growth, better nutrition and housing, medical advances, and \u2014 overwhelmingly \u2014 access to clean water and effective sanitation, have Good health is an important goal in itself \u2014 a key human right \u2014 and, equally important, a pre-requisite to allowing individuals, families, communities, and nations to achieve the economic development that permits access to better nutrition, housing, sanitation, and healthcare. That said the provision and delivery of revolutionized public health so that life expectancy has risen to between 75 and 80 years in the industrialized world. In contrast, for an unacceptably long list of developing countries, including Afghanistan, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Somalia, healthcare services in all their many guises is immensely complex. Critically important are preventive measures such as health education, good nutrition, and access to clean water and sanitation services; research and development into medicines, diagnostics, vaccines, and other healthcare and Zambia, the needle still wavers stubbornly around the 40-year mark. products designed to diagnose, prevent, and treat illness and other conditions; healthcare delivery \u2014 the complex interplay Three diseases, HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria, between community and hospital care, disproportionately impact mortality and patients and medics, supply and demand, morbidity rates, though many developing governments and markets, expectations and countries have seen a rapid rise in the realities. It generates strongly held and incidence of so-called western diseases, hotly defended views about the role of including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, public bodies in setting standards, a strong cancer, and hypertension. Figure 4.1 regulatory environment, safety, and above illustrates the incredible gap that remains all equitable access to healthcare. between critical health needs and the current offering. 4 Deeper Dive: Health Figure 4.1 The treatment gap Total current Total needed HIV/AIDS Antiretroviral treatments 384,000 40,000,000 Tuberculosis Pesticide-treated bednets 7,700,000 500,000,000 Source: Global Health Fund and WHO 31 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Health For good or ill, there is a widespread and deeply held public unease at the role of private enterprise at the heart of healthcare delivery. The kaleidoscopic nature of these tasks and the immediacy and importance of the end goal has attracted hundreds of social entrepreneurs into the health space where they have applied ingenuity, determination, and creativity to the huge challenges of meeting healthcare needs of the some of the poorest people in the world. Figure 4.2 highlights some of the challenges facing the healthcare sector. The result is an enduring belief in medicine as an entitlement, coupled with a resistance to arguments about commercial realities such as profit maximization. However real such considerations are for companies delivering healthcare in poor markets, they are all too readily interpreted by critics as 'profiteering' from sick, poor people in the case of drug companies or, in the case of water utilities, putting profits ahead of a basic human right. Relevance to business Even to frame the relevance to mainstream business of what social entrepreneurs are doing in the health arena in terms of a business case can be fraught with difficulties. For good or ill, there is a widespread and deeply held public unease at the role of private enterprise at the heart of healthcare delivery, and any high profile reminder of commercial drivers can lead to an outpouring of moral outrage about distorted priorities. One key reason: since the Greek philosopher and 'Father of Medicine', Hippocrates, launched his Hippocratic Oath in around 350 BC, medical ethics have sought to put the best interests of the patient above all other considerations. Figure 4.2 Challenges Prevention Low levels of health education Lack of clean water Low vaccination rates R&D High cost of medicine Drug development focused on 'profitable' markets Delivery Poor transportation infrastructure Insufficient numbers of health workers Inadequate government infrastructure Although this attitude may provide a mighty disincentive for companies to engage in these markets, paradoxically \u2014 and here's the rub \u2014 demand for their active engagement as a partner in solving some of the more intractable health-related problems in the developing world continues unabated and is likely to grow. In a globalized economy, emerging markets are increasingly critical to mainstream firms \u2014 as a source of growth opportunities, cost efficiencies and political risks. Forecasts for drug and overall health expenditure increases in China and India between 2007 and 2009, for example, are predicted to rise from $30 to 40 billion and $132 to 163 billion, respectively. 32 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Health In Africa, men, women, How healthcare firms respond to the need to balance market realities with access and children are dying of issues is likely to have an impact on their easily preventable diseases, license to operate in all markets; to have a bearing on the attraction and retentionsimply because they cannot of talented staff; to offer opportunities to develop the critical skill of partnering;be reached. and may even come to be seen as a proxy for competencies relating to the management of that core value driver of many industries: innovation. Health sector milestones and entrepreneurial solutions Below, we highlight just a few of the remarkable examples of how Mindset 3.0 entrepreneurs are breaking log-jams and advancing healthcare provision. While none of the models \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 delivers direct returns to shareholders comparable with operating in mainstream markets, they do provide examples of how out-of-the-box thinking can turn at least some challenges into opportunities. Systems thinking and design: PATH to global health As already noted, healthcare delivery is a highly complex system of prevention, research and development and delivery. When one element of this system breaks down, it can have devastating consequences. Take vaccination for example. In developed countries where vaccinations are in - expensive and accessible, diseases such as polio and measles have been all but eradicated. Not so in poor countries. Roughly one child in four does not receive the vaccines s/he needs despite the fact that it only costs $30 to immunize a child against the greatest childhood threats. The value of vaccination \u2014 preventing disease before it takes root and protecting children at their most vulnerable \u2014 and the advances in technologies has led to the development of large scale immunization programs such as GAVI and IAVI , and has made possible national immunization programs which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates averts around 2 million deaths a year. Yet, despite these advances, issues such as poor transportation infrastructure, inadequate delivery vehicles, and lack of funding still keep vaccines out of reach for most poor children. PATH , a not-for-profit organization specializing in global health, is taking a systems approach to addressing these challenges. Identifying critical gaps in healthcare systems, PATH establishes unique partnerships and leverages tech - nology to develop 'resilient and enduring' solutions. Examples include the adaptation of food industry technologies to develop a means of telling health workers whether the polio vaccine they plan to use has gone bad on its long journey from Europe to Africa. The vaccine vial monitors (HEATmarker), developed with TEMPTIME Corporation and the WHO, are printed directly on vaccine vial labels and darken with exposure to heat over time. This simple technology means no more uncertainty, no more waste. The organization's vaccines work also involves partnership based initiatives dedicated to helping vaccines from the laboratory into clinical development efficiently and quickly, both to combat malaria and the deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae , or 'pneumococcus, ' which causes the deaths of up to one million children under age five each year. Elsewhere systems thinkers are considering a key missing link in relation to healthcare delivery: transportation. In Africa, men, women, and children are dying of easily preventable diseases, simply because they cannot be reached. Riders for Health \u2014 born out of the world of motorcycle racing \u2014 tackles the problem by putting in place reliable, preventative maintenance systems for two and four wheeled vehicles used in healthcare delivery. This innovative work is managed by wholly African teams, and means that healthcare in these areas is very much less likely to be undermined by vehicles failing, no matter how harsh the conditions. Villagereach is another social enterprise attempting to 'go the last mile' in healthcare delivery, according to founder Blaise Judja-Sato. Its business is focused on the logistical challenges and infrastructure gaps facing those who want to take affordable, safe, and effective healthcare delivery into very poor environments \u2014 be they transportation, issues of cold storage, quality control, or staffing. 33 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Health 'Sadly, the health field still seems dreadfully stuck. Structurally, it has incentives for innovation in a few limited areas (certain pharmaceuticals and medical appliances) but virtually nowhere else in the system. In fact, the human delivery dimension of health care is an appalling mess. The current high-tech-led focus on the technical elements of health delivery for a few diseases in a few places continues this unhelpful imbalance. ' Bill Drayton, Ashoka Like many of the social entrepreneurs featured here, Villagereach dedicates considerable time and effort to developing strategic partnerships and mobilizing communities to take greater ownership of health systems to promote a social atmosphere of higher expectations and greater accountability. Critical to its work is a desire to promote local economic development as a means of developing sustainable healthcare delivery and the support of weak government health systems. Empowering consumers: teaming up Despite its ethical tradition, the health care sector struggles with the concept of consumer (patient) focus. As one US-based social entrepreneur put it 'health care companies don't develop products and services with consumer needs in mind and often financial incentives run counter to the notion that patient health is paramount. ' Health education is one way that social entrepreneurs are helping to empower consumers to demand decent healthcare. From Afghanistan to America, entrepreneurs are emerging in this space with myriad creative and cost-effective solutions. EduSport , which runs programs like 'Go Sisters' and 'Kicking AIDS out!, ' is a community-driven NGO based in Lusaka, Zambia. It uses sport to tackle issues like HIV/AIDS, poverty alleviation and child rights in underprivileged communities in Zambia. Sport is becoming a powerful tool for change as entrepreneurial thinkers have realized activities like soccer are also vehicles for communication and youth empowerment. More interestingly, this unique approach is recruiting highly influential players onto the field. In particular, Nike is teaming up with GlobalGiving.com \u2014 an internet donation site \u2014 to raise awareness and money for, social entrepreneurs who take a sport for social change approach. Business models: an Indian Robin Hood Creating a market-based solution to bring essential services such as water and healthcare to poor citizens is a sensitive proposition. How does a company balance the rights to basic services with the need to make money to sustain the enterprise? And, how do they ensure that they provide sufficient quality given customers' inability to pay premium prices. The most successful entrepreneurs in the field are those who have developed a hybrid model appropriate to the market in which they are operating. Mainstream firms have found it impossible to meet these needs and meet required margins. Those same firms, however, in partnership with social entrepreneurs and with some financial support from government, have developed means to bring services to people, at profit margins, appropriate to the market environment. Critically, this means that the service expands to meet the needs of more people, at prices they can afford. The initiatives highlighted here are illustrative of how entrepreneurial thinkers are taking on this challenge: \u2014 Challenges around secondary care India is a market that offers impressive opportunities, alongside considerable challenges. With annual growth rates of 8%, the growing middle class is now made up of 150 million Indians. A further 300 million people live on less than a dollar a day and 50% of all Indian children are malnourished. The majority of healthcare services are provided by the private sector. Government coverage \u2014 despite the abject poverty of so many people \u2014 only accounted for 25% of total health spend in 2003. Out-of- pocket health expenditure \u2014 as opposed to social security or private insurance \u2014 accounted for 97% of total expenditure in the same year. The net result is that secondary care \u2014 treatment in hospitals \u2014 is way beyond the reach of millions of Indians. In response to this exceptionally grim picture, Dr. G. Venkataswamy (Dr. V) created Aravind . What started in 1976 as an 11-bed eye clinic in an old temple-city has grown into the largest and most productive eye care facility in the world. Unlike many social enterprises, it is completely self-sustaining and now treats over 1.7 million patients each year, two-thirds of them, for free. From its beginning it developed a 'Robin Hood' business model of 'borrowing' from richer eye patients to fund operations of the poor. The business model is stated up front and built into discussions about fees. It has proved entirely socially acceptable to those who pay. 34 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Health A company's license to Likewise, Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals are using a similar model operate may come to to provide cardiac surgery and other depend on managing such health care services to patients in India.

Despite this, 1.1 billion people still lack adequate access to clean water, 2.6 billion have no basic sanitation and government action to meet these needs falls far short of what is needed to get even close to the 2015 target. The privatization of many public utilities in the 1990s, followed by the enthusiastic expansion of western-based water utilities into developing countries, did not deliver promised results either to the companies themselves or to water consumers. The complexities of increasing poor people's access to water in highly fragmented markets (where they face a bewildering array of service providers including public utilities, private stand-pipe operators, water trucks, vendors in kiosks and agents) proved insurmountable to some. Profit margin predictions, based on increased use following expansion of the service to more consumers, proved wrong as the price meant people consumed less water. Faced with political opposition to privatization \u2014 irrespective of the poor standard of much public service provision \u2014 and the difficulties of establishing a license to operate, many companies concluded that the provision of water to poor people under the existing business model was not going to work. Some firms have withdrawn altogether. Others, have absorbed the somewhat bruising lessons from the experience and, drawing on the complementary skills of a range of partners to deliver water and sanitation services, have tried to shift to a model that focuses on delivering returns at the same time as fulfilling a social contract and sustainability. In an innovative attempt to address these lessons, WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor) brings together companies (RWE, Thames Water, Halcrow Group, & Unilever) with NGOs (CARE, WaterAid, WWF) and government to develop commercial projects that: deliver a return (at around 7% to 10% designed to guarantee sustainability, not maximize profits) to commercial participants; promote community health; have a positive environmental impact; and are sustainable over the long-term. 360-degree accountability: open kimono For any company with global aspirations \u2014 wherever it may be domiciled \u2014 the challenges of doing business in markets of great wealth disparity and weak state regulation are considerable. In many sectors, countries at the upper end of the development scale offer important prospects for future growth. At the same time, the needs of poor people for products and services \u2014 especially those with a strong social component, such as water or health, and where state provision is inadequate \u2014 will likely translate into direct demands of companies. A company's license to operate may come to depend on managing such expectations by supplementing its business model with creative, non-market or partial market-driven responses. Even in developed markets, the sky - rocketing costs of healthcare are challenging companies' traditional blockbuster approach to profits. One World Health (OWH) and its 'open kimono' approach to drug development is one to watch in this space. Pharmaceutical chemist, Victoria Hale \u2014 now an icon of the social entrepreneur movement \u2014 used her skills and expertise to create the world's first not-for-profit pharmaceutical company. OWH is dedicated to the development of safe, effective, and affordable medicines for people with infectious diseases in the developing world. 35 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Health As companies consider these markets, they have OWH takes dormant intellectual property, owned by academia or companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and develops it into medicines much to learn from social to treat infectious disease in developingentrepreneurs who have countries.

The company's simultaneously. transparent and collaborative approach to drug development provides an intriguing model for traditional pharmaceutical companies and their stakeholders to 78 www.ssireview.org/site/printer/ consider. Interestingly, following interest victoria_hale from investors, the company is considering the potential of a for-profit approach.78 Emerging economies: smart solutions Until now, the priorities for the global health community have been infectious diseases, and in particular, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. Public-private partnerships, and much of the work of social entre - preneurs, have focused on these infectious diseases. However, disease profiles in developing countries are changing as a result of urbanization, a more sedentary lifestyle, less physically demanding work, changing diets and an increase in smoking. Even among poorer communities, so-called 'diseases of the affluent' \u2014 diabetes, cardio - vascular disease, cancer, and hypertension \u2014 are increasing at alarming rates. Many pharmaceutical and healthcare companies see the emerging markets as important sources of future growth. For example, in 2006 cardiovascular drugs already sold more than any other therapeutic category in the Asia-Pacific market. But the complex interplay of medical need and capacity to pay pose significant challenges. As companies consider these markets, they have much to learn from social entrepreneurs who have developed successful cross-subsidized business models that serve those who can and cannot pay simultaneously. In addition, they can gain significant insight into cultural and socio-economic factors that contribute to successful operations in these markets. Consider the work of Vera Cordeiro in Brazil, who understands that the success of patient care is undermined by the severe poverty in her country. Children often leave the hospital and return to inadequate housing, poor nutrition, and other conditions that prevent them from healing. Her organization, Association Sa\u00fade Crian\u00e7a Renascer , is addressing this problem by providing post-hospitalization assistance to the families of poor children recently discharged from the hospital. The work of its network of volunteers means that at Hospital da Lagoa \u2014 a large public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where the flagship Renascer is based \u2014 paediatric re-admissions have dropped by 60%. The Renascer model has proved easily transferable and ideal for locations in which disease is exacerbated by socio-economic factors. It has spread to an additional 17 hospitals in Brazil and served more than 26,000 people to date. Or take Laura Peterson, Executive Director of Hands to Hearts International (HHI), a nascent operation in India that promotes early childhood development. HHI combines economic development/empowerment for disadvantaged women with desperately needed health services for orphaned children. Their simple model is yielding impressive results. Further, HHI is learning important lessons about how to work effectively in India. HHI goes beyond simply improving the conditions for the children in orphanages \u2014 HHI takes aim at the root causes, forwarding women's access to education and economic empowerment. 'The world has come to recognize that the health of our world's children is inextricably tied to the empowerment of our world's women, ' says Peterson. 'Smart solutions need to address societal factors to reach core causes. By looking at issues in a holistic context, entire communities reap long-term benefits and unpredictable and profound health outcomes follow. ' Growing Opportunity 36 79 www.un.org/millenniumgoals Surprisingly, and unlike health, energy is not mentioned explicitly in the top level of the UN Millennium Development Goals.79 Yet its availability, its pricing and the environmental sustainability of its production, supply and use are absolutely intrinsic to meeting all the other Goals. Meanwhile, even if activists see access to clean, affordable energy as increasingly akin to a basic human right, the prospects for providing a predicted global population of 9-10 billion people by mid-century with adequate, sustainable energy to meet their needs \u2014 let alone their wants and desires \u2014 seems remote. Taken together, these three factors could well aggravate the energy picture, driving many forms of fuel out of the reach of the world's disadvantaged communities and populations. As with the previous Deeper Dive into health, the purpose here is to investigate the potential contribution of social and environmental entrepreneurs in relation to a critical area of need, from several different angles. The first thing to say about the potential of such entrepreneurship is that this is still very much a micro-David and macro-Goliath situation, with any one of the major energy groups \u2014 among them That said, there are some grounds for hope the world's great petrochemical companies in the recent coincidence and convergence \u2014 doing more in a single day to meet of three megatrends: oil price rises, growing human energy needs than all social and concerns about energy security in the environmental entrepreneurs do in a year, context of a political uncertainties around although the vast majority of these energy several major oil production regions, and flows are based on carbon-intensive gas the profound longer-term threat of climate and oil that is consumed in rich markets. destabilization. But the key point is that much of the potential of social entrepreneurship flows from a new mindset that these people model. 5 Deeper Dive: Energy Figure 5.1 Sources for figures 5.1-5.5 World marketed energy: History: Energy Information Administration consumption 1980-2030 (EIA) International Energy Annual 2003 Quadrillion BTUs May-July 2005.

Educating potential customers regarding the need for, and advantages of, sustainable solutions. Essentially, making the business case for our services. ' Environment Sector 80 The Global Reporters 2006 was an early stepping stone in SustainAbility's evolving Skoll Program. As suggested in Figure 3.1, the way mainstream business frames sustainability issues is moving from an early focus on compliance (involving a largely defensive business positioning), through a period of corporate citizenship (with a growing degree of engagement and beyond- compliance, voluntary effort) to a now-emerging phase, involving a fundamental shift to competitive strategies built around innovative technologies, entrepreneurial solutions and potentially disruptive business models. Interestingly, energy is under-represented in current memberships of leading social entrepreneurship networks. By our analysis, only eight Ashoka Fellows (out of over 1,800) are operating in this sector, with two Schwab Foundation network members and no Skoll Foundation entrepreneurs, to date. By contrast, the Cleantech Venture Network has a major focus on clean energy and 1,300 affiliate investor members. One venture capital fund told us it now has over 2,000 cleantech firms on its database. The business case So what is the mainstream business case for looking at social entrepreneurship in the energy sector? Clearly it has varied as the agenda for the energy sector has moved beyond the basic compliance stage through various forms of citizenship to a new generation of sustainability-focused competitive strategies. But the critical mass of the energy sector is still mired in unsustainability. Even the best energy sector companies are largely operating versions 1.0 and 2.0 (see Figure 3.1) of the business case. In SustainAbility's 2006 Global Reporters survey of inter - national best practice in sustainability report, a number of energy companies made it into our Top 50, including BP, Enel, Shell , Statoil , and Suez. 80 The sort of issues such companies are currently focusing on include: environmental and social footprints (BP); provision of micro-loans to help businesses develop cleaner indoor cooking stoves (Shell) and microfinance (BP); access to new forms of energy (Statoil); and the pursuit of sustainable development through better integration of different service offerings, including energy, waste management, and water (Suez).

Figure 5.1 underscores the predicted significant continued growth in energy demand worldwide,81 with non- OECD demand overtaking OECD demand within the next decade (Figure 5.2), even given the uncoupling of energy demand from GNP growth (Figure 5.4). The current consensus is that markets for products designed with energy efficiency, renewable energy and/or clean energy in mind are set to explode, but the projections in Figure 5.3 suggest that renewables will still meet a relatively small proportion of world marketed energy demand in 2030. In the meantime, while renewable businesses and other cleantech ventures scale up, there will be a continuing, growing demand for affordable, clean fossil fuels. \u2014 Security With continuing uncertainty around the future of a number of key oil producing regions, energy security considerations are very much in the ascendant. Among other things, this has been a critical factor driving the growing interest in biofuels and other forms of cleantech. The access-to-energy agenda is closely linked. At the extreme, picture an oil company operating in West Africa, the complex's lights blazing in the night while all around there is a world in which reliable, affordable electricity remains a distant dream. This could be a metaphor for the developed world sailing on in an 'ocean' of energy-poverty, a reality that raises many longer term security issues.

The country is expected to overtake the US in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, yet the surge of investment in heavy industry is under - mining China's ability to achieve its energy efficiency targets. 83 Even without growing concerns about the implications of energy consumption trends for the stability of our climate, the likely increase in many forms of pollution linked to energy in the emerging economies can only increase the squeeze on energy producers worldwide. Once seen as a softer set of drivers, environmental factors are now seen to be of crucial importance. Figure 5.6 Challenges The cleantech surge Given the sheer scale of the challenges we face in the energy realm, it is important to maintain a sense of relative scale when thinking about the potential contributions of social and environmental entrepreneurs. The sort of social and environmental entrepreneurs who are pioneering new 84approaches include Fabio Rosa of IDEAAS , 85Brazil, Nic Frances of Easy Green , Australia, and Maqsood Sinha and Iftekhar 86Enayetullah of Waste Concern , Bangladesh. But however successful such people may be in scaling up what they do, and however much they may now deserve to be properly funded, we should note that they have a very long way to go in order to make a significant impression on tomorrow's energy challenges. Still, as IDEAAS and Waste Concern demonstrate, the best among them are having major impacts at the national or regional level, and there are ambitions to go international in some cases, as with Easy Being Green.

Indeed, this is where definitions begin to blur. If social entrepreneurship covers environmental entrepreneurs, for example, does that mean it also covers cleantech enterprises? And given that most cleantech entrepreneurs are for-profit, very much in it for the money, does this rule them out in terms of social entre - preneurship status? In the end, it probably doesn't matter much \u2014 though we see them all as part of a broad entrepreneurial landscape (see Figure 1.1). The really important question is where the truly breakthrough technologies and business models are now evolving. For the moment that would largely appear to be in what, since 2002, has been dubbed the 'cleantech' space. It is clear that, as energy analysts CERA put it, 'The race is on to invest in renewables and clean energy technologies, yet the outcome is far from clear. Considerable uncertainties exist over the policy context, the technologies themselves, and the broader energy competitive landscape. Who will be the winners and losers, and what will the implications be for company strategies and the competitive landscape?' CERA is running a multiclient study focusing on the role of clean technologies in the future. The process will involve building scenarios out to 2030, the date already mentioned in relation to International Energy Outlook . Meanwhile, however, many mainstream energy groups remain relatively cool on renewables. Some, like Exxon , pretty much ignore the field altogether. Others are investing significant sums \u2014 such as BP's half-billion-dollar investment in a new biofuel research center that will link the University of California at Berkeley with the University of Illinois and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 88 BP says that, in addition to the new Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley, it plans to spend $8 billion over 10 years on its own alternative energy efforts, which include building solar cells and wind farms. The company also has a major biofuels partnership with DuPont . But for the big oil companies that have been reaping record profits from high oil prices, such research typically remains a small component of their overall R&D portfolios. Donald Paul, who oversees alternative energy programs at Chevron , explains that the infrastructure needed to mass produce and distribute any type of fuel takes years to develop, and millions, if not billions, of dollars to build. And, longer term, it is inevitable that such biofuel investment will generate second-order social and environmental impacts. 90 When we asked Samer Salty of London- based venture capitalists zouk ventures , whether he expected the clean energy sector to follow the trajectory of the New Economy, he agreed that there were similarities \u2014 but stressed that, whereas Internet companies typically took relatively little capital to establish and could be sold for high multiples at the peak of the boom, energy technologies and infrastructures typically require massive investments. That doesn't remove the risk of a bubble developing, he argued, but it does lessen the likelihood somewhat. 89 41 Growing Opportunity Deeper Dive: Energy Not only are billions of people denied reasonable energy services, but the planet is running a fever simply by meeting the needs of those who are currently served. 91 www.innovalight.com/index.html 92 www.rmi.org 93 www.mbdc.com 94 www.mcdonoughpartners.com 95 www.hypercar.com Mindset 3.0 In carrying out this Deeper Dive, we spoke to a range of companies and organizations, from big petrochemical companies through 91to early stage start-ups like Innovalight . which is using nanotechnology and silicon inks to create ultra-low-cost solar photovoltaic modules.

Just one more example of the cleantech surge now building. But in what follows, we will draw on the experience of the full spectrum of non-profit to for-profit organizations, from foundation-funded social enterprises to market-driven cleantech ventures. Standing back, what these entrepreneurs have to teach the wider world has less to do with how to develop a given technology or how to put together a particular product, than with how they think, act and lead.

Bill McDonough inefficiency is the enemy One striking thing about leading social and environmental entrepreneurs is that they are dedicated to changing the system, not just to making marginal improvements. Whether or not they succeed in such but there is no question that the global energy system is dysfunctional: not only are billions of people denied reasonable energy services, but the planet is running a fever simply by meeting the needs of those who are currently served.

Among them are organ - izations like Waste Concern 97 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In rural regions, meanwhile, energy needs are being developed by pioneers operating in India's Gandhian tradition like Bunker Roy of Barefoot College , 98 who train barefoot solar engineers, and his countryman Ashok Khosla with his Development Alternatives . 99 Similarly, in Kenya, Martin Fisher and Nick Moon of KickStart now \u2014 remarkably, directly or indirectly \u2014 account for 0.6% of the country's GDP, with their appropriate technology solutions.100 3 360\u00b0 accountability: let the sun shine in Given the extent to which bribery and corruption distort energy production and supply systems, against the backdrop of the so-called 'Curse of Oil' that so often turns a natural resource treasure into a socio-economic tragedy, the role of transparency and accountability cannot be exaggerated. That's what makes the related work of organizations like Transparency International ,101 Publish What You Pay ,102 the Global Reporting 105 Initiative ,103 Ceres ,104 AccountAbility , and, yes, SustainAbility106 so important. A parallel initiative in the climate change field is the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), 107 which provides a secretariat for the world's largest institutional investor collaboration on the business implications of climate change. CDP represents an efficient process whereby many institutional investors collectively sign a single global request for disclosure of information on Greenhouse Gas Emissions. More than 1,000 large corporations report on their emissions through this website. The CDP 5 information request was signed by more than 280 institutional investors with assets of more than $41 trillion and sent out on February 1, 2007 to 2,400 companies. The responses will be made available in September 2007. 4 Consumer engagement: lower the entry ramps While it is easy to over-estimate the readiness of consumers to take big steps to save the planet or help other people, it can also be precariously easy to underestimate their willingness to take smaller steps \u2014 that collectively can add up to some form of revolution. One man who has taken the step of moving out from the campaigning world to engage consumers head-on is Jeremy Leggett, once a Greenpeace campaigner, and more recently CEO of Solar Century . 108 He is also a director of the world's first private equity renewable energy fund, Bank Sarasin's New Energies 109 Invest AG .

Two organizations 115 www.ceres.org have been working in this area: Richard Sandor's Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)111 is the world's first, and North America's only voluntary, legally binding rules-based greenhouse gas emission reduction and trading system; and James Cameron's Climate Change Capital (CCC) 112 is a leading investment banking group that specializes in the commercial opportunities created by a low carbon economy. CCC advises and invests in companies that recognize combating global warming is both a necessity and an economic opportunity. Its activities include invest - ment management and financing emission reductions, and its aim is to make the world's environment cleaner while delivering attractive financial returns. Longer term, it will be interesting to see what happens to such players when the Chinese get serious about greenhouse emission trading. Then there are the 'Robin Hood' models. Whether or not such a figure ever stole from the rich to give to the poor, different people certainly place a different value \u2014 and are prepared to pay very different prices \u2014 for anything from their health to clean fuels. In the energy sector, the most outstanding example of this is probably Freeplay Energy ,113 which started out offering wind-up radios and expanded to a wide range of other human-powered products. Whether from the basic needs angle or because of systemic challenges like climate change, energy is central to the sustainable development agenda. The UK Stern Review, which described climate change as effectively the biggest market failure of all time, calculated that the dangers of unabated climate change would be equivalent to at least 5% of GDP each year. 114 Overall, it estimated that the dangers could be equivalent to 20% of GDP or more. In contrast, it argued that the costs of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change could be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year. People would pay a little more for carbon-intensive goods, but our economies would continue to grow strongly. According to one measure, the benefits over time of actions to shift the world onto a low-carbon path could be in the order of $2.5 trillion each year. Markets for low-carbon technologies will be worth at least $500 billion, and perhaps much more, by 2050 if the world acts on the scale required. The potential impact of social and environmental entrepreneurs in this area was dramatically illustrated by the success of Ceres , 115 led by its President Mindy Lubber, in helping stall plans by TXU to build 11 coal-fired power stations in the USA. Even though 150 coal-fired power plants are currently proposed in the country, TXU's $10 billion coal expansion plan drew intense criticism in terms of the likely climate impacts. When the plans were announced, Ceres convened some of TXU's largest shareholders, including CalPERS , CalSTRS , and the New York City Comptroller's Office , to bring pressure to bear. Some time later, it was announced that two private equity firms \u2014 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and the Texas Pacific \u2014 would buy TXU for $45 billion, and would drop eight of the proposed power stations. Strikingly, the private equity firms consulted Ceres and other critics ahead of the deal being signed. We expect a lot more of this sort of power politics. 44 6 Growing Opportunity 116 www.calvertfoundation.org/ We are entering a new era in which 117 www.goodcap.net today's apparently insoluble problems spawn tomorrow's transformative solutions. The new breed of social and environmental entrepreneur is part of a new global order that is dedicated to new levels of equity, quality of life and sustainability. Far from accidentally, there is a buzz around innovation \u2014 for example, it was chosen as the theme of the 2007 Skoll World Forum in Oxford. Indeed, the growing appeal of social entrepreneurship was illustrated by the turn-out in 2006: nearly 700 delegates from more than 40 countries. And the 2007 event 'sold out' well in advance. But, in the midst of all of this excitement, we should ask: Is there a danger that the social entrepreneurship industry will end up intoxicated by virtue, to use a colorful Americanism, of 'breathing its own exhaust'? Overall, our conclusion is that the optimism about these entrepreneurs is well placed, but that that they are experiencing a range of growing pains \u2014 and there is an urgent need to steer more capital and business resources into this area. If this can be achieved, we very much agree with Tim Freundlich (Director, Strategic Initiatives, Calvert Social Investment Foundation 116 and Founding Principal, Good Capital 117) that the outlook is bright. 'I see the social enterprise landscape rapidly prototyping strategies that corporations will incorporate, replicate \u2014 or just plain steal. These entrepreneurs act as fearless and fast actualizers, taking the uncertainty and lack of imagination out of the equation for mainstream business. Global warming and poverty especially are conspiring in an accelerating way to sensitize society towards considering and experimenting with the integration of new models of doing business, focusing on a different and more nuanced sense of value \u2014 call it double bottom line, triple bottom line or blended value. ' So here are our conclusions and a summary of some of the next steps we propose.Conclusions & Next Steps Conclusions Social entrepreneurship is on a roll \u2014 Social entrepreneurs are part of a much wider spectrum, or continuum, of entre - preneurial effort dedicated, directly or indirectly, to addressing key sustainability challenges. \u2014 Social entrepreneurship is emerging as a potential catalyst and powerful lever of the sort of change that governments and business are increasingly committed to \u2014 but rarely know how to deliver. \u2014 While there may be elements of a boom in interest in social entrepreneurship, the risk of an entrepreneurial bubble bursting appears low \u2014 and the opportunity space can only grow. The potential for breakthrough solutions is considerable \u2014 and growing \u2014 The timing is more or less perfect, given that systemic change is increasingly needed. 'Sure, entrepreneurs need to be mavericks working outside the box, ' said SustainAbility Faculty member Sir Geoffrey Chandler, 'but they have an important voice which \u2014 if it can be properly channeled \u2014 could help break open the box. ' \u2014 The fundamental challenge, said 'blended value' champion Jed Emerson who works closely with Generation Investment Management , is not so much to scale the enterprise as to 'scale the solution. ' \u2014 Among the routes to scale discussed by our respondents, the following surfaced repeatedly: (1) grow individual social enterprises; (2) establish multiple enter - prises; (3) get big organizations \u2014 whether companies, public agencies or NGOs \u2014 to adopt the relevant models and approaches; and (4) spur public policy legislation designed to fix market failures. 45 Growing Opportunity Conclusions & Next Steps Nothing changes without individuals, but nothing remains without institutions. The field is growing, but is still relatively small \u2014 As in any area of entrepreneurial activity, the risks of actual or perceived over - promising are real. The wider community needs to find ways to monitor, measure, evaluate, and report on progress in ways that build understanding and support. \u2014 Our analysis of the funding flows into social entrepreneurship suggest that, while the overall levels have increased significantly in recent years, the current funding total is a small fraction of that currently devoted to cleantech investments \u2014 let alone wider philanthropy. \u2014 To put rough numbers on these three areas, to give a sense of orders of magnitude, we estimate that less than $200 million is going into social enterprise worldwide from dedicated foundations each year, compared with over $2 billion a year into cleantech in the USA and EU and well over $200 billion into philanthropy in the USA alone. Money is the main headache \u2014 Accessing capital is the No.1 challenge for the entrepreneurs we surveyed, with almost three-quarters (72%) putting this at the top of their priority list. While this is also true of mainstream entrepreneurs, the pressures on social and environmental entrepreneurs to grow are resulting in significant growing pains. \u2014 'There is a lot of seed capital available, angel-equivalent, for social entre - preneurs, ' said Linda Rottenberg of Endeavor Global . 'But there is not a lot of later-stage funding available \u2014 series B and C equivalent \u2014 to take social entrepreneurs to scale. There's a huge gap in the social capital market that's preventing many of the best models from replicating and fulfilling their potential. ' \u2014 Foundations are still the favorite source of funding for social entrepreneurs (mentioned by 74% of respondents), but there is a wide recognition of the need to diversify funding sources. \u2014 At least among our sample, there was a striking trend in their projections about where their funding would come from in the future. The proportion expecting to be relying wholly on grants in five years was down to 8%, compared with 27% today. Panel 6.1 Paradigm shifts don't come easy Various entrepreneurs talked in terms of the need for a paradigm shift in their field. But such shifts rarely come easy. So what needs to be done? Some answers began to surface during the 2007 Schwab Foundation Summit in Zurich, where the focus was on the business case for social entrepreneurship \u2014 and for strategic business involvement with social entrepreneurs. One business leader told the social entrepreneurs present that within a decade 'everyone is going to fall over themselves in a race to get your business. ' But at least three things need to change if we are to see a paradigm shift. The first, according to Pamela Hartigan of The Schwab Foundation , is that 'the infrastructure to support these ventures has to be put in place much more quickly than is occurring if they are to scale \u2014 and live up to their potential to achieve systemic economic and social change. The creation of social ventures is ramping up at breakneck speed as more and more talented, innovative, passionate, and caring individuals come together to address widening and ubiquitous inequities, but the financial, legal, and political support is still crawling along by comparison, stuck in antiquated institutional frameworks. ' The second is that we need to expand the spotlight to illuminate not just heroic individuals but also the organizations behind them. 'Too much rides on the founder of the venture, ' Hartigan argues. 'Much more has to be done to support the founder and the leadership team's transition through their growth phases. In the words of John Monet, \"Nothing changes without individuals, but nothing remains without institutions.\" ' We need to focus on their No. 2, 3 and 4 colleagues. Third, a need constantly flagged up by our respondents, there need to be better ways of linking the worlds of social enterprise and mainstream business. 'The degree of interface will depend on a host of factors, ' says Hartigan, 'namely: the power of the business case argument for working together; the extent to which people on both sides are committed to making the relationship work and the nature of the social enterprise itself \u2014 so, for example, leveraged non-profits might work best with the philanthropic arm of a corporation, whereas hybrids could be more in sync with the core business of the corporation. ' 46 Growing Opportunity Conclusions & Next Steps 'We need to be brokering \u2014 On the other side of the coin, the proportion of those expecting to berelationships now in the funding their own operations, with little social enterprise/business or no dependence on grants jumped from 8% to 28%. Many still expect to rely oninterface. Currently much a mix of funding types, but a significant proportion (up from 38% today to 50%of this is done around cause marketing, but we need more guides who can identify possible partners in five years) expect a substantial rebalancing in the coming years. Other growing pains and take entrepreneurs \u2014 Linked to the funding challenges, many through the courtship entrepreneurs noted the problems they face in offering competitive salaries to needed to create real staff \u2014 with professional staff, in turn,partnerships of broad value. ' often a key to attracting sufficient funding. Anonymous respondent \u2014 As these social enterprises grow, they increasingly face a tension between the need for professionalism and efficiency on the one hand and, on the other, the need to maintain a focus on the mission, values and culture of the organization. \u2014 Succession planning is another area of difficulty. The entrepreneurs them - selves are very aware that for their organizations to succeed, they them - selves need to change. This is true even of the most successful entrepreneurs. Bill Strickland of the Bidwell Training 118 www.acciona.es Center Inc. (BTC), a Pittsburgh-based 119 www.vestas.com organization for urban change, once said that the biggest barrier to his organization growing was him. \u2014 Novelty is an enormous strength, but like so many traits could also become a weakness. Many others have been tackling the challenges social entre - preneurs are dealing with, at other times, in other places, in different ways. There is a danger that in their enthusiasm to embrace \u2014 and be rewarded for developing \u2014 radical new solutions that a number of new wheels are unnecessarily invented. Partnering with business \u2014 Social and cleantech entrepreneurs turn out to be equally interested in developing partnerships with business, but with different expectations. Social entrepreneurs, in particular, are acutely aware that they often lack the experience and skills needed. \u2014 A constant refrain in the interviews was the growing need for brokering between the entrepreneurs and those they need to persuade or recruit. \u2014 'We need to be brokering relationships now in the social enterprise/business interface, ' said one interviewee. 'Currently much of this is done around cause marketing, but we need more guides who can identify possible partners and take entrepreneurs through the courtship needed to create real partnerships of broad value. So many industries have matchmakers \u2014 where are they in this sector, beyond what has been called the in-club of white male social entrepreneurs?' \u2014 There is a risk in all of this that we become overly focused on narrow definitions of social entrepreneurship. For example, it's easy to get excited about small start-ups in the renewable energy field, but we should remember the huge contributions already being made by much larger companies like Acciona 118 in Spain, Vestas 119 based in Denmark, or GE based in the USA. \u2014 Listen to Jos\u00e9 Manuel Entrecanales, Acciona's Chairman and a Spanish businessman with big ambitions in sustainable energy. We asked whether this ambition would require trade-offs? 'No, ' he replied. 'Mainstream businesses must deliver shareholder value. But Acciona has significantly increased its sustainability profile and investment in areas like renewable energy in recent years, while recording substantial growth and exceptional shareholder value. For example, in 2005 our use of renewable energy sources avoided the emission of 4.5 million tonnes of CO 2. I believe that there may be opportunities for a forward-thinking energy player to create small-scale village-based renewable energy provision which truly breaks the mould. ' 'Indeed I see interesting parallels between the provision of energy to these areas and the situation in commercial credit two decades ago which led Nobel Prize winner Professor Yunus to set up the Grameen micro-credit system. The application of a decentralised, bottom-up approach to providing electricity to remote or impoverished areas is one we have been long interested in at Acciona. It is one our team is currently exploring, knowing well that there are situations and locations where the provision of clean and sustainable energy will not be commercially viable. That is why we are currently fundraising for projects which may not prove profitable in the immediate future. We welcome dialogue with NGOs and others who share our vision. ' 47 Growing Opportunity Conclusions & Next Steps 'Over the last 25 years, the citizen sector has become as entrepreneurial structurally as business in most of the world \u2014 and, as a result, it has been closing the productivity gap with business very rapidly. We now have the opportunity to end the accidental divorce of the last three centuries. Doing so represents a gigantic productivity opportunity for business, for the citizen sector, and for the ultimate customer and citizen. ' Bill Drayton, Ashoka the social intrapreneur \u2014 Several interviewees also noted that we need to recall the potential of social intrapreneurship,120 with change agents working inside big organizations to drive similar agendas. One example of a social intrapreneur we interviewed was Gib Bulloch, Programme Lead at Accenture Development Partnerships . 121 He has been part of a team for nearly five years that has been working to switch this major consulting firm on to the potential to help NGOs, social entrepreneurs, and major businesses to understand and manage the world's great social, environmental, and governance challenges. \u2014 Many people still see such efforts as part of corporate citizenship. This, as Bulloch puts it, means that they think 'in terms of grooming donkeys, sponsoring the opera or, at best, painting schools. Rather than, say, helping Oxfam to become a high performance organization. ' In the context of Accenture's 145,000 employees worldwide, ADP's 70-going-on-100 may seem small beer, but the potential to catalyze change \u2014 both inside Accenture and among its clients \u2014 is considerable. \u2014 The key point, however, is that one way of achieving scale with entre - preneurial solutions is to switch large organizations onto the new challenges and exploit their much greater leverage to further evolve and deploy the solutions. A growing need to focus on government responsibilities and roles \u2014 Governments need to do more to shape public policy, public sector targets and wider incentives \u2014 for example, in relation to tax breaks for the funding of social enterprise \u2014 if the sort of ventures covered above are to reach their full potential. This is an area that has been covered by people like Linklaters, 122 but where considerable further thinking \u2014 and action \u2014 is needed.

This briefing represents the principal output from a joint initiative undertaken WWF-UK. Our purpose in carrying out the work has been to better understand the relationship between the corporate responsibility and public affairs agendas within companies, and in particular to explore the views of one important external stakeholder in business \u2014 believes progress towards environmentally sustainable business necessitates a strong responsibility statements and its public affairs agendas. Our findings suggest that the relationship between public affairs and corporate responsibility is indeed of interest to investors \u2014 and that this is likely to that very few companies are thinking strategically about how to align their work in these two areas. While we acknowledge that these issues and the views of important stakeholders this briefing proves useful in helping to invite readers to join us in further work on this important subject.

We also 1 Coming in from the cold Executive summary The aim of this briefing is to explore the relationship between corporate responsibility activities and corporate public affairs, and in particular to consider the current interest and future role investors may play in driving a more coherent and strategic approach between these two corporate functions. We review current practices in reporting on public affairs activities from the corporate sector (section 2), summarise the perspectives of investors on the importance of public affairs activities (section 3) and set out a series of conclusions and 'hot topics' emerging from this debate (section 4). The primary audience for the briefing is corporate executives including specifically board level directors with responsibility for governmental and public affairs and senior officials with responsibility for corporate affairs, sustainability and corporate responsibility. We also expect the briefing to be of interest to governments and politicians, trade associations, public affairs agencies, investors and non - governmental organisations (NGOs). Key conclusions The principal conclusions from the work are as follows: 1 Technology is driving greater visibility of issues and moving them into view for large parts of civil society, creating wider networked groups of involved \u2014 and often very vocal \u2014 stakeholders. 2 Engaging effectively in this more complex and transparent policy environment further emphasises the importance of corporate reputation, openness and transparency of action. 3 Society is exercising greater scrutiny and concern about corporate practices related to sustainable development. It is shifting from focusing on direct impacts to addressing the wider influence businesses have on the public policy environment and the way businesses behave in this environment. 4 To date leading businesses have responded by demonstrating increased transparency around specific policy positions on key issues, but appear still to be responding from a position of risk management . 5 In turn this means that other stakeholders \u2014 namely the mainstream investment community \u2014 are showing more involvement in assessing the public affairs activities of companies as part of a full view of business performance and in some cases are now driving measurement of business activity in this area. 6 Furthermore, market failure and the need for systemic change are also emerging as key areas of concern for some leading investors. This in turn is underlining investor interest in corporate public affairs activity. These investors single out businesses that are protecting future value through active shaping of policy frameworks to address key social and environmental issues, as exhibiting smart management. The implications of these shifts are profound. Critically, the interest of some mainstream investors in corporate public affairs activities requires a re-think of the role and nature of this work. 7 In particular, investor interest is helping to drive a shift in the role of public affairs from a somewhat specialist, behind-the-scenes activity, to a critical business function to be managed, aligned and measured alongside other business-critical activities. 8 A growing, and as yet largely unmet, need for more information on public affairs activities and governance represents a significant opportunity for business to communicate more openly and more strategically about the overall objectives and value of public affairs activities. 2 Coming in from the cold Introduction 1 The power of networks One of the defining features of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been the extraordinary impact that new technologies have had on the way companies, individuals and governments organise themselves. Technologies such as the internet and mobile telephony have helped to restructure the workplace and in the process have had a profound impact on the way businesses are managed and run. Instead of being predominantly hierarchical organisations, businesses have chosen to outsource activities to a network of independent enterprises. Whether this involves software development, research and development facilities, accounting or customer services, most large enterprises now resemble networks more than they do rigid hierarchies. 1 In some cases businesses are even turning to their customers as a source of radical innovations for their products. LEGO has set up a website to enable its customers to create and share new product designs and Michael Dell announced in early 2007 that he sees customer-driven innovation as the linchpin of his strategy for 'Dell 2.0' . Policy development \u2014 from hierarchical to networked Civil society Business Government Multilaterals Individuals 'We need to think differently about the market and engage our customers in almost everything we do, ' he says. More radically, internet sites such as MySpace , SecondLife and YouTube depend almost entirely on consumers to create the content that generate traffic to their sites. This shift to networked business models is also being reflected in other parts of society. In particular, the processes in which public policy is developed are shifting significantly. Online consultations, petitions, blogs and chat-rooms allow a wide variety of participants including NGOs, businesses and even individual citizens to engage directly in shaping public policy. Critically, these technologies also allow groups to connect to parallel processes of interactive dialogue outside the strict confines of any formal legislative process. While governments are still required to mediate the legislative process, the range of tools available to stakeholders to contribute to policy development is powerfully changing the dynamics of whose voices are heard and when. Civil society Government Business Multilaterals Individuals Figure 1 3 Coming in from the cold From impact to influence In a separate but related trend, the emerging corporate responsibility agenda is also shifting to focus as much on the influence companies wield over different stakeholders as it does on their actual direct impacts . In part this has been driven by improvements in the environmental performance of manufacturing businesses, where in many sectors the major impacts now occur during the 'use' phase of products rather than in their manufacture. As a result, stakeholder interest is now often focused on the role that companies are playing in influencing different value- chain partners. Leading businesses such as HP, Nike and Volvo focus significant efforts on influencing the social and environmental performance of their supply-chains. Financial institutions have developed criteria to ensure that their lending policies support emerging norms on social and environmental performance. Companies in the food and beverage sector are reviewing their marketing strategies and product formulations driven by concerns that their influence on young consumers is contributing to a global epidemic in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In short, companies are now being held accountable for the influence that they have over a whole range of stakeholders \u2014 including governments and regulators. Governments and regulators too are under greater pressure to be transparent about their links to business and other lobby groups. 2 The rest of this briefing further explores The case for transparency this agenda by: The importance of networks outlined \u2014 reviewing the extent to which current above combined with the shift in focus approaches to corporate reporting to the influence that companies wield, address public affairs activities has significant implications for the way (section 2); in which companies manage their public affairs activities.

They are operating debate for further study (section 4). through processes that are themselves more integral to society at large and therefore more open to public scrutiny. 3 In addition, companies wishing to stake a claim to leadership on corporate responsibility issues are being asked to demonstrate that their public affairs activities are transparent and consistent with wider sustainability claims and objectives. These trends are driving an alignment between those public affairs activities that are more effective on the one hand, and those that are transparent and accountable on the other. Companies that are well placed to respond to this agenda are likely to find themselves able to influence emerging policy standards more effectively. Companies that are not will find access and influence rapidly eroding. 'Business leaders must become involved in socio-political debate not only because their companies have much to add but also because they have a strategic interest in doing so . . . Few companies get involved in a socio-political debate at the stage when they might be at risk for being ahead of the curve. The prevalent risk is not getting involved early enough. ' McKinsey Quarterly 4 Coming in from the cold Summary of the methodology The following chapters draw on two sets of data compiled for this briefing. The first, summarised in section 2, is a review of best practices in corporate reporting of public affairs activities. The 50 leader reporters reviewed were selected through the Global Reporters 2006 research programme alongside the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the financial ratings agency Standard & Poor's (S&P). The benchmark methodology used to assess reports has also been developed alongside UNEP and S&P and provides a comprehensive framework for reviewing the quality of sustainability reporting. For this briefing we focus specifically on criteria linked to corporate public affairs activities. These include: \u2014 public policy and regulatory affairs , which covers interactions with politics and public policy on sustainable development issues, including advocacy techniques (lobbying, membership in trade associations, political contri - butions, etc.), the content of advocacy (e.g. policy positions) and the level of transparency about these involvements \u2014 industry influence , wnich covers efforts to influence sustainable development performance across an industry sector or across the business community as a whole including through participation in industry task forces, through industry associations, research or publications, and through the promotion of voluntary standards. The quality of information provided by a company's report or website was rated using the scoring methodology outlined in the table below. A full copy of the methodology is available from SustainAbility's website. In addition, section 3 summarises the results from a questionnaire sent to members of the financial community including pension fund managers, asset managers and research and rating organisations. Responses were received from 24 organisations representing over $500 billion under management (responding organisations are listed on page 13). Definition of corporate public affairs activities This report considers a range of corporate activities or decisions which are intended to influence public policy. These include efforts to: \u2014 influence the outcome or direction of proposed or existing legislation; \u2014 influence how regulators apply or enforce existing laws; \u2014 influence the broad direction of public policy, whether at the local, national or international (e.g. through the UN or World Trade Organisation) level; \u2014 support (either directly or indirectly) external organisations including industry associations, chambers of commerce, think-tanks, NGOs etc. in their public policy advocacy; \u2014 develop or improve the company's relationships with government officials, civil servants or the judiciary; \u2014 support political candidates or incumbents through, for example, monetary donations or other forms of support. Scoring criteria Score 0 1 2 3 4 Rating Absent Sketchy Systematic Extensive Integrated The quality of the information and approach adopted by each company was given one of the following ratings. No information provided on lobbying. Or the company makes general references, such as a simple statement of compliance with the law on political contributions, but provides no insight into activities or impacts. Coverage recognises the relevance of lobbying to corporate responsibility issues. As above but information also includes signs that robust systems and processes are being developed to manage and disclose lobbying and public policy activities. The company probably discusses at least one 'material' issue in some depth. Coverage of lobbying indicates that systems exist to manage and disclose lobbying and public policy activities. The company probably discusses policy positions on several material issues in some depth. However, the approach to lobbying is still not fully integrated with company values, business principles and core business As above and in addition there is an explicit link made between corporate values and principles, core business decision- making (including corporate govern - ance) processes and a company's approach to public policy. There is likely, for example, to be evidence of a decision-making process leading from basic values decision-making. and principles to specific business objectives and lobbying that supports these objectives. Figure 2 5 Coming in from the cold The public life of public affairs 2 Public reporting of corporate responsibility performance has become established as a key route to building greater trust among stakeholder groups. Building trust in corporate public affairs activity is increasingly seen as critical to public affairs and wider corporate success as outlined above, so how well do leading companies currently report on their public affairs (PA) activities? This section provides some detailed insight into the extent to which 50 leading reporters from around the world address PA activities in their published corporate responsibility (CR) or sustainability reports and on their websites. Public reporting of public affairs activity is still a minority pursuit The most striking finding from the review of corporate responsibility reporting is that, as a relatively new topic in published reports, PA activities are among the areas of business management and performance that are least reported by companies. Leader company ranking on quality of public affairs reporting The Global Reporters 2006 analysis, carried out in partnership by SustainAbility, Standard & Poor's and UNEP, found that public affairs attracted the second lowest score out of the 29 criteria that are considered, with an average score of 1.7 out of 4. Overall poor performance masks some excellent reporting by a handful of companies However, this low overall score does mask some outstanding reporting from a small group of leader companies including British American Tobacco (BAT), British Telecom (BT), Co-operative Financial Services and the Swiss retailer Migros . The full table of scores is given below. The quality of reporting appears to be slowly improving The overall score from the 2006 analysis, while weak in comparison with other criteria does, however, compare favourably with a similar analysis conducted in 2005 on the S&P 100 companies. 6 Score 0 1 2 3 4 Absent Rating Sketchy Systematic Extensive Integrated Companies ABN AMRO Real Anglo American Adidas Group ABN AMRO British American BBVA Platinum BAA Anglo American Tobacco Daiwa Securities Enel SpA BHP Billiton BP BT Group Henkel DSM GSK Co-operative Fuji Photo Film Kesko Ford HP Financial Services KarstadtQuelle Natura Gap Inc Lafarge Migros Nedbank Group Philips General Electric Nike Nissan Motor Rabobank Mecu Novo Nordisk Seven and I Statoil MTR Rio Tinto Holdings Suez PotashCorp Unilever Sony Watercare VanCity Westpac Banking Shell Group Veolia Telus Environnement Vodafone Figure 3 6 Coming in from the cold This larger group achieved a score of just 0.8 out of 4. The difference in score is not perhaps surprising given that the S&P 100 represents the world's largest companies, while the Leader 50 has been selected specifically as representing best practice in corporate sustainability reporting. Nonetheless there is evidence that the quality of reporting has improved, with the companies that were assessed in both rankings improving their scores by an average of 20%. Leader companies exhibit a particular focus on issues that are deemed to be material for their business In common with other aspects of corporate reporting, leader companies are becoming much more adept at identifying key material issues for their sector and business. This focus is clearly apparent in reporting on PA activities, with companies focusing on specific material issues for their businesses. For example, the British Airports Authority (BAA) explains the company's position on public policy relating to infrastructure development. The mining Coverage of overall 'philosophy' and giant BHP Billiton provides specific detail approach to public affairs not widely on their public affairs activities concerning reported uranium development, and BAT highlights their position on legislation around the As highlighted, a growing number of minimum age for smoking. companies provide detailed summaries of specific policy positions, but few step back to provide the wider story. This approach may reflect the more tactical profile of A significant number of companies report that they are actively supportive of specific regulations In a departure from previous reports, a significant number of companies cite their active support for specific regulations on key social or environmental issues. The European 'REACH' regulation for example is explicitly supported by a wide range of companies such as Adidas , BP, Co-operative Financial Services , DSM, Henkel and Unilever . Climate change, however, emerges as the most popular topic in corporate reports with public policy frameworks on the topic explicitly endorsed by companies including BHP Billiton , and Shell . More infrequently, companies report and explain their opposition to regulatory frameworks with just Ford and Volkswagen willing to provide some detail on the PA work aimed at stopping, or at least significantly altering, policy proposals on vehicle emissions controls. Other notable highlights from the research included: \u2014 the provision of detailed links and summaries of activities undertaken by companies (e.g. BT, HP) working with trade associations on key social and environmental issues and \u2014 very occasionally \u2014 funding levels associated with these memberships (e.g. Migros ); \u2014 marked differences between companies from different regions. For example, none of the five Japanese companies in the Leader 50 provide any information on public policy activities. In contrast, of the ten companies from the UK, the average score is 3. public affairs activities that many companies adopt \u2014 focusing on short-term policy and financial objectives rather than long-term strategic positions. The auto industry in the US has for example been singled out for excessive focus on short-term lobbying objectives that have undermined the sector's longer-term competitive position. 7 Of the leader companies few report on the broader 'philosophy' that they bring to their public affairs activities, and the extent to which this supports their longer-term business strategy positioning. GE is a notable exception, providing some insights into the company's objectives with regard to public affairs activities, and setting itself a goal to become more actively involved in energy and health policy issues. The Brazilian cosmetics company Natura has also set itself a target to fully integrate its public policy work and corporate responsibility strategy. Best practices: BT BT is one of a handful of companies that achieves a score of 'integrated' in the 2006 analysis. Among other things, BT provides detailed information on: \u2014 the trade and business associations of which the company is a part; \u2014 specific policy positions on key issues for the organisation (such as universal service obligations, mis-selling of telecoms services and digital inclusion); \u2014 the wider influence that the company has on the ICT sector including through joint industry initiatives and supply- chain activities. 7 Coming in from the cold Investing in public affairs 3 For some time, the main driver for corporate reporting on public affairs has come from academics, NGOs and wider civil society. 8 Typically, other stakeholders such as investors and customers have been less vocal on this aspect of the CR agenda. This now appears to be changing. As noted above, companies themselves are becoming more vocal in setting out their own positions with regard to key aspects of legislation. The survey carried out for this briefing suggests that investors are also becoming more actively engaged in considering the public affairs activities of companies. In fact, in many cases investors already consider the public affairs activities of companies they invest in; furthermore, a significant proportion expects these activities to become more important in the next few years While current levels of corporate reporting are quite limited, just less than two-thirds (65%) of survey respondents currently consider the public affairs activities of the companies in which they choose to invest. This represents over $320 billion of funds under management. Furthermore, nearly half of these investors consider that corporate public affairs activities will become more important for investors in the next 2-3 years, with only one respondent suggesting that interest in the issue will decrease over this time. Are public affairs criteria considered in company assessments? 65% Yes 13% N/A 22% No No Yes Reputational risks associated with public affairs activities seen as critical by many investors The principal driver for the importance of corporate public affairs activities stems from interest in social and environmental issues more generally \u2014 and the growing potential for reputational risks from public affairs activity that is seen to be at odds with wider societal concerns. Climate change is seen as particularly important in this regard, with several organisations focusing specific research on company positions on public policy related to climate change. Some investors go further, however, and believe that the issue represents a test case for future sustainability issues that cross over to become controversial mainstream issues. For these investors, corporate PA activities and the specific policy positions that companies adopt are already significant considerations. Some investors see the issue as a strong indicator of quality of management For a significant number of investors, reputational risk emerges as the central driver of interest in PA activity. However, for a small but influential band of respondents, links between PA activity and corporate responsibility are seen as more strategic. Initiatives such as the US Climate Action Partnership, 9 the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change 10 and WWF's One Planet Business Programme 11 all aim to reshape the systems that govern the behaviour of the private sector. These investors see such efforts as central to the protection of future value by helping to create enabling conditions and frameworks that address key social and environmental issues (see case study below). Figure 4 8 Coming in from the cold Strategic public affairs and corporate responsibility \u2014 the case of the US Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) The USCAP is one of several corporate initiatives aimed at encouraging governments to develop regulatory frameworks to tackle climate change. While the participating companies undoubtedly recognise the reputational benefits of participation in this joint corporate/NGO initiative, they lay particular emphasis on the strategic value of their involvement in helping to shape policy frameworks that support business performance. Among the principal objectives of the USCAP is to encourage regulators to recognise both the importance of technology, and the need to create economic opportunity and advantage through regulatory frameworks. This approach of proactive engagement with policy frameworks \u2014 combined with the greater coherence between corporate responsibility and public affairs that such positions demand \u2014 is seen as an important indicator of smart management. As one investor put it, 'We look at company lobbying activity in order to see if there is consistency between what management is saying externally and what they are pushing via their lobbying presence. It is an input for how we assess the quality of a management team. ' NGOs and institutional investors are considered the most important drivers for information on corporate public affairs activities . . . Survey respondents identified NGOs and activist groups along with institutional investors as being the most important drivers for information on corporate public affairs activities. NGOs have traditionally played a key role in advocating for greater openness of corporate public affairs activities, but the interest of institutional investors is also seen as a key driver for greater openness, with two-thirds of respondents citing institutional investors as demanding information on corporate public affairs activities. . . . with institutional investors particularly concerned with market failures as a source of substantial risk A number of respondents suggested that they believed investors would continue to play an important role. Institutional investors in particular are seen as having a specific interest in ensuring that individual company lobbying is not at odds with the wider interests of the market, and that it does not unduly slow policy development for short term gain. Separate research focusing specifically on climate change has identified at least three types of risk to investors from this style of lobbying: \u2014 reduced participation and access to policy-making and policy design processes and the loss of opportunities to steer policy in directions that financially benefit shareholders; \u2014 lower anticipated returns to capital investments as science and policy move; \u2014 reputational impacts, and in some cases litigation risk, stemming from public affairs activities that are perceived to have delayed policy actions.12 Several investors highlighted the distinct role that investors have to play in this area. As one respondent put it, 'Investors have a collective long term financial interest in seeing market failures corrected in an effective and efficient way, and therefore they have a role to play in promoting sensible, flexible and appropriate government intervention. ' 'We look at company lobbying activity 'Companies will always lobby for what in order to see if there is consistency is in their interests. What we have to be between what management is saying careful of is where lobbying is not in the externally and what they are pushing interest of the market as a whole. ' via their lobbying presence. It is an Survey respondent input for how we assess the quality of a management team. ' Survey respondent 9 Coming in from the cold Information provision from companies is widely seen as inadequate While our analysis suggests that information provision is slowly improving, investors from our survey who expressed an interest in public affairs activity almost unanimously say that companies do a poor job in meeting their information needs. 83% of our survey group stated that their information needs were not being met, with a further 74% saying that they were in dialogue with companies and had requested better disclosure from them. Disclosure should include both the overall approach to public affairs activities as well as policy positions on material issues Investors emphasised the need to understand a company's approach to public policy overall, and then to put this in the context of specific issues, particularly where these are deemed to be material. Some also expressed scepticism at the ability of companies to collect such information systematically. As one asset manager put it, 'Companies must become much more sophisticated and adept at gathering information on all types of corporate public policy activities across the company and in different regions of the world. ' Others sounded a note of caution. While overall there was great appetite for increased transparency on corporate public affairs activities, some respondents suggested that companies would be unlikely to volunteer this information. Instead research agencies and investors would have to rely on alternative sources coming from NGOs, the media and elsewhere. As one respondent noted, 'The most important information is the information that is least likely to come from companies themselves. ' Relationships with trade associations are seen as requiring additional transparency Several respondents focused in particular on the need to disclose the expenditures that companies make to trade associations, political parties, lobbying groups and even charity contributions in general. For many investors this information needs to include a list of organisations active in public policy advocacy that receive corporate support \u2014 and the extent of funding or other in- kind support. 'Less hiding behind trade associations', as one respondent put it, and 'more visibility for what companies stand for and how they are promoting these positions. ' Investors are also actively engaged in public affairs activity, but few have transparent policies themselves Investors themselves are frequently engaged in public affairs activities of their own \u2014 either through representative groups or through direct engagement with governments. Nearly two-thirds of respondents have engaged with policy makers themselves, on issues such as climate change, corporate transparency, human rights, environmental standards and executive pay. However, only 36% have their own policy that governs these activities and even fewer publicly report on these activities.

' Survey respondent Figure 5 410 Coming in from the cold Conclusions Public policy coming in from the cold This latest effort to review the quality of corporate reporting on public affairs activities suggests that leading companies are making modest progress towards greater transparency. However, we believe focusing on greater transparency solely as a response to a perceived threat from NGOs and other stakeholders risks missing a far more profound shift in the public affairs agenda. We believe this shift is driven by rapid developments in technology, interest in corporate public affairs activities among mainstream investors and a recognition of the strategic role public affairs can play on corporate responsibility issues. We have set out our conclusions below and outline some 'hot topics' for further investigation in the following section. Changes Complexity Scrutiny Business need The principal conclusions from the work are as follows: 1 Technology is driving greater visibility of issues and moving them into view for large parts of civil society, creating wider networked groups of involved \u2014 and often very vocal \u2014 stakeholders. 2 Engaging effectively in a more complex and transparent policy environment further emphasises the importance of corporate reputation and perception, openness and transparency of action. '[Investors] fulfilling their fiduciary duty to their beneficiaries requires that [company management] come to understand that the sharp line . . . between stockholders and 13stakeholders may be breaking down. ' 3 Society is exercising greater scrutiny and concern about corporate practices related to sustainable development and is shifting from focusing on direct impacts to addressing the wider influence businesses have on the public policy environment and the way businesses behave in this environment. 4 To date leading businesses have responded by demonstrating increased transparency around specific policy positions on key issues, but appear still to be responding from a position of risk management. 5 In turn this means that other stake - holders \u2014 namely the mainstream investment community \u2014 are becoming more involved in assessing the public affairs activities of companies as part of a full view of business performance and in some cases are now driving measurement of business activity in this area. 6 Furthermore, market failure and the need for systemic change are also emerging as key areas of concern for some leading investors. This in turn is underlining investor interest in corporate public affairs activity. These investors single out businesses that are protecting future value through active shaping of policy frameworks to address key social and environmental issues, as exhibiting smart management. Implications Coherence Consistency Business performance The implications of these shifts are we believe profound. Critically, the interest of some mainstream investors in corporate public affairs activities requires a re-think of the role and nature of this work: 11 Coming in from the cold 7 In particular, investor interest is helping to drive a shift in the role of public affairs from a somewhat specialist, behind the scenes activity to a critical business function to be managed, aligned and measured alongside other business critical activities. 8 A growing, and as yet largely unmet need for more information on public affairs activities and governance represents a significant opportunity for business to communicate more openly and more strategically about the overall objectives and value of public affairs activities to investors and other stakeholders. Hot topics for further study Drawing on some of the emerging trends from the research, what factors might business need to take into account to respond to some of these public affairs challenges? Below we set out some questions which we hope to pursue in more depth during further dialogue and research. Transparency and public affairs There is an inherent tension between the demands of stakeholders for greater transparency and the reasonable needs of the business to maintain confidentiality. The specific questions this tension engenders include: 1 As a critical business activity, will transparent, open public affairs activity emerge as an area of competitive advantage? 2 If so how will efforts at greater transparency sit with commercial confidentiality? 3 How can companies balance disclosure on public affairs activities on specific issues which are likely to attract criticism from some stakeholders, while also outlining a framework approach and philosophy that builds stakeholder trust and business reputation? 4 As public affairs becomes more central as a business tool and as a measure of management quality for the financial and investment community, will this in turn create a push for more formalised reporting measures? Public affairs and future value As investors come to see greater value from a more strategic perspective on public affairs, how will this shape company approaches? For example, specific questions might include: 5 Can best practice around policy development and reporting lead to new business opportunities and wider product innovation? 6 What sort of criteria are investors specifically, and other stakeholders more generally, applying when they look at public affairs as a measure of business and management performance? 7 Where do individual sectors have future value at stake, and how can individual companies engage with policy frameworks to protect and enhance this value? Coalitions and networks A more networked approach to public policy development is driving a need for greater engagement between businesses and external stakeholders in articulating compelling positions. However: 8 Such policy formulation processes are likely to prove more unwieldy, in turn driving a greater need for coalitions that articulate shared perspectives. What are the characteristics and skills that companies need in order to do this effectively? 9 Can groups like trade associations be held to the same levels of accountability as individual businesses? Can lowest common denominator positions be seen to be consistent with company best practice? Internal coherence Finally, a more strategic approach to public affairs demands a greater level of coherence with other business processes and functions: 10 How should a more strategic PA approach be made more coherent with other corporate responsibility activities? Should public affairs be subject to governance oversight? 11 How can a single framework embrace different geographies, political cultures and differing public policy traditions? Public affairs and corporate responsibility Today Tomorrow Key stakeholders NGOs and CR activist-driven Investor-driven Business case for linking Reputational risks Future value protection PA and CR Governance Tactical \u2014 Strategic \u2014 distributed to businesses subject to board oversight Reporting Focus on detail of key policy positions Focus on overall PA governance and objectives and key policy positions Figure 6 12 Coming in from the cold Next steps 5 This briefing is intended to shed further light on the rapidly evolving relationship between public affairs and corporate responsibility. Our research has demon - strated that while corporate reporting of public affairs activity is still modest, a series of strong drivers is emerging to push public affairs into greater focus for investors and for company management. We believe we are at an early stage in a new chapter that sees public affairs play a much greater role both in positioning companies on the corporate responsibility agenda and in enabling the protection and development of future forms of value. In order to help inform and develop best practice in this area, we plan to convene a series of workshops for companies. Our objectives will be to: \u2014 provide a forum for the exploration of the risks and opportunities offered by a changing public policy environment; \u2014 share best practices and insights from different sectors and regions; \u2014 generate practical advice to companies and other stakeholders on how to address some of the questions highlighted in the previous section.

A total of 1,254 executives around the world par - ticipated in the survey. Half of all respondents were from the C-suite. Roughly 27% of respondents were based in Asia, 33% in western and eastern Europe, 33% in North and Latin America, and 7% in the Middle East and Africa. Participants represented a range of company sizes, with 53% from firms with at least US$500m in revenue; 22% were from firms with revenue of at least US$5bn. The full breakdown of survey respondents can be found in the appendix, starting on page 46.

Conclusion 42 Appendix : Survey results 43 \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 3 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Executive summary Being a good corporate citizen has never been so challenging. Companies have long been under public scrutiny for practices ranging from recruitment to workplace safety, from attitudes to overseas investment to environmental pollution. The emergence of climate change as a mainstream political issue, however, has served to drive home the breadth of ethical issues with which firms must now grapple. The business\u2014and societal\u2014implications of how companies address these are so far reaching that a new area of management practice has come into being to manage them, known by many as \"corporate sustainability\". Accordingly, grasping the nature and scope of the sustainability challenge\u2014as well as best practice in addressing the attendant opportunities and risks\u2014is of immense importance to the corporate community. However, this report suggests that companies are at an early stage in developing such an understanding. While 53% of firms worldwide surveyed by the Economist Intelligence Unit claim to have a coherent sustainability policy, only half of these extend this beyond internal operations to encompass their supply chains. In all, less than one in three executives (29%) say their company has a coherent strategy that covers the whole business and its supply chain. Uncertainty also lingers as to whether sustainability can be seen as an opportunity, or if it is merely another drag on the bottom line. To investigate this, and to assess the impact of sustainability on business today, the Economist Intelligence Unit drew on a wide-ranging survey of over 1,200 executives worldwide, along with numerous in-depth interviews with leaders of businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as other sustainability experts. Other key findings from the study include the following: Business knows that it needs to raise its game... Out of a list of 16 sustainability policies, encompassing issues ranging from energy consumption and carbon emissions to diversity and governance, companies surveyed for this report had implemented an average of just 4.8 globally. Quantity Defining sustainability According to Timothy O'Riordan, Emeritus Professor at the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, defining sustainability is like \"exploration into a tangled conceptual jungle where watchful eyes lurk at every bend\". The number of definitions available, how - ever, gives each publication the freedom to advance its own, as a courtesy to readers if nothing else. This study has called sustainable those policies and processes which enhance the financial, environmental, societal, human, and other resources on which the company involved depends for its long-term health. Sustainability is the result of having such sustainable policies and processes, and aligning them so that goals in one area are not com - promised in favour of those in another. This is really just an elaboration of the Bruntland Commission definition, which posits that sustainable development is that which \"meets the needs of the present without compromis - ing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". Obviously, the practical implementation of the definition will vary across industries, geographies and job functions, because at the core sustainability is an under - lying approach rather than a definitive list of activities. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 4 aside, many executives also rated the quality of their company's efforts poorly. More respondents say that their organisation's performance has been poor in individual areas of sustainability, than those who believe their firms are doing well. Just 6% rate their companies as outstanding when it comes to the reduction of greenhouse gases, waste and pollution, compared with 15% who describe themselves as poor. One exception is communication: talking about whatever programmes they have in place is something most companies feel they do well. ...but is often confused by such new and poorly defined demands . Companies are still figuring out what sustainability means for their business and how to implement it. The research shows that companies have difficulty devising useful targets, and aligning social and environmental objectives with financial ones. Moreover, management frequently lacks an understanding of what sustainable development means for the organisation. No small factor here is a lack of consensus on what sustainability entails. \"Sustainability, at different times, can mean all things to all men,\" says Dr James Suzman, Director of Corporate Citizenship at De Beers. The supply chain is the weakest link . Extending sustainability policy to suppliers is the area where companies gave themselves the worst marks: about one-fifth say their companies have performed poorly in setting stronger supplier standards on both environmental and human rights issues. About the same proportion have only implemented supplier controls in the last five years. The problem is not new, and examples of disastrous consequences from socially or environmentally damaging supply chains abound. \"Every CEO should be asking, after a decade of work in implementing codes of conduct, 'Why haven't we fixed the problem?'\" argues Doug Cahn, Chairman of the Fair Factories Clearinghouse. Besides, firms can gain from improving their supply Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge chains. \"This is not charity: it is pure business. We create a better long-term relationship with suppliers, have better products, and better control over volume and price,\" says Roland Waardenburg, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility at Ahold. Many companies lack clear leadership on sustainability . Tony Juniper, an Executive Director at Friends of the Earth, who has seen numerous corporate sustainability programmes, says \"senior management or chief executive buy-in to the agenda is absolutely crucial\" for real change to occur. Most firms understand that senior leadership is critical here: one-third of surveyed companies place responsibility for their sustainability performance directly with the CEO\u2014and a further 26% place it with the board. But at many other firms sustainability responsibilities are dispersed throughout the organisation, and 11% of companies admit to having nobody in charge. \"Sustainability needs a strong seat at the table like procurement and finance,\" argues Francesca DeBiase, VP for Worldwide Supply Chain Management at McDonald's. \"It is the way everyone should be thinking.\" Sustainability reporting needs more work . Although companies rate their performance on communication highly, efforts regarding formal reporting are less advanced. Only 22% of executives say their firms have formal Triple Bottom Line reporting, although a further 40% say they will adopt it within five years. There is, in Mr Juniper's words, \"a huge level of disengagement\" from sustainability reporting. Sustainability does pay . Most executives (57%) say that the benefits of pursuing sustainable practices outweigh the costs, although well over eight out of ten expect any change to profits to be small. Specifically, sustainable practices can help reduce costs (particularly energy expenditure), open up new markets and improve the company's reputation. Part \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 5 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge of this involves a shift away from defensive behaviour towards more active exploration of the opportunities sustainability can present. Some of these gains can be dramatic. GE's line of Ecomagination products added US$12bn to its bottom line in 2006. The costs of implementation, however, are not to be ignored: respondents view this as the most formidable barrier to expanding sustainability practices. There is a link between corporate sustainability and strong share price performance . In our survey, companies with the highest share price growth over the past three years paid more attention to sustainability issues, while those with the worst performance tended to do less. Causality is difficult to establish, but the link appears clear: the companies that rated their efforts most highly over this time period saw annual profit increases of 16% and share price growth of 45%, whereas those that ranked themselves worst reported growth of 7% and 12% respectively. In general, these high-performing companies put a much greater emphasis on social and environmental considerations at board level, while the poorly performing firms are far more likely to have nobody in charge of sustainability issues. Business leaders are open to more regulation on social and environmental issues . Executives in our surveys are often opposed to increased regulation. Not here. Forty percent of those in our survey believe additional regulation is necessary to tackle social and environmental challenges. Another 50% say that voluntary action is generally more effective, but that additional regulation may be required in some areas. However, this openness to new rules is combined with the desire for clearer guidance about what government expects from business. Nearly two-thirds (62%) of respondents agree that \"uncertainty over government policy is making it difficult to plan strategies for corporate sustainability\". The irony is that politicians appear to be looking to business to deliver the goods. \"Governments are proponents of market solutions, and business is saying we want some regulation,\" notes Bjorn Stigson, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. \"From the outside, it can look pretty confusing.\" The social and environmental issues facing companies today are not going away\u2014and are likely to involve a redefining of relations between business and society. This often involves fundamental political and even moral questions. A good sustainability policy needs to know when, and why, to say \"no\" as well as \"yes\" to stakeholders' innumerable demands. \"If you don't know your magnetic north, then the compass is useless,\" says Mr Stigson. Companies need to adjust by integrating best practices in these fields into their operations and by joining the broader debate on the responsibilities of business, government and individuals in addressing these challenges. If firms do not get involved in the latter, it will hurt their own finances, as well as the environment and social conditions worldwide. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 6 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Doing good: Ten lessons for corporate leaders The experience of companies in the sustainability field yields some important insights. 1. Work smart, not hard. Sustainability does not involve a simple checklist of activities, but an alignment of social, environmental and financial goals. However, in our survey, the companies pursuing the largest number of sustainability-related policies were not necessarily those who ranked their perform - ance in this area highest. Quality counts. 2. Know thyself. Successful sustainability programmes are based on companies figur - ing out what they think is right and acting accordingly, rather than running after (often shifting) public demands. Distilling corporate values is an essential first step. As Bjorn Stigson, President of the World Busi - ness Council for Sustainable Development, says, \"If you don't know your magnetic north, then the compass is useless.\" A good sustainability policy needs to know when to say \"no\" to campaigners. 3. Know thy impact. A good assessment of what sustainability issues a company should be addressing requires an accurate idea of how company activities are affecting those around it. These need not be negative. Moreover, such analysis should include all aspects of the Triple Bottom Line\u2014environ- mental, social and financial. Too often com - panies forget the last, but as Jane Nelson, Director of the CSR Initiative at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, points out, \"the greatest business contribution to soci - ety is creating wealth\". 4. Focus on your core strengths. Just as with the financial side of company opera - tions, good performance comes from con -centrating on what an organisation does best. Immediate demands might inevitably draw you into areas a business does not know thoroughly, but it is wise for firms to consider where they can make the greatest impact. A consultant, rather than planting trees, would probably do better to help an organisation already doing that to run more efficiently. 5. Ask not just what your company can do for sustainability; ask what sustainability can do for your company. Sustainability need not be a burdensome imposition from outside. Taking account of social and environmental issues can lead to extensive innovation that cuts costs in the long run. At its best, it can open the way to new mar - ket opportunities and prepare the company for the growing risks in these areas. Ivo Menzinger, Group Head of Sustainability and Emerging Risk Management at Swiss Re, stresses that firms \"need to approach sustainability from a business angle ... there are environmental and social trends that will be relevant\". 6. Have clear leadership and board-level support. Sustainability will not just hap - pen. Success in these areas requires that somebody be responsible for sustainability issues. Moreover, wherever that responsi - bility is placed in the corporate structure, environmental and social priorities must have unequivocal support from the board, CEO and other senior management. Roland Waardenburg, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility at Ahold, notes that without such back-up from his CEO, \"I wouldn't do my job, because it wouldn't make sense any more.\" 7. Remember your supply chain. Too few companies are integrating their supply chains into their sustainability policies. Just as with the financial side of operations, poor performance by suppliers here can harm a company's sustainability record\u2014and very quickly its public reputation\u2014while a sus - tainable supply chain can greatly enhance an organisation's ability to deliver its own high social and environmental performance. 8. Monitor and report. \"When you say you will do something and you communicate it, you ought to measure it,\" says Daniel Vasella of Novartis. Finding information and metrics is not easy, but too few companies are even trying. Existing reporting guide - lines are not definitive solutions, but they do provide a place to start. 9. Integrate. Sustainability will not work as an add-on. It needs to be integrated into corporate structures and processes. Such change can be hard to manage, but is a key element of getting this right. Although some problems are sufficiently novel that new procedures and tools will be necessary to do so, companies should not forget traditional techniques of encouraging positive behav - iour. Mark Kramer, Founder of FSG Social Impact Advisors, explains: \"Until it affects somebody's compensation and performance reviews, it won't appear as a serious priority for middle management.\" 10. Engage. Sustainability is about the relationship of business to other elements of society. This means that a successful company will frequently cooperate with a range of stakeholders, including NGOs, that might on other occasions campaign against it. It also means engaging in public debates about the appropriate content and limits of corporate social and environmental poli - cies. This may not always be comfortable, but it will contribute both to the success of business and of the sustainability agenda. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 7 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Chapter 1: Sustainability: What is it, why now, and why us? Key points There is a general sense of confusion about the definition of sustainability. It means different things to different firms and varies across industries and regions Climate change is the key concern today, but the underlying driver is the changing roles of business, governments and other stakeholders in the wake of globalisation Three seemingly unconnected news stories appeared towards the end of 2007: a large multinational clothing company faced criticism for deaths at a supplier factory in the developing world; a major oil company's presence in a country known for human rights abuses came under the spotlight after another military crackdown on dissent; and Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) won the Nobel prize for their efforts to disseminate knowledge about climate change, while the US Congress debated legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Although distinct issues, all are part of a multi - faceted challenge that companies are approaching with increasing seriousness\u2014sustainability. Georg Kell, Executive Director of the United Nations Global Compact, a multi-stakeholder, corporate responsibility initiative, describes interest in the field as being on a \"total upswing\". It is a view that executives interviewed for this report consistently echo. As will be seen, however, companies are often bewildered in their response to these issues. That confusion is understandable when something as basic as what to call the challenge sparks debate. \"Sustainability\", \"sustainable are all terms used, often interchangeably, with different parts of the world exhibiting their own preferences. CSR has fallen out of favour among some Europeans because of associations with previous failures, whereas in parts of the US \"sustainability\" has anti-corporate connotations. For companies, the specific content of the term\u2014this study uses \"sustainability\" without any anti-business intent\u2014is even more daunting. Most lists include financial, environmental and social sustainability. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises , a useful effort to provide advice on state-of-the art best practice in this field, focuses on Disclosure, Employment and Industrial Relations, Environment, Combating Bribery, Consumer Interests, Science and Technology, Competition, and Taxation and has provisions on general policies in such areas as human rights and supply chain management. The UN Commission on Sustainable Development identifies over 40 relevant issues, including such disparate areas as \"Mountains\" and \"Health\". Ed Potter, Director of Global Workplace Rights for Coca-Cola, notes that at the theoretical level \"sustainability is unbounded\". Dr James Suzman, Director of Corporate Citizenship at De Beers, agrees: \"Sustainability at different times can mean all things to all men.\" In practice, it seems liable to mean anything that a business affects, or that affects a business, that is not purely financial. A better approach than making lists is to examine the ideas behind the terminology. Jane Nelson, Director of the CSR Initiative at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, explains that part of the problem is historical. \"You are getting convergence of similar but somewhat disparate fields,\" she says. Sustainability or sustainable development started out as a largely environmental concern, which has increasingly embraced both economic and social dimensions, whereas the origins of CSR, especially in the United States, are in corporate philanthropy. Both spread to encompass the other and more besides. The boundaries, however, remain fuzzy. \"Many companies have a sustainable development or environment, health and safety function and a CSR function,\" Ms Nelson notes. An early, oft-used definition for sustainability \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 8 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge comes from the Report of the World Commission on the Environment and Development , the Brundtland Commission: \"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" The original focus was on the environment: development that destroyed or exhausted essential natural resources was inappropriate. Bjorn Stigson, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), explains that in the late 1990s the concept of sustainability started to include corporate social responsibility, including governance in the wake of scandals such as Enron's. The thinking, however, remained consistent. Just as behaviour that destroys the physical environment on which business relies is unsustainable, so too are activities that tear at social structures and stakeholder relationships equally essential for long-term survival. CSR's evolution was different. Adrian Hodges, Managing Director of the International Business Leaders Forum, a group working to enhance business's contribution to sustainable development, argues that corporate involvement in the community some 20 years ago amounted mostly to philanthropy. \"The main driver used to be the personal interests of the chairman or, more often, of the chairman's wife.\" From there, CSR \"has moved through a long continuum to where today leading companies are looking at aligning business strategy with societal needs and working hard to eliminate negative operational impacts.\" This approach, which now includes environmental responsibility, helps with stakeholder and risk management, as well as the search for new business opportunities and competitive advantage. Mr Hodges and Mr Stigson both present this history in a way that emphasizes the element of enlightened self-interest in sustainability. This certainly has some appeal to modern business. For example, the two most frequently cited benefits that firms expect from sustainability policies relate to improved business outcomes: the ability to attract and retain customers (named by 37% of respondents) and improved shareholder value (34%). The third was straightforward increased profit (31%). Time to care Sustainability may have a long history, but why is the concept gaining traction in boardrooms now? The immediate impetus is closely tied to specific worries over global warming. John Elkington, Founder and Chief Entrepreneur of the consultancy SustainAbility, and coiner of the term \"Triple Bottom Line\", notes that interest in this area comes in waves\u2014this, he says, is the fourth since the 1960s. He sees the particular concerns driving interest as energy security, climate change and the growth of megacities.

Business is not blind to the implications. According to our survey, the leading area of activity in the past five years, and one of the most widespread priorities for the near future, is energy use reduction. Sometimes the change is more dramatic: Hurricane Katrina, for example, sparked a thoroughgoing change in how Wal-Mart approaches sustainability, particularly in environmental areas, but also in social ones. Climate change, although very important to the current interest in sustainability, is in many ways just the proximate cause. For decades now, globalisation and trade liberalisation have changed the relative positions of companies, governments and other stakeholders in society. Today's sustainability agenda is a continuation of the ongoing attempt to redefine the roles of each to address the challenges facing societies (see box Globalisation and sustainability ). Business and morality These issues are often political, and ultimately complex moral ones, such as what companies' duties are to the communities in which they operate. For this reason, most executives interviewed for this report felt that their sustainability strategy has to start with principle, not profit. \"CSR means different things to different people, depending on, for example, culture, religion, geographic location, or position in a value/ supply chain,\" says Mr Stigson. \"In considering what you should do as a company, it really comes down to your own values. If you don't know your magnetic Globalisation and sustainability Several executives interviewed for this report point to globalisation as the reason why sustainability has become an increasingly important issue for businesses. Edward Bickham, Executive Vice President of External Affairs at Anglo American, thinks the issue goes back to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of a mainstream alternative to capitalism. As globalisation accelerated, opportunities for business increased\u2014but so did worries that companies need to be more accountable. Dr James Suzman of De Beers dates a broader sociological shift to the same period, which resulted in companies having to meet new obligations in order to operate on a global basis. Georg Kell of the United Nations Global Compact also sees a strong link between liberalisation, global integration and growing \"expectations about business doing more or differently\". The issue was not just about increased business influence in the wake of globalisation, but also a simultaneous decline of state power. \"A lot of business risks and opportunities exist because of governance gaps or failures or because of changing boundaries and expectations of government roles,\" says Jane Nelson of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"So many of these issues are trans-boundary and would have been the role of government in the past. This is not to suggest that business should be taking responsibility for all these issues, but in today's increasingly complex and interdependent global economy there is a need to re-negotiate boundaries and burden-sharing between the public and private sector.\" Globalisation has made it both more important and yet more difficult to apply consistently high ethical standards to business. Different markets give rise to different responsibilities and expectations. Mr Bickham notes that in Anglo American's British operations, \"apart from being environmentally responsible and treating employees properly, our contribution is largely met by paying and treating our people decently, investing and paying our taxes.\" He believes their responsibilities are different in the poorer countries, however, where the capacity of the government to deliver sustainable outcomes is low, and consequently the requirements placed on business are much greater. Stakeholders are knocking on business's door not only for the problems firms might be causing, but also because companies may simply be the only ones capable of solving other pressing social and environmental difficulties for which they bear no direct responsibility. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 10 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge north, then the compass is useless.\" Daniel Vasella of Novartis, believes that the essential first step in this area is to \"explore what your beliefs are and to act in accordance with them\". Julian Garrido, CFO at GE Latin America, and Bob Langert, VP for Corporate Social Responsibility at McDonald's, also insist that everything starts with setting the right values. These days it is hard to escape the need for companies to crystallise their thinking on values. Michael Prideaux, Director for Corporate and Regulatory Affairs at British American Tobacco (BAT), the world's second-largest tobacco company, Case study The Quakers, social responsibility and profit The correct conduct of businesspeople in society, and the link between social responsibility and profit, are not new questions. The case of the Religious Society of Friends\u2014 the Quakers\u2014provides interesting insights into modern sustainability questions. As a group, the Quakers go back to the mid-17th century. Originally blocked from entering the professions, many went into trade and later manufacturing. Their dress, language and close links with each other certainly set them apart within business and society, but so too did a number of traits, based on their beliefs, that would hearten the modern corporate social responsibility (CSR) executive. They were known, even by critics, for exemplary hon - esty. James Walvin, a leading historian, concludes in The Quakers: Money and Morals, \"Their produce was sound, their prices fair, their services honest, their word good and their agreements honourable.\" Although important today, such behaviour was even more so in previous centuries when bank regulation, for example, was poor at best, and adulterated food - stuffs all too common. Quakers avoided even highly profitable sectors that they deemed immoral, such as the arms industry and the slave trade\u2014including, for a time, the closely asso - ciated sugar trade. They treated their employees very well by the stand - ards of the day, both because it was the right thing to do and because they thought it likely to increase productivity. The Cadburys, at their Bournville facility, in the second half of the 19th century provided decent housing, gardens, sports facilities and Saturday half- day holidays. In the early 1900s, they and the Rown - trees were among the first to set up worker pensions. Quaker employers might in retrospect seem at times highly patronising, but, compared to the alternative, that was a small price for contemporary workers to pay. By the standards of today, did this eccentric behaviour have any impact on the financial bottom line? As with modern sustainability, it certainly did not hurt. Although Quakers in Britain never numbered more than 60,000, Mr Walvin notes that by 1900 it would have been easy to organise much of material life \"around the products and services of a number of Quaker commercial enter - prises. Financial transactions could have been conducted through a number of Quaker banks (most notably Lloyds or Barclays), confectionery was to be had from a range of Quaker manufacturers (Huntley and Palmer, Carrs, Rown - tree, Fry or Cadbury), and shoes could be purchased from Clarks.\" These were merely the most noted Quaker firms, which had an influence on British business completely out of proportion to the group's size. As with those firms that best exemplify sustainability today, the Quakers were not ethical in order to make money, but they did what they saw as right and, either despite or because of this, grew rich. The irony is that their money made them thoroughly uncomfortable\u2014their precepts encouraged plainness, not luxury. As a result, even more wealth made its way to helping society. For example, Quaker businessmen were among the biggest backers of the anti-slavery movement\u2014with both time and money\u2014and for the past century Joseph Rowntree's three independent charitable trusts have been campaigning on a series of social issues worldwide. In the long term, honesty, integrity and loyalty to one's values are clearly no obstacles to financial success\u2014 whether you want it or not. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 11 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge remembers that early on in its efforts in this area, \"stakeholders were asking us what our business principles were. It hadn't occurred to us that people would want that, but ... we went out and developed them.\" Morality, philosophy and values, however important, cause most businesses to tread warily. Some companies can draw on the religious precepts of founders and owners, such as Zoroastrianism at India's Tata Group, or Quakerism at C&J Clark, the British shoe company (see \"In considering what you should case study The Quakers, social do as a company, it really comes responsibility and profit ). Mr down to your own values. If you Hodges cites a study showing that don't know your magnetic north, the biggest driver of sustainability then the compass is useless.\" among Latin American small and Bjorn Stigson, President, World Business medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) Council for Sustainable Development is the \"values of the family member who started the business\". Most modern multinationals, though, avoid a specific faith or ideology: if discussing religion is problematic for dinner guests, it can be fatal for sales or recruitment efforts. Trying to rely on some broad sense of popular morality that will satisfy consumers, however, is also fraught with difficulty. Popular mores can change rapidly and be inconsistent within the same country, let alone around the world. Ms Nelson notes that \"even with the best intentions in the world, companies have fifty different stakeholders telling them fifty different things\". Mr Vasella believes \"one needs to be open, but not run after fashion\". Acting sustainably, he believes, is never easy. \"There are a variety of stakeholders\u2014shareholders, NGOs, the media, politicians\u2014they all have an agenda. These agendas are not identical, and are sometimes contradictory. You enter into conflict whatever you do. Unless you stand behind what you really believe, you will not be sustainable because you will be attacked.\" Similarly, Mr Langert feels that, although it is important to listen to all sides on tough issues, \"it is very difficult to satisfy all the constituents. We want to feel that we are doing the right thing.\" Inevitable disagreements over moral issues means that \"sustainability\" is becoming a term like \"democracy\"\u2014everyone warmly supports the idea, but defines it differently. The contest over content is ongoing and could have profound effects. Jonathan Porritt, Chairman of the UK's Sustainable Development Commission\u2014the government's independent watchdog in the area\u2014wrote in a British newspaper, The Guardian , in November 2006 that almost by definition arms companies and cigarette-makers could not be sustainable. Mr Prideaux notes of BAT that \"we're very welcome in mainstream sustainability and CSR fora\", but the company is barred from anti-smoking ones. Mr Hodges thinks that ultimately \"society will work through what is acceptable and isn't acceptable. This is a question of changing values.\" In the past, he adds as an illustration, slavery was considered acceptable. The debate over values and what is morally acceptable may be an uncomfortable one for business. As Mr Vasella points out, \"Something we have not been trained to do in business schools is how to [engage in] dialogue with peoples with other beliefs.\" Too much is at stake, however, not to engage. At the very least, companies need to be part of the discussion on how far, if at all, current public concerns about climate change should affect a range of social issues as well. The future of whole sectors, which could find their social and legal licences to operate fading away, may depend on it. So too may the solution of many of the world's pressing environmental and social problems. As Tony Juniper, Executive Director of the environmental NGO Friends of the Earth UK, notes: \"We need business to be engaged in this in a positive way.\" 12 \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 Chapter 2 Priorities and drivers Companies are not philosophical academies but practical enterprises. How is the push towards sustainability changing the way they do business? Overall, business is looking at sustainability challenges across the board, rather than focusing narrowly. Our survey asked respondents to rank the importance of a range of sustainability-related goals at their firms. Around one-half considered the following activities as very important: improving the environmental footprint of products (57%); improving energy efficiency (52%); developing new products to help reduce social or environmental problems (51%); and improving the impact of operations on surrounding local communities and environments (both 50%). At the top of the agenda, however, is communicating this performance to investors and stakeholders (61%), an issue which is discussed later in this report. It is equally interesting to note which activities are ranked by executives as being of lower importance. Surprisingly, only around 40% of respondents see greenhouse gas reduction as an important priority. Given the interest of the public and politicians, businesses should almost certainly put more focus here. Says Roland Waardenburg, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility at Ahold, \"It would be wise to work on this. In the long term you get penalties if you don't; in the short term you can reduce your costs while doing the right thing for the environment. A perfect example of how profit and planet can go together.\" Companies also seem to be focusing on getting their own houses in order. Supply chain issues are a less common concern, whether they relate to the environment (35%) or human rights (34%), a potential blind spot also discussed later. The practical content of sustainability also varies Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge by sector. Respondents from the construction and agricultural industries, for example, gave a higher priority than the average to every one of the sustainability issues listed. Respondents in the latter were particularly concerned about local affairs, whether social (68% ranked it an important priority) or environmental (67%). Beyond the general, certain individual sectors also have specific concerns. Energy industry respondents are far more likely to place importance on issues such as energy efficiency (67%), greenhouse gas emission reduction (63%), and even\u2014given their frequent need to obtain supplies in poorer countries\u2014helping governments to promote sustainable development in countries of operation (56% compared with an average of 39%). Similarly, retailers are much more concerned than average with environmental and human rights issues in supply chains (54% for both), which can directly affect sales, and less so with developing new products (35%), a task they usually leave to others. Key points Environmentally focused actions account for the bulk of companies' activities Global guidelines may be set, but how these translate into local initiatives will vary widely Customers and governments are two key influencers globally. Much less consideration is given to developing-world customers Such diversity is hardly surprising. Ivo Menzinger, Group Head of Sustainability and Emerging Risk Management at Swiss Re, notes that the implications of these issues will obviously vary by industry, with an insurance company and a manufacturer of wind turbines seeing different opportunities and risks. The variations should not, however, obscure the broader message of the survey: a large number of companies across all industries attach importance to a wide- ranging list of sustainability initiatives. Same planet, different perspective Different vantage points lead companies to take different approaches to sustainability. As Mr Kell of the Global Compact says, the push for corporate sustainability is \"now truly a global phenomenon\". \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 13 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge How much of a priority will the following objectives be within your company over the next five years? (% respondents, only those selecting \"leading priority\" or \"major priority\" are shown) Leading priority Major priority Communicating your organisation's performance on sustainability to investors and stakeholders 24 37 21 36 Developing new products that help reduce or prevent social or environmental problems 20 31 Improving energy efficiency across global operations 19 33 Acting to enhance the impact of the organisation on the communities around operations 15 36 Improving the local environment around operating facilities 14 36 Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and/or waste/pollutants 13 26 Working with governments to promote sustainable development in the countries you operate in 12 27 Implementing stronger controls over suppliers on human rights standards 11 24 Implementing stronger controls over suppliers on environmental standards 9 26 Improving the environmental footprint of existing products/services (eg, use of recycled materials, reducing packaging and waste) Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. That does not mean it is uniform. Instead, local implementation can make sustainability appear more like a mish-mash of concerns that happen to be headed in the same direction. Values and cultural norms vary from region to region, sometimes even between or within countries. So do the drivers of sustainability. Our survey asked respondents to name the three stakeholders that would have the biggest effect on their sustainability policies. Worldwide, government policymakers, customers and competitors all featured, but with notable differences in emphasis (see chart on next page). Competitors are a broadly shared concern, and the most pressing in North America. Mark Kramer, Founder of FSG Social Impact Advisors, a non-profit organisation working with corporations and other stakeholders in this field, explains that existing sustainability efforts have changed the playing field: \"It used to be easy to say that you can't do anything because of competitive pressures. You can no longer argue that it is impossible for business to do this because many have.\" Although other companies are a universal concern, thereafter the picture gets complicated. Companies in Asia-Pacific are more influenced by policymakers than any other stakeholders and also than respondents from elsewhere. Quite simply, the government is often the most active player in this region. Speaking about China, Jing Ulrich, Chairman of Chinese Equities at JP Morgan, says that \"thus far the state is leading sustainability efforts\". Government has intervened to close some of the worst polluters and to designate several larger firms as industry leaders. These leaders have been rewarded with access to capital and state assets, \"but in return have greater responsibilities in terms of best practice,\" says Ms Ulrich. Dr Hameed Bhombal, CTO and President of Corporate Technology Strategy and Services at Aditya Birla, one of India's largest conglomerates, also notes that the environmental regulations he faces are tightening surprisingly quickly. As the figures show, consumers are not irrelevant in Asia either, although developing-world customers are generally given less consideration than those in the developed world. Even \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 14 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge in China, Professor Pan Jiahua, an environmentalist and Executive Director of the Research Centre for Sustainable Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, notes that domestic pressure on companies is seeing \"a much, much faster change than expected. The general public seem to be empowered to report to the authorities. Companies seem to care more about their social images.\" Nevertheless, the key concern remains the state. In western Europe, meanwhile, consumers are seen as the most powerful stakeholders of all in driving sustainability concerns. Mr Waardenburg of Ahold, for example, reports that his company usually acts ahead of any new regulations. To help the supermarket chain set its specific sustainability priorities, it consults customer opinion broadly. Francesca DeBiase, VP for Worldwide Supply Chain Management at McDonald's, says that her company did a similar exercise in Europe, which it is now expanding to other regions. \"It is fair to say that Europe leads the way in the sustainability discussion. This is simply because the European public, including NGOs, the government and the media, is more sensitive to sustainability and, in general, to a company's inter-linkage with society.\" Arguably, consumer behaviour and government action usually arise, directly or indirectly, out of popular opinion, whether exercised through the marketplace or electoral choices. The relatively small direct impact attributed to the media and NGOs on companies (cited by 20% and 13% respectively overall) is on the surface a surprise. Their undoubted influence comes through their effect on consumers, voters and regulators (see case study Business and NGOs: A changing relationship ). There is one caveat to the importance of popular views worldwide\u2014some people are more equal than others. Location may explain why customers in the developing world\u2014where two-thirds of the world lives\u2014are a leading factor for so few North American (11%) or west European companies (14%). Even for Asia-Pacific businesses, however, only 18% place Which of the following will have the greatest influence over your sustainability strategy over the next five years? (% respondents) All customers Competitors Developed-world customers Developing-world customers Government policymakers World 46 36 46 40 15 Western Europe 56 49 41 37 14 North America 44 37 41 45 11 Asia-Pacific 46 32 51 41 18 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. developing-world consumers among their top three influences. If companies worldwide were facing varying degrees of pressure from governments, consumers and competitors, the results might not be that different. Complicating matters is that popular opinion varies by region. Even on an issue where agreement is growing, such as climate change, Mr Stigson of WBCSD notes that, in very broad brush strokes, Americans are more amenable to technological \"It used to be easy to say that fixes, Europeans to tougher you can't do anything because of regulations that might hurt the competitive pressures. You can no economy, Japanese to voluntary longer argue that it is impossible agreements, and Chinese and for business to do this because Indians to solutions that recognise many have.\" their needs to alleviate poverty. Mark Kramer, Founder of FSG Social Impact \"It is a very broad range of Advisors \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 15 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge mindsets out there.\" Going beyond climate change, the variety of views is even greater, often arising out of different levels of development and state ability. Mr Garrido of GE notes that in Latin America the growth of the middle class is changing expectations about areas ranging from healthcare to water use. Dr James Suzman of De Beers believes that \"it is fairly widely accepted, when operating in Sub-Saharan Africa, that [Adam Smith's] invisible hand may be invisible because it isn't there. It is hard to avoid the need to engage with societal issues in a progressive way.\" Gail Kendall, Director for Group Environmental Affairs at CLP Group, the Hong Kong-based power company, says the group's fundamental dilemma is \"how to provide energy that is legitimately needed, and at the same time be good on climate change. Even our mainstream environmental stakeholders agree that there has to be a role for a fuel like coal, and that people in countries like India are entitled to development.\" She adds that local Chinese stakeholders are looking less at emissions and more on education and an improvement in living standards. In India, Aditya Birla's social activities in 3,700 rural communities accordingly focus on development, with programmes addressing issues including education, health and women's rights. As Mr Bickham of Anglo American noted of Britain, in developed countries environmental stewardship, behaving decently to stakeholders and obeying the law is sufficient to address most concerns on sustainability. However, even developed countries have their differences. As Mr Menzinger of Swiss Re says, \"It shouldn't matter in theory what your setting looks like, but it still does.\" He remembers a former Swiss Re CEO saying that \"being Swiss, with Swiss characteristics, and having the glaciers retreating, could have been one of the factors why we became alert to climate change so early\". Bart Alexander, Global VP for Alcohol Policy and Corporate Responsibility at MolsonCoors, believes that although US companies and regulators have generally been less active on climate change, they have probably been doing more in the area of financial compliance post-Enron. The general reputation of the country's business sector as a \"laggard\" on Triple Bottom Line accounting is, in his words, both true and not true. \"It is certainly true at the rhetorical level, but if you look at the functioning of North American companies, there is quite a lot of history of community outreach and concern about how people are treated.\" When he started at MolsonCoors, Mr Alexander found that a lot of sustainable behaviour had already been internalised. Many sustainability-related activities have \"been done by a lot of companies, but just not pulled together and labelled as CSR\". Even in terms of broader benefits that companies see from the sustainability agenda, the story can be quite different in regional or country-specific contexts, according to Mr Kell. For some Chinese firms, it is assumed to be a necessary part of wanting to operate on a world stage; in Egypt, \"businesses see it as a platform of modernisation, a counterweight\" to those wanting to return society to an earlier time; and in more developed economies it is often adopted by companies that want to maintain leadership. Regional priorities How are these differences playing out in corporate behaviour? Perhaps because of climate change, Europe has a reputation of being much more advanced on these issues. Our survey suggests a more complex picture, with Asia-Pacific companies rating themselves highly. There is an impression that foreign companies are leading sustainability efforts in the region\u2014most members of the China Business Council on Sustainable Development, for example, are multinationals based in Western countries. Our survey figures indicate, however, that even domestic companies in this region claim to be as active in environmental and social areas as those elsewhere. As Ms Ulrich says of China, \"Sustainability is a major concern here. It is certainly not considered just a Western issue.\" \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 16 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge In looking at priorities, far more Asia-Pacific companies consider working with governments to promote sustainable development (46%) than those based in North America (33%) or western Europe (31%). Perhaps surprisingly, for most sustainability priorities mentioned in our survey, a higher proportion of Asia-Pacific firms considered them important. Europeans were usually slightly ahead of North Americans, except in fields involving local communities, where the latter placed more emphasis. When asked about specific, sustainability-related policies and activities, Asia-Pacific firms on average had adopted more (five) than those in the other two regions (four in each). They were also less likely not to have anyone in charge of sustainability within the company\u2014just 7% had no one, compared with 10% in Europe and 17% in North America. For companies that considered it relevant, the percentage of executives that thought a significant minority would pay extra for some element of sustainability\u2014such as greener goods, carbon offset, ethical sourcing, socially responsible investment practices or brands associated with sustainability\u2014was between 5% and 15% higher for Asia-Pacific companies than for their peers in Europe or North America. Asia-Pacific companies are more likely to think they are performing better than their peers when it comes to social (49%) and environmental (44%) issues. The North Americans are not far behind (44% and 37%), with the Europeans the most pessimistic (39% and 31%). Although greenhouse gas emission in Asia, and especially China, is a real and pressing problem, it should not obscure the fact that sustainability is about more than one single issue, however important. Our survey and interviews instead paint a picture of companies facing a wide variety of challenges worldwide, with poor performance in one area How do you believe your company's performance in the following areas rates against that of your main competitors? (% respondents that selected \"much better\" or \"better\") Asia-Pacific North America Western Europe Social contribution 49 44 39 Environmental impact 44 37 31 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. not necessarily precluding positive performance elsewhere. Such regional variety raises two questions. First, how should multinationals operating in many areas address issues with different salience worldwide? Sometimes the solution is to try to satisfy everyone. Tod Arbogast, Director of Sustainable Business at Dell, explains that \"fortunately, within our industry, once we implement a sustainable change in a given region, it is beneficial for us to translate it across the globe\". Mr Waardenburg, speaking of Europe and America, says in practice the differences are \"not too big\" and that Ahold's policies are able to satisfy all operating companies within the group. Even potentially more divisive issues do not necessarily cause difficulties. Mr Potter of Coca-Cola notes, for example, that his firm has a single worldwide policy on gender discrimination. \"So far it seems to be working without any local hiccups.\" Universality, however, is not always easy. On the other hand, policies based on values cannot be completely elastic. Mr Vasella notes that Novartis is \"not very flexible\" on its rules. \"We apply the same kind of standards across the world. That puts us at a disadvantage to some companies locally, but so be it.\" Our survey shows that this attitude is not shared by all, even on questions where values are central. Just under one-quarter of companies have different standards on business ethics, corruption and bribery, \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 17 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Case study Business and NGOs: A changing relationship In popular imagination, relations between non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and companies usually involve angry con-frontation\u2014introducing the notion that the business community has been forced to address sustainability issues largely owing to the work of frequently hostile civil society groups. The image may have historical justification, but the relationship has moved on. The main driver of corporate change is no longer activists with great media acumen chained to corporate property. Survey respondents put NGOs last in a long list of influences over their sustainability policies (only 13% placed them in the top three). Of course, civil society actors certainly affect more highly ranked groups, such as governments or customers, and a well-targeted NGO campaign can cause deep reputational damage. Instead, the apparent decline of NGO influence may be relative rather than absolute. According to Mr Kramer of FSG Social Impact Advisors, because of their success in winning over the public, \"pressure from activists [now] falls on more fertile ground. Activist groups certainly continue to put on pressure, have gotten more sophisticated, and have moved from a radical fringe to an accepted part of the culture.\" More interesting than conflict is the increasing level of partnership between NGOs and companies. As Georg Kell, Executive Director of the United Nations Global Compact, notes, dialogue required change on both sides, with the former becoming less confrontational and the latter less defensive. Co-operation between individual firms and activist groups, which a few years ago might have been problematic, is now unremarkably commonplace. Ed Potter, Director of Global Workplace Rights at Coca-Cola, says that NGO input to policies at his firm is \"quite important\". Coca-Cola's recently released workplace rights policy saw \"more external engagement with human rights NGOs than we probably did internally\". Bob Langert, VP for Corporate Social Responsibility at McDonald's, comments: \"We need them and their expertise. We don't know enough about all of these technical issues. Even the campaign NGOs play an important role. These issues need more attention. I like the fact that there are these groups out there rattling the cages. They care, we care.\" As with its suppliers, McDonald's appreciates long-term relationships with partner NGOs, having co-operated with Conservation International for two decades. Dell too works with NGOs, using the same logic it has for business partners: they bring expertise that the company simply does not have in-house. Across the fence, Tony Juniper, Executive Director of Friends of the Earth UK, says that after \"a lot of greenwash over the last 20 years\", his organisation was seeing in some cases \"a genuine engagement we haven't seen before\". It is now working with Eurostar and the Co-operative Bank, whereas \"a few years ago we didn't find partners out there that we trusted sufficiently\". But despite numerous examples of co-operation, mistrust remains between the sectors. Mr Juniper sees \"a very mixed level of engagement and performance on sustainability across the corporate world and within sectors\". Companies are doing \"a lot of engaging in the communications sphere\", but only some who make claims are seriously addressing the issues. Daniel Vasella at Novartis points out that, like companies, NGOs are not all the same: \"They range from 180 degrees collaborative to 180 degree oppositional.\" He argues that companies \"need to keep open a dialogue with the ones we can, but so do they\". Many executives see a simple market logic at work: in Mr Kramer's words, there is \"a separate industry of NGOs that needs to find \"We need [NGOs] and their wrongdoing on the part of corporations to sustainexpertise. We don't know enough themselves. There are about all of these technical issues. those who think business Even the campaign NGOs play an is fundamentally a bad important role. These issues need thing. They are not going to change their views.\" more attention.\" This continuingBob Langert, VP for Corporate Social Responsibility at McDonald's tension is causing less friction than it might because actors in both sectors have realised that the other is not the key to these issues. At the Global Compact, Mr Kell was \"never of the view that the business-NGO partnership dimension is so important. In the broader constellation of business, government remains in the driver's seat.\" Similarly, NGOs see attacks on companies as sometimes necessary but generally inefficient. Even the largest ones rarely have the resources to co-ordinate more than a few large campaigns at a time. Mr Juniper notes that at Friends of the Earth \"our analysis has broadened into a different place, looking less at the performance of individual companies and more at the private sector as a whole and the role of regulation. That has led us to engage less with individual firms, and more with governments.\" Even the International Business Leaders Forum, whose mission is to put \"business at the heart of sustainable development\", according to Adrian Hodges, the Managing Director, \"spends as much time working with NGO and government leaders as business, because the ability of business to be sustainable is as much a result of the attitudes and actions of these actors as of business itself\". Overall, our survey result does not reflect business being able to ignore activist pressure, but rather a maturing relationship between the sectors and a realisation by both that limited resources are better focused elsewhere. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 18 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge How do you apply standards in the following areas across your global operations? (% respondents) Where possible, we apply We adopt different standards depending We have not developed a Don't know one global standard on local laws and custom standard policy on this issue Code of business ethics 61 23 11 4 Rules on corruption (eg, bribery) 59 23 12 6 Health and safety 49 37 10 4 Consumer health and safety 43 31 17 9 Environmental policy 30 30 32 8 Working hours and pay 29 59 8 4 Support for biodiversity (eg, protection of natural species affected by suppliers, products and operations) 19 21 46 15 49 16 Carbon emissions policy (esp. in countries with different Kyoto criteria) 16 19 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. depending on local laws and customs. Over one- third treat health and safety issues differently. Some flexibility may be necessary. Ms DeBiase agrees that there have to be global standards, but within such a framework certain issues depend on local needs: water use reduction, for example, might get a higher priority in dry areas. The kind of variation suggested in our survey, however, means that a significant minority of companies risk scandals that sustainability was supposed to help address: after all, developed- world consumers do not differentiate between bribes or sweatshops at home and those abroad. More important, these businesses risk missing the broader changes afoot worldwide. The second question is: \"Where does it end?\" Critics of sustainability point out that companies are being asked to do things they are not necessarily very good at, to the detriment of what they do well, thereby ultimately hurting society. As everything above shows, no simple answer exists and context is essential. Alan Rosling, Executive Director at Tata Group, says that his company considers these matters \"case by case. There is a limit to what we can do with the resources we have, and we are restricted by what is legal and ethical. Beyond that we don't have any restrictions.\" Mr Vasella agrees that it is \"not a question you can answer in general. You have to explore each and every time. You have to ask what do we really believe is needed and useful.\" Ultimately, leading companies limit these activities in the same way they do commercial ones, by asking where they can bring added value or make a unique contribution\u2014and, more recently, by asking what aspects of sustainability will bring them competitive advantage as well. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 19 Key points Few companies rate their efforts on environmental and social issues highly Key barriers include a lack of definition about what level of action is sufficient, and the need for deep cultural change within business Specific issues centre on leadership, firms' supply chains, reporting and metrics, and the challenge of turning values into processes Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Chapter 3 How is business doing? Despite numerous examples of companies with laudable sustainability efforts, business as a whole is at a relatively early stage of learning and adoption. Just 53% of surveyed firms worldwide have a coherent sustainability policy. About one-half of these address only company operations, not supply chains. Another 23% of respondents are currently trying to develop policies. Execution is similarly problematic. Asked about performance on a range of environmental and social outcomes, less than 10% of respondents rated their efforts as outstanding on each, barring public relations (PR). Large majorities described themselves as average or worse. The specific content of sustainability programmes also frequently leaves much to be desired. As noted above, just 55% of companies are reducing energy usage\u2014and those doing so are not having much impact on their carbon emissions. The only other strategy adopted by over one-half of companies (51%) was to change governance structures relative to social and environmental activity. Basic steps, such as upgrading information technology (IT) to monitor performance or integrating sustainability into employee training, were minority tastes (27% and 31% of companies, respectively). A large part of the problem is simply how new all this is to many, especially when, as Mr Stigson at WBCSD explains, the challenges are very substantial. \"There is some humility in looking at these issues,\" he says. \"Most corporations have not been doing so very long. At the same time the agenda is exploding.\" Similarly, Mr Kell of the Global Compact sees a lot of insecurity as to how to master these issues. \"Business people recognise their importance, but when it comes to the practical question of what they mean to the organisation, there is a lot of confusion,\" he says. \"Business has never explicitly embraced these issues. There is no ready recipe or toolbox.\" Mr Potter of Coca-Cola thinks only a small part of the corporate world has achieved momentum in this area. Overall, business is \"at the baby steps stage. This whole thing is a huge endeavour.\" The main impediments to progress confirm that companies are at an early stage in the learning process. After fear of costs (40% of companies), the second and third most frequently cited barriers are: difficulty devising useful targets, measures and controls to entrench sustainability (36%); and problems aligning these efforts with financial ones (31%). One-quarter even blame a broad lack of management understanding of what sustainable development means for the organisation. These difficulties point to two wider issues. First, the lack of definition hinders excellence. Ms Nelson of Harvard explains: \"Most companies are not sure what is enough. On climate change, what is enough? That you have a policy? That your emissions meet or Does your company have a coherent strategy for corporate sustainability that covers the whole business and its supply chain? Please select one answer only. (% respondents) Yes, it covers the whole business including the supply chain Yes, it covers the business, but not the supply chain 24 No, but we are developing one 23 No, and we have no immediate plans to develop one 18 Don't know 5 Other 1 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 20 29 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge exceed some publicly agreed level? And if so, who sets the level? There is even more fuzziness on spheres of social responsibility.\" Jill Brady, General Counsel and in charge of sustainability at the airline Virgin Atlantic, agrees: \"The issue is so big and people never know if they're doing enough. I try and get my team to write down little successes along the way\u2014because it's easy to lose sight of what has been achieved.\" Second, progress requires not only new techniques and tools but, potentially, deep cultural change too. \"Sustainability's history of being imposed on companies has made it very hard to see it as a positive thing,\" argues Mr Kramer at FSG. \"It has been deeply ingrained for a couple of decades that it is really an attack on business, something to be avoided and handled through PR.\" Thus, the starting point is simply taking the challenges seriously, thinking through one's values and long-term business interests, and then acting accordingly. Mr Juniper of Friends of the Earth sees the key for businesses as aligning environmental, social and financial goals. They fail if \"they see this as a process of balancing challenges\", in which case \"they finish up always trading off, and choosing the financial\". Creating such an alignment will often, according to Mr Elkington of SustainAbility, require \"a fundamental rethink of the business model, which is really, really tough to do\". Looking in detail, several issues stand out as needing attention by many companies. A. Leadership As elsewhere in business, leadership is essential in reaching sustainability goals, but our survey indicates several problems. A handful of companies (4% of respondents) make no bones about the link between sustainability and PR, giving oversight of sustainability issues to their PR departments. More seriously, at more than one in ten firms, nobody has specific responsibility for sustainability. Overall, more than one in four businesses report that a lack of clear responsibility for sustainability at the board level is a major impediment to progress.

But too few businesses share this view. an important priority. One reason is this area's inherent difficulty. Inattention to supply chains shows a failure to \"Supply chains are very complex,\" says Mr Cahn. understand how societal expectations are changing. \"Relationships aren't always transparent. There is Labour conditions within developing-world suppliers, a great deal of subcontracting. Even with robust for example, have occasioned embarrassing licensing programmes, the chains are very hard controversies for their developed-world customers to police.\" He also points to the challenge of for years. Social auditing arose largely to provide creating sustainable supply chains when operating independent confirmation of conditions in these in competitive markets with poor or virtually non- establishments. Doug Cahn, Chairman of the Fair existent regulatory environments. \"Some developing- Factories Clearinghouse\u2014recently founded to help country governments haven't got sufficient share social audit information on clothing and shoe enforcement,\" he says. Add to this the thorny issue industry supplier factories in the developing world\u2014 of company integration, tensions between those says: \"Every CEO should be asking, after a decade of seeking compliance and those seeking to drive work in implementing codes of conduct, 'Why haven't down prices, and crash orders placing hardships on we fixed the problem?'\" As supply chains become more factories to meet standards that companies are trying global, Ms Nelson sees their management as a growing to impose, and it is clear that applying standards for sustainability concern. sustainability can be a major challenge. Worse still, such inattention shows a Sheer numbers increase the complexity. Mr misunderstanding of one's own company. Ms DeBiase Bickham at Anglo American explains that extractives remembers that at McDonald's, which actively works as an industry use a lot of contractors. While his firm \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 23 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Big is beautiful? Size matters a lot to sustainability performance. Three- quarters of large companies\u2014those with annual revenue over US$10bn\u2014already have sustainability policies, most of which address supply chains. Only 5% have no plans to create one. Meanwhile, of smaller firms\u2014those with rev - enue under US$500m\u2014just 48% have policies in place, and one in four have no plans to create one. Similarly, four times more large companies engage in Triple Bottom Line reporting, compared with small firms\u2014and this ratio is set to increase over the next five years. These differences may not reflect dramatic differences in the sustainability outlook. Adrian Hodges, Managing Director of the International Business Leaders Forum, points out that surveys on other policy fields would get the same answer. \"Smaller companies tend to have fewer policies about things,\" he notes. Georg Kell, Executive Director at the United Nations Global Compact, agrees, noting that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 40% of his organisation's membership. They can do management overview without explicit policies, he says. Both he and Mr Hodges also believe that as larger firms focus on supply chains, smaller ones that are part of those chains will increasingly need to address sustainability issues. Even so, the lack of coherent sustainability strategies does matter. On specific environmental and social outcomes, larger firms rated their efforts much higher than smaller ones, sometimes dramatically so: 38% of the former thought their efforts on greenhouse gas and waste reduction very good, compared with 19% of the latter. Even more striking, more than twice as many small firms ranked themselves as poor performers for every listed sustainability action. Larger companies were also more active, typically being involved in more than one and a half times as many sustainability activities as their smaller counterparts. Why is this? Cost can be an issue for smaller companies, but is usually not a pressing one. Just 17% noted funding as a major barrier. Although this was much higher than the figure for large firms (7%), it was well down the list of issues. Instead, small businesses are under less pressure to deliver. In China, for example, Professor Pan Jiahua, an Executive Director at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, notes that whereas bigger companies see sustainability as part of what is expected of a business with global aspirations, the smaller businesses are \"not ready yet\". Mark Kramer, the Founder of FSG Social Impact Advisors, notes that whereas global players need to have a strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimension, \"SMEs are generally not the targets of activists, so they don't have the defences\". The reason is simple and unlikely to change. As Jane Nelson, Director of the CSR Initiative at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, points out, campaigners \"can't go to 100,000 little companies\". Another factor is that small companies tend to be more local. Mr Kell says that the Global Compact has found that success in social and environmental areas correlates positively to the degree of integration into global rather than local economies. For businesses operating in diverse geographies, it is \"absolutely necessary to come to terms with environmental, social and government issues,\" he says. Our survey did not contradict this: the differences between the most and least globalised businesses\u2014as measured by percentage of total sales occurring outside the country of the firm's headquarters\u2014broadly reflected those between big and small companies. Whatever the reason for their poorer performance, small businesses need to raise their game. They face the same opportunities and challenges as everyone else. Mr Kramer says sustainability is just as important to their strategy as it is to a large company. In fact, he argues, \"in many ways, there are niche opportunities that small companies can fill that are too small for large corporations\". John Elkington, Founder and Chief Entrepreneur of SustainAbility, agrees: \"Big changes in economies tend to come from a very limited set of actors. We will see unsuspected, unknown actors putting profound strategic and competitive pressure on mainstream companies.\" The performance of small firms has great implications for the success of sustainability. Some 80% of companies worldwide are small, notes Ms Nelson. Their individual activity, even if problematic, has little effect, but in aggregate it can be huge. On top of this, \"some of the greatest innovation in terms of meeting social need comes from small companies,\" she adds. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 24 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge tries to address supply chain issues, he comments: \"Does that mean we have a complete handle on all 40,000 suppliers? No, but it is a work in progress.\" Coca-Cola, notes Mr Potter, has over 100,000 suppliers, making management of its supply chain \"an immense activity\". Supplier attitudes are also not straightforward. \"We get a lot of reactions,\" says Mr Arbogast, including positive ones. As Mr Potter notes, it is \"a very resource-intensive activity to seek to influence businesses that you don't own. Your sole leverage point is whether they continue to be your supplier. It is one thing to take an approach that you throw the rascals out, but that leads to a relatively unpredictable supply chain. You do throw out some rascals, and others leave,\" but usually you need to work with what is there. A hard line is also problematic, as its impact can be limited. Ms DeBiase explains that, although McDonald's is clearly an influential buyer, \"people tend to think we have more impact than we do. We can make changes but it doesn't change the industry.\" Mr Arbogast adds that not every company follows leadership in these fields. Indeed, faced with the reality that single-handed acts of responsibility often amount to little but quixotic failures to achieve anything of substance, some businesses form industry or broader stakeholder coalitions. According to Mr Arbogast, although Dell can do much on environmental issues, the complexity of IT's supply chain makes social improvement easier to secure through the broadly supported Electronic Industry Code of Conduct. Similarly, although McDonald's has sometimes created change on its own, such as on animal welfare, it needs help on other occasions, such as the recent controversy over soya from deforested Amazonian land. In this case, it helped to create the Soya Working Group, which included suppliers, producers and NGOs. The novelty of co-operative solutions can also present legal challenges. The Fair Factories Clearinghouse is unique in how it shares social audit information. Before it could start, however, the organisation thought it wise to get a business review letter from the US Department of Justice to ensure that the latter would not prosecute those involved for uncompetitive behaviour. Despite all these complications, paying attention to supply chains is not only essential, it can also be highly beneficial. Leading companies, rather than dictating standards to suppliers, work with them to improve their performance\u2014and thereby their products. The benefits of such engagement can be substantial. BAT recently won a UK Business in the Community award for supply chain sustainability. Mr Prideaux says that it has long been helping farmers to improve crop yields: \"We work with them looking for continuous improvement.\" \"Supply chains are very complex. Sustainability issues add one Relationships aren't always more part to the mix, but also transparent. There is a great deal provide new opportunities. Coca-of subcontracting. Even with Cola, says Mr Potter, usually sees robust licensing programmes, the problems here as \"an opportunity chains are very hard to police.\" to educate, to ramp suppliers Doug Cahn, Chairman, Fair Factories Clearinghouse up\". Mr Waardenburg points to one of Ahold's subsidiaries' programmes, Albert Hein in Africa. Popular with suppliers, it insists that all of them, large or small, operate at an acceptable social standard. \"This is not charity: it is pure business. We create a better long-term relationship with suppliers, have better products, and better control over volume and price,\" he says. It is also a skills creation opportunity. \"Every year, for Albert Hein, the market share and sales of these products is increasing.\" Mr Alexander at MolsonCoors says that, even in the developed world, where the brewer's suppliers are based, sustainability programmes allow it to raise performance. The benefits from such efforts flow both ways. \"If you work in a spirit of collaboration, it is amazing how you can get things done that are practical for \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 25 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge the business and cost effective,\" says Mr Langert of McDonald's. A recent example is the company's sustainable fish programme. Some 18,000 tonnes of fish sourcing has gone to more sustainable sources, based on a scorecard \"developed with suppliers at the table all working in a collaborative way\". The results can be even more powerful when, rather than simply obeying a purchaser's strictures, supply chain members share its values. Mr Garrido at GE says his firm insists on this. \"As we develop new products, we need to have people who have the same thing in mind, who understand where we are going.\" In seeking solutions for its Ecomagination range, for example, \"we need people with the same mindset or we wouldn't be able to cope\". C. Reporting and metrics Reporting is integral to modern business. As sustainability has risen up the agenda, corporate reports dealing with some or all of the issues involved Case study Learning to share: The Fair Factories Clearinghouse Social audits are relatively new devices, designed to verify compli - ance of (usually, developing-world) supplier factories with the employment codes of the (usually, developed-world) companies that are outsourcing their manufacturing to them. The apparel industry was an early adopter, but its firms soon found themselves frustrated by their limitations. Conceptually based on financial audits, the first reports were not designed for easy sharing, even within companies, let alone with interested stakeholders, such as activists. Progress was hard to monitor, and patterns in data that could act as red flags were hard to spot. Most important, it became clear that social and environmental discussions with supplier factories had a fundamental difference from negotiations over price: for the latter collaboration with other purchasers was anti-competitive, in the former it was essential. Only collective leverage could change the sustainability practices of some of these factories, which in turn required shared information. \"Companies with supply chains and programmes to monitor factories were looking for better tools,\" recalls Doug Cahn, Chairman of Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC), a non-profit organisation. \"Some companies needed a data management tool that would help them to meet their commitments to transparency and public reporting.\" That tool began as software originally developed at Reebok, which then decided to share its work. Along with a number of other apparel and retail firms and trade bodies, it thus formed the FFC. Members can now use the database, which contains some 15,000 records, to more easily organise and access social audit information, including compliance records and history, for making purchasing decisions\u2014something that major firms like LL Bean, Adidas and VF Corporation do every day. This, however, is only the first step. \"Being able to manage information is one thing, but the ability to share non-competitive information is what companies really want,\" says Mr Cahn. \"When you have multiple buyers from a single factory, it allows for efficiency. More important, it allows for more effective communication about needed corrective action steps when compliance levels fall short of standards.\" FFC has found that even companies satisfied with their own internal social audit databases are extremely interested in this aspect of its work. The benefits are not all one-way. If purchasers can share information, then factories with good records will not need to undergo so many time-consuming audits. One advantage of the technology is that it helps overcome a problem that has plagued social auditing from the beginning\u2014a multiplicity of codes. Mr Cahn notes that there was no common ground with early efforts by individual companies in this field. \"Now you have hundreds, if not thousands, of codes of conduct, all of which are implemented in slightly different ways,\" he says. \"It has created a real mess and is terribly inefficient from a factory perspective and buyer perspective.\" The database does not try to harmonise the codes\u2014the FFC is neutral between them\u2014but by including reports that use a range of them, Mr Cahn hopes that companies will understand the advantages and drawbacks of each, which in turn may spark efforts to greater harmonisation between them. \"The FFC can be a forum in which the conversation about which standards may make more sense can take place.\" The FFC's collaborative approach is now attracting interest from smaller firms. \"These companies are not going to have the resources to build out a million-dollar database system,\" says Mr Cahn. \"For them, for a subscription fee, they can have access to the tool, to the information, and to hundreds if not thousands of other audits. Sharing is a huge opportunity for smaller and medium-sized companies.\" \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 26 have appeared worldwide. Despite real progress, too many companies do not report on their efforts, and those that do still frequently grapple with central questions of what to report, how to do so, and what the results even mean. Just 22% of survey respondents issue formal reports on their environmental and social impact and performance, along with their financial performance (the so-called Triple Bottom Line). Others are preparing to do so: 40% expect to publish such documents in the next five years. The other 38% have no plans to, although this does not mean that they are not monitoring these issues. Many report on specific items, including: programmes managing the impact of operations on communities (25%); energy use reduction (26%); jobs created by gender or minority group (40%); and donations to community and civil society groups (55%). Only 42% of respondents report nothing at all on environmental impact, and just 34% fail to report on employment conditions and social impact. These figures recall a point made by several interviewees, that companies have been doing a lot of this activity, but have just not called it sustainability. Nevertheless, even the higher figures indicate, as Mr Juniper says, \"a huge level of disengagement\". More striking, of those who did report any environmental or social data, a minority of respondents (41% and 31%, respectively) had it audited. The value of reporting is straightforward and centres on measurement. Mr Vasella believes that \"when you say you will do something and you communicate it, you ought to measure it\". If not, \"you don't know if it is being done\". Companies need the \"courage to be accountable\", which spurs them to find innovative ways to keep commitments. Reporting \"has a lot of effects on the organisation and credibility,\" notes Mr Vasella. Mr Langert adds that one important outcome of McDonald's CSR report has been enhanced transparency within the company. Indeed, employees will be one of the many stakeholders interested in such reports, along with governments, regulators, Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge consumers, NGOs and, of course, other businesses. Mr Potter of Coca-Cola says he is an \"avid reader\" of sustainability reports. This varied readership makes for a tough balancing act. A significant portion of respondents (43%) say that meeting the needs of such a multi-stakeholder audience is either a major or moderate challenge. Just 18% say it isn't. As with many things, however, the devil is in the detail. Among companies for which it was relevant, over-half faced important challenges from basic reporting questions, such as establishing appropriate key performance indicators (60%); finding reliable, relevant, internal data (58%); developing tools to monitor performance (53%); and meeting the reporting needs of different stakeholders (51%). The problems may be even more widespread: Mr Cahn notes that \"everyone interested in social compliance needs to find better tools\". Novelty is again an issue. Mr Potter says that establishing the right key performance indicators is tough: \"I don't think anyone has found the path to do that. To a large extent, this kind of work in a serious way has been going on for 15 years, but is still pretty embryonic.\" Mr Bickham, although more positive, still has concerns. Devising metrics, he says, \"is a work in progress, but it is quite well progressed\". Mr Prideaux of BAT agrees, and says \"it is hard to find metrics, but it can be done\". The ideal \"is to find something that you are already doing and use that\". For example, BAT used its Dow Jones Sustainability Index score in its latest annual financial report. Several organisations have worked on reporting frameworks or standards, ranging from ISO 14000 certification to the AA1000 assurance standard. In fact, says Mr Bickham, if anything, Anglo American's difficulty is that \"we almost have too many benchmarks and metrics to report against\". The most popular current standard is that of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Although comprehensive, the GRI's guidelines \"can look like a shopping list\" of numerous suggested metrics, says Mr Bickham. Rather \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 27 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Does your company formally report on its environmental and social impact and performance, as well as financial performance (known as Triple Bottom Line Reporting)? (% respondents) No, but we will do so within next five years No, and we have no plans to Yes 40 38 22 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. than providing a solution, the work is a starting point from which companies need to select what is relevant to them and then decide how to report on it. The issues of finding data, devising monitoring tools and getting stakeholder agreement still remain. Some companies are experimenting with alternatives. Mr Alexander explains that MolsonCoors decided not to produce a traditional CSR report, because it is \"not clear that these get widely read\". Data-driven ones, reliant on the GRI or other standards, also can hide the deeper story. \"Although aware of the standards, we wanted to look at the key issues to our stakeholders, consumers, owners and employees, to start with those, and build a report around how our business impacts those stakeholders.\" Accordingly, rather than producing a static document, MolsonCoors plans to relaunch its website, with new interactive details of its sustainability performance. Best practice is still clearly in flux. But as governments, especially in Europe, consider activists' demands for mandatory sustainability reporting, more companies should start addressing these issues. D. Turning values into processes Sustainability requires more than corporate values. Efficient individuals do not inevitably create efficient organisations: they need efficient processes too. Similarly, ethical individuals will not inevitably create ethical companies without the right structures. One challenge lies in integrating long-standing values into corporate behaviour. As Mr Vasella notes, \"thought about minimising negative impact has been around for a long time\". The change is that environmental and social impacts were not assessed so systematically before. Dr Bhombal of Aditya Birla agrees. Although his firm often tried to save energy for financial reasons in the past, all \"processes developed today are as efficient as possible from an emissions point of view. You can't do it the way you did it in the past.\" Similarly, on pollution, previously \"we cleaned up waste streams after the fact, now we are trying to design processes to avoid pollution\". All interviewees agreed that such thoroughgoing integration of financial, environmental and social goals is essential for successful corporate sustainability. As Dr Kendall of CLP Group says, \"You can't bolt this on and have a department in a closet thinking good thoughts and writing reports.\" Mr Prideaux of BAT insists that corporate behaviour, not philanthropy, is the right starting point. But creating such alignment throughout the company is not straightforward. At Anglo American, \"at the international big picture level,\" says Mr Bickham, \"we are increasingly getting toward that integration. Making certain that it happens consistently at every site remains more of a challenge.\" Traditional tools can help. One is money. \"It is very hard,\" Mr Kramer explains, \"to get people within the company to get it. Until it affects somebody's compensation and performance reviews, it won't appear as a serious priority for middle management. People are not sure if CEO speeches on CSR are PR nonsense or important: they look to compensation and performance reviews.\" Mr Garrido also believes that companies get what they create incentives for and measure. It is also sometimes possible consciously to structure sustainability into how the organisation operates, such as with Aditya Birla's energy efficient \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 28 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge How much of a challenge are the following when it comes to reporting on sustainability issues?

Such activity, Mr Potter believes, will not behind the media. A good Chain Management, McDonald's be successful unless firms have a robust, multi- example of where best practice stakeholder programme in every community in which may be headed, and the kind of they operate. \"A company could lose the forest for new challenges that sustainability is demanding the trees and not contribute, because they come in of business, is Anglo American's socio-economic with a pre-conceived notion of what is needed.\" In assessment toolbox (see case study Anglo American's fact, the largesse imposed by the company may be approach to social impact ). processes. Ms DeBiase says McDonald's has included a full-time sustainability person in its supply chain also stresses that programmes have to be owned by management. \"Sustainability needs a strong seat at \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 29 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Case study Anglo American's approach to social impact Several years ago, mining giant Anglo American was considering how to get appropriate information to improve its understanding of stakeholder perspectives and to improve its developmental impacts on the communities in which it operated. The company conducted social impact assessments when opening a new mine, or before a major expansion. But this was an initial step, rather than a repeated exercise. Edward Bickham, the company's Executive Vice President for External Affairs, explains that \"we were grappling with the difficulty of measuring in the social sphere. If you judge performance only by quantifiable metrics, you do it based on what you can measure, not what necessarily matters.\" The relevant information, however, is crucial in addressing social risks. The company piloted its socio - economic assessment toolbox (SEAT) process at three sites, in Australia, South Africa and Brazil. Since 2004 it has been used at over 60 locations, with feedback leading to an improved SEAT II in 2007. The SEAT process involves seven steps: i. Profile the Anglo operation. ii. Profile and engage with the community(ies) associated with the operation. iii. Identify and assess social and economic impacts, key local socio-economic development needs and existing social man - agement initiatives. iv. Improve the management of relationships with stakeholders and of socio-economic issues and impacts. v. Create initiatives for supporting community development. vi. Develop a management and monitoring plan. vii.Prepare a SEAT report and feed it back to stakeholders. The idea is not to reinvent the wheel\u2014where the necessary data are already available, for example, the process does not require that they be gathered again. And for each of these steps, the company has developed practices and tools to improve results. Step five, for example, which deals with community developments, has 11 tools to help with everything from establishing partnerships to small-scale water and sanitation projects. This does not mean the process involves the company identifying and fixing problems on its own. Consultation with community stakeholders and establishing part - nerships are absolutely essential and frequently repeated parts of the process. Although the company had already been covering some of this work in various ways, the introduction of a formalised process has been highly beneficial. \"By talking with stakeholders in a structured way,\" Mr Bickham says, \"we have understood more about the challenges around us, especially as we are putting social investment in place.\" This knowledge means that useful investment need not always be expensive. For example, simply moving one of its mine's fences to open land for livestock grazing helped everyone in the local area, and many of the action points arising out of these assessments revolve around basic improved communication. Anglo Brazil's sustainable development manager reported that simply running the consultation exercise improved the company's reputation among local people. Mr Bickham notes that SEAT assessment also allows a number of issues to surface. \"It is allowing us to understand the dynamics between stakeholders, as well as between ourselves and stakeholders, which did not come naturally to us before.\" Now, not only is Anglo American better informed than before, but SEAT is also helping it improve performance. The management and monitoring plan in step six involves, in part, development of local key performance indicators (with a relevant tool to help). And the report in step seven includes public commitments on improvements, such as water quality, as \"a key part of process\", adds Mr Bickham. He believes that this is a useful way of focusing management attention. The overall results of SEAT have been very positive\u2014so much so that Anglo American's board has made SEAT assessments mandatory every three years at all its operations. Although some of the social and environmental challenges of sustainability may force companies to deal with novel challenges, SEAT shows that using a business-like, process-driven approach can be as valuable here as in other areas. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 30 Chapter 4 Does sustainability pay? One perennial and unresolved debate about sustainability is whether taking it seriously improves financial results. Convincing data are elusive, although most people assume a small, positive relationship. Among survey respondents, 57% hold that the benefits of investing in these fields outweigh their cost. Also, although slightly more people expect such spending to yield a profit rather than a loss, of those for whom the question was relevant, 89% thought the effect either way would be slight. Mr Potter of Coca-Cola notes that demonstrating the link for an entire company would involve important measurement issues. \"I don't think that anyone has established the connection in accounting terms,\" he says. \"Much of this is based on faith, and a belief that there is a clear connection.\" Mr Prideaux of BAT agrees. The link is difficult to demonstrate mathematically, he says. \"It is an implicit one: if a business is not seen to be sustainable, it is unlikely to be highly valued. I'm absolutely convinced that it is there, but can't prove it. As far as costs are concerned, good behaviour doesn't cost much and, on the environmental side, if you use less raw material, you can save money.\" Mr Bickham says \"some parts of the agenda cost us money, and some help us to make money including in areas like energy efficiency.\" He says some people make \"Panglossian speeches\" about the benefits of anticipatory expenditure to further sustainable development, but the net financial effect can be in either direction. Our survey results indicate that, although it is no magic carpet to prosperity, attention to sustainability is consistent with, and may cause, higher share price growth and profits. The most striking data relate to differences in attitude towards sustainability between companies Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge with high share price growth\u2014of over 50% in the past three years, hereafter described as share price climbers\u2014and those whose value declined by more than 10% in that period (share price losers). Share price climbers put a greater emphasis on social and environmental considerations at board level. Share price climbers place higher importance on social and environmental goals, from improving human rights within supply chains (40% ranked this an important priority, compared with 18% of share price losers), through reducing greenhouse gases (38% compared with 24%), to developing products to address social or environmental problems (49% compared with 35%). Key points Companies that think they are doing well on sustainability are generally seeing better financial results than those who believe the opposite Sustainability itself has not yet become a major draw for investors A shift to so-called \"sustainability 2.0\" involves the possibility of exploiting new markets and opportunities Share price losers are 2.5 times more likely to have nobody in charge of sustainability: share price climbers usually give this task to the board or CEO. Sustainability also left the worst performers the most confused: their biggest impediments to progress in this area were poor management understanding, and lack of board responsibility (42% cite each); high growth companies instead face problems of implementation, such as finding the right targets, controls and processes (39%). So a correlation between a serious approach to sustainability and high share price growth exists, but is the link causal? According to our survey, the companies that adopted the highest number of sustainability policies had only marginally better profits than their peers. Instead, quality may matter more than quantity. When asked to rank themselves relative to peers on environmental and social performance, about 6% of respondents rated \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 31 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge themselves \"much better\" in both. The average net profit growth of this self-selected group was 16%, but share growth over the past three years reached 45%, well ahead of the average. At the other end of the scale, those companies that ranked themselves \"worse\" or \"much worse\" than their peers in social and environmental fields saw annual profit growth of just 7% and share price growth of 12% over three years. Although subjective ratings can be problematic, clearly companies that think they are doing well on sustainability are seeing dramatically better financial results than those who believe the opposite. The bottom line Despite this generally positive, or at worst neutral, picture about benefits and profits, concerns over cost remain an issue. The risk that sustainable practices would raise expenses relative to competitors was the most common impediment cited \"In the short term, there is by respondents to furthering absolutely no question that doing these policies (listed by 40%). these things better costs money. Mr Elkington of SustainAbility It's an investment. Over the long considers this apparent term it can be profitable.\" schizophrenia to be a timescale John Elkington, Founder and Chief issue. \"In the short term, there is Entrepreneur, SustainAbility absolutely no question that doing these things better costs money,\" he says. \"It's an investment. Over the longer term it can be profitable.\" The risks grow with the degree to which sustainability impacts the company, with a big gap between what Mr Elkington describes as modest housekeeping and market redefinition. The overall business case, then, may be no stronger than \"sustainability probably helps and at least it does not hurt\", but an attempt to find aggregate implications can hide important details. Sustainability is not a single process, but a change in how issues are approached, with numerous different practical results. Any business model variation has benefits and drawbacks and the overall results depend on execution as much as underlying ideas. Far more useful than searching for some overall net financial benefit is to look in detail at the economic opportunities sustainability provides. Cost reduction For nearly two decades companies have been finding that \"eco-efficiency\"\u2014a WBCSD-coined term from 1992\u2014and social sustainability can bring savings. DuPont, for example, has cut costs by US$2bn since 1990 through increased energy efficiency, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds. Substantial improvements can continue for a long time. Mr Vasella reports that Novartis, which has been increasing water and energy efficiency for several years, considered 32 environmental projects in 2006 \"which could save US$50m over ten years\". Multinational conglomerate 3M, after cutting energy intensity by 34% and saving US$82m in expenses between 2001 and 2005, achieved further reductions of 9% in 2006, saving an additional US$10m. Such benefits are often unexpected for the first companies addressing issues. Anglo American, for example, began offering HIV/AIDS testing and free anti-retroviral treatment in its South African mines in 2002. They now reach 65% of workers, with participation rates of over 90% in the company's best performing mines. \"We have surprised ourselves,\" says Mr Bickham. Not only is the programme probably slowing the pandemic among workers, but \"in the best operations it is becoming self-funding, through balancing savings from reduced absenteeism and preservation of skills\". Once potential savings are discovered, other firms would be sensible to adopt emerging best practice. Too few are. Mr Elkington notes that many companies are \"profligate\" when it comes to resource usage: \"Often companies audited on energy and water efficiency are shocked to see the state of affairs.\" Our survey bears this out. Although 55% of companies instituted policies to reduce energy consumption in the past five years\u2014the most common sustainability - 32 \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge related policy change\u201445% have not. The impact of these policies is also questionable: only 19% have measurably lower carbon emissions. Infrastructure may be an issue here. A survey of Asia-Pacific, American and European commercial real estate sectors by Jones Lang LaSalle, in collaboration with CoreNet Global, showed that in 41% of European and American executives see limited availability of sustainable real estate in some markets. Although more than 90% of respondents saw a cost premium associated with sustainable new buildings, 77% said they are willing to pay the premium to get energy cost savings and other benefits. Savings found elsewhere\u2014such as process standardisation\u2014might be greater, but aligning environmental, social and financial goals can cut costs, and more attention here would benefit many companies. Reputation and PR Another oft-cited benefit of sustainability policies is enhanced reputation, with knock-on effects for brand value and reduced reputational risk. Respondents to our survey considered this their leading objective: 79% ranked enhanced brand reputation as a \"very important\" goal for their programmes. Among the benefits they expected from these policies, they put first an opportunity to attract and retain customers (cited by 37%), and fourth the ability to manage reputational risk (29%). Similarly, 18% of firms thought that most of their customers would pay extra for \"a brand renowned for its commitment to sustainable development\", and a further 37% thought that at least a \"significant minority\" of customers would pay more. Seeking such benefits is perfectly legitimate. And why not, asks Pierre Poret, Head of the OECD's Investment Division. \"This is not incompatible with behaving responsibly. It's just fine if they capitalise on the positive impact on their reputations\" if they are actually behaving sustainably, he argues. The leading sustainability-related focus by far among respondents was not any particular social or environmental issue, but rather communicating performance to investors and stakeholders: 61% considered this an important priority, including even 39% of the worst performers. Similarly, when asked what they were doing right on sustainability, 12% rated communication of their efforts as outstanding, and 30% as very good, far higher than any other activity. Reputational benefits from sustainability certainly exist. At a basic level, good credentials here can be essential for a social, and sometimes literal, licence to operate. Dr James Suzman of De Beers explains that the diamond industry as a whole \"recognises that our survival depends on us being able to ensure that the consumer \"A reputation for fair dealing proposition is not interfered with makes a difference. Going to by awkward ethical questions\". another country, governments are Mr Rosling of Tata believes that more likely to welcome us. It does acting sustainably is both right to matter.\" do, and also smart, as the firm is Alan Rosling, Executive Director and Board then welcomed in the community Member, Tata Group and people trust it. \"A reputation for fair dealing makes a difference,\" he says. \"Going to another country, governments are more likely to welcome us. It does matter.\" Brand value is also key. Mr Stigson says, \"at a normal global company, the majority of the assets underpinning market capital are intangibles. That is a different story than in the past. The business case for sustainability is now increasingly connected to brand and reputation.\" Reaping these benefits, however, is neither straightforward, nor easy. First, empty claims rarely fool anyone. Even 71% of those surveyed agree that \"too many organisations use sustainability merely as a public relations tool\"\u2014just 5% demurred. Second, pursuing sustainable policies simply to garner good reputation is bad business strategy. Mr Menzinger of Swiss Re explains that such motivation makes it \"very uncertain whether you are going to keep going down that road if the key individuals, such as the CEO, change\". Moreover, it will be unclear where to focus\u2014 \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 33 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge If you have or are developing a strategy for corporate sustainability, how important is it to your company that this strategy meets the following objectives? (% respondents, only those selecting \"Critically important\" are shown) Increasing revenues 43 Enhancing brand reputation 42 Compliance with regulatory and legal obligations 41 Generating value for shareholders/investors 38 Reducing costs 29 Managing risks associated with sustainability issues 28 Attracting/retaining customers concerned about environmental or social issues 25 Differentiating products 23 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. especially as popular mores are not fixed. \"These issues are shifting from country to country and year to year,\" says Mr Kell at the Global Compact. \"Currently it is climate change, last year it was poverty.\" What might win praise one year could easily seem inconsequential, or an embarrassment, the next. Finally, sustainability's reputational advantages are equivocal. A good record only goes so far. Mr Potter Mr Potter of Coca-Cola sees little public relations benefit beyond the hope that moderate activists will wait to hear Coca-Cola's side of the story before condemning it for an alleged incident. More broadly he says, \"there is no getting around the fact that we are symbolic of potentially three things: globalisation, multinationals, and America.\" Accordingly some people will condemn his business whatever it does. Others go further and argue that a good record can itself also attract problems. Mr Kell believes that \"a psychological element\" stops companies from claiming sustainability successes. \"When you say you are best in class, you open yourself up to scrutiny,\" he notes. This is such a problem that Ms Nelson of Harvard thinks \"companies are worried about trumpeting their own efforts or they will get slapped down by NGOs and journalists. I'd be amazed if I could identify one company that said that it was doing right.\" Mr Rosling notes from experience that \"the bigger your reputation, the more willing people are to have a go at you. Sometimes it feels as if people are going for us because we are nice, have a reputation, and may cave in easily to make the attacks to go away.\" Although critics may sometimes have a point, on other occasions \"you have to stand tall if some bully tries to go for you\". Mr Menzinger sums up the best approach: \"It doesn't hurt to take into account that sustainability may help your reputation, but if that is your sole goal, it will not be sustainable in the long run.\" Instead, companies should \"treat reputational benefits as a positive side effect\". Investor attraction Another suggested financial benefit of sustainability is the attraction it might have for investors\u2014both the specialist socially responsible investment (SRI) community and more mainstream ones. The direct practical impact of the former on companies is comparatively small. Only 3% of respondents rated the ability to be listed in ethical/low-carbon indices as a leading benefit of \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 34 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge their sustainability policies. Mr Elkington, who has worked for 15 years with a variety of SRI funds, is not surprised. \"I think they've done great work, and helped wake up investor relations people, but the total amount of money moved by SRI is still very small and relatively volatile.\" On the other hand, he says, \"companies are quite proud to say things like 'we are in the Dow Jones leaders category', but this sits at a brand enhancement level\". Mr Arbogast of Dell finds the biggest benefit of his meetings with the SRI community is the chance to discuss performance and best practice rather than easier access to funds. Mr Menzinger, who sees a strong business case for Swiss Re to consider various environmental and social issues when selecting investments, is \"a little bit sceptical, to be perfectly honest\" about sustainability ratings. In his view, they are too backward-looking and not necessarily based on criteria relevant to the financial outlook for a company. Far more important is how more mainstream investors approach sustainability. FSG's Mr Kramer considers this a key issue: \"Investor behaviour drives a lot of business behaviour and the weight of the investment community is not yet there.\" Similarly, Ahold's Mr Waardenburg senses that the number of investors interested in seeing sustainability data and performance is rapidly increasing, but it is a small segment in the market. Our survey backs these impressions. On the one hand, 58% agreed that investors would increasingly reward companies with above-average performance in this area, and 34% considered increased shareholder value a leading benefit of sustainability. On the other hand, only about one in five said their shareholders would be playing a leading role in setting sustainability strategy, and 29% ranked the short-term focus of investors as one of the biggest barriers to progress in the field. Such apparent contradictions arise when investors are considered a monolithic bloc. Mr Elkington delineates \"different trophic levels in the financial ecosystem\", with reinsurers, insurers and pension funds showing greater sensitivity to long-term issues, and financial analysts\u2014\"often working on nano-second time scales\"\u2014struggling to appreciate their significance. Also, the correlation between sustainability and share price growth indicates that many companies with active programmes are having no trouble getting funds. Investors in a company know how the company is run when they put money in. For Mr Garrido (GE) and Mr Alexander (MolsonCoors), the values surrounding, and approach to, sustainability form part of what makes their companies worth buying into. \"Our investors understand that,\" says Mr Alexander. \"They may not be demanding sustainability results, but they expect us to make decisions that sustain the investment in the long run.\" Sustainability 2.0 In the past, corporate sustainability pioneers were as often defending themselves against reputational or regulatory risk as looking for value. Cost reduction, reputational benefits and increased attractiveness to investors brought limited financial gains. Now, however, leading companies are moving from \"sustainability \"It doesn't hurt to take into 1.0 to sustainability 2.0\", as some describe it. The latter involves exploiting the markets and opportunities that an account that sustainability may help your reputation, but if that is your sole goal, it will not be sustainable in the long run.\" understanding of the issues, and Ivo Menzinger, Group Head of Sustainability of the consumer reaction to them, and Emerging Risk Management, Swiss Re presents. Among the best-known examples of this trend is GE's Ecomagination product range\u2014with products varying from low-energy light bulbs to car and truck fleet services. It added US$12bn to the bottom line in 2006, a figure expected to reach US$20bn by 2010. Mr Garrido admits that it is a surprise to see such benefits arising from a simple idea. \"We came to the conclusion that we can make money by facing environmental challenges, because our customers are demanding it.\" After consulting consumers, environmentalists \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 35 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge and other stakeholders, GE saw that the needs of some sustainability challenges matched what existing products could provide and new products could be developed to meet other problems. \"It was a no - brainer,\" says Mr Garrido. \"We always believed that providing such products was the right thing to do,\" he says. \"Now, it is not only consistent with our values, but we can make money out of it. If other companies don't see that, then that's even better for us.\" Generally speaking, though, companies have started to realise the possible opportunities that exist here. Mr Kramer believes that they \"are only just beginning to consider CSR as a competitive advantage and move beyond defensiveness. It will get much, much more common\". Our survey suggests that the desire is there, but not necessarily the ability. Just over one-half (51%) of respondents say developing products that address social or environmental problems is an important priority going forward, a higher figure than for reducing greenhouse gas output. But far fewer, just 32%, thought they had done well in this area recently. The International Business Leaders Forum's Mr Hodges, author of Corporate Social Opportunity, describes many companies as being at the aspirational stage. They \"don't necessarily have the right processes in place to make it a normal part of the business cycle,\" he says. \"Do you have the right skill sets inside the business to understand how social trends may impact the business?\" Relationships with community institutions or organisations in developing-country markets or open communications channels with socially conscious young consumers in developed countries, can provide new insights compared to more traditional sources of intelligence for research and development (R&D). Indeed, exploiting these market opportunities requires not so much the invention of novel products, however helpful, as cultural change to align internal economic, social and environmental thinking. Mr Menzinger points out that Swiss Re's insurance products designed to address global warming risks take no carbon out of the atmosphere, but they did arise from an understanding of the issue. In other words, although the challenges differ in each sector, the possibilities of sustainability 2.0 are open to all firms once they focus on them. GE's Ecomagination may have started with energy-saving products, but it has now moved on to items such as credit cards where up to 1% of net purchases are set aside each month and will be used to buy carbon offsets every year on Earth Day. In assessing the financial benefits of such market-seeking sustainability, it is difficult to go beyond the anecdotal. It is noteworthy, though, that among surveyed companies with the worst share performance, the leading benefit of sustainability was defensive\u2014the ability to identify and manage reputational risk (cited by 45%). Share price climbers instead focused on improved shareholder value (47%) and the ability to attract new customers (35%). Although leading companies are finding profits from sustainability, it would be a mistake to see it as an optional route to wealth for some. The risks of not addressing these issues are also great. Mr Elkington, for example, expects that the changes likely to be imposed in the wake of climate change will initiate a period of experimentation. \"If businesses think this is going to be easy, they are deluded,\" he says, \"Creative destruction pressures are going to elbow out of markets a huge number of companies.\" Mr Menzinger is one of the few executives interviewed to stress straightforward strategic thinking rather than underlying values. \"[Firms] need to approach sustainability from a business angle. From a risk and opportunity perspective, what does it mean?\" he asks. \"People think of it as corporate citizenship rather than thinking about it as affecting their business model.\" One example he gives was the relatively sudden decision to ban incandescent lighting in some countries, something which will clearly affect its manufacturers. Awareness of sustainability issues may become not an additional business tool, but a key to survival in 21st century markets. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 36 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Limits of the business case Interviewees for this report caution against placing too much weight on building a business case for sustainability. Mr Rosling of Tata says, \"I don't think we have a business case for what we do\". Owned by charitable trusts, the group's raison d'\u00eatre is ultimately to improve society. \"[Sustainability] is in the business interests of Tata companies, but that is not the reason why they do it. It is right to do it. Anyone producing a business case would be shown the door,\" he says. \"What we do is manage it in a strict businesslike way, and we certainly budget and plan fully for it.\" More traditionally owned firms are Case study View from 30,000 ft: Virgin Atlantic Although corporate interpretations of sustainability encompass everything from monitoring labour standards in suppliers' factories to promoting ethnic diversity in the workplace, for Virgin Atlantic Airways, one issue domi - nates the agenda: climate change. \"We have environmen - tal targets that include other resources like water,\" says Jill Brady, General Counsel at Virgin Atlantic, who is in charge of sustainability. \"But climate change is certainly the biggest focus for us.\" Part of the reason for that focus is consumer perceptions. Although the airline industry contributes a relatively small proportion of the world's man-made greenhouse gases and aircraft engines are now about 70% more efficient than they were 40 years ago, environmental campaigners have been joined by the public in putting aviation under the spotlight. \"In the UK there is a perception that aviation is one of the biggest causes of climate change, and that's driven by NGOs and the media,\" says Ms Brady. \"It's one we all have to deal with whether it's right or not.\" However, although the contribution of airlines to climate change is currently small, it is increasing. \"The industry is recognising that it is a polluter,\" says Ms Brady. \"So while we're a relatively small polluter, we're growing and that's something the industry has to deal with.\" And it is not only individual consumers that want to see airlines address climate change. Ms Brady says many of Virgin's corporate clients are pushing the company in this area in order to reduce their own carbon footprint. \"We know a lot of customers are interested in what we're doing in relation to climate change,\" she says. \"And corporate customers certainly are. A large proportion of the tenders they send in for business contain questions around sustainability impact.\" As a result, Virgin Atlantic has been addressing its carbon footprint in a number of areas. For a start, at the group level, the Virgin Green Fund (formerly Virgin Fuels) is investing in companies developing renewable and alternative energy sources, as well as in companies working on technologies that generate fuel efficiency. The initiative is part of Sir Richard Branson's pledge\u2014made at the 2006 Clinton Global Initiative meeting\u2014to invest US$3bn of the profits made in the next ten years from his transport businesses in efforts to combat climate change. As well as such group-level initiative, Virgin Atlantic itself has set a target of improving fuel efficiency by 30% by 2020. Initiatives range from the development of alternative fuels to aircraft acquisitions\u2014introducing the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the fleet, which is 27% more efficient than its current aircraft. It is also enhancing working to enhance engine efficiency and investigating more regular polishing of fan blades. Along with this, the airline is reducing fuel consumption on the ground by shutting engines down in queues, towing aircraft at airports and plugging aircraft into ground power sources while stationary to avoid running engines simply to keep the air-conditioning and other equipment running. A \"Weight Watchers\" team works on eliminating unnecessary equipment onboard and ensuring that new products designed to go on board are made of lightweight materials. However, for Virgin, the savings on fuel costs mean its sustainability efforts soon pay for themselves. \"A lot of what we were doing already around fuel efficiency and being an efficient business fits well with the sustainability agenda,\" she says. \"This has given us another lever to engage people and has put more urgency around some of the targets.\" \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 37 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge \"If you are going to do this because surprisingly similar. Mr Potter it is about values, it doesn't mean of Coca-Cola and Mr Bickham of you can't do this because it is good Anglo American both think that for the business. Any CEO should the data for the business case be able to articulate both cases.\" are not there. Instead, what is Jane Nelson, Director of the CSR Initiative, driving change at Coca-Cola is \"a Harvard's Kennedy School of Government broad philosophical\" commitment to sustainable communities. Meanwhile, Mr Bickham believes that \"in our business, sustainability is a threshold requirement\", with any competitive gain staying \"at the margins\". Dr Kendall of CLP says that its retrofitting of power stations to reduce emissions \"is nothing to do with competition in the market. It is our stakeholders' and regulators' expectation that this is correct thing to do in the community.\" Her company is not addressing climate issues \"to make a quick dollar or out-position competitors. We see it as the right thing to do.\" Ironically, other stakeholders seem more likely to play up the business opportunities of sustainability than corporate executives. Mr Juniper, from Friends of the Earth, often surprises companies by telling them \"climate change is the biggest business opportunity in history\". Indeed, non-profit organisations understand perfectly well the importance of the market to broader sustainability efforts. Mr Waardenburg says NGOs frequently encourage him to make sure his programmes make money, because \"without a profit for us, it is not going to be sustainable\". Thus companies point to ethics, leaving the defence of Mammon to NGOs. Ms Nelson sees this as \"a false dichotomy and a false debate. If you are going to do this because it is about values, it doesn't mean you can't do this because it is good for the business. Any CEO should be able to articulate both cases.\" Nevertheless, sustainability debates often focus on the financial case for two reasons. First, as Mr Stigson points out, \"self-interest is very much connected to market solutions and much easier to implement\". The moral questions at the core of sustainability are simply harder. Second, the public may consider corporate talk of values overblown. Mr Kramer says, \"I'm not sure anybody believes business if they claim to be virtuous.\" But there is another element, encompassing sustainable development, that often gets too little attention. Perhaps because Milton Friedman's dictum that \"the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits\" was used to oppose CSR, even corporate discussions of sustainability tend to focus on the social and environmental. Business's contribution to society is, however, undeniably economic\u2014ultimately providing the money for almost all social and environmental progress. Dr James Suzman cites De Beers' joint venture with Botswana's government. The latter receives US$1.6bn in dividends, about 50% of the national budget. \"As a direct result, Botswana has gone from third-lowest on UN development indices to near the top,\" says Dr Suzman. This is a tiny but striking example of how, in Ms Nelson's words, \"the greatest business contribution to society is creating wealth\". Noting the dearth of references to this area in the vast majority of CSR reports, she thinks \"business has been its own worst enemy in some ways. Much of the CSR debate has been shaped by activists, NGOs and the media.\" A proper understanding of the Triple Bottom Line requires greater appreciation of the benefits arising from the original bottom line. Whatever the merits of the business case for sustainability, the sustainability case for business is unquestionably far stronger. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 38 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Chapter 5 What will deliver: Markets or regulation? How far can business's sustainability efforts go to improve the world's physical, social and political environment? And where should the line be drawn between the responsibilities of individual businesses and the responsibilities of government? Obviously, companies can do a lot, especially in their areas of expertise. When asked about the state's proper role, however, respondents gave an unusual reply for a business survey. A large proportion, 40%, believe that more government regulation is necessary if society wants to change the impact of business in social and environmental areas. Half of executives polled held that, although consumer and investor demands leading to voluntary business action would be the more effective route to change, state regulation in certain fields would nevertheless be necessary. Even North America, traditionally a more free-enterprise culture, had similar numbers. Why do companies think that markets alone are insufficient? First, as Mr Alexander of MoltonCoors notes, to be successful, \"sustainability has to embrace consumers as well\". As discussed earlier, 46% of respondents listed their firm's customers as the stakeholders with the greatest influence over their sustainability policies, tied with government as the leading choice. Although people as citizens are making clear their support, the same individuals as economic actors are displaying less straightforward behaviour. Customer influence has geographic variations, with consumers having a far greater effect in Europe. Moreover, among companies for which it was relevant, only 10 - 15% thought the majority of their customers would pay a premium for greener products, ethical sourcing or socially responsible investment. About 40% thought that a significant minority of buyers would do so, but the general consensus was that few consumers would support values with their wallets. This range of behaviour has predictably had an uneven market impact. Some firms, such as GE, have made money from developing more sustainable products. Ms Brady says that for Virgin Atlantic, quite simply, \"It is a competitive issue, because consumers are interested to see what big businesses are going to do about this.\" At Dell, Mr Arbogast notes that \"many of the strategic initiatives around sustainability are a direct reaction to customer feedback\", including those involving energy efficiency and product recovery. \"Part of sustainability's focus here is driven by customer needs,\" he says. Companies as diverse as McDonald's and De Beers noticed increased consumer interest in different sustainability issues going back to the 1990s. Now says Mr Langert, \"customers care more about this than ever\". Professor Pan at The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences even sees a rising interest What is your view on the role of regulation in relation to reducing companies' environmental and social impact? Please check one answer only. (% respondents) Voluntary business action 50 Key points Perhaps surprisingly, a large proportion of firms believe that more government regulation is needed Collaboration between business, government and society is critical Governments are often constrained in their ability or desire to act, whether owing to a lack of political will, limited power, or a simple lack of know-how is generally more effective. Governments may need to regulate in some specific areas, but the markets/consumers will reward those firms acting well and penalise those doing poorly More government regulation is necessary if society wants to change business in this area More regulation will not be effective and/or could impede economic growth 40 10 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit survey, October 2007. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 39 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge among Chinese consumers. But companies that are equally active on sustainability issues have had different experiences. Carl Kitchen, Public Affairs Manager at Hong Kong- based CLP Group, notes that the firm's Australian power customers only began to drive demand for renewable energy within the past 18 months. \"Until then, it wasn't there,\" he says. His colleague, Dr Kendall, adds that in the power sector, the customers are not quite there yet. Only \"a small percentage are asking for low carbon industry\", she says, noting that \"markets in India and China will not pay the extra costs of clean energy without government or international support\". If uneven customer demand makes markets an imperfect, albeit still powerful, tool for societal change, so does the limited power \"Most of the time we are ahead of of corporations themselves. what they set as a target anyway. Companies cannot always bring It is more an opportunity to work about environmental or social with governments, and to show improvement on their own, and the alternative ways to do things.\" novelty of co-operative solutions Roland Waardenburg, Director of Corporate poses its own potential legal risks, Social Responsibility, Ahold as noted earlier with the FFC. It would be far simpler for companies if the state dealt with these questions. In our survey, 62% agree\u2014and only 10% disagree\u2014 that uncertainty over government policy \"is making it difficult to plan strategies for corporate sustainability\". Businesses are even beginning to lobby for regulation: the best example is the US Climate Action Partnership, a club that counts some of the country's biggest blue-chips among its members, which is pushing for mandatory carbon emission caps. A good regulatory framework could do much to address the confusion that surrounds what is expected of businesses. The OECD's new Policy Framework for Investment outlines one of the top goals of public policy in this area as \"providing an enabling environment which clearly defines respective roles of government and business\", and asks states whether they \"actively assume [their] responsibilities and avoid de facto privatisation of public roles\". The OECD's Mr Poret adds that government and business responsibility go hand in hand. Companies are not, however, seeking highly proscriptive regulation. On climate change, for example, many agree with Mr Rosling of Tata that \"the best long-term solution is likely to be market- based, but you can't have market solutions without a government-designed system. You need incentives to reduce your carbon footprint because it is much cheaper to have non-sustainable energy.\" Mr Stigson (WBCSD) adds that \"it is important to recognise that there is no inherent conflict between markets and regulation\". In fact, leading companies can benefit from working with governments on regulations. Mr Waardenburg explains that his firm does not feel threatened when discussing sustainability issues with the EU. \"Most of the time we are ahead of what they set as a target anyway. It is more an opportunity to work with governments, and to show alternative ways to do things. Sometimes they tend to say very specifically how to do what, but we can suggest better ways.\" In Dell's case this involved helping Texas create mandatory computer recycling based on the company's voluntary experience. Still, governments are taking some action\u2014and this does not necessarily always mean legislation or imposed regulation.Mr Poret points out that \"there are other ways of communicating expectations: such as joint regulation, self-regulation and soft law\". Such communication can also take place within the workplace, with local communities, with trade unions, through discussions with investors, dialogue with other civil society organizations, via the press and so forth. For these other communication processes to work well, governments have the responsibility to protect the human and other rights framework. Although the various strategies that each state chooses \"may look multiple, they are all underpinned by the same values and principles\", 40 \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge on which there is broad agreement among OECD and partner countries. He notes, for example, that beyond the OECD's core membership, Brazil and nine additional countries have adopted its Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises . These not only provide a detailed and comprehensive set of voluntary standards and principles of responsible business conduct but also require adhering governments to institute national contact points, which handle and conciliate complaints over alleged violations, a facility used some 160 times by interested parties since the revision of the Guidelines in 2000. In Mr Poret's view, sustainability will advance through \"a combination of both markets and proscription, with the balance changing all the time\". Reluctant governors A certain irony arises from the current views of stakeholders on that balance. Mr Stigson notes that \"governments are proponents of market solutions, and business is saying we want some regulation. From the outside, it can look pretty confusing.\" Mr Juniper of Friends of the Earth has noticed the same dynamic: \"There is now a reversal of roles.\" Government is arguing for a market role, but companies are moving away from a knee-jerk opposition to regulation and encouraging it. In fact, for Friends of the Earth, instead of focusing on helping business change themselves, now \"the bulk of our effort with them is in seeking to get companies to change their regulatory environment,\" says Mr Juniper. Government reluctance to take firmer action may be owing to a number of things. In some cases, like companies, its powers are limited. In China, for example, Professor Pan notes that, whatever the central government's wishes, \"institutions need to be built step by step. Local governments are very powerful and work together with factory owners in a way that hurts the environment, because they want revenue.\" Ms Ulrich adds that, although China's policies reflect its growing recognition that the country has paid too high an environmental cost for its development, the central government will increasingly face demands from localities for compensation of economic losses they suffer to comply with stricter environmental rules. This, she says, will slow the process of reform, but not derail it. More than power, Mr Stigson points to a lack of political will. Governments \"don't want to regulate consumer behaviour\" because it is too fraught with political danger, he says, \"but you won't be able to get away from that if you want to create a sustainable world\". In Mr Juniper's experience, beliefs play as big a role as politics in explaining the difference. \"Governments are ideological and companies are quite practical. I get the impression that carbon trading is used by the UK government as a tool which fits the ideology rather than doing the job. There is no debate on what works. Companies don't do that. You are starting to see some saying we need a different mix of tools.\" Our survey suggests that, whether for ideological or practical considerations, the will to act within the public sector is not great: only 48% of respondents within government thought that more regulation was essential for change, and 42% considered voluntary action, along with some state help, as the best way forward. Another cause for a lack of government appetite to regulate may be that civil servants are as confused as everyone else. In looking at their own organisations, 43% considered a lack of management understanding as a major impediment to the pursuit of goals in this area, 17% had nobody in charge of these issues, and fully 46% had no plans to report on environmental or social performance\u2014all figures well above the business averages. If governments are going to mandate change for companies, then they must set their own houses in order as well. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 41 Doing good Business and the sustainability challenge Conclusion The debate over the role of the state and business leads back full circle to the definition of sustainability and the reason why it has become such a pressing issue. Although currently being driven by growing anxiety over the impact of climate change, the underlying questions about the relationship of business with the world's societies\u2014developed and developing\u2014have been given a new urgency by the impact of globalisation. The social and environmental benefits of sustainable business practices are what governments and citizens are likely to demand in return for an open world economy. Sustainability is not, however, a check list of activities. It is a change in attitude that aligns financial, social and environmental goals. Fortunately, businesses rarely need to establish clear values for themselves. Instead, they need to apply the ones they have. In practice, companies are defining sustainability widely, looking at a range of relevant environmental and social goals. The specific form that sustainability policies take, however, will inevitably be shaped by differing drivers and needs\u2014economic and regulatory, as well as environmental and social\u2014 around the world, leading to a bewildering range of activities involving every function within business. Although a few companies have a long history of addressing sustainability issues, business as a whole is still, as Mr Potter of Coca-Cola puts it, at the \"baby steps stage\", scrambling to address the issues and experiencing the pains inherent in learning to master a new area. The necessary rethinking of business models, is \"very, very tough to do\", notes Mr Elkington of SustainAbility. Four key areas currently receiving too little attention within business are: leadership; supply chains; reporting and metrics; and the transformation of values into processes. At present, weaknesses in one or another of these will condemn too many companies to poor performance in this area. This presents more than a social or environmental problem. The financial benefits of sustainability remain unclear, but an understanding of where the economic advantages are\u2014in particular cost reduction and a range of untapped market opportunities\u2014can be very helpful to profits. Perhaps more important, as the social and environmental forces driving sustainability reshape the global economy, an inability to understand and perform in this area could be fatal for businesses. Neither business, nor government, nor any other stakeholder, can meet these challenges on its own (indeed, many seem to wish that somebody else will do it for them). If they are to be addressed, however, it will be through a messy period of redefining, among other things, business's relationship with the world around it, as well as the legal and regulatory framework in which it operates. Companies must, at the very least, be part of that debate, for their own sakes as well as for that of society as a whole. In the end, sustainability will require changes, but not perhaps those the public expects. Businesspeople have long realised that the image of an immoral private sector motivated only by greed is a caricature, and a poor one at that. Most think that their economic activity serves the public good. Moreover, the executives interviewed for this study held that corporate values were not window-dressing, but at the core of what their firms did. The innovation that sustainability demands is to integrate these values into the structures, processes and incentives that mould behaviour inside companies. Social and environmental initiatives should not be something that firms do in addition to making profit: instead, they should become a central part of the strategy for corporate prosperity. \u00a9 The Economist Intelligence Unit 2008 42 01 Appendix: Survey results Doing good Business and the sustainability challange Appendix: Survey results In September and October 2007, The Economist Intelligence Unit surveyed 1,254 executives from around the world.
