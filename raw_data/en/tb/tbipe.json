Vaccination and booster appointments are available at a number of pediatric primary care clinics throughout the region. Children and teens ages 6 months to 17 years should be accompanied by a parent or guardian. What You Need to Know about Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination and Boosters - Kids ages 6 months and older can get the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. - The number of shots needed to complete the primary vaccine series, depends on your child's age, health and which vaccine they get. Some children ages 5+ who have a weakened immune system need additional primary does. Ask your child's pediatrician how many does your child needs. - After completing the primary vaccine series, the CDC recommends boosters for children ages 5+ who are eligible. Updated boosters that offer additional protection are now available. Use the [CDC's COVID-19 booster tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#when-you-can-get-booster)to find out if and when your child can get a booster. - It's a good idea to drink plenty of water and eat a meal before getting a vaccine. - At vaccination appointments, masks are required and must cover the mouth and nose. Masks should not be work by children under 2 years old. - Plan to stay for 15 minutes after your child gets their shot. This is a safety guideline set by the CDC. We encourage children and teens to bring items to keep busy during this time. "}
