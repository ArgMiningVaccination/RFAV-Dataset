The word Yoga is derived from Sanskrit word 'Yog', which means 'Jod' in Hindi or 'Joining' in English. This is joining of 'Jivatam ' (Human) with 'Parmatma ' (God). Through the pracice of Yoga, one can have Self-realisa ion and achieve God. 'Yog' word became Yoga in English. For a simple person, Yoga is another form of physical exercise. By doing physical exercises, one can develop only body muscles. But through Yoga, one achieves the condiioning of even all the internal organs like - heart, brain, spleen, liver, lungs, intesines, etc. Apart from these vital organs, through Yoga all the glands, like - thyroid, pituitary and penial gland of the brain, funcion better. Fig. Yoga Pose [Type text] [Type text] Page 9 Fig. Human Body Parts that are Positively Eected by Yoga Yoga Yoga is practical aid, not a religion. Yoga is an ancient art based on a harmonizing system for development of the body, mind, and spirit. The regular practice of yoga will not only lead you to a sense of peace and well -being, but will also give you a feeling of being at one with the nature. In the present time, more and more people, especially the Westerners, are resorting to Yoga to find a cure for chronic health problems and attain a peace of mind. They are also curious about knowing what exactly is Yoga and what all are included in it. Although many of us are well aware of the health benefits of Yoga, not everyone knows about the origin and exact definition of Yoga. It is a popular belief that Yoga merely includes stretching and warm up exercises.

It involves the practice of physical postures and poses, which is also referred to as 'asana' in Sanskrit. As the name suggests, the ultimate aim of practising Yoga is to create a balance between the body and the mind and to attain self-enlightenment. To accomplish it, Yoga makes use of different movements, breathing exercises, relaxation technique, and meditation. Yoga is associated with a healthy and lively lifestyle with a balanced approach. The oldest physical discipline in existence known to humanity, the Yoga brings stability to the body and the wavering mind. It increases the lubrication of joints, ligaments, and tendons of the body. Studies in the field of medicine suggest that Yoga is the only form of physical activity that provides complete conditioning to the body because it massages all the internal organs and glands. It reduces the risk of many diseases. Yoga can create a permanently positive difference to the lifestyle of anybody practicing it on a regular basis. Yoga is a perfect way to ensure overall health and physical fitness. Through meditation, breathing exercises (called pranayams); you can banish all your stress and lead a healthy life. In fact, it is one of the best remedies known to humankind, for curing chronic ailments that are otherwise difficult to be cured by other medications. People suffering from backaches and arthritis are often suggested to do asanas that concentrate on the exercise of the muscles at the strategic locations. Pranayamas are the best breathing exercises to increase the capacity of lungs. The amazing thing about Yoga is that its positive effects on the health and mind are visible over time. Another specialty about Yoga is its wide choice of asanas. Depending upon the stamina and overall health, you can choose from the mild pranayamas and asanas to high -intensity asanas. It is a medication without the actual use of medicines. Moreover, no visible side effects are associated with the practice of Yoga on a regular basis. All you need to know is the most appropriate asanas according to the ability and structure of your body. Also, you need to know the right way of performing the asanas, because any wrong attempt can cause sprains and injuries. Conscious connection to something allows us to feel and experience that thing, person, or experience. The experience of connection is a state of yoga, a joyful and blissful, fulfilling experience. There is no single definition of yoga. To experience truth through yoga, we must study its classical definitions and reflect on our understanding of it. If we wish to connect to the intuitive, creative part of us and realize the eternal Self, we need to consider what yoga really is. Each definition of yoga reveals a part of the ocean of knowledge and experience that forms the yogic path. Fig. .

Describe the history & evoluion of Yoga 3. Describe the journey of Yoga from India to the World 4. Explain the contribuion of Yog Gurus in spreading Yoga to the World The land of Y oga The scien ce of Yoga ha s its origin thous ands of years ago, long before the rst religion or belief systems were born. According to Yogic lore, Shiva is seen as the rst yogi or diyogi and the rst guru or diguru. Several thousand years ago, on the banks of Lake Kanisarovar in the Himalayas, diyogi poured his profound knowledge into the legendary saptarishis or \"seven sages\". These sages carried this powerful Yogic science to dierent parts of the world including Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa and South America. Interesingly, modern scholars have noted and marvelled at the close parallels found between ancient cultures across the globe. However, it was in India that the Yogic system found its fullest expression. Agastya, the saptarishi who travelled across the Indian subconinent, crafted this culture around a core Yogic way of life. Fig. India - Land of Yoga Yoga is widely considered as an \"immortal cultural outcome\" of the Indus -Saraswa i Valley Civilisa ion daing back to 2700 BC - and has proven itself to cater to both material and spiritual uplift of humanity. A number of seals and fossil remains of Indus -Saraswa i Valley Civilisa ion with Yogic moif s and gures performing Yoga sdhana suggest the presence of Yoga in ancient India. The seals and idols of Mother Goddess are sugges ive of Tantra Yoga. [Type text] Paricipan t Handbook History and Evoluion of Yoga There are many theories associated with Yoga. It is mentioned in Rig Veda, and its evidence was found in the oldest civilization of Indus -Saraswati, which is considered to be more than 5000 years old (3000 B.C.), it means Yoga is older than 5000 years. It was invented by 'Rishi Munis' for doing meditation, but apart from that, it has a very good effect on the body. During the journey of more than 5000 years, Yoga evolved in many forms. As explained earlier, mainly it has following four paths - Janan Yoga Bhakti Yoga Karma Yoga Raj Yoga After Veda Period, the great 'Mahrishi Patanjali' created systems in Yoga. He created text which was named as 'Patanjali Yog Sutras'. Although many other Sages or 'Rishis' contributed in the development of Yoga, but the effect of 'Maharishi Patanjali' is greatest. Due to that evolution of Yoga is divided in to the following periods - 1. Pre-Patanjali Period (Before 500 BC) 2. Patanjali Period (500 BC to 800 AD) 3. Post Patanjali Period (800 AD onwards) The presence of Yoga is also available in folk tradiions, Vedic and Upanishadic Yoga was being praciced in the pre- Vedic period, the great sage Maharishi systemaised and codi ed the then exising Yogic pracices, its meaning, and its related knowledge through Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. After Patanjali, many sages and Yoga masters contributed greatly to the preserva ion and development of the eld through well -documented pracices and literature. Yoga has spread to all over the world by the teachings of eminent Yoga masters from ancient imes to the present date. Today, everybody has convic ion about Yoga prac ices towards the preven ion of disease, maintenance, and promoion of health. Millions and millions of people across the globe have bene ted from Yoga, and the pracice of Yoga is blossoming and growing more vibrant with each passing day. [Type text] [Type text] Page 13 Fig.. Maharishi Patanjali 1- Pre-Patanjali Period (Before 500 BC) - It is also called as Veda Era since all Veda and Upanishads were written during this period. Veda - These are the text which contains hymns, philosophy, and guidance for life. These are written in Sanskrit, which is considered to be the mother of all languages. The writer of Vedas are unknown, and it is considered to be the oldest written documents by a human. There are four Vedas - 1- Rigveda 2- Yajurveda 3- Atharvav da 4- Samveda Upanishads - Meaning of Upanishads is Sitting down on feet' which means getting 'shiksha' or education. These are the essence of Vedas. There are more than 200 Upanishads available. Fig. 1.2.3. 'Pandulipi' of Veda 2- Patanjali Period (500 BC to 800 AD) - Maharishi Patanjali compiled all Yoga in a book called 'Yog sutras'. This book has total 196 sutras or formula. The Book has four about Samadhi. Sadhana Pada - In this segment he explains about meditation. Vibhuti Pada - In this segment Patanjali explains about yoga. Kaivalya Pada - In this segment Patanjali explains the connection of yoga with Body, mind, and soul. There are many exercises explained in this segment which can unite all of these. [Type text] [Type text] Page 14 3- Post -Patanjali Period (800 AD onwards) - Period after Patanjali Period, which covers current period also, is called Post -Patanjali period. After Patanjali, there were many Yogis and Sants, who developed Yoga. With their own personal style, they created a new form of Yoga, but the basic form of Yoga is same in all the styles. Modern Yoga is also called 'Hath Yoga' or physical Yoga. This is also related to 'Kundalini Yoga ' which is part of 'Raja Yoga' . Modern Yoga is a mix of all the four paths of Yoga and gives more stress on postures. For getting complete benefits of Yoga, one should have a holistic approach towards it, even without any religious inclination. Fig. 1.2.4. Garudasan Journ ey of Yoga from India to the World For many, the pracice of yoga is restricted to Hatha Yoga and Asanas (postures). However, among the Yoga Sutras, just three sutras are dedicated to asanas. Fundamentally, hatha yoga is a preparatory process so that the body can sustain higher levels of energy. The process begins with the body, then the breath, the mind to the inner self. Yoga is also commonly understood as a therapy or exercise system for health and tness. While physical and mental health is natural consequences of yoga, the goal of yoga is more far-reaching. \"Yoga is about harmonizing oneself with the universe. It is the technology of aligning individual geometry with the cosmic, to achieve the highest level of percepion. Yoga does not adhere to any paricular religion, belief system or community; it has always been approached as a technology for inner well -being. Anyone who pracices yoga with involvement can reap its bene ts, irrespecive of one's faith, ethnicity or culture. Tradiional Schools of Yoga: Dierent Philosophies, Tradiions, lineages and Guru -shishya tradiions of Yoga lead to the emergence of dierent Each has its own principles and pracices leading to ulimate aim and objecives of Yoga. Contribuion of Yog Gurus in Spreading Yoga Yoga has spread all over the world by the teachings of great personaliies like Swami Shivananda, of the style of yoga known as \"Iyengar Yoga\" and was considered one of the foremost yoga type. In modern days, Sri Sri Ravishankar & Swami Ramdev has contributed a lot in spreading Yoga to the common household.

These rules should followed in order to get optimum results from yoga . Some of the basic rules are stated below. Age for yoga Yoga has no age limitation. Person of any age can pergorm Yoga.Only som e type of Yoga is associated with age Ideal Place for Yoga It is advisable to pracice Yoga in a quiet and properly venilated room. You can also pracice Yoga at outdoors, amidst trees and flowers. Avoid pracicing Yoga during colds, strong winds, smoky or dirty atmosphere. Make sure your Yoga mat is surrounded by much space to avoid any sort of accidents while pracicing Yoga poses like Sirshasana. Refrain from pracicing under an electric fan, if it is not too hot. Ideal Clothes for Yoga Wear loose, light and comfortable clothes during yoga pracice. It should be ensured that clothes are covering body appropriately as per your cultural believes. Remove your spectacles, watches or any jewellery before staring the Asanas. It can harm you while doing yoga. Yoga Mat for E xercise Yoga mats made of natural materials as well as folded blankets can be used for doing Yoga. Blankets work as good insulators between your body and earth. We should avoid spongy or air-lled mattresses as they do not provide the required support to the spine. Ideal Di et for Yoga There is no speci caion or dietary rule for Yoga. Eat natural food lled with nutrients. [Type eonetobevegetaria ntopracti ce Yoga. However, in the advanced level of yoga, it is recommended to lead a vegetarian life. It is advised to ll half of the stomach with food, one-quarter with water and to keep the remaining quarter empty. This pracice keeps the body t and acive. Details on diet are given in Yogic Diet. Paricipan t Handbook Condi tion of Stomach It is highly recommended that your stomach is empty while doing yoga. That is why Yoga is normally praciced during morning hours after emptying the stomach. If that is not possible, then at least give 3- 4 hour gap after your last meal for doing yoga. In the morning create a schedule of waking up at xed ime and empty your bowl before doing yoga. After some ime it would become natural, and you would need not to force your body for that. Way of breathing During Yoga, you should breathe through your nose, not from the mouth. It is very important in order to get full bene ts of Yoga. Body Condiion While Doing Yoga While doing Yoga, one's body should be free from fever or any other disease. If he / she is suering from any disease, he / she should consult his / her doctor before pracicing Yoga. While doing Yoga one's body should be relaxed and calm. Asans in Inverted Posiion The female praciioner should avoid doing any type of inverted posiion yoga, such as Shirshasan or Sarvangasan, during periods. This can harm their body. Pain in Body while Doing Yoga Iniially, the body tends to pain since it would be in si condiion. But if pain is unbearable then you should immediately stop yoga and inform your instructor about that. Do's of Yoga \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise\" is a universal adage. Yoga praciioners should go to bed early, have a sound sleep and get up early in the morning, attend to nature's call, wash the mouth and teeth thoroughly, take a bath and start yoga in fasing mode. It is advisable that one should wake up and pracice Yoga in 'Brahm Muhrat' which is from 4:24 am to 5:24 am. Yoga can also be praciced 1 hour after a liquid diet, 3 hours after refreshments or 5 hours after full meals. One could pracice, yoga even before bath but, after pracice one should wait for some ime and then take a bath. Yoga should be praciced on a leveled floor in a room where doors and windows are kept open for air and light. [Type text] [Type text] Page 19 It is helpful in many ways to pracice yoga in a place, where morning tender sunrays fall. One should not pracice yoga directly on the ground, on cement or mortar floor. One should spread a carpet, a blanket or a clean cloth, sit on it and start yoga pracice by facing east or north in the morning, west or south in the evening. Streams of Yoga Primarily, Yoga has four paths. Bhagvad Gita has details on these four paths. These four paths are listed below - 1- Raj Yoga, 2- Bhakti Yoga, 3- Janan Yoga, 4- Karma Yoga All the four paths have their own renowned followers. We will discuss the same in detail. Raj Yoga The great sage Patanjali was a follower of Raj Yoga. In Raj Yoga, Yoga is practiced to gain mastery over the mind through will power. There are further two branches under Raj Yoga : 1- Bahiranga Yoga 2- Antaranga Yoga Bahi ranga Yoga Bahiranga means external. So Bahiranga Yoga means External or Outer Path of Yoga. It is controlled by four limbs of Ashtang yoga - yama, niyama, asana, and pranayama. Sometimes the fifth limb - pratyahara, is also associated with this Antaranga Yoga Antaranga means internal. So Antaranga Yoga means internal or inner Path of Yoga. It is controlled by last three limbs of Ashtang yoga - dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. As the name suggest, benefits of this yoga is internal rather than external. It awakens the mind and soul of Yogi. Bhaki Yoga Ramanuja was main follower of Bhakti Yoga. Bhakti yoga aims to help a person evolve emotional maturity, love for society and to spread the message of universal brotherhood and oneness. It helps in transformation of the conditional and desirous form of love into true unconditional love. Kama (desire), combined with tyaga (sacrifice) forms prema (love). Prema along with saranagati (surrender) results in bhakti. The path of bhakti yoga leads to satisfaction and calmness of mind. It is considered to be the easiest path among four, as the practice is not very rigorous. Bhakti yoga is similar to the interpersonal relation between humans but here the relation is between soul and super soul (ultimate soul). Bhagvad purana provides us with nine forms of bhakti: 1. Sravan (listening) 2. Kirtana (praising) 3. Smarana (remembering) (servitude) 8. Sakhya (friendship) 9.Atma (complete surrender of self). Fig. 1.1.6. Bhakti Yoga Janan Yoga One of the famous follower of this stream was Shankara. This path helps in developing a logical mind with intuitive knowledge and immense awareness. There are three phases in janan yoga: 1. Sravana, the first exposure to knowledge in any form (reading a book, listening to a lecture, watching a video). 2. Manana, revisiting the knowledge for further understanding. 3. Nididhyasana, the phase of experimentation. In janan yoga, the ultimate aim is to understand the reality of atma (soul) and the ability to differentiate it from the body. A person truly established in the path of janan yoga becomes free from all worldly desires and achieve contentment. Though the four paths of yoga seem to be completely different from each other, they lead to the same goal of self-realization, and the union of the individual with the universal self. Karma Yoga The Bhagvad gita remains the main source for the conceptual basis of karma yoga; it was later elaborated by Swami Vivekananda. This path emphasizes on performing actions with detachment without worrying about the results. Actions are categorized as: Tamasik - they are binding, deteriorating, violent and is a result of state of delusion and confusion Rajasik - when performed with craving for desires, with egoism and a lot of efforts Sattvik - when it is free from attachment and done without love or hatred The essence of karma yoga is to convert kamya karma (action [Type text] Page 21 inculcating detachment and committing one's energy to unceasing work. Eight Lim bs of As htang Yoga The meaning of Ashtanga yoga is 'Eight -limbed yoga'. According to Patanjali, the path of internal purification for revealing the Universal Self consists of the following eight spiritual practices: Yama: Universal morality Niyama: Personal observances Asanas: Body postures Pranayama: Breathing exercises and control of prana Pratyahara: Control of the senses Dharana: Concentration and cultivating inner perceptual awareness Dhyana: Devotion, Meditation on the Divine Samadhi: Union with the Divine The first two limbs that Patanjali describes are the fundamental ethical precepts called yamas and the niyamas. These can also be looked at as universal morality and personal observances. The Yamas and niyamas are the suggestions given on how we should deal with people around us and our attitude toward ourselves. The attitude we have towards things and other people is yama, how we relate to ourselves inwardly is niyama. Both are mostly concerned with how we use our energy in relationship to others and ourselves. The yamas are broken down into five \"wise characteristics.\" Rather than a list of dos and don'ts, \"they tell us that our fundamental nature is compassionate, generous, honest and peaceful.\" They are as follows: Yamas (Universal Morality) 1. Ahimsa - Compassion for all living things The word ahimsa literally mean not to injure or show cruelty to any creature or any person in any way whatsoever. Ahimsa is, however, more than just lack of violence as adapted in yoga. It means kindness, friendliness, and thoughtful consideration of other people and things. It also has to do with our duties and responsibilities too. Ahimsa implies that in every situation we should adopt a considerate attitude and do no harm. 2. Satya - Commitment to Truthfulness Satya means \"to speak the truth\", yet it is not always desirable to speak the truth on all the occasions, for it could harm someone unnecessarily. We have to consider what we say, how we say it, and in what way it could affect others. If speaking the truth has negative consequences for another, then it is better to say nothing. Satya should never come into conflict with our efforts to behave with ahimsa. This precept is based on the understanding that honest communication and action form the bedrock of any healthy relationship, community or government, and deliberate deception, exaggerations, and lies harm others. 3. Asteya - Non -stealing: Steya means \"to steal\"; while Asteya is -to take nothing that does not belong to us. This also means that if we are in a situation where someone entrusts something to us or confides in us, we do not take advantage of him or her. Non -stealing includes not only not taking what belongs to another without permission, but also using something for a different purpose to that intended, or beyond the time permi tted by its owne r. The practice of asteya implies not taking anything that has not been freely given. [Type text] [Type text] Page 22 4. Brahmacharya - Sense control: Brahmacharya is used mostly in the sense of abstinence, particularly in relationship to sexual activity. Brahmacharya suggests that we should form relationships that foster our understanding of the highest truths. Brahmacharya does not necessarily imply celibacy. Rather it means responsible behavior with respect to our goal of moving towards the truth. Practicing Brahmacharya means that we use our sexual energy to regenerate our connection to our spiritual self. It also means that we don't use this energy in any way that might harm others. 5. Aparigraha - Neutralizing the desire to acquire and hoard wealth: Aparigraha means to take only what is necessary and not to take advantage of a situation or act greedy. We should only take what we have earned; if we take more, we are exploiting someone else. The yogi feels that the collection or hoarding of things implies a lack of faith in God and in himself to provide for his future. Aparigraha also implies letting go of our attachments to things and an understanding that impermanence and change are the only constraints. The Yoga Sutra describes what happens when these five behaviors outlined above becomes part of a person's daily life. Thus, the yamas are the moral virtues which if attended to, purify human nature and contribute to the health and happiness of the society. Niyama (Personal Observances): Niyama means \"rules\" or \"laws.\" These are the rules prescribed for personal observance. Like the yamas, the five niyamas are not exercises or actions to be simply studied. They represent far more than an attitude. Compared with the yamas, the niyamas are more intimate and personal. They refer to the attitude we adopt toward ourselves as we create a code for living soulfully. 1. Sauca - Purity - The first niyama is sauca, means purity and cleanliness. Sauca has both an inner and an outer aspect. Outer cleanliness simply means keeping ourselves clean. Inner cleanliness has as much to do with the healthy, free functioning of our bodily organs as with the clarity of our mind. Practicing asanas or pranayama are essential means for attending to this inner sauca. Asanas tone the entire body and remove toxins while pranayama cleanses our lungs, oxygenates our blood and purifies our nerves. But more important than the physical cleansing of the body is the cleansing of the mind of its disturbing emotions like hatred, passion, anger, lust, greed, delusion and pride. 2. Santosa - Contentment: Another niyama is santosa, modesty and the feeling of being content with whatever we have. To be at peace within and finding contentnebt with one's lifestyle, even while experiencing life's difficulties through all kinds of circumstances. We should accept that there is a purpose for everything - yoga calls it karma - and we cultivate contentment 'to accept what happens'. It means being happy with what we have rather than being unhappy about what we don't have. 3. Tapas - Disciplined use of our energy: Tapas refers to the activity of keeping the body fit or to confront and handle the inner urges without an outer show. Literally, it means to heat the body and by doing so, to cleanse it. Behind the notion of tapas lies the idea that we can direct our energy to enthusiastically engage life and achieve our ultimate goal of union with the Divine. Tapas helps us burn up all the desires that stand in our way of this goal. Another form of tapas is paying attention to what we eat. Attention to body posture, attention to eating habits, attention to breathing patterns - these are all tapas. [Type text] [Type text] Page 23 4. Svadhyaya The fourth niyama is svadhyaya. Sva means \"self' that cultivates self-reflective consciousness can be considered svadhyaya. It means to find self-awareness in all our activities and efforts, even to the point of welcoming and accepting our limitations. It teaches us to be centered and non-reactive to the dualities, to burn out unwanted and self-destructive tendencies. 5. Isvarapranidhana - Celebration of the Spiritual: Isvarapranidhana means \"to lay all your actions at the feet of God.\" It is the contemplation of God (Isvara) to become attuned to god and god's will. It is the recognition that the spiritual suffuses everything, and through our attention and care, we can attune ourselves with our role as a part of the Creator. The practice requires that we set aside some time each day to recognize that there is some omnipresent force larger than ourselves that is guiding and directing the course of our lives. Fig. Yoga is for everyone Unity in Diversity Unity in diversity is a concept of 'unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural, linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or psychological differences towards a more complex unity based on the understanding that difference enriches human interactions One should pracice yoga calmly without any haste or exhausion. If one is ired, he or she should rest for a while in a comfortable posture. One should try to pracice yoga everyday regularly, preferably at the same ime. While pracicing yoga, one should concentrate on yoga alone and try to keep away the other thoughts. During the pracice of Yoga asanas, the dirt in the internal organs of the body is directed towards the urinary bladder, So soon after compleing yoga, one should pass out the urine. During yoga pracice, if anyone feels to attend nature's call, he must go and attend to it immediately. One should not hold it back forcefully for a long ime. One should also not try to suppress sneezing, cough, etc. If one feels thirsty one can drink a little water as well. If one sweats during yoga pracice, he or she should slowly wipe it out either with a cloth or with the palms. It is better if it dries up automa ically in the air. Pranayama should follow should follow Pranayama. [Type text] [Type text] Page 24 Always lay on your back for 2 to 5 minutes with relaxed breathing, after nishing Yoga postures. Movements should be slow in every case. Sudden movements should be avoided. Don'ts of Yoga Women should refrain from regular yoga pracice during their menses or pregnancy. However, for them there are a speci c set of asanas to be done. Don't have a full tummy while doing yoga, wait unil 2 to 3 hours after large meals. Don't take a shower or drink water for 30 minutes after doing yoga. During illness, after operaions, when there is a bandage either for sprains or fractures, one should refrain from Yoga Pracice. They can resume yoga after consuling experts. Don't do strenuous exercises after yoga. One should not pracice yoga in unclean/smoky place and areas with a foul smell. Yoga should not be praciced in storm winds either. Major Ben ets of Yoga Following are some of the benefits of doing Yoga.

Wisdom (Brahmacharya) 5. Simplicity (Aparigraha) 6. Worship of the spiritual goal (Ishvara -pranidhana) 7. Sacri ce the Meaning of Yoga Principle Non -violence (Ahimsa) No killing of other beings. To be meek and peaceful. Truthfulness (Satya) Live in the truth. Basically, be honest with yourself and others. Also there should be no little lies of convenience. A lie is permissible only in well -jusied situaions, for example, if you can save the life of another human being with a lie. A Yogi is silent whenever in doubt. Those who consistently live in the truth, radiate truth. Their fellow men trust them. Yoga Instructor [Type text] [Type text] Page 28 Righteousness (Asteya) Neither stealing nor cheaing. A Yogi is always honest. He does not seek unwarranted advantages, but he is looking for a fair trade. Wisdom (Brahmacharya) Live in the spiritual light. Do not serve the money but your inner happiness. Be centered in your inner happiness and peace. Simplicity (Aparigraha) Be moderate in external enjoyment and consumpion. A spiritual person lives modestly outwardly and inwardly rich. A Yogi uses his energy, not in outer acions but lives so peaceful that it turns inward and cleanses his body from the inside. One day, he lives permanently in the spiritual light. Worship of the spiritual goal (Ishvara -pranidhana) So that we do not lose our spiritual path, it is necessary that we remind ourselves again and again about our spiritual goal. We can worship any image (Goddess, Shiva, Patanjali), we can bow before a statue (Buddha, Jesus, Shiva) or speak a mantra (prayer). Sacri ce the ego (Shaucha) Puri caion/cleaning. The way into the light passes through the cruci xion of the ego. Without a cruci xion, there is no enlightenment. True sacri ce is an art. He who sacri ces too much braced them internally. Who sacri ces too little, does not solves his tensions. Self -discipline (Tapas) A clear goal, a clear life plan and a clear way of pracicing. Tapas means to lead a disciplined life. Reading (Svadhyaya) Daily reading (mantra, meditaion) keeps us on the spiritual path, cleanses our spirit, connects us with the enlightened masters and makes us spiritual victors. Contentment (Santosha) Sais ed with what one has. 2.1.2 Knowled ge of Ancie nt Yoga Text In order to have a deeper knowledge of Yoga, one should have a good understanding of ancient Yoga texts. Some of the important Yoga texts are given below - 1- Bhagvad Gita 2- Patanjali Yoga Sutra 3- The i Sutra Bhagvad Gita The Geeta is the linchpin of a great epic, and that epic is the Mahabharata or Great Story of the Bharatas. With nearly one hundred thousand verses divided into eighteen chapters, it is one of the longest epic poems in the world \u2014 seven imes longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, or [Type text] [Type text] Page 29 three imes longer than the Bible. It is, in fact, a whole library of stories that exerted a tremendous influence on the people and literature of India. The central story of the Mahabharata is a conflict over succession to the throne of Hasinapura, a kingdom just north of modern Delhi that was the ancestral realm of a tribe most commonly known as the Bharatas. (India was at that ime divided amongst many small, and often warring kingdoms) The struggle is between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas or sons of Pandu, and the Kauravas, or descendants of Kuru. Because of his blindness, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother of Pandu, is passed over as king, the throne going instead to Pandu. However, Pandu renounces the throne, and Dhritarashtra assumes power after all. The sons of Pandu \u2014Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva \u2014grow up together with their cousins, the Kauravas. Due to enmity and jealousy, the Pandavas are forced to leave the kingdom. During their exile, they jointly married Draupadi and befriend their cousin Krishna, who from then on accompanies them. They return and share sovereignty with the Kauravas, but have to withdraw to the forest for thirteen years when Yudhishthira loses all his possessions in a game of dice with Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas. When they return from the forest to demand their share of the kingdom back, Duryodhana refuses. This means war. Krishna acts as counselor to the Pandavas. The Gita is found right here, with the two armies facing each other and ready for battle. The battle rages for eighteen days and ends with the defeat of the Kauravas. All the Kauravas die; only the ve Pandava brothers and Krishna survive. The six set out for heaven together, but all die on the way, except Yudhishthira, who reaches the gates of heaven accompanied only by a small dog, who turns out to be an incarnaion of the god Dharma. After tests of faithfulness and constancy, Yudhishthira is reunited in heaven with his brothers and Draupadi in eternal bliss. It is within this enormous epic, which is less than one percent of the Mahabharata, that we nd the Bhagvad Geeta, or the Song of the Lord, most commonly referred to simply as the Gita. It is found in the sixth chapter of the epic, just before the great battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The greatest hero of the Pandavas, Arjuna, has pulled up his chariot in the middle of the battleeld between the two opposing armies. He is accompanied by Krishna, who acts as his charioteer. In a t of despondency, Arjuna throws down his bow and refuses to ght, deploring the immorality of the coming war. It is a moment of supreme drama: ime stands sill, the armies are frozen in place, and God speaks. Fig. 2.1.1. The Bhagvad Geeta [Type text] [Type text] Page 30 The situaion is extremely grave. A great kingdom is about to self-destruct in internecine warfare, making a mockery of dharma, the eternal moral laws, and customs that govern the universe. Arjuna's objecions are well -founded: He is the vicim of a moral paradox. On the one hand, he is facing persons who, according to dharma, deserve his respect and veneraion. On the other hand, his duty as a warrior demands that he kill them. Yet no fruits of victory would seem to jusify such a heinous crime. It is, seemingly, a dilemma without a soluion. It is this state of moral confusion that the Gita sets out to mend. When Arjuna refuses to ght, Krishna has no paience with him. Only when he realizes the extent of Arjuna's despondency does Krishna change his attitude and start teaching the mysteries of dharmic acion in this world. He introduces Arjuna to the structure of the universe, the concepts of prakrii, primordial nature, and the threes gunas, the properies that are acive in prakrii. Then he takes Arjuna on a tour of philosophical ideas and ways of salvaion. He discusses the nature of theory and acion, the importance of rituals, the ulimate principle, Brahman, all the while gradually disclosing his nature as the highest god. This part of the Gita culminates in an overwhelming vision: Krishna allows Arjuna to see his supernal form, the Vishvarupa, which strikes terror into Arjuna's heart. The rest of the Gita deepens and supplements the ideas presented before the epiphany \u2014the importance of self- control and faith of equanimity and unsel shness, but above all, of bhaki or devoion. Krishna explains to Arjuna how he can obtain immortality by transcending the properies which qualify not only primordial matter but also human character and behavior. Krishna also emphasizes the importance of doing one's duty, declaring that it is better to do one's duty without disincion. In the end, Arjuna is convinced. He picks up his bow and is ready to ght. Knowing a couple of things will make your reading easier. The rst is that the Gita is a conversaion within a conversaion. Dhritarashtra begins it by asking a quesion, and that is the last we hear out of him. He is answered by Sanjaya, who relates what is happening on the battleeld. (Dhritarashtra is blind. Vyasa, his father, oers to restore his sight so he can follow the battle. Dhritarashtra declines this boon, feeling that seeing the carnage of his kinsmen would be more than he could bear. So instead, Vyasa bestows clairvoyance and clairaudience upon Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's minister, and charioteer. As they sit in their palace, Sanjaya relates what he sees and hears on the distant battleeld.) Sanjaya pops up now and again throughout the book as he relates to Dhritarashtra the conversaion between Krishna and Arjuna. This second conversaion is a bit one-sided, as Krishna does almost all of the talking. Thus, Sanjaya describes the situaion, Arjuna asks the quesions, and the answers. [Type text] text] Arjun in Mahabharat The eighteen chapters of the Bhagavadgita are classi ed as 'yogas', staring with the 'yoga' of Arjuna's depression and ending with the yoga of 'liberaion through renunciaion'.

Yoga is commonly praciced as a rouine which helps in improving physical tness and someimes as a means to stress management. There is growing awareness that yoga can be eecively used as therapy in treaing a variety of ailments, including hypertension, diabetes, heart condiions, etc. Those who have been pracicing yoga for a while can attest to the physical and physiological bene ts that the pracice brings. While all the above -men ioned bene ts of yoga are certainly desirable, as a Yoga Instructor you should know about the true meaning and purpose of yoga which is \"the ability to control the fluctua ions of the mind\". This brief and succinct deniion was given by Sage Patanjali, more than three thousand years ago, in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali has provided a very scien ic and pracic al exposiion of the philosophy and pracice of yoga. One very important secion of the book describes what is commonly called \"ashtanga yoga\" or the Eight Limbs of Yoga which provides pracic al guidelines for achieving the goal of yoga, i.e., controlling the mind. Most of the yoga as it is praciced today, called Hatha Yoga, includes physical postures (asanas) and some breathing techniques (pranayama). As you can noice from the eight limbs which are listed below, asana and pranayama are only two of these eight limbs and help establish a strong foundaion towards achieving the objecives of yoga. However, to develop a fully integrated pracice of yoga and achieve the nal objecives of yoga, one needs to include in their rouine all the eight limbs of yoga in some form. Overview of Yoga Sutras Even though yoga has been menioned in various ancient texts, including the Vedas, Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, etc., the credit for putting together a formal, cohesive philosophy of yoga goes to Sage Patanjali. In his Yoga Sutras, Patanjali has provided the very essence of the philosophy and teachings of yoga in a highly scieni c and systemaic exposiion. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (YSP) are one of the six darshanas of Hindu schools of philosophy and a very important milestone in the history of Yoga. The book is a set of 195 aphorisms (sutras), which are short, terse phrases designed to be easy to memorize. Though brief, the Yoga Sutras is an enormously influenial work that is just as relevant for yoga philosophy and pracice today as it was when it was written. The sutras are divided into four chapters (pada) as follows: Samadhi Pada: The rst chapter provides a deniion and the purpose of yoga. Various approaches that can be used to achieve the objecives of yoga are provided. Sadhana Pada: The second chapter contains the pracical approach to achieve the goals of yoga. In this chapter, the author gives a descripion of the eight limbs of yoga called Ashtanga Yoga, which is how the yoga sutras are someimes referred to. Vibhui Pada: The third chapter focuses on some of the supernatural powers that an adept yogi may be able to attain. Kaivalya Pada: In the fourth chapter the nature of the mind and mental percepions, desire, bondage and liberaion and what follows it are discussed. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are also someimes referred to as \"Raj sutra 2 [Type [Type text] Page 33 of the rst yoga as - \"yogaschitta vritti is restraint mind -stu\" Vivekananda In subsequent sutras, Patanjali explains that once the mind is properly restrained, then the \"seer\" or the \"soul, the true self\" can rest in its own true nature. Further, as long as the mind is not under control, it coninues to assume the form of the \"vrittis\" or the perturbaions in mind, and these vrittis become the cause of human suering. In simpler terms, what this deniion tells us is that we can be peaceful and happy when we can control the mind; else, the mind coninues to control us, and we stay in a state of suering. 2.1.2.2.1 Ashtanga Yoga (Eig ht Lim bs of Yoga) The eight limbs of yoga as dened in the second chapter are as follows: Yamas (self -restraints): The yamas are guidelines for how to interact with the outside world at a social level. The ve yamas are: Ahimsa santosha (contentment), the scriptures and self-study), and Ishwara pranidhana (surrender to God). Together, yamas and niyamas provide an ethical and moral code to be followed so that the aspiring yogi can establish an adequate moral foundaion for his/her spiritual journey. Asana (posture): Asana refers to the seated posture which should be steady and comfortable so the yogi can sit and meditate for long periods of ime. Pranayama (breath control): Pranayama, which literally means stretching or expansion of prana, the vital life force, involves breath control and helps train and prepare the mind for dharana (concentraion). Pratyahara (sense withdrawal): Through pratyahara one gains the ability to withdraw the senses from their objects thus achieving perfect control over the senses. Dharana (concentra ion/focus): Dharana involves focusing the mind on a single object of concentra ion for long periods of ime. Dhyana (meditaion): When there is an uninterrupted flow of the mind toward the object of focus, the yogi enters the state of meditaion. Samadhi (total absorpion): Finally when even the self-awareness of the mind disappears, and only the object of meditaion shines through, it is called the state of samadhi. It is only in the highest stage of \"Samadhi\", called the \"nirbeeja Samadhi\" (seedless Samadhi) when the mind is fully under control and brings the yogi to a state of perpetual peace and tranquility. 3.

Explain about human body anatomy 2. Explain various internal organs and glands 3. Dene role of organs and glands in a person's health 4. Describe the bene ts of Yoga on human body 3.1 Human Body Human Body is a very complex machine. It works well when all of its components works in tandem and remain in good condiion. We can divide Human Body in following systems - 1- Skeletal System 2- Cardiovascular System 3- Muscular System 4- Digesive System 5- Endocrine System 6- Nervous System 7- Respiratory System 8- Immune & Lymphaic System 9- Urinary System 10- Female Repr oduciv e System 11- 11- Male Repr oduciv e System 3.1.1 Skeletal System The skeletal system in an adult body is made up of 206 individual bones. These bones are arranged into two major divisions: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton runs along the body's midline axis and is made up of 80 bones in the following regions: Skull, Hyoid, Auditory ossicles, Ribs, Sternum and Vertebral column The appendicular skeleton is made up of 126 bones in the following regions: [Type text] [Type text] Page 35 Upper limbs, Pelvic girdle and Pectoral (shoulder) girdle Fig. 3.2.1. Skeletal System 3.2.1.1 Skull The skull is composed of 22 bones that are fused together except for the mandible. These 21 fused bones are separate in children to allow the skull and brain to grow, but fuse to give added strength and protecion as an adult. The mandible remains as a movable jaw bone and forms the only movable joint in the skull with the temporal bone. The bones of the superior porion of the skull are known as the cranium and protect the brain from damage. The bones of the inferior and anterior porion of the skull are known as facial bones and support the eyes, nose, and mouth. Fig. 3.2. 2. Skull 3.1.1.2 Hyoid and Auditory Ossicles The hyoid is a small, U-shaped bone found just inferior to the mandible. The hyoid is the only bone in the body that does not form a joint with any other bone \u2014it is a floaing bone. The hyoid's funcion is to help hold the trachea open and to form a bony connecion for the muscles. The \u2014are the smallest bones in the body. Found in a small cavity inside of the temporal bone, they serve to transmit and amplify sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Fig. 3.2.3 Hyoid & Auditory Ossicle s 3.1.1.3 Vertebrae Twenty -six vertebrae form the vertebral column of the human body. They are named by region: Cervical (neck) - 7 vertebrae Thoracic (chest) - 12 vertebrae Lumbar (lower back) - 5 vertebrae Sacrum - the singular sacrum and coccyx, each vertebra is named by the rst letter of its region and its posiion along the superior - inferior axis. For example, the most superior thoracic vertebra is called T1, and the most inferior is called T12. Fig. 3.2.4. Vertebrae 3.1.1.4 Ribs and Sternum The sternum, or breastbone, is a thin, knife -shaped bone located along the midline of the anterior side of the thoracic region of the skeleton. The sternum connects to the ribs by thin bands of carilage called the costal carilage. There are 12 pairs of ribs that together with the sternum form the ribcage of the thoracic region. The rst seven ribs are known as \"true ribs\" because they connect the thoracic vertebrae directly to the sternum through their own band of costal carilage. Ribs 8, 9, and 10 all connect to the sternum through carilage that is connected to the carilage of the seventh rib, so we consider these to be \"false ribs.\" Ribs 11 and 12 are also false ribs but are also considered to be \"floaing ribs\" because they do not have any carilage attachment to the sternum at all. Fig.3.2.5. Ribs & 3.1.1.5 Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limb The pectoral girdle connects the upper limb (arm) bones to the axial skeleton and consists of the left and right clavicles and left and right scapulae. The humerus is the bone of the upper arm. It forms the ball and socket joint of the shoulder with the scapula and forms the elbow joint with the lower arm bones. The radius and ulna are the two bones of the forearm. The ulna is on the medial side of the forearm and forms a hinge joint with the humerus at the elbow. The radius allows the forearm and hand to turn over at the wrist joint. The lower arm bones form the wrist joint with the carpals, a group of eight small bones that give added flexibility to the wrist. The carpals are connected to the ve metacarpals that form the bones of the hand and connect to each of the ngers. Each nger has three bones known as phalanges, except for the thumb, which only has two phalanges. Fig. 3.2.6. Pictoral Girdle & Upper 37 3.1.1.6. Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb Formed by the left and right hip bones, the pelvic girdle connects the lower limb (leg) bones to the axial skeleton. The femur is the largest bone in the body and the only bone of the thigh (femoral) region. The femur forms the ball and socket hip joint with the hip bone and forms the knee joint with the ibia and patella. Commonly called the kneecap, the patella is special because it is one of the few bones that are not present at birth. The patella forms in early childhood to support the knee for walking and crawling. The ibia and bula are the bones of the lower leg. The ibia is much larger than the bula and bears almost all of the body's weight. The bula is mainly a muscle attachment point and is used to help maintain balance. The ibia and bula form the ankle joint with the talus, one of the seven tarsal bones in the foot. Fig. 3.2.7. Pelvic Girdle & Lower Limb The tarsals are a group of seven small bones that form the posterior end of the foot and heel. The tarsals form joints with the ve long metatarsals of the foot. Then each of the metatarsals forms a joint with one of the sets of phalanges in the toes. Each toe has three phalanges except for the big toe which only has two phalanges 3.2.1.2 Cardiovascular System The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and the approximately 5 liters of blood that the blood vessels transport. Responsible for transporing oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body, the cardiovascular system is powered by the body's hardest -working organ \u2014 the heart, which is only about the size of a closed st. Even at rest, the average heart easily pumps over 5 liters of blood throughout the body every minute. Fig. 3.2.8. Cardiovascular System 3.1.2.1 The Heart The heart is a muscular pumping organ located medial to the lungs along the body's midline in the thoracic region. The bott om ip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body's left side with the other 1/3 on the right. The top of the heart, known as the heart's base, connects to the great blood vessels of the body: the aorta, vena cava, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary veins. There are 2 primary circulatory loops in the human body: the pulmonary circulaion loop and the systemic circulaion loop. Fig. 3.2.9. The Heart [Type text] [Type text] Page 38 Pulmonary circulaion transports de-oxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, where the blood picks up oxygen and returns to the left side of the heart. The pumping chambers of the heart that support the pulmonary circulaion loop are the right atrium and right ventricle. Systemic circulaion carries highly oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to all of the issues of the body (with the excepion of the heart and lungs). Systemic circulaion removes wastes from body issues and returns de-oxygenated blood to the right side of the heart. The left atrium and left ventricle of the heart are the pumping chambers for the systemic circulaion loop. 3.1.2.2 Blood Vessels Blood vessels are the body's highways that allow blood to flow quickly and eciently from the heart to every region of the body and back again. The size of blood vessels corresponds with the amount of blood that passes through the vessel. All blood vessels contain a hollow area called the lumen through which blood is able to flow. Around the lumen is the wall of the vessel, which may be thin in the case of capillaries or very thick in the case of arteries. Fig. 3.2.10. Blood Vessels 3.2.1.3 Muscular System The muscular system is responsible for the movement of the human body. Attached to the bones of the skeletal system are about 700 named muscles that make up roughly half of a person's body weight. Each of these muscles is a discrete organ constructed of skeletal muscle issue, blood vessels, tendons, and nerves. Muscle issue is also found inside of the heart, digesive organs, and blood vessels. In these organs, muscles serve to move substances throughout the body. There are three types of muscle issue: Visceral, cardiac, and skeletal. Fig. 3.2.11. Muscular System 3.1.3.1 Visceral Muscle Visceral muscle is found inside of organs like the stomach, intesines, and blood vessels. The weakest of all muscle issues, visceral muscle makes organs contract to move substances through the organ. Because visceral muscle is controlled by the unconscious part of the brain, it is known as involuntary muscle \u2014it cannot be directly controlled by the conscious mind. The term \"smooth muscle\" is often used to describe visceral muscle because it has a very smooth, uniform appearance when viewed under a microscope. This smooth appearance starkly contrasts with the banded appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscles. 3.1.3.2 Cardiac Muscle Found only in the heart, cardiac muscle is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Cardiac muscle issue cannot be controlled consciously, so it is an involuntary muscle. While hormones and signals from the brain adjust the rate of contracion, cardiac muscle simulates itself to contract. The natural pacemaker of the heart is made of cardiac muscle issue that simulates other cardiac muscle [Type text] [Type text] Page 39 cells to contract. Because of its self-simulaion, cardiac muscle is considered to be autorhythmic or intrinsically controlled. The cells of cardiac muscle issue are striated \u2014that is, they appear to have light and dark stripes when viewed under a light microscope. The arrangement of protein bers inside of the cells causes these light and dark bands. Striaions indicate that a muscle cell is very strong, unlike visceral muscles. The cells of cardiac muscle are branched X or Y-shaped cells ightly connected together by special juncions called intercalated disks. Intercalated disks are made up of nger like projecions from two neighbouring cells that interlock and provide a strong bond between the cells. The branched structure and intercalated disks allow the muscle cells to resist high blood pressures and the strain of pumping blood throughout a lifeime. These features also help to spread electrochemical signals quickly from cell to cell so that the heart can beat as a unit. 3.1.3.3 Skeletal Muscle Skeletal muscle is the only voluntary muscle issue in the human body \u2014it is controlled consciously. Every physical acion that a person consciously performs (e.g. speaking, walking, or wriing) requires skeletal muscle. The funcion of skeletal muscle is to contract to move parts of the body closer to the bone that the muscle is attached to. Most skeletal muscles are attached to two bones across a joint, so the muscle serves to move parts of those bones closer to each other. Skeletal muscle cells form when many smaller progenitor cells lump themselves together to form long, straight, mulinucleated bers. Striated just a like cardiac muscle, these skeletal muscle bers are very strong. Skeletal muscle derives its name from the fact that these muscles always connect to the skeleton in at least one place. 3.1.4 Diges ive System The diges ive system is a group of organs working together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the enire body. Food passes through a long tube inside the body known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointes inal tract (GI tract). The alimentary canal is made up of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intes ines, and large intes ines. In addiion to the alimentary canal, there are several important accessory organs that help your body to digest food. Following are the main parts of Diges ive System. Fig. 2.2.12. Digestive System 3.1.4.1 Mouth Food begins its journey through the digesive system in the mouth, also known as the oral cavity. Inside the mouth are many accessory organs that aid in the digesion of food \u2014 the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands. Teeth chop food into small pieces, which are moistened by saliva before the tongue and other muscles push the food into the pharynx. Fig. 2.2.13. Mouth 2.2.1.4.2 Teeth The teeth are 32 small, hard organs found along the anterior and lateral edges of the mouth. Each tooth is made of a bone -like substance called denin and covered in a layer of enamel \u2014the hardest substance in the body. Teeth are living organs and contain blood vessels and nerves under the denin in a soft region known as the pulp. The teeth are designed for cutting and grinding food into smaller pieces. Fig. 2.2.14. Teeth [Type text] [Type text] Page 40 3.1.4.3 Tongue The tongue is located on the inferior porion of the mouth just posterior and medial to the teeth. It is a small organ made up of several pairs of muscles covered in a thin, bumpy, skin-like layer. The outside of the tongue contains many rough papillae for gripping food as it is moved by the tongue's muscles. The taste buds on the surface of the tongue detect taste molecules in food and connect to nerves in the tongue to send taste informaion to the brain. The tongue also helps to push food toward the posterior part of the mouth for swallowing.] Fig. 3.2.15. Tongue 3.1.4.4 Salivary Glands Surrounding the mouth are 3 sets of salivary glands. The salivary glands are accessory organs that produce a watery secreion known as saliva. Saliva helps to moisten food and begins the digesion of carbohydrates. The body also uses saliva to lubricate food as it passes through the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus. Fig. 3.2.16. Salivary Glands 3.1.4.5 Pharynx The pharynx, or throat, is a funnel -shaped tube connected to the posterior end of the mouth. The pharynx is responsible for the passing of masses of chewed food from the mouth to the esophagus. The pharynx also plays an important role in the respiratory system, as air from the nasal cavity passes through the pharynx on its way to the larynx and eventually the lungs. Because the pharynx serves two dierent funcions, it contains a flap of issue known as the epiglottis that acts as a switch to route food to the esophagus and air to the larynx. Fig. 3.2.17. Pharynx 3.1.4.6 The esophagus is a muscular tube connecing the pharynx to the stomach that is part of the upper gastrointesinal tract. It carries swallowed masses of chewed food along its length. At the inferior end of the esophagus is a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter or cardiac sphincter. The funcion of this sphincter is to close off the end of the esophagus and trap food in the stomach. Fig. 3.2.18. Esophagus 3.1.4.7 Stomach The stomach is a muscular sac that is located on the left side of the abdominal cavity, just inferior to the diaphragm. In an average person, the stomach is about the size of their two sts placed next to each other. This major organ acts as a storage tank for food so that the body has ime to digest large meals properly. The stomach also contains hydrochloric acid and digesive enzymes that coninue the digesion of food that began in the mouth. Fig. 3.2.19. Stomach [Type text] [Type text] Page 41 3.1.4.8 Small Intesine The small intesine is a long, thin tube about 1 inch in diameter and about 10 feet long that is part of the lower gastrointesinal tract. It is located just inferior to the stomach and takes up most of the space in the abdominal cavity. The enire small intesine is coiled like a hose, and the inside surface is full of many ridges and folds. These folds are used to maximize the digesion of food and absorpion of nutrients. By the ime food leaves the small intesine, around 90% of all nutrients have been extracted from the food that entered it. Fig. 3.2.20. Small Intestine 3.1.4.9 Liver and Gallbladder The liver is a roughly triangular accessory organ of the digesive system located to the right of the stomach, just inferior to the diaphragm and superior to the small intesine. The liver weighs about 3 pounds and is the second largest organ in the body. The liver has many dierent funcions in the body, but the main funcion of the liver in digesion is the producion of bile and its secreion into the small intesine. The gallbladder is a small, pear -shaped organ located just posterior to the liver. The gallbladder is used to store and recycle excess bile from the small intesine so that it can be reused for the digesion of food. Fig. 3.2.21. Liver & Gall Bladder 3.1.4.10 Pancreas The pancreas is a large gland located just inferior and posterior to the stomach. It is about 6 inches long and shaped like short, lumpy snake with its \"head\" connected to the duodenum and its \"tail\" poining to the left wall of the abdominal cavity. The pancreas secretes digesive enzymes into the small intesine to complete the chemical digesion. Fig.3.2.22. Pancreas 3.1.4.11 Large Intesine The large intesine is a long, thick tube about 2 \u00bd inches in diameter and about 5 feet long. It is located just inferior to the stomach and wraps around the superior and lateral border of the small intesine. The large intesine absorbs water and contains many symbioic bacteria that aid in the breaking down of wastes to extract some small amounts of nutrients. Faeces in the large intesine exit the body through the anal canal. Fig. 3.2.23. Small Intestine System The endocrine system includes all of the glands of the body and the hormones produced by those glands. The glands are controlled directly by simulaion from the nervous system as well as by chemical receptors in the blood and hormones produced by other glands. By regulaing the funcions of organs in the body, these glands help to maintain the body's homeostasis, Cellular metabolism, reproducion, sexual development, sugar and mineral homeostasis, heart rate, and digesion. Fig. 3.2.24. Endocrine System 3.1.5 Hypothalamus The hypothalamus is a part of the brain located superior and anterior to the brain stem and inferior to the thalamus. It serves many dierent funcions in the nervous system and is also responsible for the direct control of the endocrine system through the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains special cells called neurosecretory that secrete hormones: 1- Thyrotropin -releasing hormone (TRH) 2- Growth hormone -releasing hormone the hypophysis, is a small pea-sized lump of issue connected to the inferior porion of the hypothalamus of the brain. Many blood vessels surround the pituitary gland to carry the hormones it releases throughout the body. Situated in a small depression in the sphenoid bone called the sella turcica, the pituitary gland is actually made of 2 completely separate structures: the posterior and anterior pituitary a small pinecone -shaped mass of glandular issue found just posterior to the thalamus of the brain. The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin that helps to regulate the human sleep -wake cycle known as the circadian rhythm. The acivity of the pineal gland is inhibited by simulaion from the photoreceptors of the reina. This light sensiivity causes melatonin to be produced only in low light or darkness. Increased melatonin producion causes humans to feel drowsy at gland is a butt erfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck and wrapped around the lateral sides of the trachea. The thyroid gland Thyroxine (T4) Calcitonin is released when calcium ion levels in the blood rise above a certain set point. Calcitonin funcions to reduce the concentraion of Fig. 3.2.28. Thyroid Gland calcium ions in the blood by aiding the absorpion of calcium into the matrix of bones. The hormones T3 and T4 work together to regulate the body's metabolic rate. Increased levels of T3 and T4 lead to increased cellular acivity and energy usage in the body. Fig. 3.2.27. Paricipan t Handbook 3.1.5.5 Parathyroid Glands The parathyroid glands are 4 small masses of glandular issue found on the posterior side of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands produce the hormone parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is involved in calcium ion homeostasis. PTH is released from the parathyroid glands when calcium ion levels in the blood drop below a set point. PTH simulates the osteoclasts to break down the calcium containing bone matrix to release free calcium ions into the bloodstream. PTH also triggers the kidneys to return calcium ions ltered out of the blood back to the bloodstream so that it is conserved. Fig. 3.2.29. The adrenal glands are a pair of roughly triangular glands found immediately superior to the kidneys. The adrenal glands are each made of 2 disinct layers, each with their own unique funcions: the outer adrenal cortex and inner adrenal medulla. Androgens, such as testosterone, are produced at low levels in the adrenal cortex to regulate the growth and acivity of cells that are recepive to male hormones. In adult males, the amount of androgens produced by the testes is many imes greater than the amount produced by the adrenal cortex, leading to the appearance of male secondary sex characterisics. The adrenal medulla produces the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine under simulaion by the sympatheic division of the autonomic nervous system. Both of these hormones help to increase the flow of blood to the brain and muscles to improve the \"ght -or-flight\" response to stress. These hormones also work to increase heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure while decreasing the flow of blood to and funcion of organs that are not involved in responding to emergencies. Fig. 2.2.30. Adrenal Glands 3.1.5.7 Pancreas The pancreas is a large gland located in the abdominal cavity just inferior and posterior to the stomach. The pancreas is considered to be a heterocrine gland as it contains both endocrine and exocrine issue. The endocrine cells of the pancreas makeup just about 1% of the total mass of the pancreas and are found in small groups throughout the pancreas called islets of Langerhans. Within these islets are 2 types of cells \u2014alpha and beta cells. The alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon, which is responsible for raising blood glucose levels. Glucagon triggers muscle and liver cells to break down the polysaccharide glycogen to release glucose into the bloodstream. The Beta cells produce the hormone insulin, which is responsible for lowering blood glucose levels after a meal. Insulin triggers the absorpion of glucose from the blood into cells, where it is added to glycogen molecules for storage. Fig. 3.2.31. Pancreas 3.1.5.8 Gonads The gonads \u2014ovaries in females and testes in males \u2014are responsible for producing the sex hormones of the body. These sex hormones determine the secondary sex characterisics of [Type text] [Type text] Page 46 adult females and adult males. Testes: The testes are a pair of ellipsoid organs found in the scrotum of males that produce the androgen testosterone in males after the start of puberty. Testosterone has eects on many parts of the body, including the muscles, bones, sex organs, and hair follicles. This hormone causes growth and increases in strength of the bones and muscles, including the accelerated growth of long bones during adolescence. During puberty, testosterone controls the growth and development of the sex organs and body hair of males, including pubic, chest, and facial hair. In men who have inherited genes for baldness, testosterone triggers the onset of androgenic alopecia, commonly known as male pattern baldness. Ovaries: The ovaries are a pair of almond -shaped glands located in the pelvic body cavity lateral and superior to the uterus in females. The ovaries produce the female sex hormones progesterone and estrogens. Progesterone is most acive in females during ovulaion and pregnancy where it maintains appropriate condiions in the human body to support a developing fetus. Estrogens are a group of related hormones that funcion as the primary female sex hormones. The release of estrogen [Type text] [Type text] Page 47 during puberty triggers the development of female secondary sex characterisics such as uterine development, breast development, and the growth of pubic hair. Estrogen also triggers the increased growth of bones during adolescence that leads to adult height and proporions. 3.1.5.9 Thymus The thymus is a soft, triangular -shaped organ found in the chest posterior to the sternum. The thymus produces hormones called thymosins that help to train and develop T-lymphocytes during fetal development and childhood. The T-lymphocytes produced in the thymus go on to protect the body from pathogens throughout a person's enire life. The thymus becomes inacive during puberty and is slowly replaced by adipose issue throughout a person's life. Fig. 3.2.33. Thymus 3.1.6 Nervous System The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and all of the nerves that connect these organs to the rest of the body. Together, these organs are responsible for the control of the body and communicaion among its parts. The brain and spinal cord form the control center known as the central nervous system (CNS), where informaion is evaluated and decisions made. The sensory nerves and sense organs of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) monitor. [Type text] [Type text] Page 48 Fig. 3.2.34. Nervous System 3.2.1.7 Respiratory System The cells of the human body require a constant stream of oxygen to stay alive. The respiratory system provides oxygen to the body's cells while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product that can be lethal if allowed to accumulate. There are 3 major parts of the respiratory system: the airway, the lungs, and the muscles of respiraion. The airway, which includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, carries air the body's exterior. [Type text] [Type text] Page 50 Yoga Instructor 3.2.1.8 Immune and Lympha ic Systems The immune and lymphaic systems are two closely related organ systems that share several organs and physiological funcions. The immune system is our body's defense system against infec ious pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as parasiic animals and proists. The immune system works to keep these harmful agents out of the body and attacks those that manage to enter. The lymphaic system is a system of capillaries, vessels, and nodes. Fig. 3.2.36. Immune & Lymphatic System 3.2.1.9 Urinary System The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The kidneys lter the blood to remove wastes and produce urine. The ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra together form the urinary tract, which acts as a plumbing system to drain urine from the kidneys, store it, and then release it during urinaion. Besides ltering and eliminaing wastes from the body, the urinary system also maintains the homeostasis of water, ions, pH, blood pressure and calcium. [Type [Type Female Repr oduciv System The female reproducive includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, vulva, mammary glands, and breasts. These organs are involved in the producion and transportaion of gametes and the producion of sex hormones. The female reproducive system also facilitates the ferilizaion of ova by sperm and supports the development of ospring during pregnancy and infancy. Fig. 2.2.38. Female Reproductive System 3.1.11 Male Repr oduciv e System The Male reproducive system comprises of many organs, whose main funcion is to produce and supply sperms for reproducion. The male sex system is formed by testosterone secreted from the fetal testes; on reaching puberty, the secondary sex organ gets developed and become fully funcional. Its main funcion is to produce Sperm in the testes and to send it by the epididymis, ejaculatory duct, and urethra. The sperms are penis during ejaculaion. [Type text] [Type text] Page 52 Fig. 2.2.39. Male Reproductive System 3.2.2 Ben ets of Yoga on Human Body Unlike other physical exercises, which give bene ts to the body only, Yoga bene ts Body, mind, and soul. Also, no other exercise give bene ts to internal organs and glands, while for good health it is very essenial that they all should work properly. Below are some of the bene ts of yoga - Yoga Instructor 3.2.1 Improves flexibility Improved flexibility is one of the rst and most obvious bene ts of yoga. During your rst class, you probably won't be able to touch your toes, never mind do a backbend. But if you sick with it, you'll noice a gradual loosening, and eventually, seemingly impossible poses will become possible. You'll also probably noice that aches and pains start to disappear. That's no coincidence. Tight hips can strain the knee joint due to improper alignment of the thigh and shinbones. Tight hamstrings can lead to a flattening of the lumbar spine, which can cause back pain. And inflexibility in muscles and connecive issues, such as fascia and ligaments, can cause poor posture. 3.2.2 Builds Muscle Strength Strong muscles do more than looking good. They also protect us from condiions like arthriis and back pain and help prevent falls in elderly people. And when you build strength through yoga, you balance it with flexibility. If you just went to the gym and lifted weights, you might build strength at the expense of flexibility. 3.2.3 Improves Body Posture Your head is like a bowling ball\u2014big, round, and heavy. When it's balanced directly over an erect spine, it takes much less work for your neck and back muscles to support it. Move it several inches forward, however, and you start to strain those muscles. Hold up that forward -leaning bowling ball for eight or 12 hours a day, and it's no wonder you're ired. And faigue might not be your only problem. Poor posture can cause back, neck, and other muscle and joint problems. As you slump, your body may compensate by flattening the normal inward curves in your neck and lower back. This can cause pain and degeneraive arthriis of the spine. [Type text] [Type text] Page 53 3.2.4 Prevents carilage and joint breakdown Each ime you pracice yoga, you take your joints through their full range of moion. This can help prevent degeneraive arthriis or miigate disability by \"squeezing and soaking\" areas of carilage that normally aren't used. Joint carilage is like a sponge; it receives fresh nutrients only when its fluid is squeezed out, and a new supply can be soaked up. Without proper sustenance, neglected areas of carilage can eventually wear out, exposing the underlying bone like worn -out brake pads. 2.2.2.5 Protects Spine Spinal disks \u2014the shock absorbers between the vertebrae that can herniate and compress nerves \u2014crave movement. That's the only way they get their nutrients. If you've got a well -balanced asana pracice with plenty of backbends, forward bends, and twist, you'll help keep your disks supple. Paricipan t Handbook 3.2.6 Betters your bone health It's well documented that weight -bearing exercise strengthens bones and helps ward o osteoporosis. Many postures in yoga require that you lift your own weight. And some, like Downward and Upward - facing dog, help strengthen the arm bones, which are paricularly vulnerable to osteoporoic fractures. 3.2.7 Increases your blood flow Yoga gets your blood flowing. More speci cally, the relaxaion exercises you learn in yoga can help your circulaion, especially in your hands and feet. Yoga also gets more oxygen to your cells, which funcion better as a result. Twising poses are thought to wring out venous blood from internal organs and allow oxygenated blood to flow in once the twist is released. Inverted poses, such as Headstand, Handstand, and Shoulderstand, encourage venous blood from the legs and pelvis to flow back to the heart, where it can be pumped to the lungs to be freshly oxygenated. This can help if you have swelling in your legs due to heart or kidney problems. Yoga also boosts levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the issues. And it thins the blood by making platelets less sicky and by cutting the level of clot-promoing proteins in the blood. This can lead to a decrease in heart attacks and strokes since blood clots are often the main cause behind them. 3.2.8 Drains your lymphs and boosts immunity When you contract and stretch muscles, move organs around, and come in and out of yoga postures, you increase the drainage of lymph (a viscous fluid rich in immune cells). This helps the lymphaic system ght infecion, destroy cancerous cells, and dispose of the toxic waste products of cellular functioning . 3.2.9 Ups your heart rate When you regularly get your heart rate into the aerobic range, you lower your risk of heart attack and can relieve depression. While not all yoga is aerobic, if you do it vigorously or Ashtanga classes, it can boost your heart rate into the aerobic range. But even yoga pracices that don't get your heart rate up that high can improve cardiovascular condiioning. Studies have found that yoga pracice lowers the resing heart rate, increases endurance, and can improve your maximum uptake of oxygen during exercise \u2014all reflecions of improved aerobic condiioning. One study found that subjects who were taught only pranayama could do more exercise with less oxygen. [Type text] [Type text] Page 54 3.2.10 Drops your blood pressure If you've got high blood pressure, you will get bene ted from yoga. When compared the eects of Shavasana (Corpse Pose) with simply lying on a couch, after three months, Savasana was associated with a 26-point drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and a 15-point drop in diastolic blood pressure (the bott om number) \u2014and the higher the iniial blood pressure, the bigger the drop. Yoga Instructor 3.2.11 Regulates your adrenal glands Yoga lowers corisol levels. If that doesn't sound like much, consider this. Normally, the adrenal glands secrete corisol in response to an acute crisis, which temporarily boosts immune funcion. If your corisol levels stay high even after the crisis, they can compromise the immune system. Temporary boosts of corisol help with long -term memory, but chronically high levels undermine memory and may lead to permanent changes in the brain. Addiionally, excessive corisol has been linked with major depression, osteoporosis (it extracts calcium and other minerals from bones and interferes with the laying down of new bone), high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. In rats, high corisol levels lead to what researchers call \"food -seeking behavior\" (the kind that drives you to eat when you're upset, angry, or stressed). The body takes those extra calories and distributes them as fat in the abdomen, contribuing to weight gain and the risk of diabetes and heart attack. 3.2.12 Makes you happier Feeling sad? Sit in Lotus. Better yet, rise up into a backbend or soar royally into King Dancer Pose. While it's not as simple as that, one study found that a consistent yoga pracice improved depression and led to a signi cant increase in serotonin levels and a decrease in the levels of monoamine oxidase. 3.2.13 Creates a healthy lifestyle Move more, eat less\u2014that's the adage of many a dieter. Yoga can help on both fronts. A regular pracice gets you moving, and burns calories and the spiritual and emoional dimensions of your pracice may encourage you to address any eaing and weight related disorders on a deeper level. Yoga may also inspire you to become a more conscious eater. 3.2.14 Lowers blood sugar Yoga lowers blood sugar and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and boosts HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. In people with diabetes, yoga has been found to lower blood sugar in several ways: by lowering corisol and adrenaline levels, encouraging weight loss, and improving sensiivity to the eects of insulin. Get your blood sugar levels down, and you decrease your risk of diabeic complicaions such as heart attack, kidney failure, and blindness. 3.2.15 Helps you focus An important component of yoga is focusing on the present. Studies have found that regular yoga pracice improves coordinaion, reacion ime, memory, and even IQ scores. People who pracice Transcendental Meditaion demonstrate the ability to solve problems and acquire and recall informaion better\u2014probably because they're less distracted by their thoughts, which can play over and over like an endless tape loop. 2.2.16 Relaxes your system Yoga encourages you to relax, slow your breath, and focus on the present, shifting the balance from the sympatheic nervous system (or the ght-or-flight response) to the parasympatheic nervous system. The latter is calming and restoraive; it lowers breathing and heart rates, decreases blood pressure, and increases blood flow to the intesines and reproducive organs. your balance Regularly pracicing yoga increases propriocepion (the ability to feel what your body is doing and where it is in space) and improves balance. People with bad posture or dysfuncional movement patterns usually have poor propriocepion, which has been linked to knee problems and back pain. Better balance could mean fewer falls. For the elderly, this translates into more independence and delayed admission to a nursing home or never entering one at all. For the rest of us, postures like Tree Pose can make us feel less wobbly on and o the mat. 3.2.18 Regulates your nervous system Some advanced yogis can control their bodies in extraordinary ways, many of which are mediated by the nervous system. Scienists have monitored yogis who could induce unusual heart rhythms, generate speci c brain -wave patterns, and, using a meditaion technique, raise the temperature of their hands by 15 degrees Fahrenheit. If they can use yoga to do that, perhaps you could learn to improve blood flow to your pelvis if you're trying to get pregnant or induce relaxaion when you're having trouble falling asleep. 3.2.19 Releases Tension F rom Your Lim bs Do you ever noice yourself holding the telephone or a steering wheel with a death grip or scrunching your face when staring at a computer screen? These unconscious habits can lead to chronic tension, muscle faigue, and soreness in the wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, and face, which can increase stress and worsen your mood. As you pracice yoga, you begin to noice where you hold tension: It might be in your tongue, your eyes, or the muscles of your face and neck. If you simply tune in, you may be able to release some tension in the tongue and eyes. With bigger muscles like the quadriceps, trapezius, and butt ocks, it may take years of pracice to learn how to relax them. 3.2.20 Helps you sleep deeper Simulaion is good, but too much of it taxes the nervous system. Yoga can provide relief from the hustle and bustle of modern life. Restora ive asana, yoga nidra (a form of guided relaxaion), Savasana, pranayama, and meditaion encourage pratyahara, a turning inward of the senses, which provides downime for the nervous system. Another by-product of a regular yoga pracice, studies suggest, is better sleep \u2014which means you'll be less ired and stressed and less likely to have accidents. 3.2.21 Boosts your immune system funcionality Asana and pranayama probably improve immune funcion, but, so far, meditaion has the strongest scieni c support in this area. It appears to have a bene cial eect on the funcioning of the immune system, boosing it when needed (for example, raising anibody levels in response to a vaccine) and lowering it when needed (for instance, miigaing an inappropriately aggressive immune funcion in an autoimmune disease like psoriasis). [Type text] [Type text] Page 56 Yoga Instructor 3.2.22 Gives your lungs room to breathe Yogis tend to take fewer breaths of greater volume, which is both calming and more ecient. A 1998 study published in The Lancet taught a yogic technique known as \"complete breathing\" to people with lung problems due to congesive heart failure. After one month, their average respiratory rate decreased from 13.4 breaths per minute to 7.6. Meanwhile, their exercise capacity increased signi cantly, as did the oxygen saturaion of their blood. In addiion, yoga has been shown to improve various measures of lung funcion, including the maximum volume of the breath and the eciency of the exhalaion. Yoga also promotes breathing through the nose, which lters the air, warms it (cold, dry air is more likely to trigger an asthma attack in people who are sensiive), and humidi es it, removing pollen and dirt and other things you'd rather not take into your lungs. 3.2.23 Prevents IBS and other digesive problems Ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, consipaion \u2014all of these can be exacerbated by stress. So if you stress less, you'll suer less. Yoga, like any physical exercise, can ease consipaion \u2014and theoreically, lower the risk of colon cancer \u2014because moving the body facilitates more rapid transport of food and waste products through the bowels. And, although it has not been studied scieni cally, yogis suspect that twising poses may be bene cial in getting waste to move through the system. 3.2.24 Gives you peace of mind Yoga quells the fluctuaions of the mind, according to 'Patanjali's Yoga Sutra. In other words, it slows down the mental loops of frustraion, regret, anger, fear, and desire that can cause stress. And since stress is implicated in so many health problems \u2014from migraines and insomnia to lupus, MS, eczema, high blood pressure, and heart attacks \u2014if you learn to quiet your mind, you'll be likely to live longer and healthier. 3.2.25 Increases your self-esteem Many of us suer from chronic low self-esteem. If you handle this negaively by take drugs, overeaing, working too hard, sleeping around \u2014you may pay the price in poorer health physically, mentally, and spiritually. If you take a posiive approach and pracice yoga, you'll sense, iniially in brief glimpses and later in more sustained views, that you're worthwhile or, as yogic philosophy teaches, that you are a manifestaion of the Divine. If you pracice regularly with the intenion of self-examinaion and betterment \u2014not just as a subsitute for an aerobics class \u2014you can access a dierent side of yourself. You'll experience feelings of graitude, empathy, and forgiveness, as well as a sense that you're part of something bigger. While better health is not the goal of spirituality, it's often a by-product, as documented by repeated scieni c studies. 3.2.26 Eases your pain Yoga can ease your pain. According to several studies, asana, meditaion, or a combinaion of the two, reduced pain in people with arthriis, back pain, bromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other chronic condiions. When you relieve your pain, your mood improves, you're more inclined to be acive, and you don't need as much medicaion. text] Page 57 Paricipan t Handbook 3.2.27 Gives you inner strength Yoga can help you make changes in your life. In fact, that might be its greatest strength. Tapas, the Sanskrit word for \"heat,\" is the re, the discipline that fuels yoga pracice and that regular pracice builds. The tapas you develop can be extended to the rest of your life to overcome ineria and change dysfuncional habits. You may nd that without making a paricular eort to change things, you start to eat better, exercise more, or nally quit smoking after years of failed attempts. 3.2.28 Connects you with guidance Good yoga teachers can do wonders for your health. Excepional ones do more than just guiding you through the postures. They can adjust your posture, gauge when you should go deeper in poses or back o, deliver hard truths with compassion, help you relax, and enhance and personalize your pracice. A respectful relaionship with a teacher goes a long way towards promoing your health. 3.2.28 Connects you with guidance Good yoga teachers can do wonders for your health.

A respectful relaionship with a teacher goes a long way towards promoing your health. 3.2.29 Helps keeping you drug free If your medicine cabinet looks like a pharmacy, maybe it's ime to try yoga. Studies of people with asthma, high blood pressure, Type II diabetes (formerly called adult -onset diabetes), and obsessive - compulsive disorder have shown that yoga helped them lower their dosage of medicaions and someimes get o them enirely. The bene ts of taking fewer drugs? You'll spend less money, and you're less likely to suer side eects and risk dangerous drug interacions. 3.2.30 Builds awareness for transformaion Yoga and meditaion build awareness. And the more aware you are, the easier it is to break free of destrucive emoions like anger. Studies suggest that chronic anger and hosility are as strongly linked to heart attacks as are smoking, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol. Yoga appears to reduce anger by increasing the feelings of compassion and interconnecion and by calming the nervous system and mind. It also increases your ability to step back from the drama of your own life, to remain steady in the face of bad news or unsettling events. You can sill react quickly when you need to\u2014and there's evidence that yoga speeds reacion ime\u2014but you can take that split second to choose a more thoughtful approach, reducing suering for yourself and others. 3.2.31 Benets your relaionship s Love may not conquer all, but it certainly can aid in healing. Culivaing the emoional support of friends, family, and community has been demonstrated repeatedly to improve health and healing. A regular yoga pracice helps develop friendliness, compassion, and greater equanimity. Along with yogic philosophy's emphasis on avoiding harm to others, telling the truth, and taking only what you need, this may improve many of your relaionships. 3.2.32 Uses sounds to soothe your sinuses [Type text] text] Page \u2014asana, pranayama, and meditaion \u2014all work to improve your health, but there's more in the yoga toolbox. Consider chaning. It tends to prolong exhalaion, which shifts the balance toward the parasympathe ic nervous system. When done in a group, chan ing can be a paricularly powerful physical and emoional experience. Yoga Instructor 3.2.33 Guides your body's healing in your mind's eye If you contemplate an image in your mind's eye, as you do in yoga nidra and other pracices, you can eect change in your body. Several studies have found that guided imagery reduced postoperaive pain, decreased the frequency of headaches, and improved the quality of life for people with cancer and HIV. 3.2.34 Keeps allergies and viruses at bay Kriyas, or cleansing pracices, are another element of yoga. They include everything from rapid breathing exercises to elaborate internal cleansings of the intesines. Jala nei, which entails a gentle lavage of the nasal passages with salt water, removes pollen and viruses from the nose, keeps mucus from building up, and helps drains the sinuses. 3.2.35 Helps you serve others Karma Yoga (service to others) is integral to yogic philosophy. And while you may not be inclined to serve others, your health might improve if you do. A study at the University of Michigan found that older people who volunteered a little less than an hour per week were three imes as likely to be alive seven years later. Serving others can give meaning to your life, and your problems may not seem so dauning when you see what other people are dealing with. 3.2.36 Encourages self-care In much of convenional medicine, most paients are passive recipients of care. In yoga, it's what you do for yourself that matters. Yoga gives you the tools to help you change, and you might start to feel better the rst ime you try pracicing. You may also noice that the more you commit to pracice, the more you bene t. This result in three things: You get involved in your own care, you discover that your involvement gives you the power to eect change, and seeing that you can eect change gives you hope. And hope itself can be healing. 3.2.37 Supports your conneciv e issue As you read all the ways yoga improves your health, you probably noiced a lot of overlap. That's because they're intensely interwoven. Change your posture, and change the way you breathe. Change your breathing, and you change your nervous system. This is one of the great lessons of yoga: Everything is connected \u2014your hipbone to your anklebone, you to your community, your community to the world. This interconnecion is vital for understanding yoga. This holisic system simultaneously taps into many mechanisms that have addiive and even muliplicaive eects. This synergy may be the most important way of all that yoga heals. 3.2.38 Uses The Placebo Eect, To Aect Change Just believing that you will get better can make you better. Unfortunately, many convenional scienists believe that if something works by eliciing the placebo eect, it doesn't count. But most of the paients who just chanted a mantra, like you might do at the beginning or end of a yoga class or throughout a meditaion, they felt better. [Type text] [Type text] Page 59 Unit Objeciv es At the end of this unit, you will be able to: 3.2.1.1.3.1 Explain Yogic diet 3.2.1.1.3.2 ts of Fasing 3.2.1.1.3.5 Describe Do's 3.3.1 What is Yogic Di et? The Yogic view on diet begins with the metaphysical or energeic concept known as \"the three gunas.\" As per Yogic concept, by looking at the world of matter, there are three basic types of energy - rajas,11 tamas, and11sattv as - which can be seen in all objects, experiences, and even though ts.11 Rajas11is ery energy or agitaion, which in its most negaive form manifests as anger .11 Tamas11is ineria, and in its most negaive form manifests as laziness.11 Sattvas, nally, is lightness, peacefulness, and harmony. Again, as per Yoga all three can be seen in every aspect of the material world, including our bodies, our thoughts, and our feelings, and food, of course is no excepion. Some foods, such as meat, spicy foods, and caeine, are seen to be simulaing or rajasic. Others, such as fatty, fermented, and overcooked foods, are seen as sedaing or tamasic. And some, such as raw or lightly -cooked fruits and vegetables, grains, and legumes, are seen as11health y, nourishing or sattvic. Any person pracicing Yoga should consume Sattvic food for getting quick and better result from Yoga. 3.3.1.1Sa ttvic Foods Following are included in Sattvic foods - Raw fruits Vegetables Lightly cooked vegetables, legumes & whole grains Raw milk UNIT 3.3: Food Habits & other Instrucions as per Yoga Philosophy text] Foods Following are included in Rajasic foods - Meat Spices Garlic Rened sugar Simulants (coee, tea, etc.) Fig. 2.3.3. Tamasic Food 3.3.1.3 Tamasic Foods Following are included in Tamasic foods - Fermented foods Fried foods Onions Fish Eggs Reheated foods Alcohol Frozen Foods Fatty Foods Fig. 2.3.3. Tamasic Food 3.3.2 Impor tance of Good Eaing Habits in Yoga In Yoga, not only food selecion is important but its preparaion is also important. Further, the way we eat and our mind set while eaing are equally signi cant in good eaing habits - that is, even the most healthful food can have a negaive impact if consumed in a state of agitaion or depression. This latter point is especially important - normally we pay great a ttenion to our diet but are far less aware of our mental state when we eat. As per Yoga belief, eaing calmly, mindfully, and in silence greatly enhanced the quality of nutriion as well as the mental state fostered by that meal. Another important aspect of the gunas is that we often make the mistake of thinking that by combining rajas11and11tamas11amounts to the same as sattvas - that is, we tell ourselves if we combine simulaing aciviies with sedaing ones, we will somehow generate \"balance\" - and nowhere is this more common than diet, where for example we consume spicy foods which simulate us with fatty foods or alcohol to \"calm us back down\". This mistake has several powerful negaive consequences. To begin, since rajasic11 and11 tamasic11 foods are less-than -ideal fuel sources, we get very little energy from them. Further, because the two are sending conflicing messages to body and mind, the inner eect is profoundly taxing and draining. To get an idea of this, imagine having two bosses, one who is always praising you and one who is always criicizing - the end result might seem to balance, but the internal turmoil would be great, and our bodies and nervous systems are exactly the same. By contrast, when we eat11sattvic11 foods we not only provide much better nourishment but also help our mind remains calmer and clear, which in turn helps us make better choices in all areas of life, including diet. There are other nuances to Yogic diet, but one last element that deserves emphasis is how food influence our world -view. As you may have noiced,11 sattvic foods are generally simple and readily available, while11 rajasic11and11 tamasic11 foods require greater eort both to obtain and prepare. The Yogis realized when our food is easy to obtain, can be enjoyed with little adornment, and leaves us feeling good physically and mentally; we tend to feel nourished by and connected to our world. On the other hand, if the struggle to obtain and expense to make pleasurable, we tend to feel \"at odds\" with nature - that life is hard, and the world is something that we must \"conquer\" in order to survive, let alone enjoy. In other words, the more we choose sattvic foods, the more we support not just our physical and emoional health but also our sense of connecion with the world, in turn fostering our desire to support and care for it. [Type text] [Type text] Page 61 3.3.4 in Yoga The Yogis believe fasing can be a useful tool for all of us and even in the simplest and \"mildest\" form can have profound bene ts. Again, given the amount of ime we invest in food, they realized if every now and then we take a break from eaing and invest that ime in our growth - for example, ime with family, serving our community, or simply reflecing on our lives - these brief periods can have great impact on our personal development. Again, it's worth noing this doesn't have to be long - even just a day or a porion of a day can be powerful. And if even that feels dauning, we can pracice a \"rela ive fast\" - choosing a form of eaing that's simpler but sill comfortable for us, like a day of just fruits and vegetables or just juice and broth, so we free up our ime while sill honoring our \"comfort zone.\" Even at the ashram where I lived, on our weekly \"fasing day\" the kitchen was sill open with juice, soup, and simple dishes being available throughout the day for those who felt it was a better t for them at the moment. We can also apply the idea to other areas of our lives where we realize we invest more ime than might be ideal, such as television, the news, or social media. Think of what you could accomplish if, once a week or month, you took a break from an acivity that consumes a lot of your ime and invests it in a \"greater purpose,\" however you might dene that. This is the idea behind spiritual fasing and fasing on holy days in general - in both the cases, we're choosing to brie fly put aside certain worldly things, not giving them up, of course, but simply taking a break to invest that energy in something more important to us that is often pressed out by daily rouine. 3.3.5 Steps for Putting Spiritual Nutriion Into Pracice So those are the basics of Yogic diet and fasing. As you can see, the fundamentals are actually quite simple: the Yogis realized that by focusing on natural foods in their natural state, we could foster greater health and peace of mind, and by eaing mindfully and in moderaion we can further support that process. Ulimately, eaing this way not only can give us the best health possible but also the best mental focus and outlook for living our spiritual values. To oer a closing reinforcement, below are ve simple steps we can use each ime we eat to take even greater advantage of the powerful link between food and our ideals: 1. Consider your greater goals11 - Of course, every meal is a wonderful and important chance to experience pleasure - something the Yogis felt shouldn't be denied or missed out on in any way - but it's also a chance to foster health and build our capacity to serve others. Before each meal, take a moment to look at how you'd like this meal to support your long -term goals while sill provide pleasure and joy. 2. Think of connecion11 - As you prepare your food or wait to receive it, use the ime to think of the connecion between you and the world that meal represents. Think of the people who grew or prepared it, the plants or animals nourishing you, the people with whom you are sharing, and of course all those who support your work, making the meal possible. 3. Express graitude11 - Before eaing, take a moment to express, silently or out-loud, your appreciaion of the nourishment and pleasure you are about to receive. Even a moment of silent thanks can greatly enhance our mindfulness and enjoyment, in turn dramaically enhancing the physical and psychological nourishment we receive from each meal. Paricipan t Handbook enjo - We all know what it's like to nish a meal with little recollecion of how it actually tasted. As you eat, take as much ime as you can to truly savor it. Ideally, consider eaing in silence, or at least try to allow at least a few moments of calm within the meal, really observing and appreciaing the smells, tastes, textures, and social connecions of your meal. 5. Observe & reflect11 - At the end, take at least a moment simply to reflect: how does the meal feel for you? In retrospect, how were the choices you made? Are there things you'd like to be more aware of or do dierently next ime? This process of observing and reflecing will help reinforce good choices and allow us to be even more mindful and aware of our next meal. One should pracice yoga calmly without any haste or exhausion. If one is ired, he or she should rest for a while in a comfortable posture. One should try to pracice yoga everyday regularly, preferably at the same ime. While pracicing yoga, one should concentrate on yoga alone and try to keep away the other thoughts. During the pracice of Yoga asanas, the dirt in the internal organs of the body is directed towards the urinary bladder, So soon after compleing yoga, one should pass out the urine. During yoga pracice, if anyone feels to attend nature's call, he must go and attend to it immediately. One should not hold it back forcefully for a long ime. One should also not try to suppress sneezing, cough, etc. If one feels thirsty one can drink a little water as well. If one sweats during yoga pracice, he or she should slowly wipe it out either with a cloth or with the palms. It is better if it dries up automa ically in the air. Pranayama should follow the asanas and meditaion should follow Pranayama. Always lay on your back for 2 to 5 minutes with relaxed breathing, after nishing Yoga postures. Movements should be slow in every case. Sudden movements should be avoided. 3.3.9 Prayer During Yoga There are some prayers which one can oer during pracicing Yoga. 1. OM shan i, shan i, shan i May we be protected together. May we be nourished together. May we create strength among one another. May our study be lled with brilliance and light. May there be no hosility between us. Om peace, peace, peace. Yoga Instructor [Type text] [Type text] Page 63 1. Dincharya to yoga lifestyle 2.

Place the palms on the knees and make sure that the knees are rmly touching the floor. Close your eyes and relax the body. Breathe normally. Now inhale slowly and deeply and then hold the breath. Instrucions: Step -2: Contract the throat muscles and bend the head forward so that the chin touched the chest. Adjust the chin posiion so that it rests between the two collar bones in the pit of the throat. Straighten the arms and press the knees down with the palms to create a kind of locked posi ion. The shoulders are slightly hunched forward to make sure the arms stay locked 1- Hold this posiion for as long as you are comfortable. Remember the breath is held inside. 2- Do not strain or overdo the holding of breath. Beginners should hold the breath for just a few seconds. Later it can be increased to a minute or more depending on your capacity. Experienced yogis, however, can maintain the chin lock for three minutes or more. 3- To release the lock bend the arms, raise your head and exhale out. Come back to the straight posiion and take few normal breaths. 4- Repeat the process as many imes as you feel comfortable. Once you have mastered the Jalandhara Bandha with breath held inside, you can experiment with the breath held outside. This requires a little pracice and should be achieved slowly without straining. Hold the breath outside for just a few seconds iniially. Later you may increase it to minute depending on your capacity. Experienced praciioners can even hold the breath outside for two minutes or more. But this has to be done with cauion. One should not feel any suocaion while holding the breath either inside or outside. Release the lock when you feel the slightest discomfort and breathe normally. 4- The duraion of the pracice should be increased very gradually. 5- Kumbhaka or holding of breath should not be praciced by those suering from high blood pressure. 2.4.13.3.2 Steps of Sutra Nei 1- Insert the end of a thin and soft rubber catheter horizontally into the right nostril. 2- Slightly lift your head back. 3- Insert the right index and right middle nger inside your mouth and catch the catheter at the back of the throat. 4- Take out the last part of the catheter through the mouth and give a gentle massage to the whole nasal passage. 5- Then slowly remove the catheter from the nose. 6- Repeat same pracices from the left side.

Following are some of the main mudras - ( PLEASE MENTION , HOW MANY MUDRA SHOULD BE COVERED) 3. The throat region is the seat of the Vishuddhi Chakra . Jalandhara Bandha helps to acivate the throat chakra. When acivated, it is said to give immortality. The Gheranda Samhita says that Jalandhara Bandha gives victory over death. Here the meaning of death is not the death of the body. Rather it means that the yogi can control the physical changes that happen in the body. It can mean that an ani-aging process is achieved by acivaion of the Vishuddhi Chakra . This is the meaning of immortality in this context. It is also said that a fluid called Amrita or nectar falls from a center in the brain called Bindu Visarga . This nectar falls through the throat and gets burned at the Manipuraka Chakra . Yogis use the Jalandhara Bandha to prevent the nectar from going down the throat, thereby a ttaining immortality. 4. Jalandhara Bandha prevents the prana Shaki from moving upwards. When praciced with moola bandha, it can create a lock of the prana (upward moving energy) and apana (downward moving energy) in the body. The two energies mix and awakens the Navel Center or the Manipuraka Chakra . 5. Jalandhara Bandha is one of the three yogic locks that have to be mastered before attemping the Maha Bandha or the triple lock. 4.13.4.1 Benets 1. The Jalandhara Bandha eecively closes the air passage and blocks the flow of air. This is used in the pracice of Kumbhaka or holding of breath by yogic praciioners. 2.

First, we will learn common hazards of workplace in detail - 3.1.1 What is Hazard? 'Hazard' is a set of condiions, which can be a risk to health or life. It can be an atmosphere of work place or construcion of a machine or working procedure. Anything out of these can be a Hazard. For understanding it better, we can see Examples of various hazards and threat possessed by them. Oil on the floor creates a Slip hazard. Use of Asbestos causes Cancer and other breathing problem hazards. Use of broken electric wires creates electrocuion hazard and re hazard by potenial sparking out of it. Fig. 3.1.1.

The floor of the workplace should be free from any oil or slippery material. Also, aisles should be clutter free so that movement of persons and trolleys remains smooth. Fig. 3.1.4. Slip or fall 3.1.2.2 Accident by Moving or Falling Objects This is one of the other big hazards at the workplace. There are many big and heavy things at workplaces which are dicult to manage manually. During transportaion also, if they are not secured properly then there is a chance that they may fall from moving the vehicle or can fall on the person who opens the door of the closed transportaion vehicle. Special safety arrangement should be made to load heavy objects. Fig. 3.1.3. Accident by moving / falling object 3.1.2.1 Manual Handling Around 40% of the total accident at workplaces is reported due to this cause. Fig. 3.1.2. Hazard of manual handling [Type text] [Type text] Page 146 3.1.3.2 Chemical Hazard There are many chemicals that are used in workplaces.

Every person has dierent ability to do yoga, and everyone should respect its own body's endurance limit. 5- Do not attempt Yoga immediately after eaing or drinking something, there should be a gap of minimum 3 to 5 hours after your last meal. Fig. 3.1.8. Assistance from Yoga Instructor for avoiding injury [Type text] [Type text] Page 14 Unit Objeciv es At the end of this unit, you will be able to: 1. Describe Safety Hazards associated with Yoga. 2. Explain various safety precauions to be taken during Yoga pracice 3.2.1. Safety Hazard During Pracicing Yoga Although Yoga is for improving one's health, but if not done correctly it may cause harm to the body also. During Shirshasana, one may fall and get injured. Similarly, Sarvangasana has the same hazard. In some asanas, like Halasana - one may overstretch one's back and may get injured. The threat of Back injury is also present in forward and backward bend and during Paschimottasana. New praciioners may pull their muscles if warm up is not done properly or dicult posture asana is done without precauions. One may get dehydrated if one is sweaing too much during Yoga. There is a chance of vomiing if yoga is praciced immediately after having a meal. There is also a risk of Heart attack if a person is suering from Heart disease and he / she does very exhausive Yoga, which increases their heart rate very high. ig. 3.2.1. One of the di cult poses of Yoga (Dhanurasana) 3.2.2 Safety Precauions While Pracicing Yoga There are many threats present while pracicing Yoga, but these all can be avoided if it is done under supervision and with some precauions. Following are the precauion one must take during Yoga exercises - UNIT 3.2: S afety during Yoga Yoga Instructor [Type text] Page 15 3.2.2.1 Medi cal Condiion of Yoga Praciioner New Praciioner must get him / herself medically checked completely. One must take one's doctor's advice before taking up Yoga exercises. There are certain Yoga exercises, which should not be done by Heart paients or person suering from other diseases. On review of medical reports, Yoga Instructor can advise properly which exercises needs to be avoided. 3.2.2.2 Yoga Under Supe rvision New Praciioner must start yoga under good supervision only. Yoga Instructor is required to give coninuous advice for improvement. Yoga Instructor is also helpful in giving iniial support while taking up dicult yoga postures. It is ok to pracice some easy Yoga Postures after reading the book or by seeing the video. But dicult postures, such as Shrisasan or Halasan must be done under Yoga Instructor supervision only. 3.2.2.3 Don't Push Body Too Much Iniially , the body of Yoga Praciioner would be si, and he / she might be over enthusias ic for doing dicult yoga postures by seeing videos or fellow yoga praciione r. In that scenario, he / she might want to push his / her body to its limits of bending or straining. But you should not let him/her cross the limit and should allow his / her body to adjust. You should increase the intensity of Yoga Posture, gradually. You should coninuously council them to have paience in doing dicult yoga postures. 3.2.2.4 Pracicing Yoga with Empty Stomach You should ensure that yoga should be praciced with an empty stomach. There are many yoga postures in which you pose upside down or put pressure on your stomach. If you are not empty stomach, you could vomit, or there could be a pain in stomach. Ideally, you should keep a gap of 3 to 5 hours after your last meal. Staring Yoga, without knowing your medical condiion may harm you very severely. We need to understand that all yoga postures are not advisable to all the persons. Paricipan t Handbook [Type text] [Type text] Page 16 3.2.2.5 Do not Drink Too Much Water during Yoga Pracice You should avoid drinking too much water during Yoga pracice. The temperature of the room plays a great role in this. If there is too much heat in the Yoga room, then you tend to sweat more and feel more thirs ier. Hence you should do yoga at a comfortable temperature. If you really have to drink water then take only a few sips of water. 3.2.2.6 Take Precauions in Pracicing Yoga During Pregnancy You can pracice Yoga during pregnancy, but you need to take expert Yoga Instructors advice on the type of Yoga to be done and for other precauions. If precauions are not taken, there could be a complicaion in pregnancy and person may face aborion also. 3.2.2.7 Precauions in P racicing Yoga During Men struaion You should avoid asanas in which you have to elevate your pelvis higher than your heart. You should also avoid the postures which put pressure on your lower abdomen. 3.2.2.10 Prec auions For Heart Paients There are some yoga poses which are prohibited for Heart paients. Persons undergone Bypass Surgery or Angioplasty must avoid all upside down poses and yoga postures which put Heart under strain. 3.2.2.9 Precauions During Upside Down Yoga Poses Iniially, always take support doing upside down yoga. There is a big risk of falling ill the ime you master these poses. Also always do these asanas under supervision. 3.2.2.8 Precauions During Back Bending Yoga Never bend your back too much in iniial attempts. Gradually increase the intensity. Bending your back too much or bending it with a jerk may cause harm to your back. [Type text] [Type text] Page 17 Notes 3.2.2.12 Avoid Compe iion When doing Yoga in a group, it is natural to have a feeling of compe iion in doing dicult pose or doing it for a longer period. You need to understand one thing that everybody has the dierent ability for bending or enduring the pain. Everyone gets the bene t of yoga (some less and some more), even if it is done for a shorter period. You should give your body some ime to adapt to Yoga. In compe iion, you may harm your body. 3.2.2.11 Duraion of Yoga Poses You should immediately leave a Yoga pose if you are feeling uncomfortable or feeling unbearable pain in any of your body part. Putting your body under undue stress may cause more harm than bene t. [Type text] [Type text] Page 18 3.3.2 Emergency Situaion at Work Place There are various emergency situaions at workplace. Some of them are - 1- Accident Emergency 2- Electric shock Emergency 3- Medical Emergency 4- Natural Disaster Emergency - Flood, Earthquake, Tsunami, etc. 5- Fire Emergency For rst 3 emergencies, we need to give rst aid and immediately call Ambulance. For Natural Disaster we should take shelter at a safe place or follow company's emergency procedure. For Fire Emergencies we will discuss in detail. First, we will understand about common Injuries at the workplace and their First Aid. 3.3.1 What is Emergency? An Emergency is a sudden or unexpected state of the situaion, which, if not tackled properly, will lead to loss of property, health or life. In cases where any miigaion is not possible, immediate evacuaion is needed. Unit Objeciv es At the end of this unit, you will be able to: 1.

Good hygiene is one of the most important pracices to help with the prevenion and spreading of infecions and diseases. Good physical and emoional health helps our bodies and minds to funcion properly without pain, anxiety, depression or discomfort. Improper hygiene can cause diseases, which can negaively impact our physical & mental well -being. Poor hygiene causes us to smell bad (due to bacteria), develop infecions, and contract diseases such as flu, common cold, e-coli, Salmonella, and skin diseases such as ringworm, and scabies. Other problems such as tooth decay, lice in the hair, and foot infecions are also caused due to poor hygiene. UNIT 4.1: Personal Health & Hygiene At the end of this module, you will be able to: 1.

Following are the ways to maintain good hygiene - \u00b7 Washing hands, face, hair and other parts of body, frequently \u00b7 Brushing/cleaning teeth at least once a day \u00b7 Cleaning the living quarters including frequent change of bed sheets, pillow covers, and changing personal clothes and undergarments frequently \u00b7 Taking care to avoid soiling of clothes and body parts, when urinaing, vomiing or relieving oneself in toilet \u00b7 Washing hands before eaing - especially after touching animals \u00b7 Holding a issue/handkerchief over the mouth when coughing or sneezing. If you use hands, make sure to wash them afterward \u00b7 Suppression of habits such as nose -picking, touching the face, etc. \u00b7 Not biing nails \u00b7 Washing hands after using toilet \u00b7 Shower every day with soap/body wash. Remember to also wash under armpits and feet with soap. It's important to be clean. Always clean your private areas (the hair traps sweat and can sink if not washed regularly). \u00b7 Shampoo and condiion hair as needed. Most people have to wash their hair every day to prevent smell and grease. Remember to scrub your scalp and rinse all the product out of your hair unil it is \"squeaky\" clean. Use a good smelling hair product. Keep it nice and neat. \u00b7 Use roll-on, not spray deodorant to prevent armpit odor. [Use the deodorant when you are clean, not instead of getting clean.] Put deodorant on in the morning or any ime you get sweaty. \u00b7 Use a loion to smooth out dry skin. This is opional and isn't essenial, but it's good for your skin and to prevent the look of ugly, dry, cracked skin. \u00b7 Make sure to clean and clip your ngernails whenever they start getting white ends. Girls especially will noice if you have long, dirty nails. This counts for toenails, too. \u00b7 Brush your teeth after every meal and floss them at least once a day. If you're a student, be sure to brush your teeth thoroughly every morning before school. They will look much cleaner and your breath will be more fresh. Make sure to thoroughly brush your teeth AND your tongue to get all the bacteria out. Using mouthwash is also highly recommended. \u00b7 Take o your shoes as soon as you get home so they can air out and dry out. \u00b7 Wear socks when you wear shoes. Each foot sweats a lot during the day, so your shoes will smell pretty bad if you don't [Type text] [Type text] Page 31 wear socks. \u00b7Wear undershirts to help keep your regular shirt smelling fresher. \u00b7Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. (best to do it with a issue) \u00b7If you're around animals of any kind, don't touch them before eaing. If you do, be sure to wash your hands before eaing. \u00b7Don't lick your ngers (such as when turning pages in a book). \u00b7Menstruaing women should take care to change pads or tampons frequently. \u00b7Carry some mints around if you have a problem of bad breath. If the problem persists, then visit a doctor; you could be suering from halitosis. \u00b7Hair on your chin, upper lip, ears, and nose can make you look unsightly. So remember to pluck it out when they start becoming visible on your face. Women should visit the salon every 15 days to shape up the eyebrows. Another safe and eecive way is to opt for a laser surgery for removing facial hair only if it ts your pocket. \u00b7Wear clean socks and apply some talcum powder before wearing shoes. Give your shoes some room to breathe especially after any strenuous acivity. Own 2-3 pair of shoes and rotate their use. Buy a foot deodorant to help get rid of your foot odors. \u00b7Makeup clogs up your skin pores and gives germs a chance to muliply. If you do not remove the makeup before you hit the bed, you will surely have a couple of pimples sprouing out the next day. So no matter how ired you are, you must remove your make up before you sleep. Not for Sale - For Internal Circula ion Only 162 4.1.3.1 Grooming Tips - For Men 1.Trim the nose hairs: This is something very basic that makes a world of dierence. Many companies make nose hair clippers for a moderate price 4.1.3 Grooming Grooming oneself includes washing, cleansing, combing, regularly cutting and styling the hair. It also includes cosmeic care of the body, such as shaving and other forms of depilaion. [Type text] [Type text] Page 32 2. Trim the eyebrows: actually even recommend getting them professionally cleaned (not shaped) to open up the eyes. Remember to brush them up before you leave for the day as this opens up the eye, keeping the face more alert. 3. Clean the hair o your ears and neck : This is something your barber can do for you monthly that gives the appearance of good grooming. The sight of long ear hairs, or neck hair going into the collar of your shirt, is never appealing. 4. Keep your nails short and clean: Dirty, long ngernails require no explanaion as to why they don't work. If your budget or schedule permits, try a monthly manicure/pedicure to have someone take care of this for you. I also recommend bung your nails as a way to keep the healthy shine without looking aricial. 5. Brush and floss your teeth daily: it doesn't matter if your teeth are not perfectly straight and white, but please keep them clean. It is rather unappealing to talk to someone and see built up plaque or food stuck between their teeth. I know this one seems simple, but trust me when I tell you to take nothing for granted. 6. Have your clothes tailored to t your body: This is a big one, as no matter what your shape is, the right t makes everything look so much better. 7. Stand up straight: posture is very important. You create a sense of condence and pride when standing tall, showing everyone you are secure in the man you are. 8. Cleanse your face on a regular basis with a facial soap: I have so many male friends who use the same soap on their body that they use on their face. Most body soaps are too strong for the face. You must invest in a cleanser that is just for the face. 9. Remember less is more when it comes to fragrance: It's all right to smell good, but everyone doesn't have to smell it. Fragrance is such a personal preference, and you really must nd the one that works best for you. Just remember not to bathe in it. 10. Match your belt to your shoes: This one is really simple and makes a world of dierence. If you are wearing black shoes, you don't wear a brown belt. I'm not saying you need to be a fashion plate, but this basic ip makes everything you wear look that much better. 4.1.3.2 Grooming Tips - For Women It is not just your work that talks for you, it is your gestures and how you bring yourself. Individual self- care or Personal self-care for females is as essenial as it is to men. How to sit, how to talk, when to talk, what to talk, may all seem fundamentals, but keep a lot of signi cance. 1- Look Fresh: The rst thing is to look fresh. This is the primary phase of your grooming. Have your nails nicely maintained. Prevent dressing in fancy shades that are too shiny or appealing. 2- Using Perfume: Use a mild fragrance. Too much of a fragrance may be frustraing to the individuals around you. Also, you must take care not to put on intensely fragrant products when you are in a business conference. 3- Using Makeup: Cosmeics should be easy and mild for ocial places of work. Use makeup that is not too little and neither too large. Do not wear too much lipsick that it propagates on the paper napkin or the cup when you take a sip of water. 4- Using Jewellery: You must not wear a lot of jewellery. Jewellery that is loud and too Yoga Instructor [Type text] [Type text] Page 33 huge would irritate individuals around a serious conversaion. Use easy jewellery to avoid clinging earrings, huge wristbands, etc. 5- Hair Style: Your hair style should be easy and neat looking. 6- Wearing proper dress: Normally when you are at work place, you need to be presentable. At work place, with business individuals around, you should dress rather cauiously. 4.1.5 Importance of Grooming Keeping clean is an important part of staying healthy. For example, the simple act of washing hands before eaing and after using the toilet is a proven and eecive tool for ghing o germs and avoiding sickness. Being clean and well -presented is also an important part of condence for teenagers. If your child's body and breath smell OK, his clothes are clean, and he's on top of his basic personal hygiene, it can help him t in with other people. The following health related problems can occur if one does not maintain good personal hygiene: 4.1.4 Consequences of Not Grooming Well One of the most eecive ways we have to protect ourselves and others from illness is good personal hygiene. This means washing your hands and have a bath too. It means being careful not to cough or sneeze on others, cleaning things that you touch if you are unwell, putting items such as issues (that may have germs) into a bin, and using protecion (like gloves or condoms) when you might be at risk of catching an infecion. Personal hygiene, such as bathing, is very much dependent on the culture in which you live. In some cultures, it is expected that you will wash your body at least every day and use deodorants to stop body smells. Other cultures have dierent expectaions. 7- Eaing in Public: Self-care also includes how you eat. Put the paper napkin on your lap. Make the lowest disturbance with the cutlery while you are consuming food. 8- Choosing Footwear: Wear comfortable and elegantly designed footwear. [Type text] [Type text] Page 34 4.1.5.3 Bad Breath Good dental hygiene includes regular brushing and flossing. Bad breath can be caused by diseases of the teeth, gums, and mouth, such as infecions. Most people have bad breath rst thing in the morning because saliva is not made while you're asleep. Bad breath proves another easily recognizable consequence of poor hygiene. It commonly develops from not regularly brushing and flossing your teeth. Bad breath results because of two main reasons. First, bacteria thrive on paricles of food that can sick to your teeth. As the bacteria digest this food, their byproduct results in odor. Food can also get stuck in your teeth and rot over ime, producing a foul odor, Some foods that can cause bad breath include garlic and onion. Mouthwashes, Mouth sprays, and flavored chewing gum can make your breath smell better for a while, but if you have a health problem in your mouth, you need to see your denist. 4.1.5.2 Hand Washing Most infecions, especially colds and gastroent eriis, are caught when we put our unwashed hands, which have germs on them, to our mouth. Some infecions are caught when other people's dirty hands touch the food we eat. Hands and wrists should be washed with clean soap and water, using a brush if your ngernails are dirty. Dry your hands with something clean, such as paper towels or hot air dryers. You should always wash your hands: \u00b7After using the toilet \u00b7Before making or eaing food \u00b7After handling dogs or other animals \u00b7If you have been around someone who is coughing or has a cold.4.1.5.1 Body Odor Fresh perspiraion, when allowed to evaporate does not cause body odor. An oensive smell is caused when bacteria that are present on the skin get to work on the sweat and decompose it. This is especially so in the groin, underarms, and feet or in clothing that has absorbed sweat. Diet influences the odor too. Bathing every day and changing of clothes that are in close contact with the body should take care of the problem. Talcum powders, of the non-medicated kind, can be used under the armpits. The addiion of perfumes masks the odor. Excessive perspiraion can lead to the scaling of the skin or inflammaion (Dermaiis). Usually, this is no cause for worry. Some people sweat more than others due to hereditary and body composiion factors. Excessive perspiraion may also be a symptom of diabetes, anemia, and hyperthyroidism. Body smells are caused by some factors working in combinaion, including: \u00b7Chemicals in sweat, including pheromones, which are made by the body and sexually attract (or repel) other people. \u00b7Wastes excreted through the skin, such as metabolized alcohol. \u00b7The acions of bacteria that live on the skin and feed on dead skin cells and sweat. \u00b7Unwashed clothes, such as underwear and socks.[Type text] [Type text] Page 35 4.1.5.7 Dental Disease Not only can poor dental hygiene lead to bad breath, but it can also lead to dental diseases. As you allow food paricles and bacteria to build up on the teeth, a coaing called plaque begins to form. The bacteria in this plaque release acid, which break down the enamel on your teeth. As this process coninues over ime, a hard substance called calculus can form on the teeth, irritaing the surrounding gums. This irritaion can progress into gingiviis, leading to inflammaion of the gums, which can later lead to gum disease. Gum disease causes infecion and eventually may destroy your teeth. 4.1.5.6 Building Good Hygiene Habits Building good hygiene habits is not a work of a day, it takes coninuous eorts. The following aciviies should be included in daily rouine - washing hands, covering mouth when coughed and having regular baths or showers. 4.1.5.5 Traveling Hygiene When traveling overseas, take special care if you're not sure whether the water is safe. Suggesions include: \u00b7Drink only bottled water. \u00b7Don't use tap water to clean your teeth. \u00b7When you wash your hands, make sure they are totally dry before you touch any food. \u00b7Don't wash fruit or vegetables in unsafe water. \u00b7If you have no other water source, make sure the water is boiled before you drink it by holding it at a rolling boil for one minute. \u00b7Make sure any dishes, cups or other utensils are totally dry after they are washed.4.1.5.4 Smelly Feet & Shoes Smelly feet and shoes can also be a problem for you, whether you are sporty or not. You can avoid this by giving your feet extra attenion in the shower, and make sure they're completely dry before putting your shoes on. It's a good idea to alternate your shoes and to wear cotton socks instead of socks made of syntheic sensaion during urinaion. Chances of urinary infecion increase during pregnancy and after major surgery. The urine can be discolored; itching, frequent urinaion, fever, and chills can also result from urinary infecion. To avoid this infecion, improve overall hygiene, both - toilets and personal parts. Wash or wipe front to back after urinaing or defecaing. Remember this when wiping or washing babies too, as a general rule. Do not wear ight- tting syntheic underwear. Drink plenty of water. Do not hold back when you have the tendency to urinate. If the condiion persists, consult a doctor. 4.1.5.11 Ear Wax Ear wax accumulates in the ear canal that leads from the outer ear to the eardrum. As the secreion comes out of the ear, it collects dust paricles. Do not reach farther than you can with your little nger into your ear to clean it. Putting in hair pins, safety pins or blunt edged objects for cleaning inner parts of the ear might harm the ear. Ear wax should be cleaned by your doctor. 4.1.5.10 Traveling Hygiene Lice are iny insects that live on the human scalp; they make a pin prick like a puncture on the scalp, emit an ani-clotting substance and feed on the blood as nourishment. Lice thrive on unclean hair. Children are especially prone to lice infestaion. Lice spread from one head to another when there is close contact, such as in school environments. Lice eggs are wrapped in a shiny white sheath and show upon the upper layers of hair as the infestaion increases. They make the scalp itchy and are a cause of annoyance and embarrassment. In infants, they may cause disturbed sleep and bouts of crying. Unchecked, they can produce scalp infecion. 4.1.5.9 Gender Speci c Men and women have unique hygiene needs that if ignored may lead to health problems. For example, men who have an uncircumcised penis need to regularly retract the foreskin and clean beneath to prevent inflammaion, phimosis (where the penis cannot fully retract the foreskin), or penile adhesions. Women must take care to keep the genitalia clean, and always wipe from front to back after using the restroom to prevent introducing infecions from the rectum to the urethra. 4.1.5.8 General Disease Hygiene pracices, such as washing your hands, prove the most eecive ways to prevent contracing disease and spreading disease, according to the Mayo Clinic and the Center for Disease Control and Prevenion (CDC). Your hands are in constant contact with both the environment and your face, providing easy transportaion from the surface of an infected object or person to your nose or mouth.
