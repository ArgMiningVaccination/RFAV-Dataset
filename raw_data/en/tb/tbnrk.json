There are also IgG delayed food allergy symptoms. How long does it take for an allergic reaction to go away? For most allergic reactions, the symptoms begin to fade away within a few hours after the allergen has been removed. They usually clear completely in about two days. Which medicine works best for skin allergies? Your doctor might prescribe antihistamines or topical creams containing hydrocortisone to treat skin allergies. However, antihistamines can cause drowsiness, and long-term use of hydrocortisone causes thinning skin. You can opt for alternative therapies like homeopathy, acupressure, or reflexology ( [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8057181/)).

Skin allergies usually remedy on their own within a week or two, but treatment may make you feel better in the meantime. However, in case of severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulty or puffiness in your throat, dial 911 immediately. How do you treat skin allergies in babies?
