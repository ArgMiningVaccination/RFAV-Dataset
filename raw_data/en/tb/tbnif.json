Providers need to be extremely careful in designing their immunity-boosting programs based on [science-backed practices](https://drprem.com/wellness/philippines-wellness-tourism-eyes-science-based-luxury-experience-for-rapid-growth/). - Focusing on Immunity-based Nutrition Eating a healthy diet tops the priority list in maintaining the well-being of a human body. Many of us surpass the advantages a balanced diet can have over our day-to-day living. Our immune system is the sum-total of the guardians of our body which enables it to resist infection under normal conditions. Immunity depends on proper nutrition, physical fitness, age and environment. When this natural immunity is taken for granted by poor nutritional status and other conditions, a person may develop infections. If the person is in a poor nutritional state, an attack of common infectious diseases can endanger life itself. - Crafting customized Diet Plans One should identify the kind of food that suits an individual. We often get caught up in the latest fads of nutrition and readily adopt it by plunging into it for the hype being created. But we are unaware that every body type is different. What works for one needn't work for the other. Wellness resorts can create customized [immunity-boosting food](https://drprem.com/globalhealthcare/list-immune-system-boosters) plans for the guest, be it for the purpose to boost immunity or for a fitness freak who needs to stick to one's limited calorie intake of the day. As healthy food is the most vital form of living, it can go ahead and become the USP of the wellness resort. One cannot deny the benefits of clean eating where innovative nutrition plans can be custom-made to create a happy brood of healthy guests. With the classification of food and the role of a proper diet, holistic nutritionists can establish remarkable changes in the lives of their clients. They can imbibe these healthy practices into their daily routine life. Hereon, your wellness resort experience will have a permanent space carved into their well-being, evolving a layperson into a conscious eater. - Promote mindful eating Introduction of [mindful eating](https://drprem.com/globalhealthcare/10-tips-for-adding-mindfulness-to-your-meal) diets like The Paleo Diet, The Blood Type Diet, The Vegan Diet, The South Beach Diet, can be made a part of the wellness resort programme. Ancient Indian methods of Ayurvedic Diet can become an integral part of the approach to a healthy envisioned lifestyle. Imagine the treasure of knowledge your clients will be taking back home as a takeaway. Workable diet plans can be crafted suitably as per as the physician's recommendations and diet restrictions. The holistic kitchen at a wellness retreat can create a menu adhering to the doctor's advice. The healing of the guest should be the priority of a wellness retreat. - Detoxification is the key Your liver and kidneys should work at an apogee to expel toxins built-up within the body. In that sense, eating sattvic foods or taking organic herbal supplements high in antioxidants, magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, D and drinking healthy juices can help in the detoxification of your system. This would thus aid in developing your natural immunity to fight viral infections. Detoxifying herbal massage therapy like [Panchakarma](https://drprem.com/wellness/look-effectiveness-panchakarma-healing-system/), or among the western ones like Lymphatic Drainage Massage or body treatment featuring Dead Sea salt and mud have a lasting impact for weeks making you fill with vigor and rejuvenated. Such therapies aim at cleansing your system by increasing the blood flow inside the body and build immunity. - Create resistance-building workout programs [Wellness resorts](https://drprem.com/wellness/top-100-wellness-resorts-in-the-world/) need to select resistance-building physical exercises and workouts to stimulate different glands in producing immunity-boosting hormones. The workouts should be aimed to manage chronic conditions, if any, and stimulate the circulatory system to build resistance protecting the body from deadly microbial and inflammatory invasions. - Tap natural resources Destination resorts have a great opportunity to create great immunity-boosting programs by wisely tapping natural resources. It could be Thermal springs, exotic herbs, [salt caves (halotherapy)](https://drprem.com/wellness/know-about-salt-therapy/) and the like. Various such programs could be integrated with specific mind-body practices and other activities to offer a great wellness experience that would be long lasting. The resorts will have to pay special attention to infrastructure rearrangement by creating special spaces for these programs. - Guide work-rest balance Severe disruptions in work-rest balance leads to a dip in body immunity.

If this persists, people develop immunity-related ailments which in course of time becomes difficult to manage. Wellness resorts can help guests in building a healthy work-rest routine through specific programs. Under proper guidance, setting into regularity will not be an issue at all whatever may be other life commitments. - Get professional Expertise in Holistic Healing Since past centuries, we have heavily relied on Western medicine, i.e Allopathic medication which is known to treat only the symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery, rather than the source of the disease. This approach to treating health issues is useful when fast recovery is a mandate. In the long run, this approach might further end up suppressing the symptoms of the actual disease making it a deep-seated problem for life.

Here are some of the common programs offered in immunity-boosting retreats to reinforce the in-built body immunity. - Oxygen Therapy Our body symptoms are all connected and one thing leads to the other like a domino effect.
