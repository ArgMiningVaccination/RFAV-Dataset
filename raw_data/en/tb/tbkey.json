There were too many days when they were frazzled from meetings, deadlines, and interruptions. Even though they were long-time advocates and practitioners of meditation, they couldn't stop in the middle of the day to meditate and regain that feeling of calmness, clarity and focus. They were aware of the stress relieving benefits of botanicals and adaptogens (natural substances that help the body adapt to stress, for example, ginseng). Adaptogens, similar to meditation, increase the alpha brainwaves that \"reset\" your mind, reducing the stress and increasing mental clarity. Could they formulate a drink from such ingredients? Aisha and Faheem researched hundreds of ingredients from around the world, many of them from their multicultural backgrounds, all supported by scientific studies, and all super healthy. They mixed up thousands of experimental batches in their kitchen. They were looking for healthy, nutritious and delicious and succeeded with [Moment](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1673157&u=1225712&m=103824), a proprietary formula of natural ingredients that increase alpha brainwaves and reduce stress. Think of how you feel after a brisk walk or some deep cleansing breaths\u2014soothed and invigorated. That's what Moment does for you. Together they founded Moment, LLC, with Faheem as CEO and Aisha as CFO. Faheem is a serial entrepreneur from South Africa. His first business was selling shirts on the side of the road when he was 10 years old. His last startup was funded by Google and was selected as the best startup in South Africa. He graduated from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor in Business Science in Economics, Statistics and Finance. He is a certified by the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute. Aisha grew up in South Asia and the Middle East, She has over 10 years of supply chain and logistics expertise on four continents. After spending two weeks on business in South Africa, she moved there, met Faheem, and then pursued an MBA at Harvard Business School. Her BS in Finance, Economics and Social Sciences is from the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Pakistan. Aisha and Faheem were all too familiar with the sugar-laden, caffeinated drinks that are readily available in the workplace and with their aftereffects. They wanted to create a beverage as readily available that would provide some of the benefits of meditation\u2014not as a substitute but as a supplement. Once people started feeling the clarity and calmness provided by Moment, they may want to explore extending the feeling with meditation.
