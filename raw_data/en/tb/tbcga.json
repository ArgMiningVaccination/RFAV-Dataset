I'm here to offer insight and advice that helps both those who choose to get vaccinated as well as those who prefer not to but still want to educate their immune system. Our immune systems are brilliantly intelligent and once they are properly educated, they do wonders to protect us. Homeopathy or homeopathic medicine is a medical system that was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago. It's based on two principles. You may or may not have heard of something called Homeoprophylaxis. It is a safe method of disease prevention that has no chemicals or preservatives or other excipients. It can exercise and educate the immune system in a logical way that provides immunity. If this is of interest to you, you can pick up the incredible book called [The Solution: HOMEOPROPHYLAXIS: The Vaccine Alternative](https://thewholejourney.com/homeopathysolutionbook). There is something called a homeopathic nosode available for many diseases and disorders including COVID-19. A nosode is a homeopathic remedy of inactivated micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses, or products of disease - fluids, discharge, or tissue. The homeopathic manufacturing process inactivates and removes dangerous source material but retains its energetic effects so that the remedy is safe for use. There is a nosode available for COVID-19 and now there are several studies out to prove its efficacy. One such study was of 437 people who took the covid nosode and then were exposed to multiple and various strains of coronavirus and no one got it.

I love [Willow Buckley](http://balancingyourhealth.com/) (also my co-author and dear friend) who is an FHCI supervisor locally. She is a brilliant homeopath locally and takes clients remotely. [Jack Tips](https://wellnesswiz.com/) is also an exceptional homeopath who can send you the nosode and administer his specific protocol (different than the above study). You may also email him directly about it as he is passionate about education and service. His email is [jack@wellnesswiz.com](mailto:jack@wellnesswiz.com). Homeopathic physicians have helped humanity for years with the side effects of vaccinations. In doing so, they have traditionally employed three remedies: Ledum pal., Silicea, and Thuja occ. This short protocol helps the body process the toxic adjuvants that are included in vaccines to insult the immune system and thereby help gain antibodies. But the body must also process toxic elements such as mercury, aluminum, propylene glycol, latex, and PEG. Taking the homeopathic remedy does not interfere with the vaccination process and it does not negate the vaccination in any way. It simply helps a person adjust and respond more favorably to the vaccination experience. 1: Mud pack the site by mixing just a little bit of [bentonite clay](https://thewholejourney.com/medi-clay) with water and applying it to the skin before you put on the band-aid. 2: You can pick up these little blue homeopathic vials at any health food store or click the links below to get them on Amazon. Alternatively, you can contact Jack's office for all-in-one homeopathic with different doses customized to the vaccine you are employing for $21 at jack@wellnesswiz.com. Traditionally, a person about to be vaccinated takes one dose of the remedy an hour or less BEFORE the injection. Then, take the remedy hourly thereafter on the day of taking the injections. Then after that first day, the remedy is used four times a day until it runs out.
