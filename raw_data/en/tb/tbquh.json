Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 5 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 Our community Our members are at the heart of everything we do. The United Kingdom is a world leader in immunological research and immunology underpins many aspects of recent advances in our knowledge of human and animal health and dise ase. As the largest professional immunology network in Europe, we aim to be a friendly, accessible community for immunologists from all disciplines, which supports diversity and works across different sectors and national borders. We work with members from across the whole spectrum of discipline, from basic science through to clinical application, to support cu rrent and future generations of immunologists. Our members benefit from discounts to our meet ings, free access to our journals, grants, bursaries and much more. Additionally, we prov ide multiple opportunities for our members to network and engage with our community through ac tivities such as our Regional and Affinity Groups, training events or social media projects. We also work with our members to use the collective voice of our community to repres ent immunology at the highest levels. At the end of 2016/17 we had 3,024 members from 56 countries around the world and representing all levels of immunology careers from undergraduates to senior professionals. \"The world's premier immunology society! I am proud to have been a member for so long.\" What do you like most about being a member of the BSI? \"The feeling of belonging to a society which cares, promotes and advances immunology in the UK. Excellent staff\" Updating our systems To allow us to improve our understanding of and engagement with our membership, this year saw the BSI take on a large project to launch a new CRM - or Customer Relationship Management system. This is the digital tool that hosts our membership database, personalises user-experience and enables func tional improvements, such as the ability to better handle online payments for events and membership. Our new CRM launched in December 2016, mean ing that we can now offer an improved service to our members. Security improvements have come hand in hand with this modernisation and comprehensive testing has ensu red that our website is held to the highest standards of data security. Regional and Affinity Groups \"The Regional and Affinity Groups represent much of the core activity of the BSI that continues throughout the year across the country. The sc ientific discussions and networking that takes place at these meetings are invaluable for the continued development of immunology. The strengths of the Regional Group meetings ar e to bring together immunologists without the need to travel great distances, saving both money and time, and strengthening local research networks. The Affinity Groups have all been cr eated to focus meetings and discussions on specific areas of immunology, and they continue to evolve as new areas of research in immunology expand.\" John Curnow, Groups & Meetings Secretary. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 6 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Regional and Affinity Groups (continued) Key activities of the Regional and Affinity Groups through the year included: 19 Regional Groups 16 Affinity Groups 14 research conferences 136 seminars 2 careers events 3 public engagement events \"We consider our seminar series as a major educational tool, and found that 20-30 undergraduate students attended the seminars for much of the year, as well as members of the university's research faculty .\" Brian Ferguson, BSI Cambridge Immunology Group Chair Keeping you informed It's important to us that we have good comm unications channels with our members and the wider world, meaning we can be clear about our activities and how they benefit immunology. We also want to engage with and hear back from our members and those interested in our work. To this end, over the past 18 months, we have refreshed many of our communication channels to make sure they are fit for func tion, informative and easily accessible. New website In December 2016, we launched our brand new website. Now with a mobile friendly design, the easy-to-navigate pages and layout mean that visitors benefit from an improved user experience, which makes it easier to find and ac cess the information. Following feedback, we have also launched a blog section of the websit e which provides us with a space to tell you more about our work and respond in more detail to topical issues affecting our community. Additionally, we have integrated our BiteSized Immunology education product into the main website, meaning that visitors can find a ll the information they need on the one site. Alongside the website, our email communications system has also undergone an upgrade and redesign to allow us to connect with our members and supporters more effectively. Immunology News Our flagship quarterly magazine, Immunology News , was recently redesigned to help us communicate more effectively with our members. This includes regular feature articles by leading immunologists, an education and careers section, an increased focus on our journals and more information on our activities. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 7 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Social media Our social media channels are becoming increasingly important in allowing us to engage with a wider audience, interact with our supporte rs, spread the word about our work and why immunology is great. At the end of June 2017, we had 3,862 followers on Twitter and 23,429 Facebook likes. Influence and impact: spreading the word of immunology The UK is a world leader in immunology rese arch and we are now witnessing how decades of investment and research into immunity ar e yielding breakthroughs in the treatment of critical disease areas such as infection, cancer, autoimmunity and allergy. However, with this success, it becomes more important for us to give a powerful voice to immunological science and health and advocate on relevant issues for t he benefit of society. This means a significant part of our current strategy is to put imm unology centre stage in the public arena to be discussed and engaged with. Engaging with stakeholders Through our policy and public affairs work, we aim to engage with policymakers and stakeholders to ensure the viewpoi nt and interests of immunologists are heard loud and clear. Over the past year, we have: Held 18 meetings with MPs and key stakeholders Participated in stakeholder network meeti ngs with the Royal Society of Biology and Association of Medical Research Charities Run a campaign to inspire our members to engage with their parliamentary candidates in the run up to the UK's General Election Produced seven briefings and position statements Published our report ' Immunology: an international, lifesaving science' Produced a briefing that was quoted in the October 2016 House of Lords debate on UK's withdrawal from EU Contributed three consultation responses Collaborated with external organisations such as the Medical Research Council and the Welcome Trust, to new schemes of works in areas such as vaccine research Run campaign to encourage members to engage with their MP over Article 50 and implications for the life sciences. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 8 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Immunology and the UK's life sciences industry Immunology sits at the very heart of the dr ug development process, with the discipline underpinning over half the pipeline products of t he top five R&D investors in the UK. With the government planning a comprehensive and ambitious new industrial strategy, this report is our contribution to highlight the importance of immunology to the life sciences sector. We make recommendations for actions the government should take to support life sciences sector in seven priority areas, from how to make the most of our transition out of the EU following Brexit, to making the most of the re search potential of our unique NHS. Working with partners Working with partner organisations to build on common interests is a key part of our strategy. This year, we collaborated with the Academy of Medical Sciences to contribute to their report on how we can all best use scientific evidence, which highlights the significant difficulties patients and some healthcare professionals face in using evidence from research to judge the benefits and harms of medicines and makes re commendations to improve the situation. \"Engaging with patients, funders and the public to clearly communicate the science behind these medical innovations and in turn listen to t heir viewpoints and concerns is a key part of our role as doctors and scientists. Providing accurate and accessible information on medical innovations and educating people on how to judge the benefits and harms of medicines should be seen as an integral part of developing any new treatment. It is only by working in close partnership with patients, clearly and honestly explaining the scientific evidence, that we can fully realise the huge potential that 21st century medical science offers.\" Professor Peter Openshaw, BSI President Public engagement In 2016, the BSI decided to pause and evaluate our public engagement activities to ensure that they were in line with our charitable remit, meeting our organisation's aims and making the most of our limited resource s. With our new five-year strategic plan in place, our new challenge has been to identify the most succes sful and important aspects of immunology and to create a strategic programme that will rais e the profile of and increase engagement with immunology amongst the public. Vaccine ambassadors - growing immunity in our community Through our public engagement activities, we aim to ensure that the public benefits from immunology's success, making one of our priorities to encourage immunisation uptake and to provide reliable information on vaccines and i mmunity to those who need or want it. Our research showed that new parents and carers want the opportunity to have an informed discussion with experts about immunisations and the immune system more generally. This year, we have piloted the BSI Vacci ne Ambassador Scheme, wh ich facilitates BSI members engaging with new and expectant parents on vaccines and immunity. Vaccine ambassadors attend local nurseries, community groups, antenatal and po stnatal classes and take part in these discussions with the ultimate aim of making parents feel more confident in their ability to make informed choices on their child's health and vaccines. The pilot of this project is due to be completed in Autumn 2017, with plans to evaluate and expand the project nationwide at the start of 2018. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 9 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) #BritainBreathing #BritainBreathing is our citizen science project that aims to engage the UK public to act as 'citizen sensors' to help scientists discover more about seasonal allergies such as hay fever or asthma. Working in partnership with The University of Manchester and the Royal Society of Biology, we have developed an app which allows the public to record their allergy symptoms in a simple and straightforward way and then safe ly share that data with the project team. Our aim is to work with the public to better unde rstand (both on a national scale and for the individual) when allergy symptoms are occurring and what the triggers for these might be. The project launched in 2016 and this year represents our second season collecting data. Media highlights Through our media work, we aim to promote evidence-based and accurate coverage of immunology in the news and ensure that journalis ts have access to relevant experts who can provide knowledgeable responses. This may be through providing expert comment to breaking news stories, working with programme researchers to shape TV or radio broadcasts or through highlighting research from our journals or meetings. This year, we also ran our first media training sessions for members, with the ai m to equip them with the skills to be confident to speak to the press about immunology. Over the past year, we had: Media enquiries statements: 24 Articles in the UK national press: 44 Articles in the worldwide press: over 300 Supporting the next generation The BSI wishes to be a hub of expertise on fo rging strong immunology ca reers, whatever the sector in which people work. It is essential that our members feel supported at every stage of their career and one of our core responsibilities is to offer appropriate careers and educational support to current and future generations of immunologists throughout their careers. We do this through a number of ongoing activities, such as our highly popular grants schemes and our education website BiteSized Immunology, and through new initiatives we are in the process of developing, in line with our strategic plan. BiteSized Immunology \"BiteSized Immunology is an online resource wh ich provides a comprehensive overview of the immune system, delivered in short self-contained articles, which highlight the major 'take home' messages. These articles are designed for use by bioscience undergraduates, A-level students and anyone who is encountering immunology for the first time.\" Helen Collins, BSI Education Secretary Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 10 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) BiteSized Immunology (continued) This year, along with migrating the BiteSized Immunology content to our new website, we have started to review and refresh the articles to ensure the content is accurate, current and relevant. To oversee this process, we've recruited a number of BSI members to join our new Editorial Board who will review current content and commission additional content to fill any gaps. Each month, BiteSized Immunology receives an average of: 22,750 page views from users in 132 countries \"I cannot recommend BiteSized Immunology enough as a resource for teaching (and as a refresher)\" Lesley Hoyles @BugsinyourGut New for 2017 Review of immunology careers To better understand the career progression of immunologists and the challenges they face, we have commissioned a review of immunology careers, which will help to target our future activities in this area. This review consists of several pieces of work including a careers survey, analysis of academic workforce and tra cking the career destinations of immunology PhD students. The findings will be published in October 2017. Immunology Teaching Excellence Award To recognise outstanding teachers at higher edu cation institutes across the UK, we have launched the Immunology Teaching Excellence Award. The first recipient will be announced in December 2017. Mentoring scheme Our new mentoring scheme aims to supp ort professional development amongst the immunology community, bringing together senior sc ientists with early career researchers to assist the next generation of immunologists with career developm ent and progression. The call for participants is now out and the pilot scheme will launch in December 2017. BSI Summer School relaunched The essential training course for PhD students and early career postdocs. The first event took place in July 2017. Grants to support you A significant proportion of our funds are di stributed to our members through our grant schemes to support their research, help them attend conferences and assist them in running public engagement activities. In 2016/17 \u00a3112,044 was awarded in grants to 237 BSI members and others (2016: \u00a3104,271 to 119). Travel Awards We awarded 187 Travel Awards to members in 2016/17 totalling \u00a387,905, including 79 members funded to attend the BSI Congress and 16 to attend the 2017 Summer School. \"It was a fantastic opportunity which I woul d never have been able to take up without the support of the BSI, so I would like to thank them for giving me the chance to attend this amazing meeting!\" Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 11 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Summer Placement Awards These grants offer medical and postgraduat e students funding to undertake a formal immunology placement in a selected laboratory. In 2016/17 six placements were funded at a cost of \u00a39,000. \"My elective was better than I could ever have dreamed of. The place and the people were fantastic. I left eager to start my foundation training and even more determined to make immunological research a significant part of my future career.\" Charlotte Grant, Summer Placement grant recipient Communicating Immunology Grants We supported 11 projects through this scheme with the aim of stimulating interest, discussion and understanding of immunology amongst a wider audience. Projects ranged from stands at science fairs and funding education films to supporting a trip to Madagascar to educate rural communities on parasites. A total of \u00a38,665 was spent in 2016/17. Undergraduate Achievement Awards Through this scheme, we supported 17 univers ity departments to promote excellence in the study of immunology at undergraduate level, and encourage gifted students to pursue a career in immunology. Full details of all Society grants can be found at www.immunology,org/grants-and-prizes 60 years of the British Society for Immunology When a small group of immunologists founded the British Society for Immunology 60 years ago, they could hardly have foreseen the explosion of knowledge that would follow. To mark our 60th anniversary in 2016, we ran a number of events and projects ai med at celebrating the rich history of our discipline while also looking forward to future innovations. Anniversary lecture Sixty years on, and another group of immunologist s gathered, this time in the comfortable surroundings of the Royal Society, to attend our anniversary lecture and hear about 'The changing nature of research'. Over 200 peopl e attended a special meeting at the Royal Society to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the BSI. While there was no red carpet, it was a 'Who's Who' of British immunologists. Immunology: past, present and future With the UK currently ranking as first amongst the G7 for the quality of our research in infection and immunology, we wanted to use our 60th anniversary to celebrate the breadth and depth of the discipline. To do this, we commi ssioned a report to discuss key areas where immunology has and will have a significant impact on our understanding of human and animal biology, our ability to treat and even cure commo n diseases and our capacity to deal with emerging threats on a global scale. This was disseminated to our members and key stakeholders with excellent feedback receiv ed. You can read the whole report at http://bit.ly/60yearimm. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 12 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Immunology in 60 objects We chose 60 objects to tell the story of immunology over time, each object suggested by a BSI member to tell the tale of a specific disc overy, new technique or step change in thinking in our wonderful discipline. We released one ob ject per day and at the end of the project, our supporters voted for which they felt had made t he most significant contribution to immunology. The project proved supremely popular and the winner, by quite some margin, was the structure of the antibody, a di scovery for which Gerald Edelman and Rodney Porter won the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 1972. You can view all the objects at www.immunology.org/days. Journals The BSI's original ethos still lies at the heart of our Society - to disseminate research with the aim of promoting and advancing immunology to foster future innovation. The BSI is proud to achieve this aim through the publication of our two official journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology . Working with the publisher Wiley, our journals provide a significant proportion of the Society's income. Over the past year, the two journals have undergone a strategic review to ensure they maintain their position in the face of the digital and editorial innovations currently taking place in the publishing industry. New initiatives include building on our relationship with Wiley, the journals' publishers, to ensure we work togethe r to maximise output and effectiveness. We have also conducted a review of the editorial bo ards and are looking to bring on new associate editors. We were pleased to welcome Ananda Goldrath as an associate editor at Immunology in April, and more appointments will follow shortly. 2017 saw a change in leadership at Clinical & Experimental Immunology , with Mark Peakman stepping down as Editor-in-Chief after a successf ul eight years in office, which saw sustained growth of the journal. He is succeeded by Leonie Taams who will take the strategic work on the journal forward. The current Editor-in-Chief of Immunology is Danny Altmann, who has recently extended his term of o ffice for another three years. Our grateful thanks to all the editors, review ers, authors and readers whose devotion to the field of immunology and interest in our journals is vital to their continued good health. Journals income for 2016/17 was very strong at \u00a31,298,288 (2016: \u00a31,153,305). This strong income is essential to being able to s upport the other activities of the BSI. Special issues Clinical & Experimental Immunology From bench to clinic - highlights in translational immunology research Immunosenescence in health and disease Immunology Drivers and regulators of adapt ive immunity - new concepts Editor's Choice Specialised innate and adaptive immune subsets Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 13 Impact and Achievements 2016/2017 (continued) Special issues (continued) Joint Highlights in autoimmunity: pathogenesis, pathol ogy and clinical features of disease Raising the online profile of articles With online conversations becoming increasingly important in the promotion and recognition of new research, the BSI journals have embrac ed our viral traits and gone social. 2017 saw the launch of new Twitter channels for each of our journals, @CEIjournal and @immjournal. This, along with an increased focus on educating our authors and membership on how to promote their work on social media, has led to an increase in Altmetric scores this year. Working in Scotland The BSI is a national and international organisa tion and has strong links to and undertakes a wide variety of work in Scotland. This incl udes having over 350 members living or working in Scotland. The BSI Forum structure includes a regional representative from Scotland. The BSI has four regional groups based in Scotland, the Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Tayside and West of Scotland Regional Groups, as well as active members of our national affinity groups based in Scotland. During 2016/17 the Scottish regional groups held 25 events including 2 symposiums and 23 seminars which were attende d by over 1,100 people. The BSI provided financial support of approximately \u00a314,000 as we ll as administrative and marketing support for these events. Working with international partners BSI/NVVI Congress 2016 In 2016, we held a Joint Congress with the Dutch Society for Immunology (NVVI) in Liverpool. We were delighted to welcome over 1,600 immu nologists from around the world with the international aspect of the congr ess appreciated by all. Akiko Iwasaki from Yale University gave an outstanding keynote lecture and this wa s followed by a plethora of plenary talks and invited lectures from leading researchers acro ss the spectrum of immunology.

The full rules for the appointment of Trustees, and their obligations , are contained within the Memorandum & Articles of Association. As part of their induction process, Trustees spend some time at head office, with the Chief Executive and staff. They are pr ovided with a trustee resource pack and are taken through a number of key areas outlining the history of the Society, background information, job description, areas of re sponsibility and useful information from the Charity Commission. Trustees are briefed on key areas of governance, strategy and activity. All Trustees and senior staff completed and retur ned statements of interest and conflict of interest documentation. No issues arose from these during the year. Governance and management The Trustees set the strategic direction for the BSI, oversee its financial and legal responsibilities and duty, and provide advice a nd support for all areas of activity. The Chief Executive Officer, Jo Revill, is also Company Secretary. She has responsibility for running and operating the group and the charity on a day to day basis with support from a senior management team. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 18 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Governance and management (continued) The British Society for Immunology is govern ed by a Board of Trustees which has legal responsibility for the organisati on. The Board meets quarterly. Eight members of the Board are nominated and elected by BSI members. Members of the Board may serve for a renewable period of four years. The Board c an also appoint up to four co-opted members for a renewable period of four years. Remuneration policy Following a review of the BSI staff pay policy and system undertaken in early 2016, all BSI staff salaries were fully benchmarked to other charity roles. The Board decided to adopt a new pay and performance system which was introduced in January 2017 for all staff, including the Senior Management Team. The Finance Sub-Committee considers remuneration, and recommends to the Board an annual pay awar d, based on market rates and cost of living. There is a small discretionary element ba sed on fulfilment of strategic goals. This is linked to the BSI's performance and appraisal proc esses. The Chief Executive's pay is set by the Board as well as a discretionary bonus, dependent on fulfilment of strategic goals. Details of key management personnel for the BSI and the total remuneration awarded to them during the year is included in note 9. Committees In addition to the Board of Trustees, the BSI has several committees which support its work and answer to the Board. T he Finance Sub-Committee is chai red by the Treasurer, includes two co-opted trustees, and the CEO, and is attended by the Finance & Business Director. The main purpose is to consider, decide and advis e on financial and investment matters pertaining to the BSI, including remuneration and risk. The Forum is a representative body of up to 20 members and is responsible for developing policy and advising on communications, education and public engagement work. This body has no legal or management responsibility and meets quarterly. The content of the Society's sci entific programme, particularl y that of its annual meeting, Congress, is the responsibility of the Congress Committee. This is a committee of up to 20 members who meet three times a year. The Clinical Committee of the Society meets qua rterly and represents a range of clinicians, trainees, patient representatives and nurses. The BSI membership is also supported by more than 30 Regional Groups or Affinity Groups with a specialist interest. These groups run their own programmes of meetings and are supported by the Society, financially and someti mes administratively. The representatives of these groups meet formally, face to face, onc e a year, at the Regional and Affinity Groups committee meeting, chaired by the Groups Secretary. The BSI's journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology are published in partnership with Wiley. The Journals Co mmittee meets annually and comprises the BSI President and Treasurer, the Editors-in-Chief, BSI staff members and colleagues from Wiley. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 19 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Committees (continued) The Society also has a Patient Advisory Panel . The group comprises patient group members who represent the interest of patients with a wide range of immunological disorders and also has regional representation. The BSI Clinical Secretary, and the CEO are also on the committee. Risk management Risks to the group and the charity are reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Trustees, the Finance Sub-Committee and the Senior Mana gement Team. Key risks are reviewed at each meeting and the full risk register reviewed twice a year, which includes reviewing actions and mitigations to be undertaken. The Trustees have reviewed risks to the Soci ety and have identified the following key risks and have put in place mitigations to manage the risk: Failure to find new or diverse sources of income to decrease reliance on traditional journals income Underlying the strategy is a commitment for BSI to be less reliant on traditional journals income through diversifying, increasing other income or finding new income sources to enable us to do more. Sponsorship income is being rais ed in different areas across BSI with some success, while we also have new corporate membership packages in place from 2017 and trust and foundations fundraising has begun. Partnership working, both income generating and non-income generating, is a key priority moving forward. Impact of domestic and / or international politics and environment International political changes could impact on the BSI consider ably as they will impact on members, funding for research, for collaboration and networks. The vote to leave the EU will impact on access to EU science funding, access to talent, disrupting networks, changing relationship with EFIS, but it is unclear what impact it will have on BSI. It may affect our international reputation by making us seem less relevant or connected. With the US, major cuts in funding for Science could follow through to libraries, impacting on journals income. Staff are currently assessing the si tuation as it arises with a lot of information being shared between science bodies. This includes being re sponsive to updates in the situation and making public responses from the President's to the media, our members and international colleagues, to stress the BSI's focus on global collaboration and networks. We will continue our work on policy and public affairs to put in place a plan for emphasising BSI's international role and the UK's position on research. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 20 Financial review Results for the year It was a very positive year for the BSI financi ally with an overall surplus of \u00a3231,187 (2016: deficit \u00a315,367), increasing the balance shee t value to \u00a33,158,715 (2016: \u00a32,927,528). Overall, revenue was \u00a32,046,871 compared to \u00a31,436,182 in 2015/16 with a number of key revenue areas accounting for the increase. Jour nals income continues to be the main source of revenue with \u00a31,298,288, an increase of \u00a3144,983 against the 2015/16 income of \u00a31,153,305. This increase is in part due to exchange rate movements, however it is very welcome to see journals income continuing to th rive in uncertain times. A very successful Congress led to income of \u00a3532,172 from a combination of registration fees, exhibition and sponsorship income. There was no Congress in 2015/16 and so this accounts for a large amount of the overall income increase. Invest ment income also saw an increase from \u00a31,192 to \u00a346,859. This was due to reflecting the dividend income from the investment portfolio which had been reinvested, although in previous years, this had been netted off against unrealised gains (losses) on investments. Partnership wo rk, a key priority moving forward, increased from \u00a37,900 to \u00a329,115, through sponsorship and donations from a number of key partners. There were some areas of income that saw a reduction from 2015/16 including membership, advertising, exhibitions and sponsorship and othe r meetings and events. Membership income reduced as the accounting treatment for me mbership income was changed from January 2017 to reflect new membership categories and multi-year memberships. Previously, membership had been accounted for on a cash basis, but from January 2017 is phased according to the period to which the income relates. This has resulted in a one-off reduction in accounting for the revenue for 2016/17. R eductions in advertising, exhibitions and sponsorship and other meetings and events all relates to events that were held in 2015/16 but were not held in 2016/17. Expenditure also increased year on year from \u00a31,405,415 in 2015/16 to \u00a31,967,547 in 2016/17. This increase was almost entirely due to the direct costs of Congress which stood at \u00a3540,362 (2016: \u00a3nil). The allocation of support costs of \u00a3492,942 (2016: \u00a3493,533 restated) is different from 2015/16 due to the basis being on direct costs and Congress having such a high proportion of the over all direct costs. The Society continues to prioritise key areas of expenditure to support the delivery of the strategy including policy and public affairs, education and careers, public engagement, international and communications whilst also continuing to support membership activities th rough ongoing and significa nt support of awards and grants, meetings and member ship services. Alongside this, the journals are supported through the funding of the editorial team and marketing. The Senior Management Team and Board of Tr ustees have successfully focussed over the past two years on managing support costs and ens uring that efficiencies can be made where possible in order to free up resources to support charitable activities. This work will continue in the future. In 2015/16 the Board of Trustees took the decis ion to allocate \u00a3300,000 from the unrestricted reserves to a designated fund to be used to inve st in the development of the BSI. During 2016/17 \u00a380,958 (2016: \u00a379,312) was allocated across a number of areas including membership development (\u00a33,220), educat ion and careers (\u00a313,575) and website development (\u00a333,343). Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 21 Financial review (continued) Results for the year (continued) BSI set up a trading company in May 2016, BSI Trading Limited, which had little activity in 2016/17 but will see growth in 2017/18 as all ex hibition and sponsorship income for Congress 2017 will be included within the trading company. Investment powers, policy and performance During 2016/17 BSI undertook a review of investment managers and, following a competitive tendering exercise, made the decision to appoint Standard Life Wealth as our new and sole investment managers. The transition took place during the year and by the year end all investments were held by Standard Life Wealth. Standard Life Wealth has been appointed as a di scretionary fund manager, with all investment decisions made by them in accordance with the investment policy and direction agreed by the Board of Trustees and overseen by the Finance Sub-Committee. Standard Life Wealth report on a quarterly basis and meet with the Finance Sub-Committee twice a year. The BSI does not require a regular annual income from the investment portfolio, however from time to time, may choose to use income fr om investments to support its activities. The Trustees have reviewed their investment po licy with regard to the Charity Commission's guidance on ethical and responsible investment. The Trustees aim to observe responsible investment principles and will work with investment managers to ensure that no direct investment is made in companies with involvement in the production of arms or considerable involvement in the production of tobacco. The charity's investment managers are expected to take into consideration the environmental, so cial and governance charac teristics of existing and prospective investments, where this is practicable and proportionate in the context of the overall investment strategy. Investment performance against policy Following the transfer of our investment portfolio management to Standard Life Wealth in December 2016, the long term investment objective is to generate a capital return of 3.5% in excess of inflation (as measured by RPI) over a rolling 3-year period. The performance of this objective will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Reserves policy The Trustees recognise the need to hold sufficient free reserves to ensure the protection of our core activities in the event of income shortfall and economic downturns, and to allow balanced long-term strategic planning. The Trustees set a target range for free reserves based on holding sufficient funds to cover two years of operating expenditure. On the basis of the 2017/18 budget, the target range for fr ee reserves is between \u00a32,600,000 to \u00a33,100,000. The target range of reserves will be recalculated on an annual basis as part of budget setting and planning. Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 22 Financial review (continued) Reserves policy (continued) At 30 June 2017, the free reserves stood at \u00a32,934,944 (2016: \u00a32,628,399) comprising the general funds balance excluding fixed assets. The Trustees decided to hold, as part of the unrestricted funds, a designated fund to enable investment in the strategic development of the organisation. At 30 June 2017 this designated reserve stood at \u00a3139,730 (2016: \u00a3220,688). This is in line with the policy above. Financial position The ongoing uncertainty associated with changes in academic publishing continues to make future income difficult to forecast; however, the strong reserves position gives the Society flexibility to respond to changes in the publishing business in the future. They further ensure that, should income fall, the Society will cont inue to be able to deliver membership benefits while dealing with these changes. Net assets of \u00a33,158,715 (2016: \u00a32,927,528) gives BSI a secure financial base in which to continue to deliver its strategic priorities over the coming years. Statement of Trustees' responsibilities The Trustees (who are also directors of Brit ish Society for Immunology for the purposes of company law) are responsible for preparing t he Trustees' report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law and Unit ed Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Company law requires the Trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charity and of the income and expenditure of the charity for that period. In preparing these financial st atements, the Trustees are required to: select suitable accounting policie s and then apply them consistently; observe the methods and principles in Account ing and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable to the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102); make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charity will continue in operation. The Trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charity and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of t he charity and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Each of the Trustees confirms that: Trustees' Report Year to 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 23 Statement of Trustees' responsibilities (continued) so far as the Trustee is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the charity's auditor is unaware; and the Trustee has taken all the steps that he/sh e ought to have taken as a Trustee in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the charity's auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006. The Trustees are responsible for the maintena nce and integrity of corporate and financial information included on the charity's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial st atements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Approved by the Trustees and signed on their behalf by: Peter Openshaw Trustee Approved by the Trustees on:6 December 2017 Independent auditor's report 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 24 Independent auditor's report to the trustees and members of The British Society for Immunology Opinion We have audited the financial statements of The British Society for Immunology ('the parent charity') and its subsidiary (together known as 'the group') for the year ended 31 March 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of financial activities, the balance sheets, the consolidated statement of cash flows and not es to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. T he financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'T he Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

To the fullest extent permitted by la w, we do not accept or assu me responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the charitable company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or fo r the opinions we have formed. In our opinion, the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of t he group's and of the parent charity's affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its income and expenditure for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and have been prepared in accordance with t he requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Sco tland) Act 2005 and regulation 8 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended). Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with In ternational Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities und er those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of t he financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK , including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical re sponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtain ed is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independent auditor's report 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 25 Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the followi ng matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: the trustees' use of the going concern basi s of accounting in t he preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or the trustees have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant do ubt about the group's or the parent charity's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the fi nancial statements are authorised for issue. Other information The trustees are responsible for the other info rmation. The other information comprises the information included in the trustees' report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the fina ncial statements does not cover the other information and, except to t he extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial stat ements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowled ge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such mate rial inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whet her there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other informati on. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude t hat there is a material misstatem ent of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the information given in the trustees' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and the trustees' report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent charity and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the trustees' report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 and the Charities Account s (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (as amended) requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: proper and adequate accounting records have not been kept; or the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or Independent auditor's report 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 26 Matters on which we are required to report by exception (continued) certain disclosures of trustees' remuner ation specified by law are not made; or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or the trustees were not entitled to prepare t he financial statements in accordance with the small companies regime and take advantage of the small companies' exemptions in preparing the trustees' report and from the requirement to prepare a strategic report. Responsibilities of trustees As explained more fully in the trustees' respon sibilities statement, the tr ustees are responsible for the preparation of the financi al statements and for being satisf ied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as t he trustees determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the trus tees are responsible for assessing the group and the parent charity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the group or the parent charity or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assuranc e about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reaso nable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstat ements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in t he aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users tak en on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for t he audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Counc il's website at www.fr c.org.uk/auditorsres ponsibilities.

Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepar ed for the year to 30 June 2017 and are presented in sterling and are rounded to the nearest pound. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with items recognised at cost or transac tion value unless otherwise stat ed in the relevant accounting policies below or the notes to these financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Prac tice applicable to charities preparing their financial statements in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (Chari ties SORP FRS 102) issued on 16 July 2014, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and the Charities Act 2011. The charity constitutes a public b enefit entity as defined by FRS 102. Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement Preparation of the financial statements requires the Trustees and management to make significant judgements and estimates. The only item in the financial statements w here these judgements and estimates have been made is in respect to estimating the useful economic life of tangible fixed assets. Assessment of going concern The Trustees have assessed whether the use of the going concern assumption is appropriate in preparing these financial statements. The Trustees have made this assessment in respect to a period of one year from the date of approval of these financial statements. They have concluded that there are no material un certainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the charity to continue as a going concern. The Trustees are of the opinion that the group and the charity will have sufficient resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The most significant areas of judgement that affect items in the financial st atements are detailed above. With regard to the next accounting period, the year ending 30 June 2018, the most significant areas that affect the carrying value of the assets held by the charity are the level of investment return and the performance of the investment market s (see the investment policy and the risk management sections of the Trustees' report for more information). Income recognition Income is recognised in the period in which t he group and the charity has entitlement to the income, the amount of income can be measured reliably and it is probable that the income will be received. Principal Accounting Policies 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 31 Income recognition (continued) Income comprises subscriptions, income from scientific meetings and publications, advertising and sponsorship, donations and investment income. All income is recognised on an accruals basis. Following the introduction of new membership rates and cancellation policies, a change was made from 1 January 2017 to income recognition for membership subscriptions. This has resulted in all income from 1 January 2017 being accounted for on an accruals basis, whereas up to 31 December 2016 this was on a receipts basis. The result of this is a one-off reduction in member ship income of approximately \u00a370,000 against 2015/16. Donations are recognised when the group and the charity has confirmation of both the amount and settlement date. In the event of donations pledged but not received, the amount is accrued for where the receipt is consider ed probable. In the event that a donation is subject to conditions that require a level of performance before the group and the charity is entitled to the funds, the income is deferred an d not recognised until either those conditions are fully met, or the fulfilment of those condit ions is wholly within the control of the group and the charity and it is probable that those condi tions will be fulfilled in the reporting period. Interest on funds held on deposit is included when receivable and the amount can be measured reliably by the group and the charity; this is normally upon notification of the interest paid or payable by the bank. Expenditure recognition Liabilities are recognised as expenditure as soon as there is a legal or constructive obligation committing the group and the charity to make a payment to a third party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement and the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. All expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis and is stated inclusive of irrecoverable VAT. Expenditure comprises direct costs and sup port costs. All expenses, including support costs, are allocated or apportioned to the applicable expenditure headings. The classification between activities is as follows: Expenditure on raising funds which includes all expenditure associated with raising funds for the group and the charity. This includes investment management fees. Expenditure on charitable activities include s all costs associated with furthering the charitable purposes of the group and the ch arity through the provision of its charitable activities. Such costs include direct and s upport costs, including governance costs. Allocation of support and governance costs Support costs represent indirect charitable ex penditure. In order to carry out the primary purposes of the group and the charity it is nec essary to provide support in the form of personnel development, financial procedures, provision of office services and equipment and a suitable working environment. Governance costs comprise the costs involv ing the public accountability of the charity (including audit costs) and costs in respect to its compliance with regulation and good practice. Principal Accounting Policies 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 32 Allocation of support and governance costs (continued) Support costs and governance costs are apporti oned in proportion to the direct costs incurred on each activity. Tangible fixed assets All assets costing more than \u00a3500 and with an expected useful life ex ceeding one year are capitalised. All tangible fixed assets are capitalised and depreciated at 33% per annum based on cost in order to write them off over their estimated useful lives: Investments Listed investments are a form of basic financia l instrument and are initially recognised at their transaction value and subse quently measured at their fair value as at the balance sheet date using the closing quoted market price. The charity does not acquire put options, derivat ives or other complex financial instruments. Realised gains (or losses) on investment assets are calculated as the difference between disposal proceeds and their opening carrying va lue or their purchase value if acquired subsequent to the first day of the financial year . Unrealised gains and losses are calculated as the difference between the fair value at the y ear end and their carrying value at that date. Realised and unrealised investment gains (o r losses) are combined in the statement of financial activities and are credited (or debit ed) in the year in which they arise. The investment in the subsidiary undertaking is included at cost with provision being made for any permanent diminution in value. Fund accounting Restricted funds comprise monies raised for, or their use is restricted to, a specific purpose, or contributions subject to donor imposed conditions. General funds represent those monies which are freely available for application towards achieving any charitable purpose that falls within the charity's charitable objects. Designated funds represent monies which t he Trustees have set aside for a specific purpose. Debtors Debtors are recognised at their settlement am ount, less any provision for non-recoverability. Prepayments are valued at the amount prepaid. They have been discounted to the present value of the future cash receipt where such discounting is material. Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand represents such acco unts and instruments that are available on demand or have a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition. Principal Accounting Policies 30 June 2017 British Society for Immunology 33 Short term deposits Deposits for more than three months but less than one year have been disclosed as short term deposits. Creditors and provisions Creditors and provisions are recognised when there is an obligation at the balance sheet date as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amount of the settlement can be estimated reliably. Creditors and provisions are recognised at the amount the group and the ch arity anticipates it will pay to settle the debt. They have been discounted to the present value of the future cash payment where such discounting is material. Leased assets Rentals applicable to operating leases where su bstantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Pension costs The group and the charity operates a defined contribution scheme on behalf of its employees. The assets are held in separate ly administered funds. Contributions are charged to the statement of financial activi ties in the year in which they fall due.
