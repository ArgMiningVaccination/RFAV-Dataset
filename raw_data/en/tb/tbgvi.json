Given the sinister nature of this substance, it is imperative that those addicted to meth find help as quickly as possible. However, many people wonder how to detox from crystal meth safely while keeping withdrawal symptoms and cravings at a tolerable level. Thankfully, Detox Nashville offers effective crystal meth detox in Nashville, Tennessee. This program allows these individuals to undergo withdrawals in a secure and medically-monitored environment. What is Crystal Meth? Methamphetamine or crystal meth is a type of synthetic [stimulant](https://detox-nashville.com/programs/stimulant-detox-nashville/). Also known as crank, ice, shards, or glass, this drug causes detrimental damage to an individual's appearance, health, and relationships. Typically smoked or snorted, crystal meth can lead to sores, tooth decay, and even heart damage. Those on meth tend to feel a sense of paranoia, confusion, and anxiety. As a result, users may become violent or encounter severe insomnia. Furthermore, they are more likely to engage in risky behavior or make dangerous decisions. Sadly, crystal meth use often leads to overdose and in many cases, death. Signs and Symptoms of Crystal Meth Addiction The best way to help somebody struggling with this potent substance is to become educated on the signs and symptoms of meth addiction. Recognizing these indicators early on allows the individual to get the help they need before it's too late. Common signs and symptoms of meth addiction include: - Picking and scratching at skin or hair - Irrational outbursts and behavior - Selling possessions or asking to borrow money - Erratic movements (twitching, jerking) - Sudden weight loss - Theft - Facial tics - Poor hygiene or lack of self-care - Delusions and paranoia - Uncharacteristic behavior (such as exaggerated mannerisms or constant talking) Crystal Meth Withdrawal When a person detoxes from crystal meth, the body and mind are allowed to reset. As a result, an individual can begin addiction treatment with health and clarity. Unfortunately, this necessary process coincides with unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Those detoxing from meth commonly experience the below side effects: - Feelings of depression and hopelessness - Heightened cravings - Increased appetite - Suicidal thoughts - Dry mouth - Fatigue and lethargy - Bouts of jitteriness - Hallucinations and delusions - Extreme sleepiness It is important to note that while these symptoms sound tasking, the benefits of sobriety far outweigh the temporary discomfort of detox. Additionally, these symptoms do not have as much potential for physical damage. In fact, in most cases, they are not as consistently severe as the withdrawal symptoms associated with substances such as opioids and alcohol. Meth Withdrawal Timeline Meth has a half-life of approximately 10 hours. Given that this is generally short, withdrawal begins within 24 hours of an individual's last use. During the preliminary stages of withdrawal, individuals can expect anticipatory feelings of fear and sadness as well as cravings. Research shows the withdrawal timeline for meth to be notably consistent in users, with the majority of people showing peak symptoms within 7 to 10 days. In this stage, individuals are most likely to experience the most extreme withdrawal symptoms, such as hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and severe cravings. Following the peak of withdrawal, individuals experience a lesser degree of side effects as symptoms begin tapering off. Overall, the entire crystal meth withdrawal timeline spans between two to three weeks. What Happens During Crystal Meth Detox in Nashville, TN? Prior to entering treatment, many people wonder how to detox from meth. Though individuals sometimes attempt to detox at home, this is never recommended as it poses a higher risk of complications. Additionally, those who detox without medical supervision are more likely to relapse as their symptoms become unmanageable\u2014leading them to give in to their cravings. Instead, those battling meth addiction should only detox at a reputable medical facility such as Detox Nashville. Our multidisciplinary [team](https://detox-nashville.com/why-us/team/) works tirelessly to ensure our clients remain as comfortable and stable as possible throughout the withdrawal process. We administer specific medications to make symptoms and cravings more tolerable, thus setting the stage for sustainable sobriety and lasting recovery. What Medications Are Used in Nashville, TN? Detox Nashville uses [medically-monitored detox](https://detox-nashville.com/programs/medically-monitored-detox-nashville/) in order to set our clients up for success. For instance, we administer closely monitored doses of the appropriate medications to those in our crystal meth detox program. As a result, the risk of relapse reduces and the chance of long-term abstinence from drug use improves. Though no medication has been specifically designed and approved by the FDA to treat the withdrawal symptoms of meth, there is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883750/) that several medications can help improve the associated side effects. Drugs commonly used during meth detox include: - Modafinil (Provigil): A mild stimulant, modafinil helps to balance sleeping patterns while also improving concentration and enhancing energy levels. Commonly, the medication treats narcolepsy and ADHD. However, it has proven successful in aiding those undergoing crystal meth withdrawal. - Bupropion (Wellbutrin): Primarily used as an antidepressant or to help people stop smoking, research shows that this medication can also help reduce withdrawal symptoms and lessen cravings in crystal meth users. - Mirtazapine (Remeron): With research supporting its role in relapse prevention, mirtazapine is another substance given to those in meth detox. This atypical antidepressant improves mood while restoring neurotransmitter function in the brain. - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Evidence shows that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as Prozac and Paxil, can reduce cravings while aiding the symptoms of depression associated with meth withdrawal.
