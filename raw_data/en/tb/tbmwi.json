Also included are reports that are required pursuant to: Section 329- 3, HRS, which requir es a report by the Hawaii Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and Controlled Substances (HACDACS); Section 10 of Act 161, SLH 2002, which requir es a status report on the coordination of offender substance abuse treatment programs; Section 29 of Act 40, SLH 2004, which req uires a progress report on the substance abuse treatment monitoring program ; and Section 329E -6, HRS, which requires a report on unintentional opioid- related drug overdose . ADAD's mission is to provide the leadership necessary for the development and deli very of quality substance abuse prevention and treatment services for Hawaii residents . ADAD's primary functions include: grants and contracts management; clinical consultation; quality assurance, which encompasses training, accreditation of substance abuse treatment programs, certification of substance abuse counselors and program administrators, monitoring implementation of prevention activities and treatment services; policy development; planning and coordination of services; and information systems man agement (i.e., treatment client data system, prevention minimum data set, and needs assessments for substance abuse prevention and treatment services). The reorganization of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division (approved on March 29, 2011) provides the fra mework to implement and maintain the core public health functions of assessment (i.e., monitoring trends and needs), policy development on substance abuse issues and assurance of appropriate substanc e abuse services. Assessment . Data related functions and positions are organized within the Planning, Evaluation, Research and Data (PERD) Office so that data functions and activities support planning, policy, program development and reporting needs of the Division. Policy development . The PERD Office is charged with strategic planning, organizational development, program development, evaluation, identification of community needs, knowledge of best practices, policy research and development. Assurance . The core public health function of assurance is encom passed within four components , each of which are assigned the following functions . The Administrative Management Services (AMS) Office is responsible for budgeting, accounting, human resource and contrac ting functions to ensure Division- wide consistency, accuracy and timeliness of actions assigned to the Division. The Quality Assurance and Improvement (QAI) Office is responsible for quality assurance and improvement functions (i.e., certification of subs tance abuse counselors, program accredi tation and training). 2 The Prevention Branch (PB) provides a focal point and priority in the Division for the development and management of a statewide prevention system which includes the development and monitoring of substance abuse prevention s ervices contracts and the implementation of substance abuse prevention discretionary grants. The Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) Project focuses on building community capacity to address substance use issues and sustain t he substance abuse prevention system and infrastructure at the state, county and local community levels . The staff of the F ood and D rug A dministration (FDA) Tobacco Program within the Branch ensure s that the Federal Tobacco Control Act is enforced in Hawai i. The Treatment and Recovery Branch (TRB) develops and manages a statewide treatment and recovery system which includes program and clinical oversight of substance abuse treatment services contracts and the implementation of substance abuse treatment dis cretionary grants. Health pro motion and substance abuse prevention are essential to an effective, comprehensive continuum of care. The promotion of constructive lifestyles and norms includes discouraging alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, encouraging he alth-enhancing choices regardi ng the use of alcohol, prescription drug s and illicit drug s, and supporting the development of social and physical environments that facilitate drug -free lifestyles . Prevention is achieved through the application of multiple i nterventions (e.g., evidence -based curricula, strategies and practices, and/or environmental strategies) that impact social norms and empower people to increase control over, and to improve, their health . Substance abuse prevention focuses on interventions to occur prior to the onset of a disorder and is intended to prevent the occurrence of the disorder or reduce the risk for the disorder . Risk factors are those characteristics or attributes of an individual, his or her family and peers, school or environm ent that have been associated with a higher susceptibility to problem behaviors such as alcohol and other drug use disorders . In addition, prevention efforts seek to enhance protective factors in the individual/peer, family, school and community domains . Protective factors are those psychological, behavioral, family and social characteristics and conditions that can reduce risks and insulate children and youth from the adverse effects of risk factors that may be present in their environment. Substance abus e treatment refers to the broad range of services, including identification, intervention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling, medical services, psychiatric services, psychological services, social services and follow -up for persons with subst ance abuse pro blems . The overall goal of treatment is to reduce or eliminate the use of alcohol and/or drugs as a contributing factor to physical, psychological and social dysfunction and to arrest, retard or reverse the progress of any associated problems . Treatment se rvices have, as a requirement, priority admission for pregnant women, injection drug users, native Hawaiians and adult offenders. 3 HIGHLIGHTS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ACTIVITIES July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 State and Federal Funding Act 53, SLH 2018 appropriated $ 34,874,192 to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse program (HTH 440) for Fiscal Year 201 8-19: General funds $20,246,936 (58.0%) 29.0 FTE Special Federal FTE3 Allocations for the funds are as follows: Substance abuse treatment services $25,070,650 (71.9%) Substance abuse prevention services 7,256,797 (20.8%) Division operating 0 (0%) Division staffing costs (7.3%) $34,874,192 (100.0%) For Fiscal Year 2018- 19, $34,874,192 was appropriated by Act 53, SLH 2018, to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse program (HTH 440) - $20,246,936 general funds, $750,000 special funds and $13,877,256 federal funds (MOF N and P). Of the total appropriated, $25,070,650 was allocated for substance abuse treatment services and $7,256,797 was allocated for substance abuse prevention services.

The position count also does not include the general funded temporary Program Specialist for the Clean and Sober Homes Registry (1.0 FTE). 4 Federal Grants and Contracts Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant . ADAD received $8.85 million in Fiscal Year 20 19 of Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant funds administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to plan, implement and evaluate substance abuse preve ntion and treatment activities. U.S. Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) Tobacco Inspections. The award of a $1.6 million 3 -year contract (9/30/17- 9/29/20) by the FDA supports tobacco inspections on retail outlets that sell or advertise cigarettes or smoke less tobacco products to determine whether they are compl ying with the Tobacco Control Act (Public Law 111- 31) and the implementing regulations (21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1140, et seq.). Two types of tobacco compliance inspections are conducted: undercover buys, to determine a retailer's compliance with federal age and photo identification requirements; and product advertising and labeling to address other provisions of the Tobacco Control Act. Strategic Prevention Framework - Partnerships for Success (SPF -PFS) Grant. Hawaii was awarded $1.8 million in each of five years (9/30/13- 9/29/18) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) to implement the Strategic Prevention Fr amework process at the state and community levels to prom ote the alignment and leveraging of prevention resources and priorities at the federal, state and community levels. A No Cost Extension, effective September 30, 2018 through September 29, 2019 provided additional time to achieve project goals and complete activities initiated during the 5 -year grant period. The project has engaged public, private, state and community level stakeholders to set the foundation for the effective gathering and analysis of local data to support data -driven decision- making process es in the development and implementation of effective prevention strategies and sustainable prevention infrastructure as determined by assessments. Five (5) community coalitions utilized grant resour ces to conduct assessments and plan for the implementatio n and evaluation of environmental strategies to address underage drinking among persons aged twelve to twenty in their communities. Environmental strategies have a broader focus than individual or curriculum -based strategies, so they have the potential to change community norms and population behaviors. Additionally, SPF - PFS resources awarded to each County have assisted in strengthening infrastructure and providing capacity support to assess, plan and implement a sustainable prevention system at the county level to support substance abuse prevention efforts needed or currently being conducted in communities. During the FY 2019, the SPF -PFS subrecipients had additional time to complete their planned ac tions and maintain involvement of community organizations and community members in SPF efforts . A second SPF -PFS grant of $2.0 million in each of five years (9/30/18- 9/29/23) was awarded to continue the Hawaii Project efforts and during the close of FY19 those funds were allocated to subrecipients to build on the progress made during the first grant period and further enhance efforts to address alcohol and related issues in communities of demonstrated high need. Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) . The SBIRT is a five -year grant (proj ect period 09/30/16- 09/29/21) totaling $6,513,812. Funding is to implement screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services for adults in primary care and community hea lth settings for substance misuse a nd substance use disorders ( SUD) . Project 5 services are designed to develop, expand, and enhance infrastructure to fully integrate SBIRT in six Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in Hawaii and up to twenty -five smal l group primary care practices (PCP ) over five years and to est ablish the SBIRT model as a standard of care statewide. The SBIRT program seeks to address behavioral health disparities by encouraging the implementation of strategies, such as SBIRT, to decre ase the differences in access, service use, and outcomes among the populations served. Implementing the SBIRT will aid in improving overall health outcomes, reducing the negative impact on health, and reducing healthcare costs . The grant has three goals: 1) Implement SBIRT in six FQHCs and twenty -five small group primary care practices; 2) Develop and expand State and community infrastructure to improve linkages and coordination between primary care and SUD treatment providers; and, 3) Expand existing beha vioral health integration efforts which includes a plan to diss eminate SBIRT to small primary care practices throughout the State. State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (STR) . The Hawai'i STR grant (project period 5/1/17- 4/30/19) totaling $4,000,000 is an initiative awarded jointly through SAMHSA 's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and CSAP . The grant aims to address the opioid crisis by increasing access to treatment, reducing unmet treatment need, and reducing opioid overdose related de aths through the provision of prevention, treatment and recover y activities for opioid use disorder (OUD) (including prescription opioids as well as illicit drugs such as heroin) . The STR grant will address these concerns through three key activity tracks: (1) education and awareness , which will promote public awareness of the dangers of opioid use and provide training to health professionals to better identify and assist persons at risk or suffering from opioid use disorders; (2) care coordination and int egration which will target more efficient and effective ways to integrate primary and behavioral health care to reduce risk and better treat persons affected by opioid misuse and abuse; and (3) policy shaping which targets policies and protocols aimed at improving access and expanding proven interventions and preventi on strategies such Medication Assisted Tr eatment (MAT) . State Youth Treatment period: is an initiative awarded by SAMHSA's CSAT. The grant aims to improve treatment for adolescents and/or transitional aged youth with substance use disorders (SUD) and/or co- occurring substance use and mental disorders by assuring youth state - wide access to evidence- based assessments, treatment models, and recovery services supported b y the strengthening of the existing infra structure system. It intends to bring together stakeholders across the systems serving the populations of focus to strengthen an existing coordinated network that will enhance/expand treatment services, develop poli cies, expand workforce capacity, dissemin ate evidence- based practices (EBPs), and implement financial mechanisms and other reforms to improve the integration and efficiency of SUD treatment, and recovery support system. The YTI grant will address these con cerns by increasing the number of multi -systemic therapists (MST) at select treatment providers, expanding eligibility criteria for services, and including treatment services for criminal justice adolescents within the Hawai'i Youth Correctional Facility, and adolescents aged 12- 25 who present fo r care or are directed for care through the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Division and the Hawai'i Youth Criminal Justice Division. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Services Through contracts with community -based substance abuse prevention and treatment agencies, ADAD provided substance abuse prevention and treatment services to adults and adolescents as 6 follows:4 Treatment Services . ADAD's overarching goal is to prevent or reduce the severity and disabling effects related to alcohol and other drug use, abuse and dependence by assuring an effective, accessible, public and private community -based system of prevention strategies and treatment services designed to empower individuals and communities to make health -enhancing choices regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs . Twenty -six (26) agencies, which resulted in thirty -two (32) contracts were established to provide a continuum of services to seven different populations which are, Adult Substance A buse Treatment, Dual Diagnosis Substanc e Abuse Treatment, Opioid Addiction Recovery Services, Specialized Substance Abuse Treatment for Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children, Intensive Addiction Care Coordination and Substance Abuse Treatment fo r Offenders, Group Recovery Homes, Earl y Intervention Service for HIV, Homeless Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment, and Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment Services which consist of School -Based and Community -Based services . Treatment providers can provide all or part of the treatment contin uum, which includes pre - treatment service such as motivational enhancement services, outreach, and interim; treatment services such as non -medical social detoxification, residential, intensive outpatient, outpatient; and recovery support services such as therapeutic living, clean and sober housing, continuing care, transportation, translation, and childcare . All client admissions, treatment service, including treatment progress notes, and discharges are tracked on the Web -Based Infrastructure for Treatment Services (WITS) system . Services were provided to 3,396 adults statewide in Fiscal Year 2018 -19; and school -based and community -based outpatient substance abuse treatment services were provided to 1,790 adolescents s tatewide in Fiscal Year 2018 -19. Prevention Services . Through a total of thirty -two (32) contracts, nineteen (19 ) public and community -based organizations supported statewide prevention efforts to reduce underage drinking and the use and abuse of other ha rmful substances during FY 2019. I n efforts to best utilize resources to fund what works, the contracted services implement evidence -based programs, policies, and practices that include: information dissemination; education; problem identification and refe rral; community -based programming; environmental strategies; and alternative activities that decrease alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. The funded programs engage schools, workplaces, and communities across the state in establishing evidence- based and cost -effective models to prevent substance abuse in young people in a variety of community settings and promoting programs and policies to improve knowledge and skills related to effective ways to avoid substance use problems and enhance resiliency. Prog ram implementation is tracked acco rding to the number of times (cycles) curricula and strategies were implemented as collected and reported using WITS, the data management system described above and expanded to collect prevention service data. Additionally , quarterly progress reports, plans and progress notes submitted capture information related to community partnerships, problems, priorities, resources, readiness and implementation status of identified evidence -based programs. According to the data 4 Details on adult and adolescent treatment admissions, outcomes for six-month follow -ups, needs assessment s and methamphetamine admissions are appended at pages 34-43. 7 collected for Fiscal Year 2018- 2019, cur riculum -based prevention strategies served a total of 5,785 children and youth and the community -based strategies touched a total of 32,208 children, youth and adults across the state. The funded services impact the contr acted community -based agencies' ab ility to mobilize support and build capacity and readiness in identified service areas to ensure that the community is aware of the substance abuse issues and is prepared to support the implementation of interventions that have proven effective in preventi ng the occurrence or escalation of such problems. Agencies use the State and Federal prevention resources to secure materials, training, and technical assistance to implement substance abuse prevention evidence -based inter ventions (EBI) and strategies with fidelity, as designed and adhering to the core components, as intended by the developer. If evaluation findings are not what was anticipated, mid -course corrections and adaptations to the implementation of the strategy ar e made with guidance from the deve loper to increase the effectiveness of the EBI and the substance abuse prevention efforts. An emphasis on implementing evidence - based practices and determining what works should result in quality, effective prevention services that will benefit youth and their families and contribute to an enhanced substance abuse prevention system for Hawaii. Substance Abuse Prevention resources are also used to positively impact and develop the prevention workforce. Prevention staff from contracted community -based agencies are required to attend annual prevention related trainings to gain new knowledge and skills to improve implementation efforts and effectively address the prevention of the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs in the community. Trainings or conferences attended may include but are not limited to the Overview of the fundamentals of substance abuse prevention; Substance Abuse Prevention Skills Training (SAPST), SPF Coordinated Access Resource Entry System (CARES) The Hawai'i Coordinated Access Resource Entry System (CARES) is the state's new multiple entry -point and coordinating center fo r substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services. This new initiative will improve coordination among providers and increase access to quality care for people who are living with substance use problems. Hawai'i CARES is a collaboration between the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division and the University of Hawai'i at Mnoa (UH Mnoa) Myron B. Thompson School of Social Work. The project is funded through a combination of state and federal funds from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. T he agreement over two years with UH Mnoa includes the development of a call center, service referral system, and processes for quality improvement. Hawai'i CARES staff, who are trained clinicians, facilitate entry into the system of care, transitions in c are, and provide informat ion and referrals to other treatment resources. Hawai'i CARES was soft -launched on October 1, 2019 with DOH partner agencies and contracted providers, and full implementation is anticipated in January 2020. In its first month as a pilot program, CARES handled more than 300 incoming calls and facilitated more than 400 referrals to and service authorizations for addiction treatment, with these number expected to grow upon full implementation. Within the next 12- 18 months, we anticipat e expansion of this proje ct to include behavioral health services as well. We are striving toward a system where our community has a more direct and simplified process of gaining access to 8 behavioral health services across the state and that people can get those services help wher e they need it, when they need it and how they need it. Take Back Boxes Promote Safe Medication Disposal Appropriate disposal of prescription medications is essential in preventing diversion of medications and limited the enviro nmental impact of imprope rly discarded drugs . In collaboration with the Attorney General's Office, Narcotics Enforcement Division and other key partners, DOH/ADAD has provided take back boxes to Police Departments statewide. Listed on www.hawaiiopioid.org website with maps and directions, there are now three (3) sites on Kauai, six (6) sites on Hawaii Island, nine (9) sites on Maui and ten (10) sites on O'ahu . These sites also include pharmacy -based take back sites that started after Act 183, SLH 2019 was signed by Governor Ige in July, 2019 which allows pharmacies to take back medications. Hawaii continues to participate in the twice -yearly DEA take back campaigns in addition to twenty -eight ( 28) sites statewide. Studies and Surveys Tobacco Sales to Minors. The 2019 annual statewide survey results for illegal tobacco sales to minors is 5.7% (weighted), a decrease from last year's rate of 6.6%. This year's 5.7% retailer violation rate is less than the 9.6% national weighted av erage for federal fiscal year 2013. The annual survey, which is a joint effort between the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division and the University of Hawaii, monitors the State's compliance with the \"Synar\" (tobacco) regulations for the federal Su bstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. It is important to note that on January 1, 2016, it became unlawful to sell both tobacco products and electronic smoking devices to persons under twenty -one (21) years of age. With the enactment of Act 122, which incre ased the minimum age from 18 to 21, youth between the ages of 18 -20 were also included in the annual survey. In the Spring of 2019, teams made up of youth volunteers (ages 15 -20) and adult observers visited a random sample of 335 stores state wide in which the youth attempted to buy cigarettes to determine how well retailers were complying with state tobacco laws . Nineteen stores (5.7%) sold to minors (ages 15 -20). Of the four counties included in the statewide survey, the County of Kauai had z ero sales, the County of Maui had five sales, and both the County of Hawaii and County of Honolulu had seven sales each. Due to the small sample size, rates for individual counties are not considered statistically reliable. Fines assessed for selling tobac co to anyone under the age of 21 are $500 for the first offense and a fine of up to $2,000 for subsequent offenses. Provision of Contracted or Sponsored Training In Fiscal Year 201 8-19, ADAD conducted training programs that accommodated staff development opportunities for 1,642 healthcare, human service, criminal justice and substance abuse prevention and treatment professionals through fifty-two (52) training sessions, courses and workshops in topics relating to substance abuse prevention and treatment for adolescents and adults . Participants earned 28,217 Continuing Education Units (CEU's) towards their professional certification and/or re -certif ication as certified substance abuse professionals in the following: Certified Substance Abuse Counselor (CS AC), 9 Certified Prevention Specialist (CPS), Certified Criminal Justice Professional (CCJP), Certified Clinical Supervisor (CCS), Certified Co -occurring Disorders Professional - Diplomate (CCDP -D), or Certified Substance Abuse Program Administrator (CSAPA). Topi cs covered during the reporting period included: opioid prevention and response ; SBIRT ; The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria ; suicide prevention; workplace satisfaction ; supportive supervision; group processing and treatment ; provider s instruction to substance abuse treatment for LGBTQ ; street drugs and surviving through crisis ; motivational interviewing ; group counseling ; criminal conduct and substance abuse ; drug use during pregnancy ; confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse cli ent records (42 CFR ; Part 2) ; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) ; certification and examination processes ; data input and its usefulness ; prevention specialist training ; identifying/implementing environmental trainings ; evaluation capacity building ; evidence -based practices ; Code of Ethical Conduct for substance abuse professionals , mental health and substance use; denial and resistance in addiction treatment; critical thinking for substance addiction professionals; unde rstanding sexually transmitted diseases; HIV/AIDS in the substance abusing population; cultural diversity; and understanding the addiction process and how families are affected by addiction. Programmatic and Fiscal Monitoring Through desk audits of provider s' program and fiscal reports, ADAD staff examined contractors' compliance with federal SAPT Block Grant restrictions, State General Fund expenditure guidelines and statutory provisions for grants -in-aid and purchases of service . ADAD also provided tec hnical assistance to substance abuse prevention and treatment programs statewide . Staff conducted on going desktop program and fiscal monitoring of forty (42) prevention service contracts and fifty -three ( 53) treatment service contracts . Technical assistance an d follow -up and site visits related to program development and implementation, reporting and contract compliance provided as needed. Certification of Professionals and Accreditation of Programs Certification of Substance Abuse Counselors. In Fiscal Year 2018 -19, ADAD processed 462 (new and renewal) applications, administered seventy -eight (78) computer -based written exams and certified fifty -one (51) applicants as substance abuse counselors, bringing the total number of certified substance abuse counselors to 1,328. On average, the shortest amount of time to become a certified substance abuse counselor is approximately thirteen (13) months . A Master's degree in a human service field credits the applicant with 4,000 hours working i n the substance abuse fi eld. The applicant must still obtain 2,000 supervised work experience hours which is approximately twelve ( 12) months of working full-time. The remaining month is to schedule and take the required written exam . If a person also lice nsed as a Clinical Social Worker, Mental Health Counselor, Marriage and Family Therapist, Clinical Psychologist, or Psychiatrist, the required supervised work experience is 1,000 hours (or approximately six (6) months of full -time work) in the substance abuse profession. The pers on would also need a month to schedule and take the written exam . If an 10 applicant has no applicable college degree to substitute for education and supervision hours, the total time to become certified is approximately three ( 3) years (i.e., 6,000 hours of work experience), plus one month to schedule and take the exam. Accreditation of programs. In Fiscal Year 2018- 19, ADAD conducted a total of twenty -one (21) accreditation reviews and accredited thirteen (13) organizations, some of which have multiple (res idential treatment and therapeutic living) programs. Clean and Sober Homes Registry In Fiscal Year 2018 -19, ADAD received twenty -nine (29) initial application for the clean and sober registry. ADAD reviewed and conducted twenty -two (22) clean and sober homes statewide, and in \"Good Standing\" as referred to by H AR Chapter 11-178. There are three (3) registrations pending home detail submissions, three (pending DOH review), and (1) one pending inspection. Currently there are two (2) homes that are \"Not in Good Standing\" pending further review. ADAD has received (1) one complaint that has been resolved. Act 193, SLH 2014 (HB 2224 HD2 SD2 CD1), relating to group homes, establishes a registry for clean and sober homes within the Department of Health; appropr iates funds for staffing and operating costs to plan, establish and operate the registry of clean and sober homes; and amends the county zoning statute to better align functions of state and county jurisdictions with federal law. The voluntary registry of clean and sober homes is a product of a two- year process during whic h the knowledge and expertise of public (i.e., State and County) as well as private agencies' perspectives were elicited . The registry will help residents to access a stable, alcohol -free and drug- free home- like living environment by establishing procedure s and standards by which homes will be allowed to be listed on the registry, including but not limited to: organizational and administrative standards; fiscal management standards; operation standards; recovery support standards; property standards; and g ood neighbor standards. Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Act 5, SLH 2019 approved $800,000 in general funds in the ADAD base budget for FY2020 to continue outreach counseling and law enforcement diversion services for the chronically homeless w ho suffer from severe substance abuse disorders on O'ahu . Of this amount, $600,000 was added to existing contracts with substance abuse treatment providers to expand their outreach abilit y to serve the chronically homeless in coordination with the Governor 's Coordinator on Homelessness. The remaining $200,000 is intended for an arrest diversion pilot project working with local law enforcement (e.g., local police departments) for the chroni cally homeless who suffer from severe substance abuse disorders . The pilot also includes training for local law enforcement to detect the signs of SUD addiction (versus mental health disorders) in the field and how to fast -track low -level offenders to SUD treatment programs . With LEAD, low- level offenders for whom probable cause for arrest or citation exists are provided the choice of arrest/citation or active engagement in services by local law enforcement . 11 On their own, the homeless will have no benefit of a care coordination safety net and are at risk of wandering from one provider that requires multiple assessments and services completed with previous providers that were not effective, leading to increased waste of treatment provider time and effort . A segment of the homeless population may qualify for LEAD which fast -tracks them to receive appropriate care in a SUD treatment program if they have committed low -level, non- violent offenses due to drug and/or alcohol addiction. Sustained outreach and quick referrals to SUD treatment servic es coupled with wrap- around services such as care coordination will expand the system of care to help the homeless overcome addiction which will improve their ability to secure housing, reduce crime and qualify for employm ent. This intervention is targeted to move resistant individuals into care and increase the overall safety of the community . The project is currently being piloted and the general fund appropriation w ill be utilized to expand implementation of the project. The Honolulu LEAD pilot began in Chinatown in mid-2018 and involves both HPD and the State Sheriffs from the Department of Public Safety. The first-year program evaluation report was released on Oct. 1, 2019. In FY 2018- 19, LEAD has: Received forty -seven (47) social contact referrals (individuals perceived as high risk for arrest) ; Of the social contact referrals, thirty -seven (37) participants were enrolled in and received services; with thirty -two (32) active in case management . Through coordination with the Governor's Coordinator on Homelessness as well as the police departments and the county prosecutor on each island, LEAD was also expanded to Hawaii County, Maui County and Kauai County through three (3) contracts with mental health and substance use treatment providers serving those counties as a result of the Governor's Emergency Proclamation dated Dec. 14, 2018. The Proclamation recognized the need to divert homeless individuals and families away from frequent use of the heal thcare and criminal justice systems by connecting them to mental health services or substance use treatment services. The contracts also used funds from Act 209, SLH 2018 which were intended to expand the LEAD pilot program to Maui and Hawaii. The one -year contracts were executed in Feb. 2019, and may be extended for two additional years. Legislation ADAD prepared informational briefs, testimonies and/or recommendations on legislation addressing substance abuse related policies , and often in coordination with the stakeholders of the Hawaii Opioid Initiative . Legislation enacted during the 2019 Legislative Session that addressed issues affecting the agency included: Act 5, SLH 2019 (HB 2 SD 2 CD1), relating to the state budget . This measure approved $800,000 in general funds in the base budget for FY 2020 to continue to provide outreach counseling and law enforcement diversion services for the chronically homeless who suffer from severe substa nce abuse disorders on O'ahu . The Legislature also approved a Governor's Executive B udget request to convert 1.00 position from 12 temporary to permanent and address variance of the position (#97606H) from Program Specialist V to Program Specialist IV to fulf ill mandates pursuant to Act 193, SLH 2014, relating to group homes. Act 183, SLH 2019 (HB1272 HD1 SD1) relating to prescription drugs. This measure authorizes pharmacies to accept the return of any prescription drug for disposal via collection receptacles or mail- back programs; prohibits pharmacies from re -dispensing returned prescripti on drugs or accepting returned prescription drugs in exchange for cash or credit; requires the pharmacist -in-charge to ensure that only authorized reverse distributors acquire prescription drugs collected via collection receptacles or mail- back programs. Act 230, SLH 2019 (SB1486 SD1 HD1 CD1) relating to the electronic prescription accountability system. DOH supported this Department of Public Safety measure which allows the Narcotics Enforcement Division Administrator to disclose confidential information from the Electronic Prescription Accountability System to the U.S. Department of Defense health agency prescription monitoring program and authorized employees of the Stat e DOH Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division and the Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention Systems Branch. Act 251, SLH 2019 (HB665 HD2 SD1 CD1) relating to the electronic prescription accountability system. DOH worked with Department of Public Safet y to support this measure which specifies that a health care provider shall not be r equired to consult the electronic prescription accountability system for patients when the prescription will be directly administered under the supervision of a health care provider, provided that the system is consulted when the patients are initially admitted at a hospital, for patients in post-operative care with a prescription limited to a three -day supply, or for patients with a terminal disease receiving hospice or oth er palliative care. Act 255, SLH SB535 SD1 of opioid antagonist . This measure authorizes pharmacists, acting in good faith and exercising reasonable care, to prescribe and dispense an opioid antagonist to patients at risk of overdose, and family members and caregivers of patients at risk of overdose. This measure also sunsets on 6/30/2024. Act 263, SLH ( SB1494 SD2 HD1 to health . This measure establishes and appropriates funds for a working group within DOH to evaluate current behavioral health care and related systems and identify steps to promote effective integration to respond to and coordinate care for persons experiencing substance abuse, mental health conditions, a nd homelessness. NOTE: In the upcoming 2020 Supplemental Session ADAD will request to add 1.00 position to the Treatment and Recovery Branch to assist in the management of the Federal Grants . This position will be responsible to apply for new federal grants and implement the program . ADAD will also be requesting to change MOF P to A 2.00 positions in the SPF -PFS award that continues to be funded by SAMHSA/CSAP. 13 OTHER REQUIRED REPORTS Report Pursuant to Section 329 -3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, Requiring a Report by the Hawaii Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and Controlled Substances (HACDACS) Report Pursuant to Section 10 of Act 161, Session Laws of Hawaii 2002, on the Implementation of Section 321 -193.5, Hawaii Revis ed Statutes Report Pursuant to Section 29 of Act 40, Session Laws of Hawaii 2004, Requiring a Progress Report on the S ubstance Abuse Treatment Monitoring Program Report Pursuant to Section 329E -6, Hawaii Revised Statutes, Requiring a Report on Unintentio nal Opioid- Related Drug Overdose. 14 REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 329 -3, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES, REQUIRING A REPORT BY THE HAWAII ADVISORY COMMISSION ON DRUG ABUSE AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES The Hawaii Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and Controlled Substances (HACDACS) is required to submit a report on its actions during the preceding fiscal year pursuant to Section 329-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS).

Meetings were scheduled on the fourth Tuesday of each month. Priorities discussed duri ng FY 2018- 2019: Coordinated Access Resource Entry System (CARES) and Coordinated Entry Withdrawal Managemen t and Stabilization Beds for Homeless Substance Use Outreach Reducing Opioid Misuse, Opioid Overdose and Related Harms and Aligning with the Hawaii Opioid Initiative Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and Co -Morbidities 15 The members of HACDACS gathered research, best practices and invited knowledgeable speakers on these topics to form the following policy recommendations for prevention and treatment of sub stance use in Hawaii. The overarching themes of our recommendations are to support evidence and data driven c ulturally appropriate services by integrating systems, policies and programs to create a comprehensive continuum of substance abuse prevention and treatment services in Hawaii. HACDACS recognizes the data that establishes methamphetamine use as more prevalent than opioid use in the State of Hawaii. Methamphetamine is the primary substance reported by participants in ADAD treatment facilities. For ex ample, 60.6% of ADAD -funded adults who were admitted to treatment facilities in FY2019 reported methamphetamine as the primary substance used. Coordinated Access Resource Entry System (CARES) and Coordinated Entry HACDACS supports the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division's (ADAD) overarching goal to create a connected and coordinated continuum of care that provides people with the treatment they need, when they need it. Appropriate care is critical to successful recovery from SUD. As discussed in previous legislative reports, there have been systemic barriers to entering the continuum of care including time and resource management, lack of staff who can screen or assess patients for SUD, and lack of a simple system to provide referrals . To combat this deficit, ADAD and community providers have worked diligently to address these barriers. Public health and public safety partnerships, such as Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) as well as the Health Efficiency and Long -term Partnerships (HELP), have stren gthened this past year and are important access points into the continuum of care. LEAD, HELP, Outreach Workers, and other homeless outreach efforts have resulted in identifying people in need of pre- treatment, treatment, and recovery support services. The system illustrated in Diagram 1 demonstrates a coordinated and responsive system of care provi ding clinically appropriate substance use treatment and recovery support services statewide. The specific services available under each treatment and recovery type are provided in Table 1. ADAD has contracted the University of Hawaii at Manoa School of Social Work to operate the system . On October 1 st, 2019, ADAD launched the statewide Coordinated Access Resource Entry System (CARES) which will be the hub of the coordinated entry system. CARES provides SUD care coordination, screening, assessment, intake, placement determination, referral, and authorization management of services for all ADAD- funded clients. As people are identified in the Outreach process, CARES provides access into an array of treatment a nd support services. Currently, hours are similar to normal business hours, with the intention to eventually be a 24-hour facility. Further information can be found at: http://manoa.hawaii.edu/cares/ . HACDAC S supports eventually adding all behavioral health services to the coordinated entry system. 16 Diagram 1. Illustration of the CARES System. Table 1.

Jay King, administrator for the CES for Partners in Care, presented a series of best practices to HACDACS on CES implementation. Some of the notable lessons learned from the Homeless Coordinated Entry Syste m three years of implementation are outlined on its website (www.coordinatedentrysystem.org ), and include: Ten Challenges: Service Coordination Barriers 1. Resistance to change 2. Limited understanding of HIPAA, PPI, PHI, and federal policy 3. Deficient data storage and case management system Outreach Pre-Treatment and Pre -Recovery Support ServicesTreatment ServicesRecovery Support ServicesCARES17 4. Inaccurate, diluted, and missing measures of vulnerability: missing the greatest need 5. Limited resources and support 6. Data system not designed and operated with human factors engineering 7. Missing common communication and coordination platform 8. Limited reporting functions 9. Policies don't reflect regional reality 10. Resistance to new partnerships and methods of participation Ten Points of Progress: 1. Data that measures operational beha viors 2. Design that directs provider behavior 3. Empowerment of service staff with avenues to conference and contribute 4. Secure, accessible, and transparent data 5. Communication and referral platform: one place for all 6. Communication platform email and comment thread 7. Community resource collection 8. Inclusive case conferencing 9. Process for special requests 10. In person community presence HACDACS members agree with adapting to a flexible system of care providing the appropriate level of care where, when, and how individual s need it is essential . HACDACS supports the concept of \"treatment on demand ,\" allowing the consumer to access culturally appropriate services when ready, willing, and able. This is especially important during transitions of levels of care, including: from street into care, from residential to recovery homes, and support during relapse or changes in substance use that are a normal part of the cycle of SUD. Diagram 2 illustrates the various ways an individual can travel within the system of care. A linear path is non- existent as an individual's recovery is unique to their circumstances and experiences. A system that is flexible enough to meet the needs and match the uniqueness of each individual will be paramount to the success of CARES. Diagram 2. Illustr ation Services in the Treatment System of Care. HACDACS recommends ongoing support of CARES with a focus on adapting best practices from other states and the Hawaii Homeless Coordinated Entry System to ensure a comprehensive, responsive and nimble syste m informed by consumer input, provider feedback, and a transparent 18 implementation process. HACDACS recommends that CARES collaborate with coordinated street outreach efforts such as HELP and LEAD to build upon early successes of collaboration to streamli ne efforts to get consumers from the street into services. Withdr awal Management and Stabilization Beds for Homeless Substance Use Outreach A critical component in the homeless outreach effort is incorporating stabilization beds. The 2018 Homeless Point in Time Count found 4,453 homeless on Oahu and 1237 homeless on th e Neighbor Islands. On Oahu, the homeless population is further broken down to 2401 unshelte red persons and 2052 sheltered, with 846 on Oahu indicating that substance use affects their daily activities. During homeless outreach efforts over the past year, outreach workers encountered people with conditions such as dehydration, skin conditions (open infected wounds, sores, skin inflammation, scabies, lice), infectious diseases (tuberculosis , hepatitis A, B, C), chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes) , substance/alcohol intoxication, mental health disorders (active psychosis, depression, anxiety, post -traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia), and seizures. In a 2006 study, 49.3% of people in the sample group were diagnosed with epilepsy and 40.7% with alcohol -related seizures. In the latter group, other factors like sleep deprivation, anxiety, and stress also contributed to the seizures 5. Substance use treatment is confronted with complex patients needing emergency supports and resources. Once a home less individual agrees to engage with the outreach workers, a quick screening and triage is performed. Results from this screening often indicate that those with acute conditions need to be stabilized prior to admission into the appropriate level of formal treatment. A gap in the continuum of care is that most substance use residential facilities cannot provide the appropriate medical services needed for the acute care that many homeless individuals need. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) describes treatment as a continuum with five broad levels of care, including an early intervention level. Within the levels of care, decimal numbers differentiate degrees of intensity of servi ces. 6 Treatment services range from no care (0) to early interv ention and outpatient care (0.5 - 2.5) to residential and detoxification (3 - 3.7) and hospitalization (4). The differences in levels correspond to the acuity of an individual's illness, see D iagram 3 for detailed information. ASAM best practices recommend s that withdrawal management be integrated with other treatment services7 including: outpatient and residential services, stabilization beds, and in- patient hospital units. Due to the nature of habitual compulsive use and the difficulties inherent in overc oming them, th e withdrawal management phase of 5 Anny Epilepsy among the homeless: prevalence and characteristics, European Journal of Public Health, Volume 16, Issue 5, October 2006, Pages 484 -486, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckl011 . 6 Mee- Lee D, Shulman GD, Fishman MJ, Gastfriend DR, Miller, eds.

Copyright by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. 19 treatment often requires a greater intensity of services to establish initial treatment engagement and induction into formal treatment. Diagram 3. The ASAM T reatment C ontinuum.8 ASAM recommends the assessment of individuals for factors complicating w ithdrawal (including alcohol use) such as the use of other addictive substances, acute and/or destabilized medical or psychiatric problems, and/or a history of seizures or delirium tremen s. An individual's risk for complicated withdrawal increases with the presence of multiple risk factors. ASAM has criteria for different levels of withdrawal management based on the presence of risk factors as outli ned below in Diagram 4 :9 8 https://www.asamcontinuum.org/knowledgebase/what -are-the-asam Gastfriend DR, Miller, eds. The ASAM Criteria: Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance- Related, and Co-Occurring Conditions . 3rd ed. Carso n City, NV: The Change Companies; 2013. Copyright by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. 20 Diagram 4. ASAM Criteria for Different Levels o f Withdrawal Management . The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) suggests utilizing stabilization beds as a cost-effective alternative to in-patient hospitalization. This is outlined in SAMHSA's publication Crisis Services: Effectiveness, Cost -Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Funding Strategies, along with information regarding the types of crisis stabilization10. The purpose of stabilization beds is to promptly assess, provide acute care, and connect individuals to appropriate resources, ensuring the warm hand -off from the street to treatment. HACDACS is in support of the current request for information (RFI) for stabilization beds. The overall goal is to reduce repetitive emergency department visits and chronic homelessness. HACDACS would be in support of partnerships that encourage the development of stabilization units across the state. It is HACDACS understa nding that no hospitals in Hawaii pr ovide inpatient withdrawal management (detoxification) in the absence of other acute psychiatric or medical conditions necessitating admission. The absence of such services presents great concern given that SAMHSA and ADAD recommend withdrawal management a nd stabilization beds as: 1) a cost reduction method, 2) crucial components in the continuum of service, and 3) part of an emergency response to the substance use and homeless crisis. At the time of this report, only two ADAD funded agencies are providing withdrawal management. After consultation with various treatment and outreach providers, it appears that our current services are insufficient to meet the needs of the community. HACDACS recommends the development of a comprehensive SUD management plan t o include emergency placement into detoxification and stabilization beds for those in need. HACDACS recommends payment reform allowing providers to sustainably execute complex patient models of care that are needed and clinically indicated. HACDACS recom mends the development of more partnerships to provide withdrawal management and stabilization beds across the state. 10 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Despite th ese low rates, relative to the continental United States and Alaska, data from the Stat e of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) demonstrates that drug poisoning (drug overdoses) continue to be a leading cause of injury related death in Hawaii. In 2016, Governor David Ige signed Act 68 granting immunity to individuals dispending, carrying, or utilizing naloxone (Narcan\u00ae) to reverse an opioid- related drug overdose. Since the enaction of Act 68, more than 5,000 doses have been distributed statewide and over 230 overdose reversals were reported to the Hawaii Health and Harm Reduction Center (HHHR C), the overseer of the Overdose Prevention and Response Program. In 2019, Gov. Ige signed Act 255 which allows pharmacists to prescribe naloxone, increasing access to the medication and support s the CDC's recommendation that all persons with a prescriptio n of morphine milligram equivalents greate r than 50 milligrams per day should be prescribed naloxone. In 2017, the Center for Disease Control reports that opioids contributed to 203 cases of fatal and non-fatal drug poisonings in Hawaii. To combat this, overdose prevention has been a major focus of the Hawaii Opioid Initiative (HOI). The Initiative was spearheaded by the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH), Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention System Branch, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division, and Harm Reduction Services Branch. Partn ers include the Department of Public Safety (DPS), Hawaii Narcotics Enforcement Division (NED), and community groups working collaboratively to develop a Hawaii -specific strategic plan to address opioid misuse and related harms. The HOI has supported col laboration among stakeholders across various disciplines to implement sustainable changes in preventing opioid misuse and increasing access to treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The initiative has leveraged increased funding to make sustainable chang es in Hawaii's substance use prevention and treatment continuum. This broad focus acknowledges the ongoing challenges of methamphetamines, which is still the number one substance reported by people acces sing DOH -funded treatment programs in Hawaii. The fi rst HOI Plan was released in late 2017. The second ( HOI 2.0) update was released in late 2018 and the third ( HOI 3.0) update is anticipated by the end of 2019. The three primary themes guiding the workgr oups and their recommendations include: system improv ement through a collaborative response by identifying and fostering key systems -level coordination; a balanced public health- public safety approach; and supporting healthcare integration through enhanced behavioral health integration into primary care. The seven working groups and executive steering committee meet regularly to coordinate efforts. In 2018, the HOI website was launched at www.hawaiiopioid.org and includes links to treatment options, places to dispos e of unused prescription drugs, and information on naloxone access. In 2019, two HOI public awareness campaigns focused on the importance of disposing prescription drugs properly and learning about opioid use and misuse that are intended to drive the publi c to the website. The next campaign will focus on SUD treatment and the coordinated treatment referral system (CARES) launched in October 2019. 22 The HOI has seven workgroups wit h the following priorities: FOCUS AREA 1, TREATMENT ACCESS: Improve and moder nize healthcare strategies and access for opioid and other substance misuse treatment and recovery services. FOCUS AREA 2, PRESCRIBER EDUCATION: Improve opioid and related prescr ibing practices by working with healthcare providers and payers. FOCUS AREA 3, DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING: Implement system -wide routine data collection, sharing and dissemination to increase knowledge and inform practice. FOCUS AREA 4 - PREVENTION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION: Improve community - based programs and public education to pre vent opioid misuse and related harms. FOCUS AREA 5 - PHARMACY- BASED INTERVENTIONS: Increase consumer education and prescription harm management through pharmacy -based strategies. FOCUS AREA 6 - SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS: Coordinate opera tions and services, support specialized training for first responders and assure effective laws and policies FOCUS AREA 7 - SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMEN T (SBIRT): Increase implementation of SBIRT in primary care settings. HACDAC S members received monthly updates on HOI activities and a presentation on comprehensive treatment of OUD by an Addiction C ertified Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, who is also a member of HACDAC S. Highlights of the presentation included a review of FDA approved medications to treat OUD, an overview of mu-opioid receptor agonists (such as heroin or oxycodone), antagonists (such as naloxone) and partial agonists, such as buprenor phine. Buprenorphine is the only medication with partial agonist properties th at is approved by the FDA to treat OUD and may be prescribed or dispensed by providers who have obtained a DEA X -Waiver (8 hours for physicians, 24 hours for Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants). After the first dose or two, buprenorphine does not create a feeling of being \"high,\" nor does it lead to respiratory depression as do full opioid receptor agonists. There is a \"ceiling effect (limit on receptor activation)\" because doses greater than 32 mg per day will reduce pain, prevent euphoria from full opioid receptor agonists, and prevent withdrawal syndrome (\"drug sickness\"). While Hawaii only has two agencies certified to provide methadone (another FDA a pproved treatment for OUD) there are dozens of certified providers for buprenorphine, but not nearly enough to meet demand. 23 HACDACS recommends the implementation of the Hawaii Opioid Initiative's goals and objectives and encourages the Department of Health to provide workgroups with the resources they need to develop and sustain HOIs efforts. HACDACS supports all HOI goals and recommends prioritizing specific efforts to help people struggling with chronic pain and opioid use disorder. This includes improved access to detoxification services, medication for OUD, evidence- based integrated pain management, and substance abuse treat ment services. HACDACS recommends the expansion of medication access for OUD be available statewide. Of particular concern is addressing pre-authorization barriers. Other important issues include methadone and buprenorphine access on Kauai and the west side of Hawaii Island , access in emergency departments, detention facilities , and other appropriate settings. HACDACS recommends policies that promote utilizing these medications without exclusion from other treatment modalities or settings. HACDACS recomm ends continued implementation of Act 68 (2016) that expands access to 24 naloxone through sufficient distribution throughout the state. Act 68 gives immunity to law enforcement, first responders and community members for th e administration of naloxone. The focus on integration of naloxone into the continuum of care is imperative. Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and Co -Morbidities According to the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an es timated forty -five percent of the 18.7 million American adults with a substance use disorder had a concurrent mental illness. Given the limitations in reporting a nd challenges of obtaining this kind of data, it is likely this is an underestimate. HACDACS is interested in the intersection of substance abuse with mental health and other comorbidities including homelessness and domestic abuse. This past spring, Dr. Amy Curtis, an Epidemiologist with the Department of Health, presented an overview of the WIT S database to HACDACS. The WITS database stores information on individuals serviced by ADAD funded programs. Data presented in Dr. Curtis' presentation confirms th at methamphetamine use disorder remains the most common substance used by people in Hawaii se eking care through ADAD -funded programs. Dr. Curtis also presented data demonstrating that those suffering with methamphetamine use disorder are also high utilizer s of mental health services in Hawaii. These services included (multiple) admissions to the H awaii State Hospital system and enrollment in the I ntensive C ase M anagement program. Treatment modalities for methamphetamine use disorder including various behavi oral therapies (ex. motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and contingency management therapy) were reviewed. Use of these treatment modalities can be resource intensive but may be very useful for certain patients. Currently there are severe limitations in the database and imputing methods that impair the ability to identify the use of multiple substances as well as secondary diagnoses such as mental illness, domestic abuse, or homelessness. Co- occurring morbidities can contribute to the patient's status and impede treatment services. Improving reporting in the WITS would assist in identifying treatment gaps and help delineate the community's needs for resources. HACDACS recommends aligning data collection and outcomes to improve the abil ity to report co-morbi dities such as mental illness, homelessness, and domestic abuse. HACDACS recommends additional and on- going support for re -introductory programs for patients being discharged from the Hawaii State Hospital or other state contracted inpatient facilities. On -going support and training should include recovery support services, continued enga gement in care, and intensive SUD treatment focusing on prevention of relapse of methamphetamine use disorder. HACDACS recommends increasing resources for stabilization programs and dual -diagnosis treatment programs that address SUD, co -morbid mental illness, and homelessness. Prevention Much of the focus in the SUD continuum of care has emphasized treatment, however, prevention 25 is critical in addressing health -related concerns and issues linked to alcohol and substance use. Prevention is imperative as it assists individuals in developing the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to change harmful behaviors, make helpful choices by promoting constructive lifestyles, and developing social environments facilitating drug free lifestyles. Methods in Prevention must remain dynamic due to changes in generational needs; SUD issues that were non- existent a decade ago may be prevalent now (ex. youth vaping and opioid use disorder). Hawaii's SUD prevention programs have focused on youth, especi ally underage drinking (UAD). Since 2006, ADAD has partnered with prevention providers, community coalitions, and county governments to enhance the state's prevention infrastructure. In 2013, ADAD was awarded the Strategic Prevention Framework Partnerships for Success (SPF -PFS) grant from SAMHSA with the goal of reducing and preventing underage drinking among youth and young adults ages 12- 20 in the State of Hawaii. Components of the SPF include: assessment, capacity building, implementation, evaluation, sus tainability, and cultural competency. Hawaii's efforts to address the priorities of UAD have made some significant achievements since October 2016 through the SPF. HACDACS recommends focused data collection and research to guide decision making and planni ng in the area of SUD prevention. HACDACS recommends prevention efforts be evidence -based and tailored to specific substances. 26 REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 10 OF ACT 161, SESSION LAWS OF HAWAII 2002, ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 321 -193.5, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES Act 161, SLH 2002, was enacted \"to require first time non- violent drug offenders, including probation and parole violators, to be sentenced to undergo and complete drug treatment instead of incarceration.\" Section 2 of the Act specifies th at: The Department of Public Safety, Hawaii Paroling Authority, Judiciary, Department of Health, Department of Human Services, and any other agencies assigned oversight responsibilities for offender substance abuse treatment by law or admi nistrative order , shall establish a coordinating body through an interagency cooperative agreement to oversee the development and implementation of offender substance abuse treatment programs in the State to ensure compliance with the intent of the master plan developed under Chapter 353G , HRS . Section 10 of Act 161, SLH 2002, specifies that: The Department of Health shall submit an annual report to the Legislature before the convening of each Regular Session, beginning with the Regular Session of 2004, on the status and progress of the interagency cooperative agreement required under Section 2 of this Act and the effectiveness of the delivery of services thereto, and expenditures made under this Act. It should be noted that there are caveats to Act 161, SLH 2002, implem entation . There is no mention of a \"master plan\" in Chapter 353G as cited in Section 2 of Act 161, SLH 2002; and no funds were appropriated in Act 161. The interagency initiative to implement offender substance abuse treatment services, however, has been an on- going collaborative activity. The following tables indicate the number of offenders served, criminal justice agency referral source and the geographic distribution of the offenders served. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Divis ion (ADAD) has contract s with thirty -two (32) substance abuse treatment agencies that provide services statewide. During Fiscal year 2018 -19, 1,690 offenders were referred by criminal justice agencies for substance abuse treatment, case management and clean and sober housing in the City and County of Honolulu and the counties of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii . Of the 1,954 offenders who received services, 375 were carryovers from the previous year . A breakdown of the numbers serviced in Fiscal Year 2018- 19 is as f ollows in Tables 1 -4: Codified as \u00a7321- 193.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes.

The major outcome for services to offenders is recidivism, or the proportion of offenders who have been rearrested . The Interagency Council on Interm ediate Sanctions (ICIS) 2017 Recidivism Update (dated June 2018) for the Fiscal Year 2014 cohort (the 2018 Recidivism Update was not yet available for this report ) states that the overall recidivism rate is 47.3% for probation, parole and Department of Public Safety (PSD) maximum- term released prisoners . (ICIS defines recidivism as criminal rearrests, criminal contempt of court and revocations/violations) . The data reveal a 41.4 % recidi vism rate for probationers; a 53.3% recidivism rate for ers releas ed to parole; and a 66.0% recidivism rate for offenders released from prison (maximum- term release). 28 The 45.1% reci divism rate for FY 2014 probationers and parolees was lower than the previous year's rate of 48.6 %. The FY 2014 recidivism rate is 28.8% low er than the recidivism rate reported in the FY 1999 baseline year, remaining just short of the primary goal of reduc ing recidivism in Hawaii by 30% . Felony probationers in the FY 2014 cohort had a 41.4% recidivism rate, which is 4.1 percentage points lower than the recidivism rate for the previous year's cohort, and indicates a 22.9% decline in recidivism since the baseline year . Parolees in the FY 2014 cohort had a 53.3% recidivism rate, which is 2.8 percentage points lower than the previous year's rate, a nd signifies a 26.9% decline in recidivism from the baseline year. The recidivism rate for maximum- term released prisoners declined from 76 .1% for the FY 2005 cohort to 63.4% for the FY 2014 cohort . The recidivism rate for FY 2014 is 45.1% (3.5 percentage points) lower than the FY 2013 rate . Additionally, probatione rs had the highest recidi vism rates in the entire FY 2014 offender cohor t for criminal reconvictions (35.4%), while maximum- term released prisoners had the highest recidivism rate in the entire F Y 2014 offender cohort for criminal rearrests (48.5 %). The t able below summarizes data for clients (i.e., non- violent offenders) from various segments of the overall offender population who are referred and are provided substance abuse treatment and case management services . It should be noted that clients who are referred for services may also drop out before or after admission. Table 4.

The Substance Abuse Treatm ent Monitoring Program requires the Department of Health, the Office of Youth Services, the Department of Public Safety and the Judiciary to collect data from private providers of substance abuse treatment services that receive public funds and state agenc ies that provide direct treatment services . Treatment providers are required to report admission and discharge data, as determined by the Department of Health. During the Fiscal Year 2005- 06, site visits to substance abuse treatment provider agencies were conducted to assess co ntractors' data collection procedures . During Fiscal Year 2006- 07, activities of the interagency group included: training State agencies' staff on admission, discharge and follow -up data collection; making adjustments to accommodate criminal justice agenci es' data needs; training for substance abuse treatment providers; and assistance in installing software onto providers' computers and providing \"hands -on\" training. Throughout Fiscal Year 2007- 08, progress in data entry included ori entation and training o f providers' staff in the Web- based Infrastructure for Treatment Services (WITS) system . During Fiscal Year 2008 -09, agencies were to have strengthened communication and collaboration for data collection, however, challenges in staff recruitment and retent ion stymied continuity in program implementation . Similarly, during Fiscal Years 2009 -10 and 2010- 11, restrictions on hiring, the reduction in force which deleted one of the three positions, and furloughing of staff exacerbated progr ess in program implemen tation. Act 164, SLH 2011, converted two positions, Information Technology Specialist (ITS) IV and Program Specialist - Substance Abuse (PSSA) IV, from temporary to permanent . The ITS IV position was filled on June 18, 2014. The PSSA IV position was recla ssified into a Program Specialist VI position and was filled on April 1, 2016. The position supervises the Division Planning, Evaluation, Research and Data (PERD) Office that is responsible for strategic planning; organizational deve lopment; program develo pment and evaluation; policy research and development; coordination and development of the Division's legislative responses, reports, and testimonies; and management of the Division's data systems. Since Fiscal Year 2008 -09, WITS ha s been used as a data collection and billing system for all ADAD contracted substance abuse treatment providers . The data collected was used to annually report admission and discharge information to the Legislature . While WITS has always had the capability to collect substance abuse treatment information about all clients served by its contracted providers, only clients whose services were paid through ADAD contracts were reported . In Fiscal Year 2011- 12, some of ADAD contracted providers began collecting information from the Judiciary, followed in Fiscal Year 2013 -14 with the Hawaii Paroling Authority; and in Fiscal Year 2015 -16, the Department of Public Safety . ADAD continues to strengthen collaboration with the Office of Youth Services, the Department of Public Safety and 30 the Judiciary to use WITS as their substance abuse treatment data collecting and monitoring system. 31 APPENDICES A.

Comparable figures by county are as follows: For the City and County of Honolulu, 59,459 (9.46%) of t he total 628,853 adults on O'ahu are in need of treatment for alcohol and/or other drugs. For Maui County, 9,699 (9.89%) of the 98,042 adults on Maui, Lanai and Molokai are in need of treatment for alcohol and/or other drugs. For Kauai County, 8,121 (17.15%) of the total 47,346 adults on Kauai are in need of treatment for alcohol and/or other drugs.** For Hawaii County, 8,189 (7.96%) of the total 102,849 adults on the Big Island are in need of treatment for alcohol and/or other dr ugs. The five -year (Fiscal Year 2015 to Fiscal Year 2019 ) average annual ADAD -funded admissions for adults is 3,027, which is 3.5% of the estimated need for adult alcohol and drug abuse treatment. * \"State of Hawaii 2004 Treatment Needs Assessment,\" Department of Health, Alco hol and Drug Abuse Division, 2007. ** The 2004 Kauai County data present a unique pattern of use, abuse and dependence that makes the data difficult to analyze and compare to other counties within the State. The resul ts of the Kauai County data need to be further investigated in order to reconfirm the accuracy of the information . Other statewide studies may also provide information on the county drug/alcohol problem . One data source, the Department of Health's 2007 Beh avioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, provides county data on alcohol which are comparable. 38 APPENDIX E 2007-08 ESTIMATED NEED* FOR ADOLESCENT (GRADES 6-12) ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT IN HAWAII Diagnosis for Abuse or De pendence of any Substance, Based on DSM -IV Criteria, for Gender, Grade Level, and Ethnicity (weighted percents) No Yes Total n % n % Overall Total 5,753 92.3 553 7.7 6,306 Gender Male 2,478 93.2 210 6.8 2,688 Female 3,023 91.7 316 8.3 3,339 Grade 6th Grade 1,807 98.4 33 1.6 1,840 8th Grade 1,555 95.2 88 4.8 1,643 10th Grade 1,150 89.5 150 10.5 1,300 12th Grade 1,241 82.2 282 17.8 1,523 Ethnicity Japanese 778 94.6 49 5.4 827 Caucasian 1,040 88.5 153 11.5 1,193 Filipino 1,451 95.3 89 4.7 1,540 Native Hawaiian 999 88.9 132 11.1 1,131 Other A sian 426 96.4 17 3.6 443 Other Pacific Islander 481 93.0 39 7.0 520 2 or more ethnicities 129 86.8 20 13.2 149 Other 346 88.9 49 11.1 395 The Hawaii Student Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use Study: 2007- 2008 Comprehensive Report. NOTE: Data was c ollected from students in grades 6, 8, 10 and 12 across the State, using a risk and protective factors approach, to report le vels of substance use and treatment needs in Hawaii . Specifically, data illustrate the prevalence rates of alcohol, tobacco and oth er drug use among Hawaii's adolescents and provides information on risk and protective factors associated with adolescent substance use . Analyses were conducted to determine the number of studen ts who met the American Psychiatric Association DSM- IV criteri a for any substance abuse or dependence by gender, grade level and ethnicity . For the purposes of this study, abuse and dependence variables were combined such that students who qualified would meet criteria for any substance abuse or dependence as a singl e variable . In addition, all substances were combined into a single category . Therefore, students who met criteria for abuse or dependence for any substance are identified as individuals in need of treatment. The table above provides the percentages of st udents meeting criteria for substance use disorders overall by gender, grade and ethnicity: For treatment needs by gender, more females (8.3%) than males (6.8%) met criteria for abuse or dependence for any substance use. For treatment needs by grade, 1.6 % of 6th graders, 4.8% of 8th graders, 10.5% of 10th graders and 17.8% of 12th graders met criteria for substance abuse or dependence. Adolescents most likely to meet criteria for substance abuse or dependence were Caucasians (11.5%) and Native Hawaiians (11.1%) . Students identified as Other ethnicities (11.1 %) had higher rates as well, but it should be noted that the sample size for Other ethnicities was not as large as that of Caucasians and Native Hawaiians . In addition, 7% of students of Other Pacific Islander ancestry also met criteria. Japanese (5.4%) and Filipino (4.7%) students had the lowest rates of needing treatment for substance use. The five -year (Fi scal Year 2015 to Fiscal Year 201 9) average annual ADAD -funded admissions for adolescents is 1,908, which is 30.3% of the estimated need for adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment. 39 APPENDIX F METHAMPHETAMINE ADMISSIONS 200 9 - 2019 As re flected in the graph and table below, there was a 1.1% increase and a 16.0% in crease in adult and adolescent crystal methamphetamine admissions to treatment, respectively, in Fiscal Year 2018 -19. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 24 28 15 21 24 26 16 30 25 29 by contracted substance abuse treatment providers, the above data encompass \"ice\" admissions that are funded by all sources of funds which includes client s whose services are ADAD - funded, as well as coverage by Medicaid (i.e., QUEST) and health insurance coverage under Chapter 40 431M, HRS, relating to mental health and alcohol and drug abuse treatment insura nce benefits . Data reported on Appendices A, B and C are for ADAD- funded admissions only. 41 REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 329E -6, HAWAII REVISED STATUTES REQUIRING A REPORT ON UNINTENTIONAL OPIOID- RELATED DRUG OVERDOSE Section 2 of Act 68, SLH 2 016, requires that the Department of Health ascertain, document, and publish an annual report on the number of, trends in, patterns in, and risk factors related to unintentional opioid- related drug overdose fatalities occurring each year within the State. The report shall also provide information on interventions that would be effective in reducing the rate of fatal or nonfatal drug overdose. This report is the result of a collaboration between ADAD , the DOH Emergency Management Services and Injury Prevention Systems Branch (EMSIPSB) , the University of Hawaii Office of Public Health Studies and the Hawaii Opioid Initiative (HOI) . Numbers, Trends, and Patterns Data from the HOI website called https://www.hawaiiopioid.org/opioid- dashboard/ shows a 5 -year average of 59 opioid- related fatal overdoses from 2013- 2017 accor ding to the D OH d eath certificate database, a decrease from the previous 5 -year average of 67 deaths a year from 2012- 2016. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control 's (CDC) WONDER system, a national public health dataset shows that Hawaii opioid poisoning fatality rates appear to be trending downward (5.2 in 2016 to 3.4 in 2017) (Figure 1) while the national rate appears to steadily increase (14.9 in 2017). When compared to overall drug poisonings, Hawaii's rate appears steady at 13.8 (Figure 2) wh ich is still well below the national rate. And when compared to other states, Hawaii has the third lowest fatality rate of poisonings due to prescription opioids, methadone, heroin and opium (4.4) which is also well below the national rate (Figure 3). 42 Figure 1. Adjusted opioid poisoning fatality rates (per 100,000), Hawaii vs. U.S., 1999- 2018 (includes poisonings due to heroin and opium.) Figure 2. Adjusted drug poisoning fatality rates (per 100,000), Hawaii vs. U.S., 1999- 2018. 43 Figure 3. Adjus ted opioid poisoning fatality rates (per 100,000), by state, 2013 -2017 (includes poisonings due to heroin and opium). When looking at poisoning fatality rates by type of drug, CDC WONDER data show that deaths due to synthetic drugs like fentanyl and tr amadol have increased significantly (Figure 4). This picture contrasts with Hawaii death certificate data which show a greater prevalence of fatal opioid poisonings among Hawaii residents due to natural or semi - synthetic opioids like codeine, morphine, oxy codone and hydrocodone (Figure 5). 44 Figure 4. Adjusted opioid poisoning fatality rates, by type, U.S., 1999 -2017. Figure 5. Annual number of fatal opioid poisonings among Hawaii residents, by type of opioid, 1999 -2018. 45 A 2016 review of opioid- related fatal overdoses by the City & County of Honolulu then- Medical Examiner's Office ( City MEO) upon request by the EMSIPSB found that : According to the MEO, 91% or 64 of the opioid- related fatal overdoses on Oahu in 2016 were unintentional; Only one victim was described as homeless; About two- thirds or 64% of the victims has a history of mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety, bipolar); 43% were also positive for benzodiazepines which are also known as tranquilizers; More tha n half or 59% of victims tested positive for illicit substances (e.g., methamphetamine, heroin, THC, cocaine) ; and 39% of the victims had an opioid prescription. Source: EMSIPSB The EMSIPSB in prior work for the CDC linked the City MEO autopsy records wit h the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) which is operated by the Department of Public Safety. Of the 67 opioid- related fatal overdoses on Oahu in 2016, PDMP records matched for 76% or 51 decedents. The match found that: 73% or 49 of the decedent s had prescriptions pain fentanyl ; o About two thirds of them received their latest prescriptions within the last four months prior to death; o Nearly two -thirds or 63% of the 49 decedents with O PR prescriptions were not in compliance with CDC prescriber guidelines to guard against overlap ping between OPR and benzodiazepine prescriptions. 24% ha d a single prescriber, whereas another 24% had 2 -3 prescribers, another 27% had 4- 5, and the last 24% ha d 6-18; Nearly half or 47% of the 51 matched decedents tested positive for benzodiazepines; Most or 71% of the 51 matched decedents had a benzodiazepine prescription filled within thirteen (13) days or sooner of their death; Of the 193 OPR prescribers: o 55% wrote only a single OPR prescription, and o 88% prescribed OPRs to a single victim. There were no significant differences between the matched decedent group and the unmatched group in ter ms of age, gender, residency, and testing positive for illicit substan ces. Source: EMSIPSB Risk Factors and Effective Interventions Against Opioid Overdose The risk factors identified by the EMSIPSB in the 2016 consultat ions with the City Medical Examiner's Office and the PDMP include but are not limited to: 46 Use of benzodiazepines Use of illicit substances (e.g., methamphetamine, heroin, THC, cocaine) Had recent (less than four months) for pain relievers including methadone, codeine, hydrocodone History of mental illness (e.g ., depression, anxiety, bipolar) Other risk factors perhaps not considered in the 2016 autopsy record review that may also contribute towards opioid overdose includes: Male Caucasian Arrested more than 3 times in life Divorced Sleep apnea Positive drug s creening test Liver disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma Past overdose Past i ntravenous drug use Source: Wilder et al. J Addict Dis . 2016; 35(1): 42-51. doi:10.1080/10550887.2016.1107264 According to the CDC, the best ways to prevent opioid overdose deaths are to improve opioid prescribing, reverse overdoses , prevent misuse, and treat opioid use disorder. Improve Opioid Prescribing . CDC has issued the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to provide recommendations for prescribing opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain (pain lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing) outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end - of-life care. Reverse Overdoses. CDC recommends expanded access to and use of naloxone - a non- addictive, life -saving drug that can r everse the effects of an opioid overdose when administered in time. CDC also recommends expansion of Good Samaritan Laws, which already exist in Hawaii. In the event of an overdose, these types of policies protect the victim and the person seeking medica l help for the victim from drug possession cha rges. Prevent Misuse. CDC recommends: Expanded use of the PDMP; Prescription drug laws; Formulary management strategies in insurance programs, such as prior authorization, quantity limits, and drug utilization review Academic detailing to educate provider s about opioid prescribing guidelines and 47 facilitating conversations with patients about the risks and benefits of pain treatment options Quality improvement programs in health care systems to increase implemen tation of recommended prescribing practices Patient education on the safe storage and disposal of prescription opioids Improve awareness and share resources about the risks of prescription opioids, and the cost of overdose on patients and families (like th e Rx Awareness campaign website) . Opioid Use Disorder Treatment. CDC advocates expanded access to evidence- based treatments, including medication -assisted therapy (MAT ) which is a comprehensive wa y to address the needs of individuals that com bines the use of medication (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) with counseling and behavioral therapies (like the SAMHSA Treatment Locator and National H elpline) . ADAD continues to implement the co llaborative and multidisciplinary stakeholder response currently known as the HOI. While a revision to the 2019 opioid plan is in process, ADAD wish to emphasize that the overarching goal of the collaborative i s to also develop Action Plans for other subst ance misuse issues (like methamphetamine). The HOI is currently working on the following objectives: Treatment Access: o Increase the number of prescribers licensed to prescribe and administer MAT such as bupr enorphine and suboxone by 25% o Expand coordinated entry system pilot to a statewide system for all ADAD contracted providers by Dec. 2019; Prescriber Education & Pain Management o Establish a process within the Medical Review Board for professional or institu tional review and engagement w ith prescribers who may be over - prescribing or who are engaged in prescribing practices that are of concern (separate from law enforcement). o By Dec . 2019 develop and recommend a plan for education for physicians specific to o pioid prescribing and pain management practices that includes oversight to ensure that content remains relevant and current. o Identify and evaluate mechanisms to increase use of o pioid/pain management education for prescribers upon relicensing or renewal of prescriptive authority. o Promote UH Project ECHO Series on Opioid and Pain management information. o Promote educational offerings that provide relevant opioid and pain managemen t information. This will include development of a minimum of eight short vide o clips that can be distributed widely to enhance prescriber knowledge of relevant topics (\"Mocha Minutes\"). Data- Informed Decision Making o Support and recommend legislature that a llows data sharing between the Narcotic Enforcement Division (NED) and DOH. 48 o Standardize a framework for collecting, synthesizing and disseminating data. o Develop electronic health record (EHR) interface between hospital and primary care settings. o Identify methods to optimize the completeness of P DMP data through additional softwar e enhancements and personnel support. o Develop an electronic health record (EHR) interface between hospitals and primary care settings. o Increase prescriber education regarding access to and use of PMP, including delegates by an additional 20%. o Increase c apacity of the data dashboard through a standardized framework for data to be utilized by all workgroups and published on www.hawaiiopi oid.org o By Dec . 2019 increase data collection by pulling in additional data s ets and continue to apply analytics to the data to describe, predict, and improve each of the workgroup's performance. o Coordinate with all workgroups to develop a centralized sys tem for naloxone distribution, utilization and tracking. o By Dec . 2019 develop a data summary on medical cannabis statutes and patterns of utilization through a literature review. Prevention and Public Education o Continue developing and establishing a medi a campaign that encompasses themes and topics from all focus areas. o Continue to develop and disseminate an evidenced -based training module on opioid use, misuse, overdose and harms resources in Hawaii. o Create a comprehensive two -year marketing campaign th at serves to develop, finalize, and disseminate branding and products (e.g. e vidence- based training module on opioid use, misuse, overdose and related harms for non- prescribers) as the next stage in a multi -modal public awareness campaign to increase awareness of opioid issues, risks and centralize resources in Hawaii. o Expanding D rug Take -Back Options. P romote awareness of existing \"take back\" sites through www.hawaiiopioid.org and other channels (e.g. infographics), and increase access by implementing at least two additional year-round \"take back\" sites on Oahu. o By Dec . 2019, est ablish partnerships with at least ten new organizational allies (e.g. hepatitis coalitions, faith -based groups, environmental justice, hygiene centers, youth groups) to develop, i mplement, and evaluate at least two locally -based prevention projects that ca n be shared as successful models of care. Pharmacy -Based Interventions o Train pharmacists to screen for opioids users for SUD. This can be coordinated with implementation of SBIRT project activities. o Continue developing the Pharmacist Naloxone training pro gram. o Create a marketing campaign to increase awareness about Act 154 ( 2019) and the availability of Naloxone. Group will identify their targeted audience for campaigns and will ensure there is agreement about 49 messaging as to not confuse viewers. o Review p reauthorization requirements for Naloxone that may be potential barrier for pharmacists prescribing under Act 154 (2019) and provide an action plan to resolve. Support for Law Enforcement and First Responders o Establish LEAD in Maui and Hawaii Counties o Develop mechanism for real time reporting and data collection for opioid related incidents and emergencies. o Develop a resource card or an infographic about the availability and effectiveness of treatment options for both the opioid users and their families in healthcare settings. This resource card may also be a utilized for first responders (collaborating with H IDTA). o Collect data on implementation and utilization of ODOM Mapping pilot and discuss expansion project. Maui P olice D epartment has piloted the ODOM Mapping system to disseminate real time data reporting of SUD related or crisis incidents for coordinate d response efforts by available community resources. o Develop data needs and coordinate with the Department of the Medical Examiner on data resources, collection and reporting. o Continue providing support to NED for P DMP utilization and effectiveness. o Provide support for coordinated entry and related referral and access efforts such as LEAD implementation on Maui and Hawaii counties. Also provide coordination and leadership for community stakeholders and resources for implementing LEAD activities. "}
