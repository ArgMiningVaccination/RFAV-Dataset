And, on this episode of the [Ben Greenfield Life podcast](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/). Jeremy: So, the inspiration for all this for me was the spiritual retreat that I had. And, for the first time, I actually saw the connection between nature, humans, environment. And, I was like, \"There's got to be a way to replicate this in a non-dangerous, non-threatening way without the use of various pharmaceuticals.\" And, this was the closest thing we could find. Ben: Faith, family, fitness, health, performance, nutrition, longevity, ancestral living, biohacking, and a whole lot more. Welcome to the show. What mattress do I sleep on? Well, I'm picky. I'm very picky. I wanted a mattress that blocks EMF, that increases deep sleep cycles based on my actual measurements, that actively cools my body even if I can't use one of those fancy bed top cooling thingamajigs, accelerates recovery, something my wife likes and I like, something that doesn't off-gas a bunch of chemicals, something that is designed using your health in mind and nothing else, no fancy bells or whistles or Wi-Fi or gadgets or springs or anything. Okay, this is like sleeping on the most natural surface imaginable. They've even done what's called dark film microscopy on people's blood cells when they sleep on this mattress and actually allows your blood cells, your freaking blood cells, to return to a natural free-flowing state that allows your bloodstream to optimize the oxygen flowing through your body, improves your body's nighttime recovery cycle, improves your sleep quality. Sleep is so important to me. You know that. I'm super picky. I don't just sleep on stuff because people give it to me, I sleep on stuff because I do the research. And, this mattress is top of the top. [Essentia](http://myessentia.com/bengreenfield). E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A, you go to myessentia, M-Y-E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A, [myessentia.com/BenGreenfield](http://myessentia.com/bengreenfield). Use code That'll get you an additional $100 off your Essentia mattress. So, myessentia.com/BenGreenfield and use code BENVIP. Well, today, I want to talk about organ meats. Most of you know I'm a huge advocate of eating what I call nature's multivitamin on a daily basis. Yes, organ meats. You don't have to put raw liver in your smoothie like I do though, or heart, or kidney, or spleen to access the most nutrient-rich foods on the planet. Because organ meats, especially those from grass-fed, grass-finished cows, you can actually take in a capsule. Problem is a lot of capsules aren't sourced well or they're simply too difficult to get your hands on when it comes to grass-fed, grass-finished sources. Now, one of my friends you might know, his name is [Paul Saladino](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/low-carb-ketogenic-diet-podcasts/the-carnivore-diet/), also known as [Carnivore MD on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carnivoremd2.0/). He's been on my podcast many times. He founded a company called [Heart & Soil](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/heartandsoilpodcast). These are grass-fed, grass-finished, were generally farmed beef organs in supplement form. You can take them on the go, sprinkle them on food. I'll break open the capsule sometimes. I chew the capsules. It's like nature's multivitamin but on steroids, without actual steroids, don't worry. So, you're going to get 10% off of these fine, fine organ meat-based supplements. Go to [heartandsoil.co](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/heartandsoilpodcast), heartandsoil.co and use code BEN10. That's BEN 1-0 for 10% off, heartandsoil.co and use code BEN10 for 10% off of anything from Heart & Soil. Let's talk about your gut. Is it super, super duper? Well, if it's not, then I got to tell you about this stuff. It's called [Supergut](http://supergut.com/ben). They recently sent me a bunch, and what it is designed to do is nourish the healthy bacteria in your small intestine but without giving you crazy gas and stuff like a lot of this fiber does. So, it's a resistant starch fiber mix. It's this clean vegan gut health booster. In one placebo-controlled trial, Supergut's Resistant Starch Shakes were proven to reduce hemoglobin A1C, which is your blood sugar by 0.7% in 12 weeks. That's actually pretty significant. The resistant starch fiber mix lower blood sugar 22 to 42% two hours after a meal. It's not a secret that having fiber with the meal will lower your blood sugar, but this stuff blows the other fiber mixes out of the water. Comes in packets. You have one packet of Supergut balancing fiber to your morning coffee or your smoothie that gives you 8 freaking grams of prebiotic fiber to your entire morning routine. That's significant. Prebiotics are food for the good bacteria in your gut. So, go to [supergut.com/Ben](http://supergut.com/ben) and use code BEN20 for 20% off your first purchase of Supergut, gut-balancing fiber mix. That's supergut.com/Ben and use code BEN20. What you are about to hear is a crazy, crazy podcast interview. I don't think I did it justice honestly. I visited a place called [The Bioenergetic Institute](https://www.ammortal.com/about/) in Lexington, Kentucky. I'll walk in this place and I'm greeted by an old friend of mine who I've known from the precision medicine space back in the day, a guy named Dr. Jeremy Stitch. Super smart, cool, down-to-earth dude, and he had been texting me these cryptic texts for the past few months that he was building some crazy new biohacking meets spirituality, meets diagnostics, meets healing type of modality, but I really wasn't quite sure what he meant. A lot of these things you got to experience for yourself. So, my wife dropped me off at his place and she goes off to run some errands, and I go in there and it's in this tight clean room in this cool little pretty area outside Lexington. And, right in the middle of the room is this massive Tesla coil. It looks something off of a deck of Star Trek-fueled truckies, I suppose maybe something from an Avengers spaceship or whatever for you modern-day newfangled kiddos. Anyways, if you've seen the [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger) before, which is a Tesla coil, it was like that. It's basically a giant Tesla coil. So, this is in the center of the room and this thing's just blasting the entire space. You smell essential oils and this coil is just lighting up the whole room with energy specifically pulse electromagnetic field energy. And then, we talk about in this podcast. That was kind of crazy. It was interesting. I was like, \"Well, I have a BioCharger. I've kind of felt these type of frequencies hit my body before\" They're cool. They're very healing. They're very energizing depending on what state you happen to desire to be and what the frequencies are doing to your body. But then, he takes me in this other separate side room like a treatment facility or a patient room and there's this crazy glass crystal bowl-esque-looking device attached via a long coil to these magnetic foot pads. And, he sits me down, he has maybe put both my feet on the pads and has me hold this glass bowl in my hands. And then, basically, he tells me to just get ready for this crazy experience. I put on noise or not a noise, but a light-blocking mask if I can talk today. And, I put in headphones, and then he told me just play some deep meditative music, so I did. And then, he flips this thing on and look, I know maybe not all of you have done psilocybin or LSD or going on a plant medicine journey or experience some deep, deep out-of-body experience, maybe holotropic breathwork is something else you might have experienced something like this before, my whole body just went to a different planet. I was weeping. I was sobbing. I was laughing. I was holding my breath for five minutes. I was just in this whole trance-like state as all these electrical waves went through my body. They weren't painful, it was just these pulsed electromagnetic field just surging through my whole body adjusting my cellular voltage all over the place including my brain. And, we talk about the science in this episode, so I'm just laying down the groundwater for you about what I experienced there. It felt hours. And, he comes back in the room. I guess, I'd been there about 40 minutes or so. And, my body just felt as though somebody had pushed the reboot button on it. My nervous system had gotten the reboot button pushed on it. And then, he's like, \"Okay, you ready for the treatment?\" And, I'm like, \"Oh, gee, I thought that was a treatment.\" But, what happened was he was in the other room doing the same thing. So now, he's all charged up with this electricity. He has me continue to sit down, but now he puts both his feet on the pad. I'm still holding the bowl, and that means his hands are completing the circuit and he starts to go through up and down my body with almost this electrical massage using his hands. And, every time he'd find a nerve or an area that needed to be treated, my muscles would vibrate and a couple of times, they would even spark, produce sparks that went over into his hand. And, he basically treated my whole body up and down my spine, reset my whole nervous system, hit the hips, and then he even treated my knee, which was bugging me a little bit. And, it was crazy, it was crazy as though I was being electrically massaged is the best way I can describe it. And so, then he finished with this final 10-minute session back to what I've done before to align everything after he'd finished the session. And then, we recorded the podcast you're about to hear. And, I was dead. I felt like I've been hit up by a truck. That sounds bad, but I didn't want to record a podcast. I was like, \"I need to go lay down.\" I need to go meditate or something because my body is telling me like, have you ever had a massage before and you don't want to just go back to work, you want to go chill, read a book sit around? That's how I felt. And so, I did the podcast, and I apologize for the wind, by the way, we went for a walk. There was a little bit of wind, but you'll get the information either way. I practice what I preach. We're walking in the sunshine outside of his office. So, he drops me back off at the hotel where my wife and I are staying and I walk in, I tell my wife, I'm like, \"I don't know if I can go to dinner tonight\" because we had planning going to dinner with a bunch of friends, I'm like, \"I just need to go lock myself away in the room for a little while because my body just felt weird like frazzled.\" So, I go in there in the room, I close my eyes, and just let myself center and I meditated for about 25 minutes, just deep breathing, eyes closed. After 25 minutes, my eyes popped open and I stood up and I was like on top of the world. Not only did I feel clean as a bell like I was 16 years old, I slept like a baby that night. I woke up the next day just charged up full of energy, I had to go catch a plane and fly to another place. I was just like on top of the freaking world. And, I mean, I don't remember if I can ask Jeremy during this interview, but basically, I'm like, \"Okay, where can I get this thing?\" because you could actually have a friend do the electrical massage on you or a massage therapist because the body is just talking the electricity back to the therapist, so they don't have to be super-duper, duper trained to do it. You could sit with this thing in your home holding the ball in your hands meditating in the mornings. I haven't even really grasped the concept of how deep this could penetrate in the medicine particularly as an electrical modality and kind of like the frontier of medicine. But hopefully, that gives you an idea of the experience I had that led up to the discussion that you're about to hear first with a couple of patients of Dr. Stitch's and then with Jeremy Stitch himself. So, enjoy. It was called The Bioenergetic Institute by a company called [Ammortal](https://www.ammortal.com/about/), A-M-M-O-R-T-A-L. And, the shownotes are at BenGreenfieldLife.com/Ammortal, A-M-M-O-R-T-A-L. So, Gwen, tell me about what you experienced here and how you came to know about this stuff? Gwen: Yeah, totally. So, in 2013 at 29 years old, I was diagnosed with two different types of cancer, independent from one another, supposedly unrelated, so Hodgkin's lymphoma and thyroid cancer. And, to say that my life upended at that point would be an understatement. I went from being a pretty healthy or I thought pretty healthy person to having a team of oncologists, some radiologists, and more doctors than I ever care to interact with at that point in my life. So, the first cancer that they treated was the thyroid cancer. And, I had a total thyroidectomy for that and had some post-surgical complications. My parathyroid glands were damaged during the surgery, so my blood calcium level dropped really fast really critically. I ended up hospitalized for that and then on long-term calcium supplementation to try to get me to a normal level. And then, after surgery for the thyroid cancer, we started chemo for the Hodgkin's lymphoma. And, that was really intense, was every week for eight weeks, which ended up being a little delayed because of complications. Jeremy: And, you lost your parathyroids too, right? Gwen: Yeah. So, the parathyroids were damaged during the thyroidectomy. That's what messed up \u2014 Ben: Like basically lost. Gwen: Yeah. Ben: Like not functioning. Gwen: Gone like not operational at all, whatsoever. Jeremy: They've got a tiny, tiny blood supply. So, when you do the surgery, it's not hard to cut one or two of them. Unfortunately, you lost all. Ben: And, they're responsible for basically all the calcium modulation in the body, right? Gwen: Yeah. So, your parathyroids release something called parathyroid hormone, which basically triggers your osteoclasts in your body to chew up bone and basically release that bone mineralization into your bloodstream. And, when you don't have parathyroid hormone, your osteoclasts don't do their jobs. So, they don't chew up that bone, your blood calcium level drops off really fast, and there's no homeostatic system in place to keep that in check without the parathyroid hormone. So, I was taking 10,000 milligrams of calcium daily along with prescription calc trial, which is just the active form of vitamin D to try to increase my absorption of it. But yeah, had not had a normal calcium level since November of 2013. And, I'll get into how that plays into the story after the rest of the chemo trauma. Ben: Okay. Gwen: So, chemo for the Hodgkin's lymphoma, which was really intensive and totally knocked out my immune system like numerous times ended up hospitalized, neutropenic, had to miss weeks of chemo, which prolonged things. Ended up doing a month of radiation every day after that to the areas that I had the most disease, which were through my mediastinum. So, chest from basically shoulders down to my diaphragm. Had the highest dose of radiation. So, I came out of this happily cancer-free and in remission, but with a whole host of complications caused by my treatment. So, my immune system never came back after chemo. I was neutropenic, my white blood cell count was super, super low. My CD4 count, which is one of your types of white blood cells was below that of someone with AIDS. So, I was the bubble kid. And, I had decided as I went through treatment, I had this calling, spiritual calling, awakening to go into medicine. And, I found that route through pursuing nursing. So, I went back to nursing school and became an RN and then went on to get my master's for family nurse practitioner. And, through that journey was on this mission to not just help other people heal, but to help myself heal. I knew that there must have been an element of health that I had missed previously. Like before I was diagnosed with cancer, I exercised every day, I eat right. I thought I had it really dialed in. Obviously, I didn't. Ben: Never heard that before, by the way. Gwen: I know. A big surprise there. Ben: The Men's Health Magazine tells me to eat, what's going on here? Gwen: Yeah, exactly. So, it was on this quest for the missing pieces of medicine so to speak. And, after being traditionally educated through my master's, I was left feeling hang on a second, now, I'm an NP and I'm supposed to be providing top-level care to my patients and yet I feel I haven't even learned how to provide that care. I knew how to write prescriptions and how to manage chronic disease and the way that we are told to manage it in our medical system, but it wasn't working. All of the patients I was seeing were diabetic or in pain or diagnosed with cancer. It's just this onslaught of health issues that we see in our country. And, it was so clear to me that we were missing something. So, in that search, I ended up connecting into a fellowship in genomic medicine, felt like that could provide more information, more keys to what I was looking for. And, at that point, I connected with Dr. Stitch who's running that fellowship. And, we ended up talking about [bioenergetic medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24004341/#:~:text=Bioenergetic%20medicine%20approaches%20rely%20heavily,fluxes%2C%20which%20complicates%20treatment%20design.), which I never heard of before in my entire life but being fairly open-minded and on this quest for those foundational elements of health, I was open to. So, I first experienced this as a patient. And, after two sessions of using the PEMF machine \u2014 Ben: Which I'll give Jeremy a chance to define exactly what we mean when say things like bioenergetic medicine and PEMF machine. Gwen: Yeah. And, he's way better at explaining the science behind that. I don't even want to try to delve into that. But, after two hands-on sessions with this PEMF machine, I started feeling different, my body just felt different. I'm pretty dialed in. Ben: The same one that I just did like similar to it? Gwen: Yeah. Yup, exactly what you just did. But, all of a sudden, I started feeling like my muscles felt different, like everything just started feeling different. And, I'm pretty intuitive about my body sense at this point, so I started dropping off my calcium level. I was like, \"I don't think I need all this calcium.\" So, incrementally took it down to 5,000 milligrams, still was feeling fine, no muscle cramps, working out every day. Took it down to 250 milligrams and then was like, \"I think I should go get my level checked. I feel like something's different.\" So, went into my endocrinologist, had him draw labs. My calcium level was smack dab in the middle of normal for the first time since 2013. So, persistently depressed for eight and a half years. Ben: This is unheard of like damaged parathyroids. Gwen: Exactly, yup, and spontaneous in air quotes resolution. Ben: Wow. Gwen: Eight and a half years later after two sessions on this. The other part of that in those labs, I had just a basic CBC and panel drawn. And, my white count came back totally normal. Ben: Wow. Garrett: So, at that point, I was like, \"Alright, this is the foundational piece of medicine, of health that I'm looking for.\" Ben: Yeah, yeah. Jeremy: And, you got out of the bubble. Gwen: And, I got out of the bubble. Yeah, I'm no longer in the bubble \u2014 Ben: Yeah, you're just sitting here now and not in a bubble. Do you still do the treatments? Gwen: The PEMF treatments? Ben: Any of them. Yeah. Gwen: Yeah, absolutely. So, I am a practitioner now, so I not only receive treatments, I also give treatments. Jeremy: Yeah. So, we hired her pretty quickly to be our medical director because we're like, \"Oh, man, that's a story that needs to be told.\" Ben: Well, both of you and Jeremy mentioned you meditate with this in the mornings like you'll just sit there holding it, it's almost like a crystal ball that puts a frequency through your body and you'll do prayer and meditation and centering and everything right there holding it. Gwen: Yup. I mean, obviously, PEMF is a tech modality. It's kind of like force bathing but through an electronic device I like to say. But, setting the intention, like integrating in that spiritual component and whatever that looks like for the person because it's different for everybody. But, the connection to something larger than yourself, right? Ben: Yeah. Gwen: Setting your intention of practice when you're using therapies like this increases their effectiveness and basically sets a target point that your body works towards. Ben: Yeah, yeah. You call it force bathing. I've called PEMF in the past earthing on steroids. Gwen: Yeah. Ben: And, this is something totally different. I've used a [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger), I've used a lot of different modalities before. This is different. You feel the current going through your whole body and then all that you talk a little bit later on Jeremy about how you'll sit there and literally do therapies with your hands passing the current through your body. And, that was wacky, it's super cool. Now, that's a powerful story. I know you also have Chuck here. So, we talked to Chuck before you start to fill us in on the science behind all this stuff and how you discovered it in the first. Jeremy: Yeah, because the science is kind of geeky anyway, so we'll get the cool stuff first. Ben: Okay. Alright, let's talk to Chuck. Alright. So, we got Chuck, another one of Jeremy's patients in here. What's up, Chuck? Chuck: How are you? Ben: I'm pretty good. I'm really good after I've been spending the morning here getting all treated up by these crazy space-age-looking devices. Tell me about your experience here and why you came to do this in the first place? Chuck: Well, I've known Jeremy for, I guess, eight years now, eight or nine years. And, I was diagnosed 2020, March 2020, with stage four colorectal cancer, which metastasized to my liver. Have been pretty much level for two and a half years, I guess, with no significant decrease in size. And so, Jeremy contacts me and says, \"I've got something I think you should try.\" Ben: Yeah. Chuck: And, I did, I tried it. And, the first thing we noticed was my tumor marker level went from 60 to 25, so more than half. Ben: Wow. Chuck: It hadn't changed in a year probably. Ben: Wow. Chuck: The next thing and literally last week, I got scans that show a significant change. The lesions that were on my liver are no longer measurable and they were measurable prior. One went from three and a half, by two and a half centimeters did not even showing up. Ben: Were you coming here every day and doing it \u2014 Chuck: Once a week, visit once a week. Ben: Once a week. Jeremy: He was just charging on his own. So, this thing is actually it's a wellness device. I mean, it's not some sophisticated, yeah, it's just providing current and frequency. That's it. And, a tiny microcurrent at that. Chuck uses it about 30 minutes to an hour once a week. Is that right? Chuck: That's right. Jeremy: We're literally coming into my basement. Chuck: Yes, I'm literally walk into his basement and charge for 30 minutes to an hour. Ben: So, the effects of that is powerful. Once a week you were seeing [00:23:16] _____. Chuck: Absolutely, absolutely. And, the other thing I noticed too is not just those great results for me, the recovery from having chemo prior to doing this, chemo would literally knock me down, and just exhausted and couldn't really function great. I went from that to giving them hope from chemo and going to work. Jeremy: The approach is sort of a multi-modality thing. So, it doesn't replace anything, it's complementary. You've got chemo, which is essentially a lytic destruction, it's a force of destruction, point is to kill. You have to have that because you're trying to kill a cancer that's growing fast, it makes total sense. But, we just haven't really addressed how does somebody recover from that. so, you add just a few more ingredients and you've already done a lot to change your lifestyle. You're super connected guy, you're super spiritual. I mean, it's not like you haven't done all the deeper work. Chuck: Correct, right. Jeremy: Alright, but it was a cool addition that helped with recovery and we're happy to see some really cool results. So, I don't want this to be like, \"Hey, this cures everything.\" Chuck: Right, exactly. And, like you said, it's complementary to what I'm doing and, you're right, the spiritual connection of it alone is amazing. But, it's \u2014 Ben: And, you don't see modern oncology is a lot of electrical medicine. Jeremy: No. But, we'll talk about that later. Ben: Alright. Jeremy: You're done with all. Ben: Well, I mean, after hearing those two stories just between Gwen and Chuck, I'm sure that people want to know more about the history of this stuff and how it works. So, first of all, Chuck, thank you for sharing that. Chuck: Thank you. Ben: And, now folks, Jeremy and I are getting duck out in this beautiful Kentucky Sunshine. We're going to go on a walk as you're accustomed to me doing on some of these podcasts that I record. And, you can get the kimono open so to speak in all this stuff. Ready to do this Jeremy? Jeremy: Let's do it. Ben: So, Jeremy, we met a few years back through a couple of mutual acquaintances. My only experience with you really was you were a doctor, you're working with the Wild Health organization, doing some of the genomics-based medicine. And then, we didn't really stay in that close of touch for a while. We kind of like bounce back and forth and talked occasionally. And then, about a year ago, you started hinting to me that you were doing some really interesting forms of electrical medicine. And, I had already been tuned into that a little bit not only with my own experience with the [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger), and [pulse electromagnetic field therapy](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/ben-recommends/other-products/bioblance-pemf/), and [electrical muscle stimulation](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/bjoern-katalyst/), some of the stuff that's interesting but then also, I'd had kind of sort of the equivalent of electrical acupuncture done up in Ohio with that faith healer guy, [Issam Nemeh](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/dr-issam-nemeh-podcast/), which was an interesting experience as well. And so, I kind of sort of understood what you're telling me but didn't really have my head wrapped around it until two hours ago when you actually brought me through a full treatment and blew my mind with it here in Lexington. So, there's obviously a little bit of a technical explanation here. But first, I just want to hear how you got into this, like what drew you from basically allopathy and precision genomics medicine into this? Jeremy: Well, first of all, thanks for having me on, This is a super honor cool program. And, I just feel blessed. Cool story. So, with everything, it's usually the personal story that drives change. And, that was exactly what happened here. So, there's three of them; there's mine, my oldest daughter, and my next daughter. And, I'll go through them in the Reader's Digest version. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: So, my story, I had eosinophilic esophagitis and hypertension at the time. Ben: I'm sure everybody's nodding their head pretending like they know what syphilitic encephalitis, cephalopagus actually is. Jeremy: I was going to get there, man. So, imagine your throat, your esophagus has these strictures in it. So, it's really tight and I got to the point where I couldn't swallow anything that was larger than a small ibuprofen. Ben: Wow. Jeremy: And, I had high blood pressure. So, allopathic medicine has some treatment suggestions and surgeries. So, you basically go and you get your esophagus dilated so that you can swallow. And, it got to the point it was kind of funny, I was eating curry and the chicken got stuck in my throat and my office staff was like, \"Oh, he's doing it again.\" And, they were laughing. I was like, \"Okay, I got to do something about this.\" Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: But anyway, so that was me. At the time, I was the co-founder at Wild Health, I was kind of serving as the COO at the time and basically just helping scale it which put me at a unique position. The front of seeing all these folks coming through presenting their cutting-edge medicine and learning cutting-edge medicine and I didn't have solutions. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: And, that's what made me start searching. And, I looked at \u2014 Ben: Because it's cutting edge mess like you're analyzing every biomarker and gene snipping the human body and looking at the entire chemistry or everything that's going on and you're not getting solutions from that. Jeremy: Yeah. And, on top of that, I was directing at that time, the fellowship. And, at the fellowship, we're teaching 200 clinicians a year. So, these are also cutting-edge people who are bringing their cutting-edge ideas. So, I felt I was at the tip of the spear. And, I was, but there are still no solutions. Ben: And, of course, Thanksgiving is coming up. [ButcherBox](http://butcherbox.com/ben) is giving you free Turkey as they've done in previous years. I sometimes try to go out and hunt the Turkey. Sometimes I come back empty-handed. It doesn't matter. I always have a ButcherBox turkeys back up in the freezer and they taste amazing because these turkeys have no antibiotics or added hormones. They take care of their turkeys, gobble, gobble, and they're giving you one 10 to 14-pound turkey free in your first box. If you go to ButcherBox.com/Ben to claim that deal on free Turkey, did I mention along with your 100% grass-fed beef, free-range organic chicken, pork that's raised crate free, wild-caught seafood, all humanely raised. Did I say no antibiotics or added hormones? I'm saying it again in your turkey or anywhere else. Guilt-free this Thanksgiving, it's free shipping. Free shipping, you don't have to go to the grocery store to get your Turkey. It's 10 to 14 pounds in your first box free when you sign up at [ButcherBox.com/Ben](http://butcherbox.com/ben). Let's talk about [magnesium](http://higherdose.com/ben). So, magnesium is an essential mineral responsible for 300 vital functions in your body, yet 60% of us are deficient. Now, I started working with this company to actually get you magnesium in a very tasty manner. There are these wellness ingestibles from a company called [HigherDOSE](http://higherdose.com/ben), and I helped them develop three different products: Detox Drops, High-Dration Powder, and Chill Chews. They're all designed to pair with the HigherDOSE Infrared Red Light and PEMF devices like their Sauna Blanket and their Infrared Face Mask and their Mat. You take this stuff, you pair it with their products and you enhance the detox, enhance the effects. You can add the Detox Drops to your water before workout or a sauna session. Bunch of hyper-clean ingredients binds to toxins, nice minty flavor. I love that one. I had it in my coffee this morning actually. Then, they have the High-Dration Powder. That's an electrolyte-rich formula. It's got magnesium, a potent blend of B vitamins, a bunch of other goodies in there specifically to support a sauna session, so you just shoot this stuff back before you go into sauna. Then, they have Chill Chews. These are magnesium gummies. You eat them at night, they help to balance your body and relax your mind. They're super good. They're low-sugar. I'll just got a handful of them. I don't know how I'm supposed to eat. The bottle probably says scrub a handful of them and go to bed and it's amazing and they taste really good. So anyways, this company [HigherDOSE](http://higherdose.com/ben) done some great stuff and I've consulted with them and helped them out with their menu so to speak, so this stuff is huge thumbs up for me because I hope to help them with it. So, you go to [HigherDOSE.com/Ben](http://higherdose.com/ben) to get 15% off of any of their stuff today, HigherDOSE.com/Ben, or you can just use promo code BEN and that will get you 15% off. Alright, this is cool, but you want to pay attention because it's coming up right around the corner on Friday, December 2nd. You're going to get a chance to join me and some really powerful healing physicians down in Sarasota, Florida. This is a live event. It goes from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I'll be there, my friend, and a brilliant former podcast guest, The Doctor Strange of Medicine, Dr. [John Lieurance](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/melatonin-supplementation/) is going to be there, [HBOT USA, Dr. Jason and Melissa Sonners](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/recovery-podcasts/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/) are going to be there with their Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, Brian Richards of SaunaSpace, Harry Paul, one of John's friends who I recently met who's also an amazing healer for an event that's super unique. It's all based around the elements: earth, fire, air, and water, with a ton of treatments and technologies and modalities, and very unique biohacks that you're going to get exposed to during the entire event. Basically, what I mean by that is when it comes to air, you're going to learn about hyperbaric oxygen, and ozone, and air filtration, everything you need to know to upgrade your air. When it comes to earth, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, earthing, grounding, a host of other ways that you can use the power of the planet to enhance your health, your sleep, your recovery, your muscle gain, your fat loss, a lot more water. You'll learn about proper water filtration, how to upgrade your water, hydrogenated water, structured water, basically soup to nuts, everything you need to know about water and how to apply it in your home and your office and your life. And then, finally fire, is a fun one. Lots of cryotherapy, a little bit of ice too, breathwork, inner fire practices, a ton of stuff when it comes to introducing the element of fire into your life. So, this event is super unique. John and I have been working on it behind the scenes and it has come together amazingly. There's even a VIP experience. If you sign up for the VIP experience, you could come two days early or stay a few days after the event, and basically, you will get all the medical protocols customized by Dr. John and his staff if you claim one of those 10 VIP spots. That'll include IV methylene blue, laser treatments, John's really unique bliss release, which is basically an endonasal adjustment, which is essentially a chiropractic adjustment through your nose for your entire skull, which if you've had TBI or concussion or allergies or things like that in the past, it totally reboots that entire system. There's going to also be ozone treatments, Myers' IV cocktails, exosome treatments, IV laser, access to a CVAC machine. And, John's entire facility is going to be at your beck and call if you got one of the VIP tickets. And then, we're also probably going to have a little bit of a party later on in the evening after this event. The whole thing is going to be a pinch-me-I'm-dreaming full-on cutting-edge of biohacking experience. And, I'm just now letting the world know about it so spots are going to fill up pretty fast. Space is limited, but if you want to get in now, here's how. You go to [BenGreenfieldLife.com/Elements-Event](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/elements-event/). That's BenGreenfieldLife.com/Elements-Event. It's in Sarasota, Florida. Again, it's all-day Friday, December 2nd. I would come in early and stay after. If you just want to try out all the crazy modalities there. I don't know how fast those VIP tickets are going to sell out, but either way, this thing is going to be absolutely amazing. I just can't wait, like I'm pinching myself, can't wait to be on the plane to head down there and do this. So, check it out, BenGreenfieldLife/Elements-Event. And, I'll see you there, I hope. Jeremy: So basically, I start studying this, I did an acupuncture course, and started studying microcurrent that started making some progress on myself and with patients. And, I was like, \"Okay, there's something to this, there's a blend of eastern and western medicine that actually makes sense.\" Ben: Yeah. And, electric acupuncture, that's literally the tiny needles go in like the same as you would experience it like a Chinese acupuncture clinic but then, they're actually applying a current into those needles. Jeremy: Yeah, 100%. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: So, we call it microcurrent acupuncture. And, I was getting good results, I was getting 40% improvement in a lot of conditions that were tough to treat, and just tracking the results. And, that's where I'm like, \"Okay, there's something to this.\" And, I would try it on myself, took a course, you did a fellowship, and it was neat stuff. Okay. So, that's my story. And essentially, I was noticing some improvement. The next story is my daughter. So, I had a daughter who is now 14. At the time, she was 7 or 8 and she developed this lytic lesion on her bone. Ben: A lytic lesion. Jeremy: Yeah, I'll go into that. So essentially, it was on her collarbone and it's a lesion that eats away at the bone. And, we first thought it was something called osteomyelitis, which is a bone infection. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: Did surgeries on it, saw pathologists, saw oncologists, and they're like, \"Listen, it's either a bone infection or it's bone cancer.\" And, we don't know. And, this is an 8-year-old kid going through multiple surgeries. Ben: Wow. Jeremy: So, her mom starts praying over her and she goes, \"I know she's going to get better.\" To kind of put this in perspective, we're seeing one of the top pediatric oncology orthopedic. So, this is a guy who has taken more school than I can even \u2014 Ben: Right, like the best, the best of modern medicine. Jeremy: Yeah. And, he's telling us we don't know what this is, it's either cancer or it's a really bad hard to find infection. And, we've been through courses of antibiotics. This is a six-month stent, and all of a sudden, she gets better. So, I'm like, \"Okay, here's two cases now. One I've known about for a while where faith and intention have come into the mix and somebody gets better, and in my case.\" So, this third case is my other daughter. The background on her, she's got spina bifida. She was adopted from outside of Moscow. Ben: Russia. Jeremy: Correct. Ben: Got to clarify with people because I'm moving to a town called Moscow, Idaho so that's going to cut more and more of the podcast. So, clarify. So, you adopted this girl from Moscow, Russia. She has a spina bifida. Jeremy: Yeah, yeah. It was actually a toss-up between we're going to adopt from Moscow, Idaho or Moscow. Ben: Of course, yeah. Jeremy: So yes, Moscow, Russia. And, she's got spina bifida. And, when she came back obviously to the states, it's somewhat traumatic, she's got essentially no treatment and some substantial developmental delays because of that. But, one of the biggest things was she had pretty severe contractures on her feet but was super motivated. So, I had this beautiful kid who's super motivated and willing to try just about anything. And, like any good parent would do, we tried all sorts of things. Allopathic medicine \u2014 Ben: Right, because you have access to all this stuff because you're a trained MD, right? Jeremy: Yeah, yeah, trained MD. And, that's where we start, right? Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: So essentially, we get to the edge where she's kind of just going through the motions. She's seeing all the specialists at one of the top three children's hospitals in the world and we weren't making any progress in fact, but they were telling us was that she would probably get worse and would probably be in a wheelchair. So, yeah, we're like, \"That's not good enough.\" So, we start exploring. And, my interest takes me down to this whole bioenergetic medicine. And, that's where it started really clicking because I saw her do the microcurrent acupuncture and I saw her get functional improvement. Specifically, she had about a 30, 40% percent improvement in her calf circumference, which in a kid with spina bifida, they don't have nerves that work that innervate their calves. Ben: Got it. And, by the way, this microcurrent acupuncture, if someone were receiving that as a treatment, how often are they doing something like that? Jeremy: It varies. Some people do one treatment, some people do a series of 10 treatments. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: It's something I do. I don't do a lot of it. Ben: Like you personally are trained in that? Jeremy: Correct. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: Yeah, it's the MRA, it's what [Dr. Issam Nemeh](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/dr-issam-nemeh-podcast/) \u2014 Ben: Dr. Nemeh. And, by the way, if you guys want to listen to my interview with Dr. Nemeh about electric acupuncture and his faith-based healing practice and how he combines the two, I'll link to that if you go to [BenGreenfieldLife.com/Ammortal](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/ammortal-podcast/), A-M-M-O-R-T-A-L. Jeremy: Yeah. And essentially, watching him do that on my daughter, which is where this inspiration came from was like, \"Okay, there is definitely something to this where we're combining these modalities.\" Ben: Okay. Jeremy: And, with those three stories, what we saw was we saw a young lady who was not able to walk very far without braces. And, she still has spina bifida. That doesn't go away, but she's able to walk without braces, her strength is much, much better. Her independence, which is most important is also much better. So, with those three stories, I'm like, \"I have to start thinking outside of the box.\" When you're trailblazing and when you're cutting trail, you kind of get to the edge and you've got a whole troop behind you, your only choices are to turn back where you came from or to keep going. Ben: Or just stand there. Jeremy: Or stand there. I guess that's true. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: Some people do that. Ben: Called stagnation. Jeremy: So, that's what really led us on this journey. And, it's been a fun one. I learned all sorts of cool things, met lots and lots of really cool people. Ben: Okay. So, this journey, I mean, because I've done electric acupuncture, I've done the treatment with Dr. Nemeh up in Ohio, and it was interesting and I experienced something this morning that was way different than that. and, I don't even know where to start. Do you want to explain how you came to find this technology? Is that a good place to start? Jeremy: Sure, we can do that. So, that's part of my story. I'm on the search. I've seen this microcurrent acupuncture. I'm going doing fellowship trainings and reading books. I'm getting deep, deep, deep into quantum physics. And, not just that, but actually studying the lives of the physicists who found it like Tesla. And, my wife thought I was crazy, but that's another story. So, one of these journeys leads me to a guy near Seattle who has this strange device that I hadn't heard of before. It's a type of PEMF device and it essentially \u2014 Ben: PEMF, just real quick to make sure, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. So, it's a pulsing electrical and magnetic field that is typically in contact with your body or very close to your body that is typically somehow increasing or decreasing the cell voltage. Jeremy: Exactly. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: Exactly. So, I started bringing that into the mix. And, the really important take home from that story is that through this PEMF therapy and doing targeted treatments on my own neck where I had a neck injury, my blood pressure improved. Now, mind you, at the time, I didn't want to bore people too much, but at the time, I was 37 years old in really, really good shape like helping run a precision genetics company and teaching all these guys. So, again, you think you're at the top and you got a lot of lessons to learn. That was me. So, applying this PEMF to my neck specifically in one place relieved the blood pressure. And again, made me think, \"Well, I didn't have to use a needle to do that\" because I had this training in the fellowship and prior to that, I'm poking people with needles. Ben: Anytime you can imagine you can do something without needle phobia, people will perk out. Jeremy: 100%, 100%. So, I started trying and I literally \u2014 Ben: All you got to do is get electrically shocked. I'm just kidding. Jeremy: I did it a few times and caused that, but it's a static shock. And, you quickly realize that if you don't have to use invasive procedures like needles and acupuncture, then all the much more better. And, that's what brought me to using the tech. So, it was a cool story, I took the tech and I was like, let's figure out a way to make this \u2014 Ben: Wait, this guy you met in Seattle, what was he doing with this technology? Was he just playing out there? Did he have a plan for it? Jeremy: No, he had a plan for it and he had a plan to scale it. And, it takes an army to do that kind of thing because you got to get research and you've got it prove the science out. So, that was the idea behind this thing. And, we started partnering on strategies to do that and take it to market with the goal of if we could put this in people's homes and they can heal themselves, that puts me out of business and that's a good thing. Kind of a weird business mentality. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: It's better for all of humanity. Ben: Okay. So, you've got this PEMF device. And, are you modifying it, or is it the same thing I just experienced back at the clinic? Is that exactly what you had experience in Washington? Jeremy: Yeah, so that's a prototype. And essentially, this brings us into the science. Ben: Yeah, because I want to know how this works, the nerdy part of me and I know a lot of my audience is into the health hacking side of things. So, explain to me what's actually going on. What was I experiencing back there when my whole body was just getting electrically tuned so to speak? Jeremy: Alright. So, this is a multi-faceted thing. Let's start with the simplicity. Most people overestimate PEMF and electromagnetic fields. If you start by imagining yourself doing what we're doing now, we're walking in nature, we've got the sights and sounds of nature around us. So, we are just exposed to thousands and thousands of bio fields. Ben: Alright, our natural primal environment, natural electricity. Jeremy: Right. And, those fields provide data in the form of frequency. So, you've got electromagnetic fields, that's the carrier, that's the wave and you've got data in the form of frequency how often those waves hit you. That's this very, very dumbed-down simplistic version of what PEMF is doing, it's providing those things. And, there's all sorts of different varieties. So, what we did was we take this therapy and we want to make sure that it's delivered in a analogous way that the body can receive it. So, we are organic creatures, and that means we have this sinusoidal wave, it's called an analog wave. It looks a wavy up and down sine wave that you learned about in calculus. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: We're not digital creatures, so we realized pretty quickly that using a digital signal wasn't giving us the results that we were using. Digital signals, 1, 0, so it's straight up and it's straight down, it doesn't look like that wavy motion that you want in a sine wave. Ben: Right. Would you say it's more a square waveform, digital waveform? Jeremy: Exactly. Ben: Okay. Yeah. Jeremy: That's exactly what it is. Ben: Yeah. I picture in my head. I know what you're talking about. Jeremy: So, we realized that and then we realized that most of the frequency-based therapy is a recipe-based theory. It's essentially like we know that 15 hertz is good for wound healing and neuropathy, and we know that 420 is good for feeling good in meditation or whatever. Ben: Right. So, that'd be when I use the [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger), I could set on energy, on sleep, on relaxation. It's running a specific recipe. Jeremy: Right. And, there's nothing wrong with that approach, except that when you use that approach, you have to study every single one of those fields and you're not necessarily replicating nature or you're doing it in a very, very slow way that doesn't progress very far. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: So, the difference then is being able to apply a whole range of random analog frequencies at one time. So, the approach that we took was let's replicate nature. We basically introduced all these frequencies at one time in a way that the body can receive them and we then let the body decide which ones it wants. So, instead of giving you a recipe and saying, \"Ben, you need 15, 300, 1,600, 2,040 hertz today,\" we say, \"Ben, let's give you a tiny microcurrent and a range of frequencies and let your body know what it needs best.\" Ben: So, you're just throwing the whole cookbook at my body instead? Jeremy: Exactly. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: A very safe way. And then, it grounds out whatever you don't need. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: And, that's what you receive today. So, you're receiving this tiny microcurrent. It ranges from about 4 to 6 microvolts, very, very small, but you're receiving a range of frequencies that are analogous to your body. Ben: Okay. So, as I'm sitting there receiving those frequencies, you had me wear headphones, you had me put on a mask. Is that typically what somebody would do? Let's say you're sick or let's say you want recovery, does it matter you just sit there and you meditate or you listen to music or you can't read a book because you're holding this weird-looking space-age-y crystal that's putting the feel to your body? But, how do you actually use the thing? Jeremy: The space age crystal, it's actually a globe, a vacuum. It's got neon gas in it. That's one of the ways that those frequencies, that range of frequency is delivered. But, to your point, yes, everybody gets a benefit no matter what. But, I mentioned the intention a couple times. And, the intention comes in the focus, what are you doing with that. So, there's studies out there. This is not new to the medical world, there are studies that say if a intervention, if a patient believes it's going to work, it's going to work better. And, if their clinician believes it's going to work, it's going to work better and both of them believe it's going to work best. So, that's what the research says. So, we just applied that intention and that mindset to heal it. So, the belief is the body is well-designed. And, with intention, we can dictate where that goes. Does that make sense? Ben: It does. We're playing devil's advocate. Have you ever kind of experimented with the idea or tested this in patients of someone just sitting in a chair closing their eyes setting an intention, putting on a mask listening to music and comparing that to the people who are actually using the device and doing the same thing? Jeremy: Absolutely, man. It's a stack therapy. So, that's the idea. None of those are bad individually, they work better together. If you can replicate the natural environment that humans are in and we have a good mindset, we heal better. Ben: Now, this idea though of the electrical treatment on the body affecting the body in some way is something that I think still needs a little bit of explanation. Jeremy: Yes. Ben: When I sat down, you told me about my cells and my cell voltage, and maybe that'd be a good place to start. Tell me about what theoretically could be going on here from a cellular standpoint, this whole idea of cellular voltage? Jeremy: Yeah, it's a great point. It's a great point I'll give a little history on this, but before I do, I want to give a synopsis. So, every cell has a voltage. That voltage is called resting membrane potential. And, the theory behind it is that by restoring the resting membrane potential, the cells communicate to each other better. If you look at the structure of a cell, you know that the membrane is where all the action happens. The ions are being exchanged there. There are all sorts of gated channels; ligand-gated, mechanical-gated, voltage-gated, whatever. All the talk happens at the cell surface. And, it also maintains a voltage and does that by pumping ions in and out. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: So, for two cells to be able to talk to each other, they have to speak the same language. They can speak different dialects, their different dialects, it'll work. If it's completely different language, it doesn't work. And, by restoring that cellular voltage, what we're doing is we're basically putting all the cells at an equal playing field. And typically, we think of the neuron. That's the classic example. So, a neuron's resting membrane potential is typically around negative 70 millivolts. It fires at negative 55. And, if we can figure out ways that we restore all those cells to the arresting membrane potential, they fire better, they communicate better. Ben: Is it true that exposure to a lot of non-native EMF like cell phone radiation, and Wi-Fi, and possibly even Bluetooth would cause, the way it's been explained to me, a calcium influx with calcium being a positively charged ion that would actually shift the negative 70 towards a negative 40 or negative 30 or to a point where depolarization is less likely to occur. And so, therefore, one of the problems with our evolutionary mismatched society in terms of the electrical soup we live in, the non-native electrical soup we live in, is that our cells are in a state of sub-optimal depolarization, they're basically at a slightly higher millivolt potential than it should be at. Jeremy: Yeah, that's definitely the theory I subscribe to. There's multiple theories. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: I would also argue there's probably more to that story and it's a really interesting one, which is overexposure. We can adapt to a lot of a big variety. Think about, again, using that example, a human out in a forest, tons and tons of different frequencies. You put that human underneath a cell phone tower or underneath a bunch of power lines, and then there's one dominant frequency that is overexposed. So \u2014 Ben: And, is that dominant frequency also one of those square waveform frequencies? Jeremy: A lot of times it is, yeah. Ben: Okay. And then, also is the hertz important? Because I know the Earth naturally emits 0 to 100 hertz or so, which is a frequency that's almost energizing to the human body but then that's hertz and then you look at your Wi-Fi router, is that like gigahertz like a much more powerful frequency? Jeremy: It is. I don't necessarily think though the hertz is as big of a player as we think. To me, the hertz represents the data. So, the data is what travels on the wave. And, that comes in the form of how many times does that wave hit you. That's frequency. Ben: So, it's more the delivery mechanism that that package is being received in? Jeremy: Yeah, that's what I think of it. Ben: Okay. Alright, got it. So, back to the cellular voltage. So, you have the cellular voltage hypothesis, and what's happening in terms of the way that something like this bioelectrical modality is affecting the cell polarization? Jeremy: Yeah. So, you're delivering a microcurrent. So, we're delivering the two things: the data, which is what we just talked about, you're also delivering the microcurrent. And, that microcurrent is essentially shaking up molecules and providing energy to restore cells to their native voltage. So, I'll give a good example. It's clearest when we can talk about examples. Let's say we've got somebody like Gwen who we talked to earlier. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: She's got hypothyroidism. She doesn't have a thyroid gland or at least most of her thyroid gland is working because it got removed, but what's working is sub-optimal. So, the voltage on those cells if you were to actually go in and measure them cell by cell, which is really hard to do that's why it's just now emerging as a science, what you find is that disease cells have lower voltage. Closer to zero. Ben: And, they've actually measured that? Jeremy: Yeah. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: And, there's actually companies, Ben, that will test this stuff in vivo. Like at some point, I would love to connect you. Ben: I'm going to take a termer cell and testing it in a body. Jeremy: Yeah, like during breast cancer surgery. That's actually the modality. Ben: That's how you do it in vivo? Jeremy: Yeah. So, we put two little probes and you say, \"Oh, this one, there's a negative 15 charge, that's probably cancer. This one, there's a negative 70, that's healthy, that's probably normal tissue.\" Ben: Wow. It's like those old-school frog experiments and stuff they do it on cells. Jeremy: Totally, in the cooler-looking equipment. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: But, it literally goes back to those early 1900s experiments that you're describing. Ben: Wow. Okay. So, you can measure it, so you're back to Gwen, her hypothyroidism. Explain that to me. Jeremy: Right. So, in her case, that tissue has a voltage that's closer to 0, so there's not much gradient, there's not much happening at that cell surface. Whereas, let's say her muscle tissue has negative 55, which is the resting membrane potential, it's good and healthy. So, if we can get those two tissues to maintain their native resting membrane potentials and they're sitting next to each other, then if there's a signal that's going across one into the other, it's going to be picked up. If that other one is sitting at negative 15 and it's supposed to be sitting at negative 70 and the first one is where it's supposed to be at 55, what's happening at the surface of the cells can be congruent. It can be translated all along the cellular surface. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: And, that happens in forms of energy. It's literally just electricity that eventually causes movement AKA kinetic energy. Ben: Okay, got it. So, you're basically restoring the proper voltage to these cells and then the body initiates what, like a self-healing process or something like that? Jeremy: Yeah. I mean, think about, you cut your hand, what happens? Ben: Well, it eventually heals. Jeremy: You're 8 years old, you're outside, you cut your hands, you put a Band-Aid on it, Mom kisses it \u2014 Ben: if you're 8 years old, it feels like lightning. Jeremy: You never think about it again. Ben: Yeah, yeah. Jeremy: So, we just try to restore the body. And, it's not that this is a single modality that works alone, you've got to address nutrition. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: You've got to address relationships: personal and interpersonal. Ben: Yeah, respect that about you because you're a man of faith and you introduce a great deal of spirituality and prayer and intention setting and faith into the process, which I think is probably the biggest component of healing just that the whole \" [Biology of Belief](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biology-of-belief).\" Guys like Bruce Lipton talk about. Jeremy: That's huge. Ben: But, I mean, what's rolling around my head right now is if it can cause something like that normal cellular response and somebody like Gwen, we heard from Chuck, how come it wouldn't cause his cancer cells to actually grow? Wouldn't it be lifeblood to cancer cells, something like that? Jeremy: That's a good question. I don't think so. That's a whole mechanism and theory of cancer. In my opinion, the most common, the most basic definition of cancers, cells that are acting in isolation in order to preserve function. So, let's go back to the cellular voltage hypothesis. If that same thyroid tissue, is it negative 15 volts and it's supposed to be remembered at negative 70, then all of a sudden, the survival instinct of that cell tissue line starts to kick in. And, what does it do? It divides. And, it divides and it grows because it's not talking to its neighbors, it thinks it's in isolation and it tries to replicate. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: Now, it's not doing what it's supposed to do but it's doing what it thinks it's supposed to do. It thinks the only way to survive is to make more of me. What it should be doing is talking to its neighbor and saying, \"Hey, are you in as much distress as I am? If not, can I borrow some of your energy?\" Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: Right? Ben: Okay. Jeremy: It's a super basic premise. So, typically what happens with cancer cells is if they're too far gone, it induces apoptosis. They are not survivable, so they auto-kill. If they're not too far gone, it will restore voltage and restore function. And, these tissues that are acting out of preservation and replication will start to function normally and speak to their neighbors. Ben: And, you've seen that happen? Jeremy: Yeah. I mean, again, I don't want to make crazy claims \u2014 Ben: We can't say you can cure cancer, but I mean Chuck experienced something. You have other patients who are having interesting experiences like that? Jeremy: I'm excited about where this is going, yeah. Ben: I get what you're saying. We don't want to get you shut down. Not when you're just getting started with this stuff. Now, speaking of just getting started with this stuff, I want to know a little bit more about some of the ways that this is something that could be put into a home kind of like that giant pillar in your office or this treatment that you gave to me. But, before I do, you came in after I did my treatment, which was fantastic, and I was like, \"I feel amazing.\" There wasn't really much wrong with me when I sat here aside from I told you I had a little bit of low back and pelvic floor tightness and my left knee was a little buggy, but my whole body felt like it was glowing like full of energy afterwards, almost somebody pushed the reboot button on my body. And, I was just like in la la land with my headphones and my eye mask on. It was almost like a plant medicine journey or something like that. It was just crazy, but without any drugs or anything. And so, then you come in, and I took a break, grabbed some water, and then you sat down beside me, you put your feet on the electrical plate that I had had my feet on and then I held the ball and you started doing like a scan with your hands over my body, almost like some form of an electrical therapeutic massage. What was that all about? Jeremy: Yeah, it's basically using the applied voltage and feeling for the vibrational chips for feeling for those gradients that we're talking about. Ben: You're using your own body as a delivery mechanism for the voltage? Jeremy: Diagnostic and delivery. Ben: What are you feeling in your hands as you're doing that? Jeremy: Vibration. So, there's a little bit of vibration if the tissue is healthy, feels just normal. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: It gets much higher if that tissue is diseased or worn out or distressed in some way. Ben: So, when you hit that spot on my lower left back and you're like, \"Dude, this nerve isn't firing properly\" or this area of the body isn't properly innervated, you could feel that via vibration in your fingertips? Jeremy: Well, that was the extreme example, that was the arc, right? Ben: It actually arcs out? Jeremy: Yeah. So, it arcs because there's a big gradient \u2014 Ben: You mean like a spark? Jeremy: I mean, yeah, essentially because there's a big gradient and energy flows to the area \u2014 Ben: You remember like started on fire doing this, have you? Jeremy: Only once. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: I survived, though. Ben: Yeah, good. No spontaneous combustion during medical treatments are encouraged. You can feel the vibration, so you're basically mapping my body. And, what happens when you feel the vibration, do you stay in that area because it kind of felt you were, I don't know, hanging around in the spots that needed more hanging around in or something like that? Jeremy: That's exactly right. So, you restore function to that tissue by delivering that small current for a longer period of time. And, there's also some optimization of the surrounding tissues too. So, if you imagine that spot, it's a hot spot, it's sort of stealing energy from other places, it's created a bypass, so we're restoring energy to all of that space. Ben: So, it's like simultaneous diagnostics and therapeutics at the same time? Jeremy: Yeah. You notice that I didn't ask you much about your medical history, I didn't ask you. You're a public figure, so I didn't need to, but I don't. I don't get a detailed history. I can feel it. It's very, very intuitive. Ben: Right. You're right, I'm a public figure, everybody's seen the results of my colonoscopy to my cholesterol and beyond, they know. But, in an average scenario, patient will walk in and you can just basically scan them electrically using your hands and know what's going on. Jeremy: Yeah, exactly. Ben: So, obviously you've got this one place in Lexington, but from what I understand, this is something that you want people to be able to do in their own homes? Jeremy: Yeah. I mean, the goal is to get this to a point that it's a wellness device that individuals are using it. So, we've got some really cool stuff going. We've got this place, which is the institute where we do it and study it and teach other people. Ben: It's called [The BioEnergetics Institute](https://www.ammortal.com/about/)? Jeremy: Yeah. Ben: And, most importantly is teach. Ben: Okay. Jeremy: So, we have cool partnerships going too. You and I have a mutual friend in Bobby George, right? Ben: Oh, yeah, [Bobby George](https://lyv-wellness.com/) up in Ohio. Jeremy: Yeah. And, Bobby's got LYV, so he's got his clinics. Ben: Right, which is a wellness biohacking clinic. Jeremy: But, he's also got this freaking amazing food concept of let food be thy medicine. So, his baby is the nutrition. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: And, he's got those two things where you marry them. So, we partner with him and we teach his people and we work together and go up there occasionally to teach them how to use this stuff so that their massage therapist can do this and basically do a massage on steroids. And, it's very intuitive. It doesn't require a degree to do. Ben: You don't have to have a medical degree, you can literally just feel the vibration and you know, \"Oh, hey, I'm going to hang around in this spot.\" And obviously, some people who just have a feel like a reiki practitioner or someone who can really feel subtle energies coming up the body might already be able to sense that, but this amplifies that signal pretty tremendously. Jeremy: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Those things are super helpful, but we want this to be so intuitive that almost anybody can pick it up and use it. Ben: Okay, got you. And, when I walked into your clinic even before we went in a little private room where there was that little pad, there's this giant pillar in the center of the room. It was almost a [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger) times 10 the size of the thing, but tell me about that one. Jeremy: You mean the worship temple? No, it's a big Tesla coil. So, the Tesla coil puts out another signal. So, essentially what we've done, we've taken that product, we've taken the product that you use and then we also have this other product called a chamber, which is a chair with some lights. Really cool stuff, but we use those three things in conjunction with one another. What you're talking about is it's a modified Tesla coil that pulses out also analog fields, also variable frequencies, works the same way as the one that you use, but actually delivers an even wider range of frequencies and it's wireless. Ben: So, you have a bunch of people sitting in a room, they don't have to be holding the device, they could just be all doing meditation or worship or prayer or something like that and just basically have their cell voltage getting aligned at the same time by sitting within close proximity of this thing. Jeremy: Totally. Ben: How far away from it can we feel the treatment? Jeremy: So, we think as far as 80 feet. Ben: Wow. Jeremy: So, you're going to get your maximum dose within about 2 to 4-foot. Ben: Yeah, you can put a pretty big room, a yoga room or something like that. Jeremy: Totally, it's the idea. Ben: Okay, alright. And then, this table, you showed me a picture of it. You told me the table's in Denver right now, but tell me about that one. Jeremy: Yeah, you should come see it. So, the chamber is basically combined. This is the Ferrari of the devices because we've combined the zero-gravity chair and you sit in a chamber, so you're laying down and you get this vibroacoustic experience. And, when it's delivering, it's delivering [PEMF](https://www.pulsepemf.com/ben-greenfield/), [vibroacoustic therapy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/apolloneuro), guided meditation, and bioluminescent therapy in the form of [red lights and near-infrared](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/red-light-therapy-routine-explained/). In addition to that, we pump in various gases. Right now, it's molecular hydrogen, but there's actually a whole bunch of different phases to that where we'll add different ones. And, that's the one that goes in a lot of spas and a lot of very well-off homes. Ben: And, when you say it's endeavor, could someone listening in actually go use it right now? Jeremy: Yeah, totally. Well, I don't want to overwhelm our sales team, but yes, totally. That's the prototype that's floating around. The other ones are in production [01:06:50] _____ \u2014 Ben: Well, I mean, you can fill me in after I can put instructions about how people go to a website or whatever in the shownotes. I'll put them at [BenGreenfieldLife.com/Ammortal](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/ammortal-podcast/). A-M-M-O-R-T-A-L. So, the future of this is I could have this as an electrical medicine cabinet in my basement. If somebody's not feeling well, hook them up to this thing, I don't necessarily have to have diagnosed them, but the frequencies that are delivered by the unit are going to map out the areas that actually need adjusting and go straight there. Obviously, if someone's bone is broken, take them to the freaking ER, folks. Or, somebody has, I don't know, strep throat or something, maybe they need something in addition to just electrical modality, but \u2014 Jeremy: This feels like a good place for me to put in a medical disclaimer that we like. Ben: Yeah, it kind of feels like that. Jeremy: Replacing medical information, go see your doctor if you get sick, something. Ben: Yeah. I'm not a doctor but he is. And so, what approximately I did because I got to ask this question, how much would somebody actually spend or a family spend or a corporation spend to have these at their home or at their facility? Jeremy: That's the whole idea is we want different price points. The entry price point on the device that you use today is $14,000. In my opinion, it's just eons better than what's out there just because of the way it's delivered. The coil, which would be more for a community like a yoga hall or \u2014 Ben: A big tall coil. Jeremy: Whatever. Yeah, that's about $14,00030,000 And then, the chamber right now retails at $14,000145,000. And, that's more of a spa experience. That's like for Ben Greenfield to absolutely get the most out of his biohacking 45 minutes a day combined \u2014 Ben: This would be everything all at once, but I could. And, this is what I felt. I felt a super heart-opening experience. I felt that cellular voltage, it shifted me into this really interesting place emotionally and spiritually, so someone could, theoretically like you mentioned Church, putting these pillows in a church. I think it's sad sometimes. You and I had a little discussion about this earlier off air like how resistant the church sometimes seems, a religion sometimes seems to marry technology to spirituality. Though, I have full-on prayer sessions inside the [BrainTap](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/braintap) light sound device. If you buy that, you can go to the Ben Greenfield section and you can go through my prayers with me while undergoing light and sound simulation. And, there's nothing wrong with just praying on your knees in your bedroom. But, if somebody hasn't tried like literally shifting your brainwave state into deep delta or theta or sometimes gamma while talking to God or while doing prayer or while having devotions, it's a crazy experience. Same thing with doing meditation session in front of the [BioCharger](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger). If a church were to have one of those pillars in the middle of it, that literally shifts people's brainwave states dramatically when they're in that experience without subjection them to the risks of say like popping magic mushrooms before they go to church, which is the type of stuff that guys like [Jamie Wheal](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/biohacking-podcasts/biohacking-sex/) and [Steven Kotler](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/fitness-podcasts/rise-of-superman/) are proposing, which I think is far more risky because it's too much and I think too dangerous. Like, it's something that I think is super interesting, this intersection of spirituality and technology. I have nothing against it, but it's like you almost get called out on blasphemy if you mention this kind of stuff in a modern Christian circles just because for some reason, there's this fear of technology or people say it's pharmakeia or sorcery or something like that. Jeremy: Yes. Ben: I really don't think it is. I mean, it's a very clean and uplifting and powerful experience. Again, not to say you need it, but man oh man, it certainly amplifies any spiritual experience in my opinion. Jeremy: But, you're totally right. So, the whole concept of bioenergetics, it's not like I came up with this idea. First of all, it's been around for a while. Many men \u2014 Ben: God did it in nature. God was the original fire energetic creator. Every time you go outside, you're getting PEMFs by God. Jeremy: Totally. So, I'm not like, \"You don't need to sell God, that's just there,\" and \u2014 Ben: Right, Jesus went up on a mountain early in the morning to pray. He probably was bare feet. Jeremy: Yeah. You're basically augmenting. 150 years ago, mankind took this massive shift from outdoor living or predominantly more outdoor living to much less. The average amount of time that people spend indoors in the United States is 92 to 93% of our day. It's nuts. Ben: Yeah. Jeremy: That's why when we got to do this walking, I'm freaking thrilled. Ben: Right. Jeremy: But, it's insane, so we need to figure out a way to quickly redeliver all of those biofields back into the human biome so that we actually don't get sick. Ben: Yeah, yeah. And, I mean, it's really difficult in my opinion to describe the feeling on a podcast, but my recommendation to folks is figure out a way if it's you or a loved one who you want to introduce to a new healing modality because nothing else is working or you just want to see what it feels like to experience this like I did. I mean, just figure out a way to fly into Lexington, stay at the Kentucky castle, whatever, which is where I was at or wherever else. Drop into a hotel, come down here and try it or go to Denver, I'll put links in the shownotes and try it out. I mean, I'm not financially affiliated with Jeremy or anything, I'm not an investor in his company, I think it's cool enough. I mean, I want to be an investor in your company now. We can talk about that later. But, I think it's cool enough to where when Jeremy told me about it, I want to experience it and it's crazy, it really is. And, like I told you guys at the introduction, I think this type of electrical medicine is the next frontier of medicine and gradually kind of rips us away from our dependency on the pharmaceutical industry and what I consider to be a broken allopathic medical system. Jeremy: Totally. Ben: Yeah. So, Jeremy, go ahead. Jeremy: So, the inspiration for all this for me was the spiritual retreat that I had. And, for the first time, I actually saw the connection between nature, humans, environment. And, I was like, \"There's got to be a way to replicate this and in a non-dangerous, non-threatening way without the use of various pharmaceuticals.\" Ben: Right. Jeremy: And, this was the closest thing we could find. Ben: Yeah. And, when you say various pharmaceuticals, that include plant medicine experiences. Jeremy: Totally, 100%. Ben: It's like you could go do this and not have to be whatever, Persian DMT out of your system for the next six days or whatever. And so, again, with these technologies and the spiritual experience that you get from them, and I think the resistance to some people who are totally all-natural, \"Why don't you go outside barefoot in Sedona bro, and pick up a crystal?\" it's like, \"Well, God made us creators.\" We make jet planes and creatures in the yogis and pastors flying jet planes to get places to preach the good word, for example. It's not like we need to be resistant to technology, but the idea of us being able to create things that simulate what God created in nature and do a really good and safe and ethical job of it as a way to bring people closer to God in the same way that God reveals himself to people in nature. Well, if it was created by human beings with good intent, with intention being a big part of this, I consider this to be basically amplifying nature and taking what God created and our God-given abilities to be able to create and simulate God's handiwork and just amplify it. Jeremy: Yeah. Ben: And, it's a cool experience. I'm just kind of on board for a wild ride. That's my job is I find cool stuff and I tell people the good stories about it and then let them make their lives better with it. So, Jeremy, you certainly qualify as a cool story that I've found to be able to tell the people. So, thank you. Jeremy: Thanks, man. I really appreciate this opportunity. Ben: Awesome, awesome. Alright, folks. Well, I'll put the shownotes along with all the information about Dr. Jeremy Stitch, his team and this whole bioenergetics Ammortal Institute over at BenGreenfieldLife.com/A-M-M-O-R-T-A-L, [BenGreenfieldLife.com/Ammortal](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/ammortal-podcast/) where you can also leave your questions, your comments, and your feedback for Jeremy or I. and, until next time, I'm Ben Greenfield along with Dr. Jeremy Stitch signing out from BenGreenfieldLife.com. Have an amazing week. Alright, this is cool, but you want to pay attention because it's coming up right around the corner on Friday, December 2nd. You're going to get a chance to join me and some really powerful healing physicians down in Sarasota, Florida. This is a live event. It goes from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I'll be there, my friend, and a brilliant former podcast guest, The Doctor Strange of Medicine, Dr. [John Lieurance](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/melatonin-supplementation/) is going to be there, [HBOT USA, Dr. Jason and Melissa Sonners](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/podcast/recovery-podcasts/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/) are going to be there with their Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, Brian Richards of SaunaSpace, Harry Paul, one of John's friends who I recently met who's also an amazing healer for an event that's super unique. It's all based around the elements: earth, fire, air, and water, with a ton of treatments and technologies and modalities, and very unique biohacks that you're going to get exposed to during the entire event. Basically, what I mean by that is when it comes to air, you're going to learn about hyperbaric oxygen, and ozone, and air filtration, everything you need to know to upgrade your air. When it comes to earth, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, earthing, grounding, a host of other ways that you can use the power of the planet to enhance your health, your sleep, your recovery, your muscle gain, your fat loss, a lot more water. You'll learn about proper water filtration, how to upgrade your water, hydrogenated water, structured water, basically soup to nuts, everything you need to know about water and how to apply it in your home and your office and your life. And then, finally fire, is a fun one. Lots of cryotherapy, a little bit of ice too, breathwork, inner fire practices, a ton of stuff when it comes to introducing the element of fire into your life. So, this event is super unique. John and I have been working on it behind the scenes and it has come together amazingly. There's even a VIP experience. If you sign up for the VIP experience, you could come two days early or stay a few days after the event, and basically, you will get all the medical protocols customized by Dr. John and his staff if you claim one of those 10 VIP spots. That'll include IV methylene blue, laser treatments, John's really unique bliss release, which is basically an endonasal adjustment, which is essentially a chiropractic adjustment through your nose for your entire skull, which if you've had TBI or concussion or allergies or things like that in the past, it totally reboots that entire system. There's going to also be ozone treatments, Myers' IV cocktails, exosome treatments, IV laser, access to a CVAC machine. And, John's entire facility is going to be at your beck and call if you got one of the VIP tickets. And then, we're also probably going to have a little bit of a party later on in the evening after this event. The whole thing is going to be a pinch-me-I'm-dreaming full-on cutting-edge of biohacking experience. And, I'm just now letting the world know about it so spots are going to fill up pretty fast. Space is limited, but if you want to get in now, here's how. You go to [BenGreenfieldLife.com/Elements-Event](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/elements-event/). That's BenGreenfieldLife.com/Elements-Event. It's in Sarasota, Florida. Again, it's all-day Friday, December 2nd. I would come in early and stay after. If you just want to try out all the crazy modalities there. I don't know how fast those VIP tickets are going to sell out, but either way, this thing is going to be absolutely amazing. I just can't wait, like I'm pinching myself, can't wait to be on the plane to head down there and do this. So, check it out, BenGreenfieldLife/Elements-Event. And, I'll see you there, I hope. More than ever these days, people like you and me need a fresh entertaining, well-informed, and often outside-the-box approach to discovering the health, and happiness, and hope that we all crave. So, I hope I've been able to do that for you on this episode today. And, if you liked it or if you love what I'm up to, then please leave me a review on your preferred podcast listening channel wherever that might be and just find the [Ben Greenfield Life](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/) episode. Say something nice. Thanks so much. It means a lot. I've had plenty of pretty crazy biohacking experiences... ...and what I did recently with my old friend Dr. Jeremy Stich is at the top of the crazy list. A former ER physician, Dr. Stich began his healthcare journey in emergency medicine before several personal and familial health-related circumstances led him to seek alternative ways to pursue health. An outside-the-box thinker, Jeremy gained experience in precision genetics, several entrepreneurial endeavors, consulting, wellness technology, Eastern medicine training, and more. Creator of the [BioEnergetic Institute](https://www.ammortal.com) and currently serving as the Chief Medical Officer for [Ammortal, Inc.](https://www.ammortal.com/), Jeremy's treatments are unlike any I've experimented with in the past. Before I visited the BioEnergetic Institute in Lexington, Kentucky, Jeremy sent me cryptic texts about what he was building there. While I was fascinated, I honestly did not understand his modality. When I arrived at the Institute, I walked into the main room to be greeted by Jeremy and a giant device that looked like it was off the deck of Star Trek that blasted the entire space with pulsed electromagnetic energy (I've felt those types of frequencies before with my [BioCharger](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/biocharger)). Rather than hooking me up to this machine, which is what I thought would happen, Jeremy took me into an adjacent room with a crystal ball-like-looking device attached to magnetic foot pads. He hooked me up to the foot pads, handed me the \"crystal ball,\" had me don headphones and a light-blocking eye mask, put on deep meditative music, and switched the device on. Now, even if you haven't tried something like LSD or psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\"), you've probably heard me talk about what it feels like to have that sort of psychedelic experience. As soon as the switch was flipped on this device, my whole body went to a different planet. I wept and laughed in a trance-like state as the waves circulated through my entire body. After about 40 minutes (which felt like hours), my body felt like somebody had pressed the reset button on my nervous system. Then Jeremy said: Are you ready for the treatment? And yes, I thought I had already had the treatment, but it turns out he was in the other room, also charging himself up, and Jeremy then proceeded to go up and down my body transferring his energy in what I can only describe as an electrical massage. After the session, I felt like I had been hit by a truck, even telling my wife I didn't know if I could go to dinner. However, after a 25-minute meditation session, my eyes popped open, and I felt like I was on top of the world. That charged-up, full-of-energy feeling continued well into the next day. My visit to the BioEnergetic Institute led up to the following episode, in which I talk to two of Dr. Stich's patients, and then Dr. Stich himself (we went on a walk; excuse the wind in the background), about the science behind bioenergetic medicine and its incredible healing potential. Prepare to have your mind blown.
