Here are just a few glowing testimonials from students in our Herbal Immersion Program... \"These beautiful courses consistently, yet gently, remind me that there is always so much more to learn when it comes to herbal medicine. I've been working with and growing herbs my whole life including four years working on an herb farm. I have a master's degree in Chinese medicine and have spent nine years in clinical practice and in herbal medicine teaching roles. Even with that depth of experience, I'm learning so much! You've all done a wonderful job putting these courses together! They are impeccably organized, offering information useful to both the absolute beginner and the seasoned herbalist. More than anything, on a personal level, I so deeply appreciate the amazing images and photography. That in and of itself is inspiring to go deeper into this medicine. These courses uniquely reinforce personal creativity, building relationships with the plants, and remembering the web of connection we are all a part of. The love, experience, professionalism, and effort you have all put into the creation of these programs really shines through. Thank you all for doing what you do!\" ~ Melissa B., M.S., Menomonie, Wisconsin Acupuncturist, Bodyworker, Herbalist Online Herbal Immersion student \"If I could give this course 10 stars, I would. It is obvious that this school was years in the making: the content is incredible, the pictures and videos are amazing, and the activities are wonderful at turning the information into action. If you are interested at all in using or growing plants medicinally, or making your own herbal remedies, this school is a must!\" ~ Dr. Lori R., Cleburne, Texas Life Sciences Instructor Medicine Making Course graduate and Herbal Immersion student \"I have truly learned a lot so far - even about the topics that I thought were going to be very simple, like preparing infusions and tinctures. I've found answers to some of my questions that I had a hard time clarifying before, like how do we know which herb is best in form of tincture, infusion or decoction and why. There's so much valuable and practical information. I also like the format of the course. First of all, it's beautifully done and visually pleasing, which keeps me excited. Second of all, I like that it can be viewed electronically or can be printed out and made into booklets. I personally prefer reading from books rather than from a screen whereas I am sure there are others who don't mind or prefer to view their lesson electronically, whether it's via their laptop, phone or iPad. I also love the videos. It makes it a lot easier to grasp and absorb the information on some topics like botany. I also love the spirit of the entire course: Juliet and the rest of the staff, and the students, the ability to connect with each other on the student group and learn from each other at all times. I know I can always count on the team for any questions! I haven't felt that way before in previous herbal studies programs.\" ~ Rashida G., Istanbul, Turkey Stay-at-home mom and artist Herbal Immersion student This online course is self-paced and you can start as soon as you sign up!

Juliet Blankespoor is the green mastermind behind the program, and is the primary instructor and choreographer. She has been growing medicinal herbs for twenty-five years, and has been involved with many aspects of herbal medicine, including owning an herb nursery and tincture business, and directing an herbal school. Her extensive knowledge of plant propagation and cultivation comes from years of growing medicinals for her tincture business and nursery, and gardening with herbs in many different climates. Other core instructors include Joe Hollis, 7Song, Lorna Mauney-Brodek, Asia Suler and Becky Beyer. See our full line-up of [instructors and contributors](https://chestnutherbs.com/about/instructors/). We begin at the ground level, and build from there. You don't need any prior experience or knowledge. We're here to answer your questions and lead the way in a clear and easy format. Even if your growing area is limited, you can still grow plenty of medicinal herbs! We offer many pointers and techniques for maximizing yields in smaller gardens, such as utilizing vertical space, polycultures, repeat harvesting, and container gardening. If you have at least 250 square feet of garden space available for herbs, you can still grow quite a bit of medicine. [I've been growing and using herbs for years - will I learn enough new material to justify taking the course?](#1442114933713-449c7c6a-6535) Even experienced gardeners and herbalists will benefit from our course, as we offer detailed instruction on many topics. Some of the material will be review but we believe that most people will gain valuable insights, especially in the area of medical herbalism. Look over the [curriculum](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-immersion-program-regular/herbal-immersion-program-outline/) and list of plants covered to help you decide if the program is right for you. Finally, we do offer a guarantee - (please see the details above). We want our students to be completely satisfied with their learning! Though a lot of the information in the course will be applicable\u2014propagation and medicinal usage especially, the program itself is more geared toward the gardener than the farmer. We don't offer specifics on farming, such as market prices, yield per acre, or special mechanized equipment and the program will not cover what you would need to know to get started with a large-scale operation, but you can definitely use the knowledge to help fill in the gaps. We designed the course for a variety of growing climates throughout the temperate world. The program will be useful for most areas of North America, Europe, Southern Australia and Asian mild-temperate regions. It is specifically geared for USDA Growing Zones 4-9. Check the [USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/) to see what zone you live in. Throughout the videos, we give growing tips for different climates. We also have a whole module with regional features from various bioregions to give you a good idea of the optimal medicinal plants for your climate. Please consult the list of plants covered [here](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-immersion-program/botanical-starlets/). If you're still not sure if you can grow the plants we feature, consult local growers, herbalists, master gardeners or extension agents and ask if those plants can easily be grown in your area. If you're still not clear, drop us a [line](https://chestnutherbs.com/contact/), and we'll give you an honest opinion about whether you will benefit from this course. As long as you can grow the plants we cover (see the questions above and below), and have a solid command of the English language, you are welcome to take the course. About 10% of our students reside outside of the United States. We provide metric conversions for all recipe and cultivation measurements. Please note that businesses who have offered perks to our students may not be able to extend those offers to international students. [How long will it take for me to finish the program? And how much time will I need to devote to the course?](#1442115373208-e1543ac8-e99f) There are many ways you can approach the program. If you're enrolling purely for your personal needs and aren't working towards a [certificate](https://chestnutherbs.com/the-truth-about-herbal-certification-and-master-herbalist-status/), you take all the time in the world. It's your program to do as you like, but we do recommend following the sequential format, as it builds up from the foundation, with roots, branches, twigs, etc. You can binge watch on the weekends or slowly sip it in on Tuesday nights. If you're working towards the certificate you have a timeframe of two and a half years (30 months) from your time of enrollment to complete the program. There are several reasons you may want to aim for a certificate. The dangling carrot can help you keep your eyes on the prize, so to speak. Motivation is even more important with distance learning, where it's easy enough to fall off the wagon. Gaining a certificate can also give a strong feeling of personal satisfaction - a milestone after hard work and dedication. Finally, the certificate may help to serve your career goals. The bottom line is that we want the program to work for you and your life, however that looks. Each of you will have a different approach, tailored to your needs. Some of you will move through the materials quicker, while some of you will gain the same benefit, but spread your learning out over a longer time period. But remember, however you engage with the program, you will get out as much as you put in! This is a 1000 hour program, and we estimate you can complete the course in 18 to 30 months, depending on your pace. There are 17 modules, each of which contains approximately 2-5 hours of video instruction and 6 to 15 lessons. Additionally, you will want to plan time for reading assignments, worksheets, experiential projects, and studying for quizzes. Each module will take about 25-40 hours of your time, depending on its scope, your pace, and depth of work. To earn a certificate for this program in the allotted 30 months, you'll want to budget about 30 hours a month, or 8-10 hours a week. As stated above, you have 30 months to complete the program and gain a certificate. After this time, you'll have ongoing access to all the materials, but our team of herbal moderators won't be available, and it will no longer be possible to gain a certificate. Ultimately, we created this deadline because we believe it will help motivate you to finish the program! Yes! Enrollment is ongoing so you can sign up and begin any time. You'll receive an email every month from us\u2014with an introduction to each module\u2014to help keep you motivated and on track. After satisfactorily completing all the assignments and quizzes, and submitting your experiential projects for review (within 30 months of enrolling and after paying your tuition in full), you'll receive a beautiful certificate of completion. The certificate will state that you completed 1000 hours of coursework and list the subjects covered. (You can find the subjects and the breakdown of hours on the [course outline](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-immersion-program-regular/herbal-immersion-program-outline/).) Currently, there is no certifying or licensing agency in the United States for herbalists, so there is no such thing as a certified or licensed herbalist, despite what some schools advertise. However, many people find that a certificate represents the hours and dedication poured into one's herbal studies. Additionally, a certificate offers a sense of pride for completing the program. In any case, you will learn valuable skills that we believe are essential for self-care and the foundation for many plant-based herbal livelihoods. We want to be clear that we are not an accredited University or vocational school. We are a school of traditional herbal medicine. Read more about herbal certification [here](https://chestnutherbs.com/the-truth-about-herbal-certification-and-master-herbalist-status/). Our program lays a solid foundation in clinical herbal medicine, but it doesn't fully train you in all the necessary subjects to begin a practice, such as anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology, constitutional assessment, and drug/herb contraindications. The Herbal Immersion can serve as the first step on this career path, followed by a clinical program. Or it can be taken concurrently with a clinical program to round out your education with more botany, herb cultivation and medicine making. However, the Herbal Immersion does equip you with many valuable skills. You can find a list of these after the section on this page: Here's what you'll be able to do after completing the program. You'll have the option to be part of a private student forum where you can share triumphs, troubleshooting, and inspirations with a lively community of herbal enthusiasts. Currently, this forum is held on Facebook. If you have questions for our staff, you can look through our FAQs at the end of each lesson, as well as our general Q & A board. If your question is still unanswered, you'll send it to us via an e-mail form. In most cases, your questions will be answered by one of our moderators within 24 hours (Monday through Friday). You'll be able to ask us questions and seek guidance for two and half years after enrolling. After this time, you'll still be able to connect with other students via our student forum but the moderators won't be available for questions. Since you'll still have access to the course after two and a half years, you'll have continued access to our growing bank of common Q & A's. (Our herbal team isn't available by phone or private e-mail, except to provide assistance with technical issues or problems related to accessing the course. Please note that we can't answer questions related to personal health due to legal and time constraints.) We don't believe you would benefit, as half of the program focuses on growing herbs. We want this course to serve the educational goals of our students, and so we'll candidly let you know another course would better serve your needs. Our [Medicine Making program](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-medicine-making-course/) doesn't cover cultivation, and touches on the therapeutic use of herbs. Yes, we offer a $200 discount on tuition for each student when 3 or more students enroll together. This discount cannot be combined with other offers, discounts, or during a sale. Please contact us for the discount code info: christine (at) chestnutherbs (dot) com. See the question below for details about enrolling with children under 18. We have worked hard to offer this program at an affordable price and ask that you respect all the time, effort and trust put into its creation by keeping your login information to yourself. When you sign up for this course you enter a pact of community trust along with every one of the students and teachers. It is, of course, always okay to share your own insights and inspirations with friends and family, but building a healing community begins with respectfully supporting one another in our livelihoods. So we thank you in advance for helping us to build a stronger, more trusting community by keeping your login information to yourself. However, we do encourage sharing your course materials with your children ages 13 and up. We want to nurture the next generation of plant lovers and gardeners. This is a great program for homeschooling families with older children and teenagers interested in plants. If you wish to share the course with your children, be sure to watch our sample videos and lesson plans to gauge the level of instruction before enrolling. Please contact the school for more details if you wish to use this program for your homeschooling curriculum. You'll find some of the content of the Herbal Immersion Program in both the [Herbal Medicine Making Course](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-medicine-making-course/) and the [Online Foraging Course](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-foraging-course-edible-and-medicinal-wild-herbs/), however, the bulk of the material is only available when you enroll in the full Herbal Immersion Program. When you enroll, you will receive a list of the kitchen supplies used in most of the recipes and garden tools you will need for cultivating your herb garden. These include items you may already own, such as assorted Mason jars, an electronic scale, stainless steel funnels and labels, pruners, shovels, garden gloves, etc. How much you spend on ingredients and materials will differ, depending on how prolific you are with the recipes and what tools and ingredients you already own. We estimate you might spend anywhere from $200 to $600 depending on these factors. You'll also enjoy discounts from some of our favorite suppliers for the period of your enrollment\u2014you'll have access to these discount codes as soon as you enroll. Note that you have two and a half years to ask us questions, but the course is yours for life, so you can spread out your purchases to suit your budget. Hands-down, the biggest difference is our plant-centered approach and emphasis on cultivation and homemade medicines. We practice and teach a combination of bioregional and DIY herbal medicine. In addition, we provide a wealth of detailed, hands-on video instruction that is not found in other programs. Yes, all of our course videos are closed captioned. We believe in making our content accessible to everyone, so we've ensured that all videos come with accurate and synchronized captions. If you encounter any issues with the captions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team. The primary mission of the school is to educate about holistic healing, which includes discussing socioeconomic factors that affect health, safety, and freedom. A healer cannot truly practice holistic herbalism without understanding and addressing the stress, violence, and discrimination that marginalized people face on a daily level. If a person isn't safe-or faces discrimination that affects their access to basic necessities and optimal health care-because of their race, religion, age, ability, sexual orientation, or gender identity, then their health is affected. It's that simple. The discrimination that affects human rights is a universal concern-transcending political affiliation. We believe these topics are central to any productive conversation regarding holistic herbalism (which takes into account how societal influences affect health, safety, basic human rights, and well-being). We are actively working on implementing and expanding the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism plan we started in 2018 with the goal of creating a more welcoming and supportive environment for current and new students. The plan includes lessons to educate students who work/will work in healthcare fields about the identities and struggles of communities/peoples they may not belong to. We are also including discussions about health care inequities due to marginalization and bias. Additionally, we're updating the Herbal Immersion Program with lessons from teachers of color, and we are slowly building a more diverse student body.
