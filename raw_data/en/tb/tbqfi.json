The Sigma1 receptor is a chaperone protein located on the mitochondrionassociated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It serves an important role in heart function by regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and enhancing cellular bioenergetics. In the present study, male Sprague Dawley rats with myocardial infarction (MI)induced heart failure were used.

Following four weeks of treatment, YQHX was revealed to improve heart function and attenuate myocardial hypertrophy in MI rats. Additionally, YQHX increased the ATP content and improved the mitochondrial ultrastructure in the heart tissues of MI rats in comparison with acontrol. Treatment was revealed to attenuate the decreased expression of the Sigma1 receptor and increase the expression of inositol triphosphate type 2 receptors (IP3R2) in MI rats. By exposing H9c2 cells to angiotensin II (Ang II), YQHX prevented cell hypertrophy and normalized the decreased ATP content.

Due to an increase in the proportion of the aging population, the prevalence of HF is likely to increase in the future. Though numerous efforts have been made in cardiovascular research, current therapeutic approaches do not improve the mortality and readmission rates of patients with HF ( [1](#b1-ETM-0-0-10743)). In Chinese clinical practice, formulations from traditional Chinese medicine that have been demonstrated to be effective in improving heart function are used extensively. However, the mechanisms underlying these improvements has yet to be fully elucidated. Various mechanisms have been demonstrated to be involved in the pathophysiological development of HF, including neuro-endocrine, inflammatory and structural remodeling mechanisms ( [2-4](#b2-ETM-0-0-10743%20b3-ETM-0-0-10743%20b4-ETM-0-0-10743)). The energy starvation hypothesis for HF has attracted particular attention ( [5](#b5-ETM-0-0-10743)). Recently, the Sigma-1 receptor (Sigma-1R), a molecular chaperone located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, was suggested to have a cardioprotective effect, potentially through energy metabolism improvement ( [6](#b6-ETM-0-0-10743), [7](#b7-ETM-0-0-10743)). Sigma receptors were first reported in the central nervous system (CNS) as a subclass of opioid receptors. However, pharmacological and behavioral studies have revealed that sigma receptors are distinct from all previously characterized mammalian proteins. Sigma receptors are now recognized as non-opioid receptors located at the ER-mitochondrion interface, known as the mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM) ( [8](#b8-ETM-0-0-10743)). While Sigma-1Rs have been extensively studied in the CNS, they are also found in multiple tissues, including the cardiovascular system. In fact, the protein levels of Sigma-1R have been revealed to be more highly expressed in the heart tissue than the brain tissue in rats ( [9](#b9-ETM-0-0-10743)). In the first study on Sigma-1R function in the heart, Sigma-1R stimulation was found to increase the contractility of cultured cardiomyocytes ( [10](#b10-ETM-0-0-10743)). Sigma-1R is responsible for mitochondrial metabolic regulation by regulating Ca2+ signaling from the ER the mitochondrion ( [11](#b11-ETM-0-0-10743)). Tagashira et al of Sigma-1R by agonists in vivo may rescue cardiac dysfunction in mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced myocardial dysfunction, as well as cardiac hypertrophy ovariectomized female rats ( cardioprotection are the Sigma-1R-mediated Akt-eNOS pathway mitochondrial ATP production recovery ( [12](#b12-ETM-0-0-10743), [13](#b13-ETM-0-0-10743)). In traditional Chinese medicine the formulation Yiqi Huoxue (YQHX), is used to improve symptoms in patients with HF ( [14](#b14-ETM-0-0-10743), [15](#b15-ETM-0-0-10743)). YQHX is thought to act through the regulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism ( [16](#b16-ETM-0-0-10743)). Qiliqiangxin is a widely used YQHX formula that has been reported to increase the ATP content in the heart tissue of HF rats ( [17](#b17-ETM-0-0-10743)). Similarly, Sigma-1R has been revealed to exert cardioprotective functions, including enhanced mitochondrial ATP production. However, whether Sigma-1R is also regulated by YQHX during HF treatment, in addition to its involvement in the enhancement of ATP in HF patients, requires further study. In the present study, a YQHX formulation comprising the following six types of Chinese To investigate the role of Sigma-1R in the treatment of HF using YQHX, rats with infarction (MI)-induced with angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy were used to investigate the effect of YQHX on MI-induced myocardial dysfunction and Ang II-induced hypertrophy. [] Materials and methods [] [] Materials YQHX was composed of 40 g astragalus, 40 g Codonopsis pilosula, 20 g Salvia miltiorrhiza, 20 g Ligusticum wallichii, 20 g red Paeonia and 20 g carthami flowers. Slices of the herbs were purchased from Beijing Tong Ren Tang Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd. The herbs were boiled in water for 1 h and aliquots at a final concentration of 3 g herbs/ml were stored at 4C. Fluvoxamine (Flv), an agonist of Sigma-1R, was purchased from Abbott Healthcare Products Ltd. Ang II was purchased from Chinese Peptide Company Ltd. Sigma-1R siRNA was provided by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. [] Determination of YQHX components by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry g of lyophilized, pulverized, homogenized herbs were extracted using 5 ml methanol-water (v-v=1:1) for 20 min at room temperature. The extract was filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m membrane. Next, 3 \u00b5l extract was injected into an analytical column (Shimadzu UHPLC system; Shimadzu Corporation), equipped with an LC-30AD solvent delivery system, an SIL-30AC autosampler, a CTO-30A column oven, a DGU-20A3 degasser, and a CBM-20A controller, for analysis. The separation of the compounds was performed using a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (2.6 \u00b5m, 100x2.1 mm; Phenomenex mobile phase, which consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and methanol (B), was delivered at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min under a gradient program. The gradient system was as 0-1 diode-array detector was set at 254 nm and the online UV spectra were recorded in a scanning range of 190-400 nm. The mass spectra were acquired using a TripleTOF 4600 system with a Duo Spray source (SCIEX; AB Sciex Pte. Ltd.) in negative and positive ESI mode. The optimized parameters for the negative and positive modes were as follows: Ion spray voltage, 5,500 (positive ion mode) and -4,500 V (negative ion mode); Turbo V spray temperature, 600C; nebulizer gas (Gas 1), 50 psi; heater gas (Gas 2), 60 psi; collision gas, medium; curtain gas, 30 psi; declustering potential, 80 (positive ion mode) and -80 V (negative ion mode). The collision energy was set at 35 (positive ion mode) and -35 V (negative ion mode) with a spread of 15 V for the MS-MS experiments. The data were acquired with the information-dependent acquisition method. For TOF-MS and TOF-MS-MS analysis, the spectra covered the range from m-z 70 to 1,000 Da and 50-1,000 Da. The data were analyzed in Peak View Software 2.2 (SCIEX). [] Animal models with MI and treatments The present study was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (ethical approval no. 16-24). Male adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (age, 6-7 weeks; weight, 190-210 g) were obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. All the rats were kept in the barrier environment animal room of the Chinese Medicine Pharmacology Laboratory, Dongzhimen hospital [license no. SYXK(Beijing)2015-0001]. The animals were fed a standard laboratory diet and given free access to tap water. The cages were kept in a room with controlled temperature of 22\u00b11C, relative humidity of 65-70% and on a 12 h light-dark cycle. A total of 40 rats were used in the study. All animals underwent a myocardial infarction operation or sham operation, as previously described ( [18](#b18-ETM-0-0-10743)). The rats in the control group underwent a sham operation with no left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Following the surgical operation, 4 rats died and the surviving MI rats were divided randomly into three groups (9 rats in each group): MI (5 ml/kg/d normal saline by gavage); MI + YQHX (5 ml/kg/d gavage) and MI + Flv (1 mg/kg/d by gavage). Rats that had undergone a sham operation were administered with 5 ml/kg/d normal saline by gavage. Treatments were administered on the day following surgery once a day for 4 weeks. [] Echocardiography and measurement of cardiac hypertrophy Non-invasive echocardiographic measurements were performed in the rats using a Sino-Japanese Joint AloCa5000 ultrasound system equipped with a 7-15 MHz real-time microvisualization scan head probe. In brief, after 4 weeks of treatment, each rat was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight), and their hearts were imaged in two-dimensional parasternal long-axis fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were measured. To determine the extent of cardiac hypertrophy, the hearts of each rat were weighed and the ratio of heart weight-to-body weight (HW/BW) was calculated. [] Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Following heart perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde, the heart tissues were minced into 1-2 mm3 cubes and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Tissues were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4C, and then rinsed three times with cold PBS. The tissues were then progressively dehydrated using a series of ethanol washes (50, 70, 90 and 100% EtOH), followed by dehydration with propylene oxide and infiltration with 1:1 propylene oxide:Epon with 1.5% DMP-30 for 1 h. Finally, the tissues were cut into 70-nm sections using an ultramicrotome, placed on TEM grids, stained with lead citrate, and imaged using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd.; model H-7650). [] Measurement of ATP content in heart tissue Heart tissues were collected 4 weeks post-surgery and homogenized on ice prior to assaying for ATP content. The ATP content was determined using an ATP colorimetric-fluorometric assay kit (cat. no. MAK1900; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, heart tissue (10 mg) was homogenized in 100 \u00b5l ATP assay buffer and then deproteinized using a 10-kDa MWCO spin filter. ATP standards and fluorometric reaction mixtures were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next, fluorometric reaction mixtures with standards or samples were incubated in the plate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The fluorescence (FLU; ex = 535 nm and em = 587 nm) was measured using a microplate reader and the amount of ATP in the samples was calculated using an ATP standard curve. [] Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed as previously described ( [18](#b18-ETM-0-0-10743)). The heart tissues were homogenized on ice in RIPA buffer with complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Following centrifugation for 20 min, the protein concentration of the resulting clear supernatant was determined using the BCA method before use for western blotting. In brief, 40-100 \u00b5g proteins were loaded and separated by 10 or 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose saline-Tween-20 (TBST) with 5% skimmed milk at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4C. Following rinsing, the were incubated antimouse antibodies (dilution, 1:5,000; cat. no. BA1050; Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 1 h and evaluated by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super ECL Plus; Applygen Technologies) using a chemiluminescence image analysis system (Tanon 4600; Tanon Science and Technology Co., Ltd). Quantification was performed with densitometric analysis using NIH ImageJ software (version 1.29; National Institutes of Health). The antibodies used included anti-Sigma-1 receptor antibody (dilution, 1:1,000; cat. no. 61994; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate type 2 receptor (IP3R2) antibody (dilution,1:500; cat. no. sc-398434; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5,000; cat. no. ab181602; Abcam). [] Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol\u00ae reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Next, reverse transcription was performed using 1 \u00b5g total RNA and RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase and oligo(dT)18 (cat. no. K1622; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at the following thermal profile: 42C for 60 min and 70C for 5 min. PCR reactions were performed using SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in a PCR machine (MxPro-Mx3000P; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) using the following specific primer pairs: Calcineurin A (forward, 5'-CGATTCTCCGACAGGAAAAA-3' and reverse, reverse, The thermocycling conditions were as follows: Denaturation at 95C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 30 sec 55C for 30 sec and 72C for 20 sec. Data analysis was performed using MxPro-Mx3000P software, and was calculated as the change in the cycle threshold (CT) for the target gene relative to the CT for GAPDH (control gene) ( [19](#b19-ETM-0-0-10743)). [] H9c2 cell culture and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection The H9c2 cell line was obtained from China National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource and maintained in plastic 25-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM-F12; Biological 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The culture flasks were kept in a 95% air and 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37C. At confluence, the cells were washed and maintained in serum-free DMEM without supplements for 24 h prior to the subsequent experiments. The cells were then cultured with Ang II (10-7 mol/l) or YQHX (freeze-dried powder of YQHX dissolved in DMEM, 0.1 mg/ml) for 72 h prior to being harvested. To silence Sigma-1R expression, H9c2 cells were transfected with Sigma-1R 5'-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3' and anti-sense, 5'-ACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAA-3'; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used as control. In brief, according to manufacturer's protocols, the cultured cells were plated onto 6-well culture plates with 2.5 ml medium per well. Next, 4.6 \u00b5l Sigma-1R siRNA (20 \u00b5M) was added and 7.5 \u00b5l Lipofectamine 2000 (GeneCopoeia Inc.) was added to 125 \u00b5l DMEM. The two solutions were incubated separately at room temperature for 5 min prior to mixing and incubating at room temperature for 15 min. The resulting solution was added to cells, which were incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 6 h to initiate transfection. The medium was replaced with complete medium and the transfected cells were collected for detection at 24 h or 72 h after transfection. In the control group, the H9c2 cells were transfected with a negative control siRNA for 6 h at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere using Lipofectamine 2000. [] Cell surface area measurement To establish the cell surface area, H9c2 cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). According to the manufacturer's protocols, the cultured cells were washed twice with 37C PBS and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Following permeabilizing in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (100 nM) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Next, the nuclei were stained with DAPI for 30 sec and images of H9c2 cells were captured using a laser confocal microscope at 400x magnification (TCS SP8X; Leica Microsystems, Inc.). The surface areas were then analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). Each group of cells was counted in six wells, and at least 100 cells were measured in each well. The cell surface area rate was given as the rate in the control group. [] Measurement of ATP content in H9c2 cells The ATP content in the H9c2 cells was measured using an enhanced ATP detection kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). According to the manufacturer's protocols, the cultured cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed. After 5 min of centrifugation at 12,000 x g at 4C, the resulting supernatant was used for detection. Next, 100 \u00b5l ATP detection fluid was added to the detection platform. The plate was left to stand at room temperature for 5 min to allow all the background ATP to be consumed. Next, 20 \u00b5l the sample or standard was added to each detection platform and mixed quickly. Finally, the mixture was analyzed using a luminometer (Varioscan Flash; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). [] Statistical analysis All of the statistical tests were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Inc.). All values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The statistical significance of the differences between the groups was tested using one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey's post hoc test. Two group comparisons were performed using independent sample t-tests. Comparisons of non-normal distribution data were followed by analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis method. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. [] Results [] [] Analysis of YQHX using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) The main components of YQHX were analyzed by LC-MS. The typical base peak chromatograms of the components of YQHX are shown in [Fig. 1](#f1-ETM-0-0-10743). Approximately 21 major compounds detected ( [Table I](#tI-ETM-0-0-10743)), including paeoniflorin, calycosin function and alleviates myocardial hypertrophy in MI rats To observe the effect of YQHX on the heart function, non-invasive echocardiographic measurements were taken 4 weeks post-treatment. The results demonstrated that 4 weeks after MI surgery, the rats developed heart dysfunction, as shown by increased LVEDV and LVESV and decreased II](#tII-ETM-0-0-10743)). and LVFS (all P<0.01 vs. MI; [Table [Table II](#tII-ETM-0-0-10743)). Hypertrophy markers, including the ratio of HW/BW, and the levels of calcineurin A and BNP mRNA were also detected. The ratio of HW/BW was found to increase in the MI group, compared with the sham-operated controls (P<0.01 vs. sham; [Fig. 2A](#f2-ETM-0-0-10743)). YQHX treatment significantly HW/BW ratio (P<0.01 vs. sham; [Fig. 2A](#f2-ETM-0-0-10743)), and in ( [Fig. 2A](#f2-ETM-0-0-10743)). The calcineurin A and BNP mRNA levels were significantly increased in the MI group, and YQHX and Flv treatment antagonized the increase in calcineurin BNP mRNA levels ( [Fig. 2C](#f2-ETM-0-0-10743) and YQHX Flv on myocardial hypertrophy in MI rats.

Values are provided as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. the ATP content and mitochondrial ultrastructure of myocardial tissue in MI rats To observe the effect of YQHX on energy metabolism in HF, the ATP content was detected in the hearts of the different groups. The results demonstrated that 4 weeks after MI surgery, the ATP content in the rats was found to decrease to 53% in the heart tissues, compared with the sham controls (P<0.05; [Fig. 3](#f3-ETM-0-0-10743)). YQHX administration increased the ATP content in the heart tissues to nearly normal levels (P<0.05; [Fig. 3](#f3-ETM-0-0-10743)). Flv treatment exhibited a tendency to increase the ATP content in heart failure (P>0.05; [Fig. 3](#f3-ETM-0-0-10743)).

Values are provided as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (n=5). *P<0.05 vs. is synthesized inside the mitochondria. The function of mitochondria is based on its structure. Therefore, the mitochondrial ultrastructure of the surrounding infarction areas of left ventricular (LV) myocardial tissues from the different groups was investigated using TEM. Representative micrographs are provided in [Fig. 4](#f4-ETM-0-0-10743). The mitochondria in the heart tissues of the sham group showed complete membranes and neatly arranged internal ridges. By contrast, in the MI rats, most of the mitochondrial membranes disappeared and the internal ridges were ruptured and indistinct. Subsequently, YQHX and Flv treatment were revealed to improve the mitochondrial ultrastructure of heart tissues following MI surgery ( [Fig. 4](#f4-ETM-0-0-10743)). Figure 4 Representative transmission electron microscopy images of cardiac tissue sections. Scale bar, Sigma-1R and IP3R2 expression in the LV of MI rats To evaluate the role of Sigma-1R in the curative effect of YQHX on HF, Sigma-1R and Ca2+ transporter-IP3R2 expression was detected in the heart tissues of rats by western blotting. The data showed that Sigma-1R expression in the heart tissue decreased significantly 4 weeks post-MI surgery in rats (P<0.05 vs. sham) and was be reversed by treatment with the YQHX surgery. administration of YQHX MI-induced upregulation and Flv on (A) Sigma-1R and (B) IP3R2 expression in the heart tissues in MI rats.

However, it may become maladaptive when the heart is persistently exposed to an increased load. In cultured H9c2 cells, cell hypertrophy was induced by incubating cells with Ang II. Using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining, cell hypertrophy was investigated. The results revealed that the cell surface area in Ang II-treated cells was increased significantly compared with control cells treatment attenuated blotting, Sigma-1R expression was revealed to be downregulated following treatment with Ang II ( [Fig. 6C](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)), and was the same as reported in a previous study ( [12](#b12-ETM-0-0-10743)). When Ang II-induced H9c2 cells were Sigma-1R expression restored ( [Fig. 6C](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)). The protein levels of IP3R2 were also evaluated by western blotting. The results demonstrated that IP3R2 levels were increased in Ang II-incubated cells compared with the control cells and were partially antagonized by YQHX ( [Fig. 6C](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)). HF ( [5](#b5-ETM-0-0-10743)). Our previous in vivo experiments demonstrated that YQHX improved heart energy metabolism in HF rats, indicated by an increased ATP content in heart tissues ( [Fig. 3](#f3-ETM-0-0-10743)). Next, the effect of YQHX on ATP content was investigated in cultured H9c2 cells and it was demonstrated that cells incubated with Ang II had a decreased ATP content ( [Fig. 6D](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)), in addition to an increased cell surface area ( [Fig. 6A](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)).

To determine whether Sigma-1R was the key regulator in the anti-hypertrophy effect of YQHX, H9c2 cells were transfected with a inhibitor siRNA of Sigma-1R. As demonstrated in [Fig. 6B](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743), of Sigma-1R mRNA expression in cells siRNA hypertrophy in Ang II-treated cells. Furthermore, Sigma-1R siRNA was revealed to partially neutralize this effect ( [Fig. 6A](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)). Additionally, the attenuation of the Ang II-induced decrease in Sigma-1R levels and increase in IP3R2 levels YQHX was by Sigma-1R siRNA ( [Fig. 6C](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743)), which also attenuated the improvement in the ATP content in Ang II-treated cells by YQHX ( [Fig. 6D](#f6-ETM-0-0-10743); P>0.05). [] Discussion In HF, a deficit in energy may account for the contractile dysfunction observed during maximal exertion ( [5](#b5-ETM-0-0-10743)). In traditional Chinese medicine, QiShenYiQi and Qiliqiangxin, which are manufactured using YQHX, have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of disorders in cardiac structure and function, possibly via an increase in the myocardial ATP content ( [20-22](#b20-ETM-0-0-10743%20b21-ETM-0-0-10743%20b22-ETM-0-0-10743)). Studies on the major active ingredients of Astragalus, a drug used in the formulation of YQHX, including Astragaloside IV and Astragalus polysaccharide, have been proven regulate mitochondrial function and energy biosynthesis ( [23](#b23-ETM-0-0-10743), [24](#b24-ETM-0-0-10743)). In the present study, heart dysfunction in MI rats, represented by decreased LVEF and LVFS, was attenuated after 4 weeks of YQHX treatment. Myocardial hypertrophy, measured as the ratio of HW/BW, was also found to be alleviated following treatment. Taken together, these results indicated that YQHX improved heart function in MI rats with heart failure, which is consistent with the results of our previous study ( [18](#b18-ETM-0-0-10743)). To investigate the effects of YQHX treatment on energy metabolism in HF, the ATP content and mitochondria ultrastructure were assessed in the heart tissues of MI rats following euthanasia. While the ATP content in rats with HF was decreased, it was found that treatment with YQHX attenuated this effect. Additionally, the impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure of heart tissues post-MI surgery was improved following treatment with YQHX. Sigma-1R has been demonstrated to participate in numerous diseases, including stroke, dementia and cancer ( [25](#b25-ETM-0-0-10743)), and was recently found to exert cardioprotective effects ( [12](#b12-ETM-0-0-10743)), as well as being identified as a receptor chaperone. It is located in the membrane of MAM, and has been revealed to be expressed abundantly in whole-cell extracts from LV and RV, compared with brain and kidney extracts ( [7](#b7-ETM-0-0-10743)). When Sigma-1R was used as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in a previous study, it was reported to decrease post-MI morbidity and mortality in patients with depression ( [26](#b26-ETM-0-0-10743)). The results of the present study indicated that Sigma-1R expression is decreased in the heart of HF rats, which is in agreement with the results of a previous study ( [12](#b12-ETM-0-0-10743)). When treated with YQHX, rats with MI surgery showed increased Sigma-1R expression in the heart, as well as increased ATP content and improved heart function. The same change was observed in rats treated with Flv, an agonist of Sigma-1R. Studies have demonstrated that Sigma-1R is associated with the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function ( [11](#b11-ETM-0-0-10743)). In earlier Sigma-1R-/- knockdown experiments in mice, irregularly shaped, highly fused mitochondrial network with abnormal cristae and a significantly lower ATP pool were observed in cardiomyocytes ( [27](#b27-ETM-0-0-10743)). In addition, Sigmar1-/- hearts showed significant cardiac fibrosis, collagen deposition and the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction ( [26](#b26-ETM-0-0-10743)). The results of the present study suggested that YQHX may improve cardiac function by increasing Sigma-1R expression and improving mitochondrial ultrastructure and ATP production. Several studies have demonstrated that Sigma-1R serves key roles in heart function improvement by regulating Akt-eNOS signaling and intracellular Ca2+ between the ER and mitochondria, nuclei and plasma membranes. By regulating ER-mitochondrion a molecular chaperone to IP3R, has been observed to enhance Ca2+ signaling from the ER into mitochondria, thereby activating the tricarboxylic acid cycle and increasing ATP production ( [8](#b8-ETM-0-0-10743)). Studies have demonstrated that in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. by stabilizing the Sigma-1R-IP3R complex ( [28](#b28-ETM-0-0-10743)). In the present study, the levels of IP3R2 in the heart tissues of the different groups were detected and it was found that YQHX neutralized the increased IP3R2 expression in MI rats. These results suggested that YQHX may improve injured heart function and ATP content in the heart tissue, possibly via Sigma-1R and IP3R2 regulation. To confirm the role of Sigma-1R in the cardioprotective effect of YQHX, Sigma-1R was knocked down via siRNA transfection in H9c2 cells in vitro. While YQHX prevented cell hypertrophy and the reduction in ATP induced by Ang II, these positive effects were found to be partially inhibited by Sigma-1R inhibition. These in vitro results suggested that YQHX is able to increase the ATP content and rescue the cell hypertrophy induced by Ang II, partly by stimulating Sigma-1R. However, further experiments focused on intercellular Ca2+ homeostasis regulation and Sigma-1R-IP3R complex stabilization are required to confirm these results. Notably, in addition to IP3R regulation, Sigma-1R binds to another important Ca2+ transporter-the (RyR) and regulates inhibits the RyR-induced Ca2+ release from reticulum, leading to the suppression of overconstriction ( [30](#b30-ETM-0-0-10743)). In future studies, the mechanisms underlying regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis by Sigma-1R and how YQHX affects this will be investigated. A previous study demonstrated that the expression of Sigma-1R is regulated by numerous factors, including cold stimulation, ERS signal molecules and certain chemicals ( [31](#b31-ETM-0-0-10743)). A recent study has demonstrated that miRNA may also regulate the expression of Sigma-1R ( [32](#b32-ETM-0-0-10743)). In the present study, numerous monomers in the formulation for YQHX that had effects on the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetic- s were investigated ( [33-35](#b33-ETM-0-0-10743%20b34-ETM-0-0-10743%20b35-ETM-0-0-10743)). However, how specific components of YQHX regulate the expression of Sigma-1R requires further study. In conclusion, these in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that YQHX improved heart function by regulating the heart's energy metabolism and inhibiting cell hypertrophy. These effects partially relied on the stimulation of Sigma-1R. The results of the present study provided evidence of Sigma-1R as a therapeutic target for HF treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, and the significant therapeutic potential of Sigma-1R for cardiovascular disease. However, further investigation is required to fully elucidate the details of Sigma-1R function in the treatment of HF with YQHX ( [28](#b28-ETM-0-0-10743)). [] Acknowledgements Not applicable.
