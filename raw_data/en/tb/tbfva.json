When I'm starting to or am feeling under the weather, although my first thought is Acupuncture and herbs, superfoods to kick my immune system into high gear is at the top of my wellness list. This is especially true during the Fall months when my allergy symptoms can make me think I'm coming down with something every other week! The following recipe is taken from [http://thehealthymaven.com](http://thehealthymaven.com) What's In This Immune-Boosting Soup Recipe: Meet The Power Players! Mushrooms- the soup is made in a mushroom broth (simmering mushrooms for an hour+). Mushrooms are a power food that contains Ergothioneine, a powerful antioxidant that helps to eliminate free radicals. They're also a powerful source of Vitamin D. Coconut Oil - contains two important anti-viral compounds, lauric acid and caprylic acid. Together these help ward off bacterial and viral infections. Garlic - eating garlic can actually boost the number of virus-fighting T-cells in your bloodstream. It also contains alliin which converts to allicin, which is believed to be the major antibacterial compound in garlic. Turmeric - probably best known for its ability to fight inflammation, turmeric contains a powerful antioxidant called curcumin which is responsible for this decrease in inflammation that is oftentimes found to be related to various illnesses. Bok Choy - very high in Vitamin A, which is essential for a properly functioning immune system, while also containing high amounts of Vitamin C, an antioxidant that shields the body from free radicals. Kale - It's packed full of iron, which is essential for your body working at its ultimate level, along with being a great source of vitamins and antioxidants. ULTIMATE IMMUNE -BUILDING SOUP SERVES 6-8 1 T coconut oil 1 large yellow onion, chopped 6 garlic cloves, minced 2 celery stalks, sliced 1 lb shitake mushrooms 1 1/2 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp black pepper 1 tsp turmeric 12 cups water 4 heads baby bok choy, bottoms chopped off 1/2 head kale, chopped optional: 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger Chop off the bottom of the stem from your mushrooms and discard.

Add onions and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes or until translucent. Add in garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add in celery and mushrooms and sautee for about 10 minutes or until mushrooms have wilted. Add in spices (including ginger, if using) and water and bring to a boil. Then let simmer, covered for 1 hour or as long as you want (the longer, the better!) Add bok choy and kale in the last 10 minutes of cooking to wilt. Serve warm or store for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. "}
