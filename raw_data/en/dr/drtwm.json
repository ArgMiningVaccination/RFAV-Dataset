Editorial Guidelines Published on May 15, 2020 Trending Videos Home is where we should feel most calm, creative, and nurtured, and few things can bring uplift faster than a house that smells lovely. You might be tempted by the ease of plug-in gels, candles, or deodorizing sprays\u2014or their optimistically named scents, like Creamsicle and Freshly Cut Grass\u2014but these products' high levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) make them more polluting than soothing. And, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, many contain phthalates, which are known endocrine disruptors. As usual, Mother Nature has a remedy: pure, plant-derived essential oils\u2014and you don't need to be a professional aromatherapist or perfumer to devise fragrant and effective blends. We've whipped up a few formulas that, when paired with some creative scent-delivery vessels, will naturally and beautifully relax, motivate, or inspire. Extracted from leaves, fruit peels, petals, and other plant parts, essential oils capture nature's subtle fragrances and can even balance your mood, aromatherapists say. Combined in different ways, these highly concentrated oils contain potent natural compounds that can be used as medicine, for beauty and pampering, for perfumes and aromatherapy, and for household purposes such as cleaning, polishing, and disinfecting. Some, like peppermint and eucalyptus, are believed to be stimulating and uplifting; others, like lavender and frankincense, are considered relaxing and centering. These crafts are the simplest way to experience aromatherapy for yourself. Spray the air around you, mist your hair and skin, or spritz them on linens to leave a light scent. (They won't stain.) Whether you're stressed or sluggish, one of these DIY ideas will suit your mood. 01 of 10 Lavender Spa Treatments Bath soaks, balms, tub teas, and scrubs\u2014when infused with lavender, all of them have a calming effect.
