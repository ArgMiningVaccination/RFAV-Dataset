Acupuncture Acupuncture has a long history of easing pain and physical distress in ancient China and is administered by inserting fine needles in the body. It has been accepted widely even by medical practitioners as a neuroscientific remedy for pain in bone tumors. Acupuncture involves the nerve stimulation of the neural structure that, in turn, affects the immune system and helps the healing process. In this method, a single acupuncture point is selected based on the location of the tumor. By a more scientifically developed process, it helps reduce the agitation of the central nervous system and counteracts the inflammatory mediators of the tumor. By doing so, it palliates pain with few to no side effects, and helps the patient towards a better lifestyle. 2. Nutrition therapy and vitamin supplements Nutrition plays a very important role in bone tumors.

Other recommended food items include green tea, turmeric, garlic and onions. These food items are helpful in bringing down levels of inflammation and boost immunity levels to prevent further spreading of the disease. Vitamin and mineral supplementation is also quite helpful. Good dosages of beta carotene, selenium, vitamin C, eicosapentaenoic acid, vitamin E etc. have been proven to yield good results. 3. Magnet therapy For alleviating physical pain and clinical symptoms, the magnet therapy is becoming hugely popular and preferred across nations. In this therapy, special magnets are placed directly above the site of the tumor. The magnet pulls the drug carrying particles out of the blood vessel so that they lodge in the tumor. This technique is promising and hopeful to get rid of the related stress and queasiness of the disease. Researchers have also noted that if developed scientifically, this method can prove to be quite effective. Biological reactions towards a negative magnetic field are quite therapeutic for bone tumors as they release more oxygen in blood and result in less trauma. On the other hand, a positive magnetic field is used to excite neurons that have been inhibited by the tumor and restart the healing effect. 4. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a 200-year-old medicine system that involves a treatment that is more natural. Treatment for bone tumors are specified based on the symptoms.

Ayurvedic practitioners swear by the three step treatment for bone tumors involving 'Panchakarma' (cleansing of internal systems), Ayurvedic medicines, and a healthy natural diet.
