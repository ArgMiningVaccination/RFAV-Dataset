We are the first approved entry-level doctorate program in acupuncture and Chinese medicine (previously known as Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, DACM) in California. Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine are a form of Traditional Medicine. Established thousands of years ago, they are well-established, effective, and popular healing methods for countless patients around the world. SCU honors the tradition while embracing the modern, preparing students to formulate and prescribe therapies such as acupuncture needling, cupping, moxibustion, herbal medicine, and many others to help individuals with a wide variety of conditions. SCU's model of experiential learning in interprofessional settings combines learning alongside other healthcare disciplines, coursework, clinical experiences, community engagement, and campus clubs to expose students to a variety of philosophies, practices and treatment options; help students develop a broad base of knowledge; and prepare future healthcare professionals with a deep understanding of integrative, evidence and team-based, whole-person healthcare. Graduates are prepared for the business side of their career in acupuncture with three business management courses. Learn how to sustain and operate a business, and study practice management theories that help you succeed after graduation. You will acquire business success skills through 75 hours of courses in practice management and jurisprudence, in addition to gaining clinical experience as early as your second term. Students have two class options, daytime or evening. Daytime students can complete the program in as little as three years and four months. Evening students can complete the program in as little as four years taking courses in the evening and on select Saturdays. Clinical training is completed during regular business hours. Students interested in working while they study should consider the part-time flexible \"Flex Schedule\" option. SCU's part-time option is designed to provide students with the ability to extend their time to completion. If you have 47 credit hours or more, you can enter the [Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences](https://www.scuhs.edu/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-of-science-in-health-sciences) with a concentration in Eastern Medicine, saving you both time and money toward earning your Doctorate of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. Graduates are eligible for the [California Acupuncture Licensing Examination](https://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/students/exam_require.shtml) (CALE) as well as the [National Certification Commission For Acupuncture And Oriental Medicine](https://www.nccaom.org/) (NCCAOM), which enable students to become licensed in the U.S. Graduates of the DAcCHM program (DAcCHM - previously DACM - first time takers) have historically achieved a 100% pass rate on national licensure examinations and 90% pass rate on the CA State exam. Our practitioner faculty bring timely experience to the classroom every day, supplementing their lectures with practical advice. Many SCU faculty members earned degrees in more than one discipline, offering a comprehensive perspective of health care. Discover real-world insights from faculty who currently practice acupuncture, and who are deeply connected to the field beyond a theoretical and academic perspective. At the intersection of two worlds, our practitioner faculty help guide your first steps into the world of acupuncture practice, paving the way for a more gentle and gradual transition from student to professional. All clinical faculty in acupuncture have a minimum of 10 years of clinical experience. At SCU, our low clinical faculty to student ratio of 1 clinical faculty member to 5 treating students is designed for a more personalized, supportive learning experience. The primary advisor for each student is a content expert in acupuncture, ensuring that you benefit from the mentorship of practicing faculty in your precise field of study. The capstone project in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine is a unique opportunity to carry out an independent investigation. Instead of a research paper, you create a polished presentation that will enhance your professional resume. You will design an innovative solution to a real-world problem of your choosing, such as a patient case or health condition. The capstone enables you to collect everything you have learned throughout the program and showcase your knowledge to others in your final term. You are guided by capstone advisors throughout the project. The scholarship award amount covers 50% of the DAcCHM program tuition each term the student remains eligible.

In California, Chinese herbology is included within the scope of practice. Learn from a comprehensive curriculum that includes Chinese herbal medicine in addition to acupuncture. Learn at one of the only acupuncture schools in the nation with a cadaver lab. Cadaver-based anatomy is a classic teaching method that offers invaluable lessons and insight into the shape, feel, and function of the body. During this unique experience for future acupuncturists, students express reverence and awe as they approach the body to make their first cut in real tissues and structures. The cadaver lab offers unparalleled insight into anatomical variation, structure, and function to help you become an outstanding provider. Education at SCU is supplemented by advanced anatomical teaching tools. All learning technologies are available on site, and many are also accessible at home. SCU offers convenient access to anatomy educational materials outside of normal classroom hours. Advanced learning technologies include: Students train at a modern health center with an enriched teaching environment. The SCU Health Systems provides integrative care to over 45,000 patients per year. The University Health Center is equipped with an expansive herbal pharmacy, diagnostic imaging, and an electronic health record system. Located on-campus in Whittier, it has 36 private treatment rooms and 1,000 square feet dedicated to active care space. Interact with other health professions and disciplines and learn how to co-manage patients in an integrated setting within an interdisciplinary team environment. Begin clinical training as early as your second term. SCU is the only acupuncture school with access to hospital rotations at the Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC). You are able to complete part of your clinical training at CHOC through SCU's exclusive affiliation. CHOC is nationally ranked in seven specialties by US News and World Report, and listed as one of the best regionally ranked hospitals in California.3 With the opportunity to learn through direct experience in a private practice setting, you can gain invaluable insight that will better prepare you for private practice after graduation. According to the [National Institutes for Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/whole-person-health-what-you-need-to-know), health care systems and programs are now focusing more on whole-person health. At SCU, you will learn to go beyond just looking at separate organs or body systems to considering multiple factors that promote a person's best possible health and wellbeing. You'll learn to help and empower patients to improve their health in multiple interconnected biological, behavioral, social, and environmental areas. The future of healthcare is whole-person health, which focuses on restoring health, promoting resilience, and preventing diseases across a lifespan. Our understanding and respect for Chinese medicine's cultural and philosophical roots form the foundation of our program. SCU students will learn from expert faculty, combined with the latest classroom, online learning, and lab technologies. The curriculum covers the areas of anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology, clinical laboratory diagnosis, pharmacology, nutrition, emergency procedures, traditional Chinese classical medical theory and related techniques, acupuncture and meridians, Chinese herbology, business management, exercises such as tai chi and qi gong, integrative clinical education, and chosen areas of concentration are offered. Upon graduation graduates will have gained a unique education based on an innovative approach to patient care through the understanding of integrating classical Chinese medical theories with biomedicine. DURATION: IN AS LITTLE AS 4 MONTHS. Over the past two decades, SCU has been graduating Master's degree students in the field of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine. The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM) confirmed the route for SCU Master's students to enroll in the Doctorate program with all applicable coursework from the Master's program. Students can obtain a Doctorate by taking one additional term of study for full-time students. Students who are not able to follow the full-time schedule may choose to take courses at their own pace with a flexible part-time schedule and have up to two years to complete their studies. | | 10th Term DAcCHM | | Course # | | Course Title | | Credit | | Hours | | AEBP0501 | | Evidence Based Practice | | 2 | | 30 | | ACL1011 | | Independent Clinical Practice | | 2 | | 60 | | Various | | Concentration Series (see below) | | Select from one of the Concentrations | | | | APP1011 | | Capstone Defense | | 2 | | 30 | | Concentration - Healthy Aging | | ADX1610 | | Life Cycles | | 2 | | 30 | | ADX1720 | | Basics of Oncology | | 2 | | 30 | | ADX1830 | | Diseases of Aging | | 3 | | 45 | | ADX1920 | | Successful Aging | | 3 | | 45 | | Concentration - Orthopedics | | FAB201 | | Functional Anatomy & Biomechanics of the Extremities | | 5 | | 105 | | SMS213 | | Lower Extremity Athletic Taping | | 1 | | 15 | | SMS214 | | Upper Extremity Athletic Taping | | 1 | | 15 | | ADX1930 | | Advanced Acupuncture Orthopedics | | 3 | | 45 | | Concentration - Women's Health | | APP1020 | | Women Health I | | 4 | | 60 | | APP1021 | | Women Health II | | 3 | | 45 | | APP1022 | | Women Health III | | 3 | | 45 MAOM students who have not completed the following two courses (or equivalent) at SCU must take them in DAcCHM program: | | Course # | | Course Title | | Credit | | Hours | | CPM0409 | | Public Health | | 3 | | 45 | | XR0515 | | Diagnostic Imaging Basics and Anatomy | | 3 | | 60 $6,560 tuition to complete the program.* SCU's distinctive Fixed Rate Tuition Guarantee provides students with confidence in planning for their educational investment.

SCU's DAcCHM program is the first Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine approved by the California Acupuncture Board (CAB). The Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine degree program at Southern California University of Health Sciences is the first to be awarded programmatic accreditation by The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM) on the West coast. ACAHM granted accreditation to Southern California University of Health Sciences professional doctoral program in English under applicable ACAHM standards effective 24 February 2018. Accreditation status and notes may be viewed at: [http://acahm.org/directory-menu/directory/](http://acahm.org/directory-menu/directory/). ACAHM is the recognized accrediting agency for programs preparing acupuncture and herbal medicine practitioners. ACAHM is located at 500 Lake Street, Suite 204, Excelsior, Minnesota 55331; phone [(952) 212-2434](tel:9522122434); fax [(952) 657-7068](fax:9526577068); [www.acahm.org](http://www.acaom.org). Upon completion of the DAcCHM program, SCU students are qualified to sit for the California state licensure exams (CALE) as well as the National Certification Commission For Acupuncture And Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM), which enable students to become licensed in the U.S. 3 NCCAOM advances the professional practice of acupuncture by establishing and promoting national evidence-based standards of competence. [https://www.nccaom.org/ ](https://www.nccaom.org/) 4 SCU California Acupuncture Board (CAB) Pass Rates for students taking the test are reported annually. Neither acceptance for admission into the program nor the subsequent earning of a Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine degree guarantees that a state or a foreign country will grant a graduate a license to practice. Each state and foreign country, through its legislative and administrative process, defines the standards of competency and scope of practice within its jurisdiction. In compliance with 34 CFR 668.43, the Southern California University of Health Sciences (SCU) Master of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine (MAcCHM) and Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine (DAcCHM) programs provide information pertaining to professional licensure for the programs. Students should refer to the information below and contact the appropriate licensing board to ensure they will meet the licensure requirements in the state(s) in which they intend to practice upon graduation. SCU's MAcCHM and DAcCHM programs are approved by the California Acupuncture Board and Accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM). Currently, graduates of SCU's MAcCHM and DAcCHMprograms are eligible to sit for the California Acupuncture Licensing Exam (CALE), as well as the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM\u00ae) certification exam. A passing score on the CALE certification examination is documentation of competency for licensure as an acupuncturist in California. A passing score on the NCCAOM certification examination is documentation of competency for licensure as an acupuncturist by 43 states plus the District of Columbia. Several states, including California, have a governmental agency that governs, supervises, and controls the licensure and practice of acupuncture. In California, the Acupuncture Board is responsible for such duties. If you desire to practice in another state, it is recommended that you contact that state's medical board or other appropriate agency, for licensure requirements, as these agencies may have requirements other than the passage of the competency exam. SCU's MAcCHM and DAcCHM programs meet the educational requirements for licensure in all states that license acupuncturists. The following states do not license acupuncturists: Alabama, Oklahoma, South Dakota. Please note that licensure requirements are always subject to change. Although SCU will confirm the licensure requirements on a routine basis, we strongly recommend that you inquire with the licensing agency to confirm that you understand and will meet the requirements for licensure before enrolling in your program of choice. Additionally, while progressing through the program, we recommend that you check licensing agency requirements regularly to monitor whether they have changed in a manner that impacts your licensure plans. All international students are strongly encouraged to check the credentialing requirements in the country where they intend to practice. One of the great things about SCU is we do have a campus layout, so all your classes aren't in a single room. We have our cadaver lab. We have different specialty rooms for physical assessment classes vs. acupuncture classes. All our acupuncture-specific classes have all the herbs in the room. You can pull out the herbs and look at them, whether in class or in between classes to get that extra studying in. My favorite part of SCU is the collaboration from our beginning terms. We were working alongside chiropractor students, PA students, and ayurvedic students. It's a unique community where we get to learn about these different fields and sit in classrooms with them and work with them in the clinic. It allows you to get an understanding of all the different fields and how they can work together, and what is unique about your field. I think that is a wonderful aspect that I didn't think was going to be as prominent as it is here; even now, in my upper term classes and I am not in class with chiropractic students, I can still reach out to them about a certain aspect I may not understand or if I am working on a case. I want another perspective I know I have them to reach out to, so that has been a great networking community to have resources for. Students seeking reasonable accommodations or support services while enrolled at SCU can do so through the [Student Services Office (SSO)](https://www.scuhs.edu/accessibililty/). We encourage you to register with SSO as early as possible to allow sufficient time for the approval and notification process. |Term||Tuition*||Fees**||Medical | Equipment |EXXAT Fees||Petition to $410 per credit hour.
