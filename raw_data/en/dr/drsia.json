It takes all members of the Temple University community working together to keep ourselves and everyone safe and healthy. We're here to provide the support and resources you need. You'll find information about Temple's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our universitywide efforts, as well as responses to frequently asked questions. Temple's response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be informed by guidance issued by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) and the [city of Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/2021-06-10-covid-19-guidance-for-a-fun-and-safe-summer/). COVID-19 Vaccine The city of Philadelphia has dropped its COVID-19 vaccination mandate for students and employees at higher education institutions. Effective immediately, Temple University no longer requires COVID-19 vaccination for students, faculty or staff. Temple strongly recommends that students, faculty and staff stay current on the vaccination, including booster recommendations, as the vaccine continues to prevent severe disease. Please note that students, faculty and staff working in healthcare settings are still required to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. [Learn more about how to get the COVID-19 booster at Temple](https://www.temple.edu/coronavirus/vaccines). Temple Mask Guidelines Masks continue to be required in healthcare spaces, clinical spaces and in settings where clinical spaces are incorporated within the learning environment. Masks are optional in all other indoor and outdoor, non-healthcare spaces. When it comes to masking, we encourage all members of the Temple community to make the best decision for themselves, taking into consideration all factors, including COVID-19 transmission levels, the indoor setting and their own health, while respecting the decisions of others to protect themselves. If you are concerned about COVID-19, the best way to protect yourself is to wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask. The effectiveness of this type of [one-way masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html) has been documented. When in doubt, we encourage you to put on a mask. Most importantly, we want to keep the vulnerable members of our community safe. Following [updated guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cloth masks alone are no longer adequate for protecting yourself and others. The CDC recommends that you wear the most protective mask you can that fits well (completely covers your nose and mouth) and that you will wear consistently. [Temple students and employees now have three options for how to mask while on campus](https://www.temple.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions). Quarantine and Isolation University Housing and Residential Life as well as contact tracers will be working with any student who tests positive. Those who do test positive are encouraged to isolate at home and away from campus. We will, however, have a limited number of isolation rooms, which will be prioritized for students living in university housing. We continue to follow CDC guidelines when it comes to quarantine and isolation. While a negative test is not required to leave isolation, we will require a negative test for a student in isolation who will be returning to a campus residence hall. Emphasis on Public Health Temple remains committed to the health and safety of our community. Each of us can keep our campuses safe by following the public health precautions outlined below. All members of the Temple community should follow [the CDC's guidance and public health recommendations](http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/index.html).
