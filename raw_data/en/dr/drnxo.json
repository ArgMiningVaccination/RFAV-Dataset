Chiropractors (DCs) are highly trained, licensed professionals who have graduated from accredited chiropractic colleges. Chiropractors are also known as chiropractic physicians and take a natural approach to healing, concentrating on the mind-body relationship while also placing emphasis on nutrition and wellness. The experienced chiropractors at Alliance Integrative Medicine work closely with our medical doctors and other health care providers as part of your wellness team. How Does Chiropractic Work? The primary focus of chiropractic is the detection, reduction, and correction of spinal misalignments and nervous system dysfunction. Chiropractors believe there is a relationship between the spine and the health of the nervous system. Chiropractic seeks to find the blockage and eliminate it, allowing the body to naturally heal. What Conditions Can Be Treated by Chiropractic? Chiropractic treats chronic ailments such as arthritis, bursitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, heel spurs, sports-related problems, scoliosis, chronic pain, upper back pain and lower back pain, shoulder and arm pain, herniated discs, whiplash, and headaches. How Does a Chiropractic Treatment Feel? At your first meeting, your chiropractor will ask you about your particular health concern and about your family history, diet, lifestyle, and other care you have received. A complete physical examination is performed, which may include x-rays and other diagnostic procedures. Then the chiropractor will conduct a careful examination, checking for areas of spinal dysfunction (subluxation). What Should I Do after Treatment? Generally, our advice is not to exert yourself for six to 12 hours. Once the chiropractor has evaluated your problem, he or she will discuss with you the specific procedures and techniques that are best for your condition. The next step is an adjustment or manipulation, applying pressure to the areas that are out of alignment. The goal of the treatment is to relieve symptoms and restore normal range of motion. The number of treatments you will need varies with your age, your general physical condition, and your health goals. Treatment is typically one of three types: - Symptom control or elimination - Reconstruction, returning the neuro-musculoskeletal system to normal - Health maintenance Does Chiropractic Have Any Side Effects? The most frequent side effect of a chiropractic treatment is mild soreness, which lasts only a few hours. This soreness is similar to a feeling of overexertion. The treatment itself is usually painless; if there is any discomfort it is very brief. There is a very remote possibility\u2014less than one in ten million chiropractic adjustments\u2014of underlying blood vessel injury, nerve, or spinal cord damage. Our chiropractors work with you to ensure that your treatment is as safe and gentle as possible. If you are concerned in any way, please ask about gentle chiropractic techniques. Be sure your chiropractor is aware of any pertinent medical history to ensure your treatment is safe and appropriate for your physical condition. How Many Treatments Will I Need? This will vary depending on the type of problem being treated. In the symptom elimination period, frequent treatments are required - up to 3 times per week. As you start returning to normal, treatments become less frequent - weekly or biweekly. Maintenance treatments are usually biweekly or monthly.
