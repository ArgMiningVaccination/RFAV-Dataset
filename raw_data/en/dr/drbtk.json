The duration of this postgraduate course is 3 years, and it focuses on the study of various concepts related to the field of study and management of patients living with active, progressive, and far-advanced diseases. Further focus on providing relief from pain. The course is a full-time course pursued at various accredited institutes/hospitals across the country. Some of the top accredited institutes/hospitals offering this course and Research Centre- Telangana, and more. Admission to this course is done through the NEET PG Entrance exam conducted by the National Board of Examinations, followed by counselling based on the scores of the exam that is conducted by DGHS/MCC/State Authorities. The fee for pursuing DNB (Palliative Medicine) from accredited institutes/hospitals is Rs. 125000 per Year. After completion of their respective course, doctors can either join the job market or pursue a super-specialization course where DNB Palliative Medicine is a feeder qualification. Candidates can take reputed jobs at positions as Senior residents, Junior Consultants, Consultants etc. with an approximate salary range of Rs. 3 Lakh to Rs. 8 Lakh per annum. DNB is equivalent to MD/MS/DM/MCh degrees awarded respectively in medical and surgical super specialties. The list of recognized qualifications awarded by the Board in various broad and super specialties as approved by the Government of India are included in the first schedule of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The Diplomate of National Board in broad-specialty qualifications and super specialty qualifications when granted in a medical institution with the attached hospital or in a hospital with the strength of five hundred or more beds, by the National Board of Examinations, shall be equivalent in all respects to the corresponding postgraduate qualification and the super-specialty qualification granted under the Act, but in all other cases, senior residency in a medical college for an additional period of one year shall be required for such qualification to be equivalent for the purposes of teaching also. What is DNB in Palliative Medicine? Diplomate of National Board in Palliative Medicine, also known as DNB (Palliative Medicine) or DNB in Palliative Medicine is a three-year postgraduate programme that candidates can pursue after completing MBBS. Palliative Medicine is the branch of medical science that involves the study and management of patients living with active, progressive, far-advanced diseases. The National Board of Examinations (NBE) has released a curriculum for DNB in Palliative Medicine. The curriculum governs the education and training of DNBs in Palliative Medicine. PG education intends to create specialists who can contribute to high-quality health care and advances in science through research and training. The required training done by a postgraduate specialist in the field of Palliative Medicine would help the specialist recognize the community's health needs. The student should be competent to handle medical problems effectively and should be aware of the recent advances in their speciality. The candidate should be a highly competent specialist in Palliative Medicine possessing a broad range of skills that will enable her/him to practice Palliative Medicine independently. The PG candidate should also acquire the basic skills in the teaching medical/para-medical students. The candidate is also expected to know the principles of research methodology and modes of the consulting library. The candidate should regularly attend conferences, workshops, and CMEs to upgrade her/ his knowledge.
