Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Fina ncial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Un ited States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenanc e of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statem ents that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the cons olidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United St ates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The proced ures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial st atements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to New York University's preparation and fair presentation of t he consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of New York University's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accountin g policies used and the 2 reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statem ents. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of New York University and its subsidiaries as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, and the changes in their net assets and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generall y accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Other Matter Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The consolidating information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounti ng and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The consolidating informat ion has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial st atements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves and other additional procedures, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the consolidating info rmation is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements take n as a whole. The consolidating information is presented for purposes of additional analysis of t he consolidated financial st atements rather than to present the financial position, changes in net assets and cash flows of the individual companies and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements . Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial position, changes in net assets and cash flows of the individual companies. Other Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards for the year ended August 31, 2021 and schedule of financial responsibili ty ratios as of and for the year ended August 31, 2021 are presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and the Department of Education, respectively, and are not a required part of the consolidated financial statement s. The information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records 3 used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and ce rtain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accor dance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards and schedule of financial respon sibility ratios are fairly stated, in a ll material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated December 13, 2021, except for Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and with respect to the opinion on the schedule of financial responsibility ratios, as to whic h the date is April 28, 2022, on our consideration of New York University's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of their compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulat ions, contracts and grant agreement s and other matters for the year ended August 31, 2021. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and complianc e and the results of that testing and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering New York University and its subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Description of New York University Founded in 1831, New York University (NYU) is a private institution of higher education, research, and patient care located primarily in New York City. NYU is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship and is a member of the distinguished Association of American Universities. The consolidated reporting entities for NYU cons ist of the University and NYU Langone Health, which represents the activities of NYU Lango ne Health System (Hea lth System) and its two medical schools: the NYU Robert I. Grossm an School of Medicine (NYUGSoM) and NYU Long Island School of Medicine (collectivel y the NYU Schools of Medicine). The University The University includes twenty colleges and divisions each with its own traditions, programs and faculty. The schools, in order of founding date, are the College of Arts and Science, School of Law, NYUGSoM (reported as a part of NYU Langone Health ), College of Dentistry, Graduate School of Arts and Science, Steinhardt School of Cultur e, Education and Human Development, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, School of Professional Studies, Institute of Fine Arts, Robert F. Wag ner Graduate School of Public Service, Post- Graduate Medical School, Silver School of Social Wo rk, Tisch School of the Ar ts, Gallatin School of Individualized Study, Rory Meyers College of Nursi ng, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU Abu Dhabi, Tandon School of Engineering (forme rly Polytechnic University founded in 1854), and NYU Long Island School of Medicine (reported as part of NYU Langone Health). The University also operates academic program sites and research programs in other parts of the United States and abroad. In addition to the colleges and divisions, NYU ope rates NYU Shanghai, which grants NYU degrees as a joint venture with East China Normal University. The New York-based activities of NYU Shanghai are reported in the University's co nsolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of activities. NYU Langone Health The Health System is the sole corporate memb er of NYU Langone Hospitals, which operates the Kimmel Pavilion and Tisch Hospital, two acute care facilities which together consist of 844 beds, and are major centers for specialized procedures in cardiovascular services, neurosurgery, cancer treatment, reconstructive surgery, transplantation, psychiatric services and rehabilitation. NYU Langone Hospitals also operates NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, a 225-bed acute care facility Langone Hospital-Long Island, a 591-bed acute care facility; and several ambulatory facilities, includi ng the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, the Ambulatory Care Center, the Center for Mu sculoskeletal Care and Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders. NYU Langone Hospitals is also the sole corporate member of Winthrop-University Hospital Services Corp., a real estate holding company, and various faculty, community, and hospital-based physician service organizations. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 8 NYU Langone Hospitals is the sole corporate me mber of CCC550 Insurance, SCC. (CCC550), which provides the hospitals' professional and gener al liability insurance, as well as insurance to physicians employed by the NYUGSoM. CCC550 is subj ect to taxation in accordance with Section 29 of the Exempt Insurance Act in Barbados. In July 2021, the Health System entered into an Affiliation Agreement with Brookhaven Memorial Medical Center Inc., d/b/a Long Island Community Ho spital (LICH), a 306-bed acute care hospital located in Suffolk County, Long Island. The propos ed affiliation with LICH is subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of satisfactory due diligence and receipt of regulatory approvals, which have not been finalized. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of NYU have , in all material respects, been prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statement s include the accounts of NYU, as well as its separately incorporated affiliates. NYU and, general ly, all of its affiliates are exempt from federal income taxes under the provisions of Secti on 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. NYU prepares its consolidated finan cial statements in accordance wi th the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounti ng Standards Codification (ASC) 958, Not for Profit Entities . This standard focuses on the entity as a whole and requires classification of net assets as determined by the existence or absence of restrictio ns placed on the assets' uses by donors or by provision of law. A description of the net asset classifications follows: Without Donor Restrictions: net assets of NYU that are used to carry out its missions of education, research and patient care which are not subject to donor restrictions. With Donor Restrictions: Net assets subject to donor-imposed restrictions that will be met either by the actions of NYU or the passage of time. Items that are included in donor restricted net assets are gifts for which donor-imposed restrictions have not been met in the year of receipt; endowments, annuity, and life income gifts; pledge s; investment return on donor restricted endowment funds; and endowments where the princi pal may be expended upon the passage of a stated period of time. Expirations of restrictions on net assets with donor restrictions are reported as net assets released from restrictions. In addition, NYU has elected the simultaneous release option for contributions that are al so subject to purpose restrictions. Activities Revenues and expenses related to conducting prog rammatic activities and provision of services by NYU are classified as operating in the consolidated statements of activities. Investment return relating to board-designated endowment funds and the related endowment appropriation, as well as pension and postretirement nonservice co sts, changes in pension and postretirement obligations, net assets released from restricti on for capital purposes, incremental non-clinical COVID-19 related expenses, and other activity that is not part of NYU's core activities, are classified as nonoperating in the co nsolidated statements of activities. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 9 Tuition and Fees Tuition and fees are derived from degree-grantin g programs as well as executive and continuing education programs. Tuition and fee revenue is reco gnized within the fiscal year in which the related educational services are provided as the performance obligation is satisfied. Tuition and fee receipts received in advance of a semester ar e recorded as deferred revenue. Financial aid, in the form of scholarships and grants, including am ounts funded by the endowment, research funds, and gifts reduces the published price of tuition for st udents receiving such aid. As such, financial aid is referred to as a tuition discount and re presents the difference betwe en the stated charge for tuition and fees and the amount that is billed to the student and/or third parties making payments on behalf of the student. Tuition and fees are repo rted net of financial aid on the consolidated statements of activities. Auxiliary Enterprises Auxiliary enterprises are se lf-supporting activities t hat furnish goods or servic es to students, faculty, staff, or incidentally to the general public, and charge a fee directly related to, although not necessarily equal to, the cost of the goods or services. Auxiliary enterprises include student housing and dining, real estate rental income, and other similar activities. Student housing and dining services are delivered over the academic terms and revenues are recognized ratably as the performance obligation is satisfied. Student hou sing and dining services are presented net of financial aid on the consolidated statements of activities. Grants and Contracts NYU receives funding for sponsored programs from various government agencies, foundations, and corporations. The funding may represent a reciprocal transaction in exchange for an equivalent benefit in return, or it may be a nonr eciprocal non-exchange transaction in which the funding provided is for the benefit of NY U, the funding organization's mission, or the public at large. Revenues from non-exchange transactions may be s ubject to conditions, in the form of both a barrier to entitlement and a refund of amounts paid (or a release from obligation to make future payments). NYU's grants and contracts are prim arily conditional non-exchange transactions and revenues are recognized when expenses are incu rred. Unspent conditional contributions from grants and contracts total $1,172,400 and $689,495 at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues from unconditional non-exchange transactions are recognized in the period awarded. In 2021 and 2020, grants and contracts revenue recognized from U.S. governmental sources totaled $585,304 and $523,845 respectively. Such sponsored grants and contracts generally provide for the recovery of indirect costs supporti ng these activities. Indirect costs, included in grant and contract revenues, are recovered at rates established in advance by NYU through negotiations with the U.S. federal government and other private sponsors and totaled $198,327 and $173,851, respectively. In 2014, NYU Langone Health was awarded a $982,400 multi-year fixed capped public assistance grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for both repair and replacement of damages and hazard mitigation projects as a re sult of Superstorm Sandy . The hazard mitigation project portion of the award was recognized as a co ntribution with donor restri ction (Note 17), with a corresponding FEMA receivable (Note 6). The net assets are released from restriction as the costs are incurred and totaled $8,126 and $12,1 79 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 10 Contributions Contributions, including unconditional promises to give, are recognized as revenue in the period received at their fair value. Contributions receiv able are reported at their discounted present value, using an estimated interest rate for the year in which the promise was received and considering market and credit risk as applicable (1.87% in 2021 and 1.47% in 2020). Amortization of the discount is recorded as additional contribution re venue. Allowances are recorded for estimated uncollectible contributions based upon m anagement's judgment and analysis of the creditworthiness of the donors, past collec tion experience and other relevant factors. Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance of fair value measurements, ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , establishes a hierarchy of valuation methodologies based on the extent to which asset valuations are observable in the marketplace. The following describes the hierarchy of methodolog ies used to measure fair value of investments: Fair value for Level 1 is based on unadjusted quot ed prices in actively traded markets that NYU has the ability to access for identical assets and liab ilities. Market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets. Fair value for Level 2 is based on quoted prices fo r instruments similar to those held by NYU in actively traded markets, quoted prices for identical instruments held by NYU in markets that are not actively traded and model-based valuation techniqu es for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or c an be corroborated by observable ma rket data. Inputs are obtained from various sources including market participants, dealers and brokers. Fair value for Level 3 is based on valuation techniques used to assess prices that are unobservable as the assets trade infrequently or not at all. Investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient consist primarily of NYU's ownership in alternative investments (principally limited partnership interests in public equity, hedge funds, cr edit, real assets, private equity, real estate, and other similar funds). The NAV of the securiti es held by limited partnerships that do not have readily determinable fair values are determined by the general partner and are based on appraisals or other estimates that require varying degrees of judgment. If no public market exists for the investment securities, the fair value is determined by the general partner taking into consideration, among other things, the cost of the securities, prices of recent significant placements of securities of the same issuer and subsequent developments concerning the companies to which the securities relate. NYU has performed due diligence on these investments and believes the reported NAV as a practical expedient is an appropr iate measure of fair value as of August 31, 2021 and 2020. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermor e, while NYU belie ves its valuation methods are appropriate and consis tent with other market partici pants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 11 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly-liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. This does not include pooled investments with less than three months to maturity held within the long-term investment portfolio. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. NYU maintains its deposits with high credit quality financial institutions, with balances that exceed federal depository insurance limits. Management does not believe the credit risk related to these deposits is significant. All short-term, highly liquid investments, which woul d otherwise qualify as cash equivalents that are included in NYU's investment pool within long-te rm investments, are treated as investments and are therefore excluded from cash and cash equiva lents in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the amounts re ported in the consolidated statements of cash flows: 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents 3,340,195 $ 3,220,829 $ Cash in long-term investment pool (Note 5) 177,070 140,305 Cash in other long-term investments (Note 5) 4,078 3,443 Cash in other assets (Note 8) 332 8,796Cash in deposits with trustees (Note 9) 382,923 141,731Cash in assets held for professional liabilities (Note 13) 25,597 27,966 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,930,195 $ 3,543,070 $ Land, Buildings, and Equipment Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at their acquisition or construction cost. If donated, these assets are recorded at thei r fair value on the date of the gift. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ( buildings and building improvements 10-60 years, equipment 3-10 years) using the straight-line meth od. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed when incurred. Leases NYU leases certain academic spaces, medical o ffices, administrative offices, and equipment under finance and operating leases. Operating lease ri ght-of-use (ROU) assets and operating lease obligations are recognized based on the present va lue of lease payments over the lease term, where the initial term of the lease exceeds 12 mont hs. NYU uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payment s because the leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate. As a prac tical expedient, NYU elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the calculation of the operating lease ROU asset and operating lease obligation. Variable lease payments are exclud ed for purposes of calculating the operating ROU asset and operating lease obligation unless the variable lease payments depend on an index or rate or are in substance fixed payments. Lease payments related to periods subject to renewal options are also excluded for purposes of calculating the operating ROU asset and operating lease obligation unless NYU is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend the lease. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 12 Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Deferred rent liability is reported as a redu ction to the ROU assets within the consolidated balance sheets. Collections The University does not assign a value to collection items. Collection items are generally held for educational purposes and are not disposed of for financial gain or otherwise encumbered in any manner. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists of tuition and fees and student housing and dining fees received in advance of the Fall semester as well as funding received for grants and contracts in advance of incurring the qualifying expenses. Asset Retirement Obligation NYU recognizes asset retirement obligations on futu re events, such as the abatement of asbestos and removal of lead-based paint and petroleum bulk storage tanks from buildings. The fair value of the liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it occurred, provided that it can be reasonably estima ted. Corresponding asset retirement costs (net of accumulated depreciation) have been included in land, buildings, and equipment. Funds Held for Others Funds held for others consist of NYU's federal grants refundable and deferred compensation plan liabilities (457(b)). Corresponding assets are included within accounts receivable (Note 6) and other assets (Note 8), respectively. Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires managem ent to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the repo rted amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual result s could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2020 consolidated financia l statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These recla ssifications have no impact on the net assets or changes in net assets previously reported. Authoritative Pronouncements Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases . Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize the following for all leases with a term of twelve months or greater at the commencement date: (a) a lease li ability, which is a lessee 's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (b) a ROU asset, representing the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases (formerly referred to as capital leases). Recognition, measurement, and presentatio n of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease are determined by a lease's classificati on. NYU adopted the new standard on September 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition meth od that allows for application of the standard at the adoption date rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 13 consolidated financial statements. As permitt ed under the transition guidance, NYU elected a package of practical expedients wh ich, among other provisions, allowed NYU to carry forward historical lease classifications. Upon adopt ion, NYU recognized $2,718,449 of operating lease obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. In August 2016, the F ASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 includes guidance on eight spec ific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice with the presentation or classification of certain transactions within the statements of cash flows. The standard is effe ctive for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2020 using a retrospective approach. Adoption did not have an impact on the consolidat ed statements of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash , which addresses the presentation, disclosure, and cash flow classifi cation of restricted cash and requires that the statements of cash flows explain the change duri ng the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as rest ricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Entities are required to reconcile these am ounts on the consolidated balance sheets to the consolidated statements of cash flows and disclose the nature of the restrictions. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Decemb er 15, 2018. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2020 using a retrospective approach and incl uded the required reconciliation and disclosures in the Cash and Cash Equivalents section of Note 2. In August 2018, the F ASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans, which addresses changes to the disclosur e requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments in the update remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost be neficial, clarify the sp ecific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identi fied as relevant. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2021 using a retrospective approach and updated the disclosures in Note 14. In August 2018, the F ASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement , which eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements relat ed to fair value measurement. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after Decemb er 15, 2019, with early adoption permissible. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2021 using a retrospective approach. Adoption did not have a material impact on NYU's conso lidated financial statements. New Authoritative Pronouncements not yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The new standard removes the previous requirement that a credit loss be probable of occurring for it to be recognized, and requires entities to use historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate their future expected credit losses. The standard is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect ad justment to net assets, if any, upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginni ng after December 15, 2022. NYU is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the F ASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software . The new standard amends aligns the require ments for capitalizing implementation costs New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 14 incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a servic e contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain in ternal use software. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. NYU is evaluating the impact of the new standard on NYU's consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the F ASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform, Fa cilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . The standard provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform due to the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transact ions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of refere nce rate reform. This standard is effective immediately and can be applied through December 31, 2022. NYU does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the NYU's consolidated financial statements. Impact of COVID-19 In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. On March 7, 2020, the Governor of New York declared a state of emergency, and the Mayor of New York City made a similar emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. The pandemic impacted NYU's activities with Executive Orders issued by the Governor of New York State and related federal, state, and city law, regulations, and guidance resulting in the cancelation of elective procedures at NYU Lang one Health, the transition to remote learning and closure of student residences at the campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, and the discontinuance of activities at each of the global academic centers. As of August 31, 2020, NYU Langone Health has re-opened all service lines and patient service revenue has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. For the year ended August 31, 2021, NYU's New York campus offered courses using a hybrid model with sections conducted part ly or fully in-person or remote. For Fall 2021, NYU's New York campus resumed fully in-person instruction with many classes also offering remote sections. The University incurred expenses relating to COVID-19 testing, incremental space for social distancing, and other pandemic related expenses supporting student instruction, research, and pandemic related campus services. These expenses have been recorded as non-clinical COVID costs in non-operating activity for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relie f and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted. The CARES Act impacted NYU as follows for the year ended August 31, 2021 and 2020: The Provider Relief Fund (PRF) appropriated funding to reimburse eligible healthcare providers for expenses attributable to COVID-19 and lost revenues. NYU Langone Health received payments totaling $570,200 which were recognized in program fees and other revenues in the consolidated statements of activities for the year ended August 31, 2020. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 15 NYU Langone Health received $441,276 in advanced payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ($432,800 in April 2020 and $8,476 in September 2020), for which repayment began in April 2021. As of August 31, 2021 and 2020, NYU Langone Health has a remaining Medicare advance of $317,099 and $432,800, respectively, which is reported in accoun ts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. The Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) appropriated funding to the Office of Postsecondary Education. The U.S. De partment of Education (DOE) awarded HEERF funds based on an institution of higher educ ation's Pell Grant recipients and full-time enrollment. Based on these criteria, DOE awarded $104,407 and $25,626 to NYU for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The University recognized $121,414 and $6,158 in program fees and other revenues in the consolidated statement of activities for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, re spectively. Financial aid awards include $69,899 and $7,272 of COVID-related emerge ncy grants to students supported by University funds, HEERF funds, and donati ons for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NYU deferred the deposit and payment of $181,950 and $116,190 related to the employer's share of Social Security taxes which are reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated bala nce sheet as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These deferred payments are due to be paid in two equal installments on December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. Federal Emergency Management Agency For the year ended August 31, 2021, NYU Langone Health recognized $199,661 as program fees and other in the consolidated statement of activi ties for reimbursement of eligible operating expenses related to NYU Langone Health's submission of CO VID-19 reimbursement claims to FEMA and $4,305 in nonoperating activities in the consolidated statement of activities related to FEMA reimbursement of capital expenditures. NYU Langone Health recognizes revenue as expenses are incurred and determined to be eligible for FEMA reimbursement. For the year ended August 31, 2021, NYU Langone Health received payments totaling $151,475 as expedited payments from the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services related to NYU Langone Health's submission of COVID-19 reim bursement claims to FEMA. As of August 31, 2021, NYU Langone Health has a balance due fr om FEMA of $54,358 in accounts and loans receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 16 3. Financial Assets and Liquidity Resources As of August 31, 2021 and 2020, financial assets and liquidity resources available within one year for general expenditure, such as operating expenses, scheduled principal payments on debt, and capital costs not financed with debt, were as follows: 2021 2020 Financial assets Cash and short-term investments 3,533,727 $ 3,223,281 $ Investments available for general purposes 1,273,620 743,208 Accounts receivable, net 236,143 188,011 Grants and contracts receivable, net 153,773 115,562Insurance premiums 105,457 114,290 Patient accounts receivable, net 1,059,493 847,254 Non-endowment pledge due within one year 182,239 assets 44,725 19,746 Subsequent year endowment distribution 198,428 188,448 Total financial assets available within one year 6,787,605 5,580,541 Liquidity resources Undrawn bank lines of credit (Note 12) 1,355,600 1,405,600Funds functioning as endowment ava ilable for operations 1,849,753 1,593,729 Total liquidity resources 3,205,353 2,999,329 Total financial assets and liquidity resources available within one year 9,992,958 $ 8,579,870 $ The University's cash flows have seasonal variations dur ing the year attributable to tuition billing cycles and, at times, a concentration of cont ributions received at calendar year end. The University's Reserve and Liquidity Management Poli cy provides guidelines for calculating and reporting the global cash position on a daily basis as well as rigorous cash flow forecasting. This approach is adopted to maximize the portion of wo rking capital funds that may remain invested. The Working Capital Fund Investment Policy (the In vestment Policy) has a primary objective of aligning the maturity and liquidity profile of t he working capital portfolio with NYU's anticipated spending needs, while preserving the principal invested and maximizing return among a subset of approved investment grade products and provid ers. The Investment Policy establishes concentration limits for both investments and banking institutions. Liquidity resources are available with NYU board of trustees approval. As part of NYU Langone Health's liquidity mana gement, financial assets are structured to be available as its general expenditures, liabilities and other obligations come due. In addition, NYU Langone Health may invest cash in excess of daily requirements in short-term or liquid investments. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 17 4. Patient Care Revenue and Receivables Patient care revenue for NYU, net of contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 2021 2020 NYU Langone Health gross charges 43,372,657 $ 36,148,464 $ NYU Langone Health contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions (35,253,304) (28,936,898) University patient care 43,563 36,450 Total patient care revenue 8,162,916 $ 7,248,016 $ The University's College of Dentistry provides de ntal clinic services to patients as part of a student's training. Performance obligations ar e met and patient care revenue is recognized as services are performed. NYU Langone Health has agreements with third pa rty payors that provide for payments at amounts different from its established rates (i.e., gr oss charges). Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reim bursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payments. NYU Langone Health grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor arrangements. NYU Langone Health bills patients and third-party payers several days afte r the services are performed and/or the patient is discharged. Patient service revenue is recogniz ed as performance obligations are satisfied over time based on actual charges incurred in re lation to total expected charges. Generally, performance obligations over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute care services or patients receiving services in NYU Langone Health's outpatient and ambulator y care centers. NYU Langone Health measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital or the commencement of an outpatient or ph ysician service to the point when it is no longer required to provide services to that patient, which is generally the time of discharge or the completion of the outpatient or physician visit. As substantially all of its performance obligations re late to contracts with a duration of less than one year, NYU Langone Health has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) Revenue from Contracts with Customers which removes the requirement to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at the end of the reporting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primar ily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when the patients are discharged, which generally occurs within days or weeks of the end of the reporting period. NYU Langone Health determines the transact ion price based on gross charges for services provided, reduced by adjustments provided to thir d-party payers based on contractual agreements, discounts provided to uninsured patients in ac cordance with NYU Langone Health's policy, and implicit concessions provided to uninsured pat ients. For the years ended August 31, 2021 and New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 18 2020, NYU Langone Health recorded $154,642 and $103, 211, respectively, of implicit price concessions as a direct reduction to patient care revenue. NYU's patient accounts receivable, after contractua l adjustments and implicit price concessions is $1,059,493 and $847,254 at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NYU Langone Health estimates its implicit price concessions using a q uarterly standardized approach to review historical collections based on major payor classification as a practical expedient to account for patient contracts as collective groups rather than individual ly. Based on historical collection trends, the financial statement effects of using this practical expedient are not materially different from an individual contract approach. In addition, NYU Lan gone Health assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues and assess the impact, if any, on estimates. NYU Langone Health be lieves that the collectability of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing proc esses, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services it provides . Subsequent changes to the estimate of transaction price are recorded as adjustments to net patient care revenue in the period of the change. Certain patient care revenues received are subject to retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. NYU Langone Health has established estimates, based on information presently available, of amounts due to or from Medicare and non-Medicare payors for adjustments to current and prior year payment rates, based on industry-wide and hospital-specific data. The amounts due to third party payors included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets is $149,883 and $146,837 at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, certain payors' payment rates for various years have been appealed by NYU Langone Health. If the appeals are successful, additional income applicable to those years will be realized. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility th at recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term. NYU Langone Hospitals' Medicare cost reports have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermediary through August 31, 2015; however, final settlements are pending for 2003 and 2004. Prior to their merger into NYU Langone Hospitals' Medicare cost report, NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn and NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island f iled separate stand-alone Medicare cost reports through December 31, 2015 and July 31, 2019, respectively. NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn's Medicare cost reports have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermediary through December 31, 2015; however, final settlements are pendi ng for the years 2008 to 2013. NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island's Medicare cost reports have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermediary through August 31, 2018 and there are no final settlements pending. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 19 The mix of patient care revenue for the year s ended August 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: Health System NYUGSoM Health System NYUGSoM Medicare 18 % 18 % 17 % 17 % Medicaid 2 1 2 1 Medicare and Medicaid managed care 20 14 18 14 Blue Cross 26 18 26 17Managed care and other 34 49 37 51 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 2020 2021 The mix of patient accounts receivable, net from patients and third party payors at August 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: Health System NYUGSoM Health System NYUGSoM Medicare 9 % 13 % 10 % 13 % M e d i c a i d 11 21Medicare and Medicaid managed care 19 15 18 13Blue Cross 28 19 27 18Managed care and other 43 52 43 55 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 2021 2020 NYU Langone Health's charity care policy, in ac cordance with the New York State Department of Health's guidelines, ensures the provision of qua lity health care to the community served while carefully considering the ability of the patient to pay. The policy has sliding fee schedules for inpatient, ambulatory and emergency services provided to the uninsured and under-insured patients that qualify. Patients are eligible for t he charity care fee schedule if they meet certain income tests. Since payment of the differen ce between NYU Langone Health's standard charges and the charity care fee schedules is not sought, t hese forgone charges for charity care are not reported as revenue. Total forgone charges for charity care totaled $101,318 and $102,569 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This equated to an approximate cost of $19,297 and $22,103 for the years ended August 31 , 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is based on a ratio of cost to charges. New York State regulations provide for the distributi on of funds from an indigent care pool, which is intended to partially offset the cost of uncompensat ed care and service provided to uninsured. The funds are distributed to NYU Langone Health ba sed on an uninsured patient methodology. Subsidy payments recognized as revenue amount ed to approximately $49,408 and $43,554 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in patient care revenue in the consolidated statements of activities. NY U Langone Health paid $63,004 and $61,545 into the indigent care pool for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 5. Investments Asset Classes NYU invests across a broad range of asset classes, including public equity, fixed income, hedge funds, credit, real assets, private equity, real estate, and cash and other. NYU may invest directly in the securities of these asset classes, or indirectly through interests in funds and limited New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 20 partnerships. Securities held directly by NYU are valued at their observable market prices. The value of holdings in funds and limited partnerships are in accordance with the valuations provided by their investment managers. Funds and limited partnerships may make investments in securities that are publicly traded, which are generally valu ed based on observable market prices. Managers of investment funds and limited partnerships value those investments based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are the investment manager's best estimates after consid eration of a variety of internal and external factors. Investments held by NYU's investment pool are categorized as follows: Public Equity Public equity consists of publicly-traded equity , mutual funds, and other commingled funds (which may include passive index exposure). Fixed Income Fixed income includes investments in securities such as U.S. government securities, non-U.S. sovereign bonds, and corporate and asset-backed securities. Real Assets Real assets include public and private investments in real asset funds. Cash and Other Cash and other predominantly includes cash and cash equivalents. Hedge Funds Hedge funds include investments with managers wh o invest across different strategies such as long and short equity, multi-strategy, event driv en and relative value funds. These managers typically employ some leverage. Credit Credit includes public and private investments in strategies including distressed debt and special situations. Private Equity Private equity investments include limited partnersh ip investments in funds pursuing strategies in corporate buyouts, growth equity, and venture capital. Real Estate Real estate includes public and private investments in real estate funds.

The pool is managed to achieve the maximum long-term return given prudent risk parameters. NYU relies on a total return strategy, the objective of which is to achieve a long-term rate of return consisting of a combination of current income and capital appreciation, recognizing that changes in market conditions and interest rates will result in va rying strategies in an attempt to optimize results. Investment return (realized and unrealized net gains or losses, interest and dividends) and the appropriation for the approved endowment distribution for board-designated endowment funds are reported as nonoperating ac tivities in the consolidated statements of activities. Investment return and the approp riation for the approved endo wment distribution for donor-restricted endowment funds are reported as change s in net assets with donor restrictions in the consolidated statements of activities. NYU's Board of Trustees has authorized a spendi ng policy designed to allow asset growth while providing a predictable flow of return to support activities. Distributions from the endowment to support activities (approximately 4.5% in 2021 and 2020) are calculated using the prior year distribution adjusted for the change in the New York Metro Area Consumer Price Index (CPI). To preserve the endowment's purchasing power, caps may further limit spending as follows: 1) the distribution of endowment return to support activiti es may not exceed the prior year's distribution by more than 10%, unless the increase was the resu lt of new gifts to the endowment, and 2) if the results of using only the average market value of either the final four quarters alone or the final eight quarters alone would be a decline in the distribution from the prio r year's distribution, then the distribution may not exceed the previous year's level. 6.

NYU enters into various debt and other loan agreem ents that are secured by specific revenue streams, collateral and other real property or improvements, in addition to issuing debt supported by a general obligation of the University, any of which may constrain the use of certain assets. Other agreements include covenants requiring t hat NYU Langone Hospitals maintains certain financial ratios. At August 31, 2021 and 2020, NYU is compliant with all financial and administrative covenants. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 35 Obligations with Financial Institutions At August 31, 2021 and 2020, the Obligated Group ha s three contractually committed bank credit agreements which total $800,000.

Professional Liabilities NYU Langone Hospitals' professional liabilities are reported on a discounted basis and comprise estimates for known reported losses and loss expense s plus a provision for losses incurred but not reported. Losses are actuarially determined and ar e based on the loss experience of the insured. In management's opinion, recorded reserves for both self-insured and commercially insured exposures are adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses incurred to date; however, the provision is based on estimates and may ultimately be settled for a significantly greater or lesser amount. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 36 Professional liabilities consist of the following as of August 31, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 CCC550 Professional 847,910 $ 770,741 $ NYU Langone Hospitals is self-insured for prof essional and general liabilities on an occurrence basis through CCC550. Beginning July 1, 2017, NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island and certain of its physicians are also self-insured through CCC 550. Prior to July 1, 2017, NYU Langone Hospital- Long Island was self-insured for prof essional liabilities and designated funds in a revocable trust for satisfaction of claims and expenses. CCC550 provides insurance cove rage to certain voluntary attending physicians and other non- employed physicians serving NYUGSoM and NYU Langone Hospitals. The cost of this insurance coverage is the responsibility of such physicians.

NYU Langone Hospitals recorded a corresponding insurance recovery receivable for claims covered by these policies within accounts and loans receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets (Note 6). 14. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension Plans Substantially all NYU employees are covered by retirement plans including various defined contribution plans, multi-employer defined benef it plans, and three NYU-sponsored benefit plans. Defined Contribution Plans Contributions to the defined contribution plans are based on rates required by union contracts or other contractual arrangements. Contributi ons of $262,571 and $259,985 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are reported as expenses in the co nsolidated statements of activities. There is no obligation on the consolidated bal ance sheets for these plans. Multi-Employer Defined Benefit Plans Contributions to the multi-employer defined benefit plans are based on rates required by union contracts and other contractual arrangements. Contributions of $199,920 and $196,708 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are reported as expenses in the consolidated statements of activities. There is no obligation on the consoli dated balance sheets for these plans. Defined Benefit Plans Contributions to the three defined benefit plans are intended to provide benefits attributed to service to date, as well as for those expected to be earned in the future. Contributions are made in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requi rements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (ERISA), plus such additional amounts as the sponsors may deem appropriate. Pension benefits under these defined benefit plans are based on participants' fi nal average compensation levels and years of service and are accrued during the period the employees provide service to NYU. Contributions of $63,001 and $100,549 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are reported as a reduction in the accrued benefit obligation on the consolidat ed balance sheets for these plans. Postretirement Benefits NYU has three defined benefit health and welfare plans that provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. NYU employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach the age and service requireme nts of the plan while working for NYU. The costs related to these plans are accrued during t he period the employees provide service to NYU. Contributions of $26,133 and $16,217 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are reported as a reduction in the accrued postretirement obligation on t he consolidated balance sheets for these plans.

New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 40 Plan Assets The following table presents the fair value of t he defined benefit plan inve stments at August 31, 2021 and 2020 according to the asset categories defined in Note 5: Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Public equity 1,037,161 $ 339,858 $ - $ 1,377,019 $ Fixed income 521,732 326,417 - 848,149Real estate 20,865 - - 108,076 1,687,834$ 666,275 $ - $ 2,354,109 Alternative investments NAV as a practical expedient 1,340 2,355,449$ 2021 Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Public equity 939,266 $ - $ - $ 939,266 $ Fixed income 448,639 159,249 - 607,888Real estate 33,720 - - 414,296 1,835,921$ 159,249 $ - $ 1,995,170 Alternative investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient 3,687 1,998,857$ 2020 The defined benefit pension assets seek to: (1) provide retirement benefits to its participants and beneficiaries; and (2) achieve full funding of the pens ion liability, while incurring an acceptable level of risk for the sponsor. The pension liability grow th rate together with the objective to achieve and maintain a fully-funded level over a reasonable timeline implies a minimum absolute rate of return to be met through either: (1) annual budgeted contributions, (2) pension assets growth, (3) plan de-risking improvements, or (4) a combination thereof. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 41 The strategy for achieving and maintaining a fully funded pension liability may vary with the prevailing funded level and other parameters related to the overall goal. The asset allocation process is designed to be dynamic and employ a liability-driven, glide path investment strategy, which reframes risk and performance relative to the pension liability. This approach is expected to enable pension assets to more reliably track the valu e of the pension liability, with less funded level volatility, than a static total-return investment. Broad target allocations at the current funded level are 55-75% return-seeking assets, such as equi ty and real estate (REIT) funds, and 25-45% liability-hedging assets, such as fixed income fund s. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by adding expected inflat ion to expected long-term real returns of various asset classes, weighing the asset class retu rns by the plans' investment in each class, and taking into account expected volatilit y and correlation between the retu rns of various asset classes. Working with our actuary, NYU management believes 6% - 7% is a reasonable estimate of long-term rates of return on plan assets for 2021 and will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions and adjust them as necessary. The following table presents the fair value of the postretirement benefit plan investments at August 31, 2021 and 2020 according to the asset categories defined in Note 5: Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1 ) (Level 2 ) (Level 3 ) Total Public equit y 142,301 $ - $ - $ 142,301 $ Fixed income 60,789 14,136 - 74,925Cash and other 118 - - 118 203,208 $ 14,136 $ - $ 217,344 $ 2021 Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Public equity 114,703 $ - $ - $ 114,703 $ Fixed income 43,941 13,261 - 57,202Cash and other 694 - - 694 159,338 $ 13,261 $ - $ 172,599 $ 2020 The plans' investment objectives seek a long-term total rate of return to meet NYU's current and future plan obligations. The postretirement benefit plan target asset allocation mix is 70% equity and 30% fixed income and cash, for which each asset class has a permitted range of +/- 10%. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 42 The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by adding expected inflation to expected long-term real returns of various asset classes, taking into account expected volatility and correlation between the returns of various asse t classes. NYU management believes that 6%-7% is a reasonable range of long-term rates of return on plan assets for 2021 and will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Contributions NYU determines the annual contributions to the plan based upon calculations prepared by the plans' actuaries. Total expected contributions for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in fiscal year 2022 are $47,568 and $29,910, respectively. Benefit Payments The following benefit payments, which reflect expect ed future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the following years: Defined Benefit Postretirement Year Endin g August 31, Pension Plans Benefit Plans participates in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. NYU makes cash contributions to these plans under the terms of collective-bar gaining agreements that cover its union employees based on a fixed rate and hours worked per week by the covered employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are di fferent from other single-employer plans in the following aspects: (1) assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other partici pating employers; (2) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, t he unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and (3) if NYU chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, NYU may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

Functional Classification of Expenses NYU's primary program services are instruction, research and patient care. NYU's additional program services are student serv ices and libraries and auxiliary enterprises. Ex penses reported as institutional services are incurred in support of one or more of NYU's program services. Natural expenses attributed to more than one functional ex pense category are allocated using a variety of cost allocation techniques such as square footage and time and effort. Non-clinical COVID-19 costs in non-operating activities of $110,482 and $16,601 are classified as institutional services for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Expenses by functional classification for the ye ars ended August 31, 2021 and 2020 consist of the following: Instruction and Research and Other Academic Other Sponsored Student Services Auxiliary Institutional Programs Programs Patient Care and Libraries Enterprises Services Total Salary and fringe 1,388,373 $ 569,609 $ 4,647,114 $ 135,396 $ 128,267 $ 955,673 $ 7,824,432 $ Medical and pharmaceutical costs 13,006,198$ 2021 Instruction and Research and Other Academic Other Sponsored Student Services Auxiliary Institutional Programs Programs Patient Care and Libraries Enterprises Services Total Salary and fringe 1,381,904 $ 533,982 $ 4,551,437 $ 139,538 $ 111,869 $ 672,466 $ 7,391,196 $ Medical and pharmaceutical costs 59 2,648 Eliminations (10,797) 12,588,345$ 2020 New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 45 17. Components of Net Assets with Donor Restrictions Net assets with donor restrictions are available for the following purposes at August 31, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Scholarships and fellowships 1,597,392 $ 1,210,111 $ Contributions and earnings for operating purposes 1,865,393 1,160,630 Faculty and staff salaries 838,654 818,516 Program support 578,566 543,505 FEMA award for mitigation 50,067 58,194 Annuity trust agreements 40,080 36,862Contributions for buildings and equipment 34,463 35,434 Other 108,286 Total net assets with donor restictions 5,112,901 $ 3,967,548 $ NYU's investment pools include individual endow ed funds established for a variety of purposes. Pooled assets include both donor restricted endowm ent funds and funds designated by the board to function as endowments. NYU classifies as net assets with donor restri ctions the historical value of donor-restricted endowment funds, which includes: (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment required by the applicable donor gift instrument. Also included in net assets with donor restrictions is accumulated unspent earnings on donor restricted endowment funds which are available for expenditure in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence described by the New York Prudent Mana gement of Institutional Funds Act (NYPMIFA), and deficiencies associated with funds where the value of the fund has fallen below the original value of the gift. The historical value of NYU's donor-restricted end owment funds totaled $2,565,794 and $2,284,973 at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NYU defines the appropriation of endowment net asse ts for expenditure as the authorization of its investment spending rate as approved annually by the Board of Trustees (Note 5). However, when donors have expressly stipulated the payout pe rcentage of earnings on endowments that differs from NYU policies, the donors' intent prevails . In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, NYU adheres to the standard of prudence prescribed by NYPMIFA and considers the following factors: the duration and preservation of the endowment fund; NYU's mission and the purpose of the endowment fund; general economic co nditions; the possible effect of inflation or deflation; the expected total return from inco me and the appreciation of investments; other resources of NYU; where appropri ate and circumstances would other wise warrant, alternatives to expenditures of the endowment fund giving due consider ation to the effect that such alternatives may have on NYU; and the investment policy of NYU. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands of dollars) 46 From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individua l donor-restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor required to be retained as a fund of perpetual duration. Deficiencies of this nature are report ed in net assets with donor restrictions. As of August 31, 2021 and 2020, 5 funds and 12 funds, respec tively, with original gift values of $350 and $3,118 were underwater by $34 and $211. All endowment funds included within net assets without donor restrictions are board-designated. The following table provides the changes in the net asset classes of NYU's endowment funds at August 31: Without Donor With Donor Restrictions Restrictions Total Investment pool net assets, beginning of year 1,593,729 $ 3,111,869 $ 4,705,598 $ - Investment pool net assets, end of year 1,849,753 $ 3,928,681 $ 5,778,434 $ 2021 Without Donor With Donor Restrictions Restrictions Total Investment pool net assets, beginning of year 1,442,772 $ 2,882,044 $ 4,324,816 $ Liquidations (25,154) pool net assets, end of year 1,593,729 $ 3,111,869 $ 4,705,598 $ 2020 18. Commitments and Contingencies NYU Langone Hospitals provides emergency department (ED) services at the site of the former Long Island College Hospital ED pursuant to an agreem ent with the State University of New York (SUNY) and a real estate development company (t he Company). Pursuant to the agreement with SUNY and the Company, following demolition and remediation of adjacent premises, SUNY will deed the cleared site to NYU Langone Hospitals at no cost and NYU Langone Hospitals will construct on the site a four-story medical serv ices building including a freestanding ED. NYU New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 47 Langone Hospitals received the deed to the site on March 13, 2020. As of August 31, 2021, construction is underway and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2023. NYU has ongoing construction projects with cont ractual commitments totaling $593,347 at August 31, 2021. NYU is self-insured for workers' compensation. The University purchases an excess workers' compensation insurance policy with a retention of $500 per claim. In connection with being self-insured, the University has maintained a surety bond in the amount of $12,720 at August 31, 2021 and 2020. Additionally, NYU Langone Health has main tained stand-by letters of credit aggregating approximately $63,540 and $51,905 at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NYU is a defendant in various legal actions arisi ng from the normal course of its activities and amounts expended under government grants and contracts are subject to audit by governmental agencies. In addition, amounts received for patient care from Medicare and Medicaid are subject to audit. Although the final outcome of such action s and audits cannot be determined, management believes that eventual liability, if any, will not have a material effect on NYU's consolidated balance sheets. 19. Subsequent Events NYU performed an evaluation of su bsequent events through December 13, 2021, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. Events Subsequent to Original Issuance of Financial Statements (Unaudited) In connection with the reissuance of the cons olidated financial statements, NYU has evaluated subsequent events through April 28, 2022, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be reissued. On March 1, 2022, the Health System received regulatory approvals related to the affiliation with LICH, at which time the Health System became the sole corporate member of LICH. The Health System's Affiliation with and su bsequent change in co ntrol of LICH will be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , and ASC 958-805-05, Acquisition by a Not-for-Profit Entity . The Health System is in the process of performing a fair value analysis of the assets and liabilities of LICH and will re cord the fair value of LICH's net assets within other items in the 2022 consolidated statement of activities which represents LICH's net assets without donor restrictions at March 1, 2022 and the excess of the fair value of assets acquired over the fair value of liabilities assumed. No c onsideration was exchanged for the acquisition. In April 2022, the Obligated Group entered into agreements to acquire or lease property in the New York Metro area with discounted future payments totaling approximately $72,000. New York University Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements August 31, 2021 and 2020 48 20. Financial Responsibility Ratios NYU participates in federal Title IV student financia l assistance programs, which require it to meet standards of financial responsibility based on cr iteria determined by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), as set forth in 34 CFR 668.171. The criteria for private institutions include the annual calculation by ED of a financial responsibility comp osite score, as further outlined in 34 CFR 668.172, using audited financial statements submitted through ED's eZ-Audit system. The composite score has been and will continue to be based on three rati os: Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income. These ratios utilize the following financial data of NYU, which ar e not otherwise presented in the financial statements or other notes to the financ ial statements, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2021: (in thousands of dollars) Related financial statement amount not used as input on supplementary Required input per standards Ratio(s) Uses Input Amount schedule Property, plant and equipment, net -

Basis of Presentation The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (\"the Schedule\") presents the federal grant activity of NYU and is pres ented on the accrual basis of accounting. The information in this Schedule is presented in ac cordance with the requirements of the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and therefore, some amounts may differ from amounts presented in, or used in the preparation of NYU's consolidated financial statements. Negative amounts represent adjus tments or credits to amounts reported as expenditures in prior years arising out of the norma l course of business. CFDA numbers and pass- through numbers are provided when available. The research expenditures for direct costs are recognized using the cost accounting principles contained in OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, and OMB Uniform Guidance, where applicable. Under those cost principles, certain types of expenditures are not allowed for reimbursement. In addition, expenditu res include a portion of costs associated with general NYU activities (facilities and administrative) which are allocated to federal awards under negotiated formulas commonly referred to as fac ilities and administrative rates (also under the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and OM B Uniform Guidance, where applicable). NYU, with the exception of NYU Langone Hospitals, as described in Note 2, does not use the 10% de-minimis indirect cost rate for sponsored programs. 2. Facilities and Admi nistrative Cost Rates The University had predetermined facilities and admin istrative cost rates for the fiscal year ended 2021, under a rate agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\"), the University's federal cognizant agency. The base ra te for on-campus research was 58.5% for fiscal 2021. The base rate for off-campus research was 26% for fiscal 2021. NYUGSoM and NYU Long Island School of Medicine had predetermined facilities and administrative cost rates for the fiscal year ended 2021, under separate rate agreements with the DHHS, their federal cognizant agency. The NYUGSoM base rates for on-campus and off-campus research, respectively, were 69.5% and 26% fo r fiscal 2021. The NYU Long Island School of Medicine base rates for on-campus and off-campus research, respectively, were 54% and 17% for fiscal 2021.

Federal Student Loan Programs NYU administers and accounts for all aspects of the campus-based student loan programs. Accordingly, NYU's consolidated finan cial statements include all activity related to these programs. The amount of loans outstanding under each of these programs at Augus t 31, 2021 are presented below. Amount Assistance Outstanding at Program Listing August 31, 2021 Federal Perkins Loan 84.038 35,225,238 $ Health Professions Student Loans - Loans to Disadvantaged Students 93.342 4,175,489 Health Professions Student Loans 93.342 19,293,225 Nursing Student Loans 93.364 1,387,806 Graduate Nursing Loans 93.364 134,503 Nursing Faculty Nursing Faculty Loans - ARRA 93.264 57,318 60,973,185 $ With respect to the Federal Direct Loan Program, NYU is only responsible for the performance of certain administrative duties. Therefore, the tr ansactions and the balances of loans outstanding related to this program are not included in NYU' s consolidated financial statements. The Schedule includes the loans issued to NYU student s during the year ended August 31, 2021. The administrative cost allowance for the Pell Grant Program of $27,765 and for the College Work Study Program of $615,981 have been included in th e schedule of expenditures of federal awards. NYU did not receive an administrative cost allowance from the Perkins Loan Program (CFDA #84.038) for the year ended August 31, 2021. 4. HRSA COVID-19 Testing and Treatment for the Uninsured NYU Langone Health conducted COVID-19 testing and/or provided treatment for uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 primary diagnosis on or after February 4, 2020 and as such has requested claims reimbursement under CFDA #93.461 Health Resources and Services Administration's (\"HRSA\") COVID-19 Claims Re imbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities for Testing, Treatment and Vaccine Ad ministration for the Uninsured program. NYU has recorded $5,897,125 on the Schedule of Ex penditures of Federal Awards consisting of $5,776,508 reimbursed to date from HRSA on claims with service dates during fiscal year 2021 and $402,787 in claims with service dates in fiscal year 2021 that have either not yet been submitted to HRSA or have been submitted, but have not yet been reimbursed, and an adjustment of ($282,170) related to claims with service dates during fiscal year 2020. Claims not yet submitted or reimbursed have been estimated based on serv ices provided and expected reimbursement rates and any adjustments based on actual cash receipts, will be reflected in NYU's fiscal year 2022 Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. New York University Notes to Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Year Ended August 31, 2021 101 5. Department of Health and Human Services Provider Relief Funds The Schedule includes grant activity related to the DHHS Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act Assistance Listing Number 93.498. As required based on guidance in the 2021 OMB Compliance Supplement, the Schedule includes all Period 1 funds received between April 10, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and expended by June 30, 2021 as reported to HRSA via the PRF Reporting Portal. New York University Schedule of Financial Responsibility Ratios Year Ended August 31, 2021 (in thousands of dollars) 102 NYU participates in federal Title IV student financia l assistance programs, which require it to meet standards of financial responsibility based on criter ia determined by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), as set forth in 34 CFR 668.171. The criteria for private institutions include the annual calculation by ED of a financial responsibility composite score, as further specified in 34 CFR 668.172, using the institution's audited financial st atements submitted with the annual Uniform Guidance (UG) report through ED's eZ-Audit system. The composite score is base d on three ratios: Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income. Effective September 1, 2019, NYU is required to report the inputs used to calculate these three ratios as a disclosure in the UG report. These ratios utilize the following financial data of NYU, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2021: GAAP financial statement line item or Amount used Location in financial statements or related notes Financial element disclosure as ra tio input Primary Reserve Ratio: Expendable Net Assets Balance Sheet Net assets without donor restrictions 6,936,140 $ 6,936,140 $ Balance Sheet Net assets with donor restrictions 5,112,901 5,112,901 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Unse cured related party receivable 134,773 134,773 Note 20, Financial Responsib ility Ratios Total property, plant, and equipment, net 12,900,693 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ra tios Property, plant and equipment, net - pre-implem entation 9,756,414 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Property, plant and equipment, net - post-implementation with outstanding debt for original purchase 1,257,957 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Property, plant and equipment, net - post-implementation without outstanding debt for original purchase 604,838 Note 20, Financial Res ponsibility Ratios Construc tion in progress 1,281,485 Balance Sheet right-of-use assets 2,154,999 N/A Lease right-of-use assets, pre-implementation - Balance Sheet Lease right-of-use assets, post-implementation 2,154,999 Note 8, Other Assets Intangible assets 51,293 51,293 Balance Sheet Accrued benefit obligation 537,447 537,447 Accrued postretirement obligation 632,710 632,710 (Accrued employee benefit liabilities) Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Total long-term debt 9,640,911 Note 20, Financial Respons ibility Ratios Long-term debt - for long-term purposes pre-implementation 7,050,234 Note 20, Financial Respons ibility Ratios Long-term debt - for long-term purposes post-implementation 2,546,277 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Line of Credit for Construction in progress 44,400 Balance Sheet Total liability related to lease right-of-use assets 2,295,086 N/A Liability related to lease right-of-use assets - pre-implementation - Balance Sheet Liability related to lease right-of-use assets - post-implementation 2,295,086 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ra tios Annuities and life income fund s with donor restrictions 99,113 Note 20, Financial Responsib ility Ratios Term endowments with donor restrictions 4,815 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Net asse ts with donor restrictions: restricted in perpetuity 2,592,090 Primary Reserve Ratio: Expenses and Losses Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ra tios Total expenses and losses wi thout donor restrictions 13,168,178 13,168,178 Equity Ratio: Modified Net Assets Balance Sheet Net assets without donor restrictions 6,936,140 6,936,140 Balance Sheet Net assets with donor restrictions 5,112,901 5,112,901 Note 8, Other Assets Intangible assets 51,293 51,293 Note 20, Financial Responsib ility Ratios Unsecured rela ted party receivable 134,773 Equity Ratio: Modified Assets Balance Sheet Total assets 30,995,441 30,995,441 N/A Lease right-of-use assets, pre-implementation - Note 8, Other Assets Intangible assets 51,293 51,293 Note 20, Financial Responsib ility Ratios Unsecured rela ted party receivable 134,773 Net Income Ratio Statement of activities Increase in net assets without donor restrictions 1,305,425 1,305,425 Note 20, Financial Responsibility Ratios Total revenues and gains wi thout donor restri ctions 14,473,603 14,473,603 Part Internal Control and Compliance PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers Center, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 T: (646) 471 3000, www. pwc.com/us Report of Independent Auditors on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financia l Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards To the Board of Trustees of New York University We have audited in accordance with auditing standar ds generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States , the consolidated financial statements of New York University and its subsidiaries (\"NYU\"), which comp rise the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of activi ties and of cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 13, 2021, except for Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and with respect to the opinion on the schedule of financial responsibility ratios, as to which the date is April 28, 2022. Our opinion is not modified with respect to these matters. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered NYU's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basi s for designing the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of NYU's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiven ess of NYU's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of pe rforming their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in inte rnal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's finan cial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the lim ited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficienc ies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given thes e limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 104 deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weakness es. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether NYU's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its comp liance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with wh ich could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not expr ess such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or othe r matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an op inion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an int egral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. New York, New York December 13, 2021, except for Note 20 to the consol idated financial statements and with respect to the opinion on the schedule of financial responsibility ratios, as to which the date is April 28, 2022 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers Center, 300 Madison Avenue, 10017 T: (646) 471 3000, www. pwc.com/us Report of Independent Auditors on Compliance with Requirements That Could Have a Direct and Material Effect on Each Major Program and on Internal Control Over Compliance in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance To the Board of Trustees of New York University Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited New York University and its su bsidiaries' (\"NYU\") compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of NYU's major federal pr ograms for the year ended August 31, 2021. NYU's major federal programs are identified in the summar y of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on complianc e for each of NYU's majo r federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirement s referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards gener ally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assura nce about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about NYU's compliance with those requirements and performing such other pr ocedures as we consi dered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not prov ide a legal determination of NYU's compliance. 106 Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opinion, NYU complied, in all material respec ts, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended August 31, 2021. Other Matters As indicated in Part I to the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, we have audited the Student Financial Assistance cluster as a major progr am. Also, as indicated in the first paragraph of this report, we performed our audit of compliance using the compliance requirements contained in the OMB Compliance Supplement, including those contained in Part V 5.3, Compliance Requirement N, Special Tests and Provisions, Section 10 \"Gramm-Lea ch-Bliley Act-Student Information Security.\" This section includes three suggested audit procedures with respect to verification that the institution (1) designated an individual to coordinate the informatio n security program, (2) pe rformed a risk assessment that addresses the three required areas in 16 CFR 314.4(b), and (3) documented a safeguard for each risk identified. Our procedures in relation to thes e three items were limited to inquiry of and obtaining written representation from manag ement and obtaining and reading management's documentation related to these three items. Our procedures did not includ e an analysis of the adequacy or completeness of the risk assessment performed or the safeguards for each risk identified by management. The results of our auditing procedures disclosed an in stance of noncompliance, which is required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item 2021-001. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modified with respect to these matters. NYU's response to the noncompliance finding identifi ed in our audit is described in the accompanying management's views and corrective action plan. NY U's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, ac cordingly, we express no opinion on the response. Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Management of NYU is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered NYU's internal c ontrol over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumst ances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 107 effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of NYU's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncomp liance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in inter nal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance wi th a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of def iciencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over complia nce was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to id entify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over co mpliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the result s of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this repo rt is not suitable for any other purpose.

Section III - Federal Award Findings and Questioned Costs 2021-001: Advertising Expense Duplication Federal Agency: Department of Health and Human Services Program: COVID-19 CARES Act Provider Relief Fund Assistance Listing #: 93.498 Criteria In accordance with the Health Resources and Serv ices Administration (HRSA) Provider Relief Fund Terms and Conditions, eligible providers may use Provider Relief Funds to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, and for related expenses or lost revenues attributable to coronavirus. Condition Within its PRF - Reporting Period 1 report subm itted in the HRSA portal, NYU Langone Hospitals reported total lost revenues of $1,174,754,451, wh ich exceeds the total payments received during the period ($437,151,870) by $737,602,581. NYU Langone Hosp itals also reported total eligible expenditures of $8,737,869. The expenditure listing included a duplicat ion of expenditures related to three advertising invoices incurred to respond to coronavirus which totaled $2,087,585. Cause Because the related invoices were for services pr ovided over time, NYU Langone Hospitals appropriately recorded the invoices as prepaid expenses within t he general ledger, and amortized the expense over the service period. However, in preparing the PRF - Reporting Period 1 submission, management did not identify the duplicate entries relati ng to advertising expenses, thus resulting in both the original invoice amounts and the related amortization expense being included in NYU Langone Hospitals' total expenses reported to HRSA. Effect The result of the condition caused a duplication of expenses reported within NYU Langone Hospitals' PRF - Reporting Period 1 submission. Questioned Costs There are no questioned costs associated with the findi ng. While NYU Langone Hospitals' submission to HRSA included $2,087,585 of duplicate expenditures, t he amount of lost revenues reported was far in excess of the funding received from the Provider Reli ef Program, such that this finding does not impact the total Provider Relief Program expenses recorded within the SEFA. Recommendation We recommend NYU Langone Hospitals perform a thorough re view of all expenditures related to services provided over time charged to the grant to ensure tr ansactions are not duplicated as well as adjust the expenses reported in the PRF - Reporting Period 2 report submission to HRSA. Management's Views and Corrective Action Plan Refer to Management's Views and Correctiv e Action Plan at the end of the report. New York University Summary Schedule of Status of Prior Audit Findings Year Ended August 31, 2021 110 Section II - Financial Statement Findings - 2020 There are no findings from prior year that require an update in this report. Section III - Federal Award Findings and Questioned Costs - 2020 There are no findings from prior year that require an update in this report. i... NVU Langone '-.-Health Management's View and Corrective Action Plan August 31, 2021 2021-001: Advertising Expense Duplication Management Views and Opinion NYU Langone Health management agrees that expenditures reported on the PRF -Reporting Period 1 report submitted in the HRSA portal were overstated by $2,087,585. The duplicated costs were for services provided over time and the invoices were appropriately recorded as prepaid expenses within the general ledger and amortized over the service period. However, in preparing the PRF -Reporting Period 1, both the amortized cost and the original invoice were included as unreimbursed COVID-19 expenses resulting in a duplication of costs on the PRF - Reporting Period 1 submission. Corrective Action Plan Upon identification, NYU Langone Health management's Research Finance department reviewed general ledger activity for other similar instances of prepaid amortizations reported in the PRF submission alongside the original invoice, noting no similar such instances. In addition, a listing of all prepaid expenses amortized over the reporting period was reviewed by NYU Langone Health management's Finance department noting that no other prepaid expenses were related to COVID-19 and thus no other expenses reported on the period I PRF report were at risk. NYU Langone Health management will perfotm a similar review of prepaid expenses for the PRF -Reporting Period 2 submission and in that submission will adjust the total amount of reported expenditures down for the identified duplication. Timeline for Action Plan I The corrective action plan will be implemented as follows: NYU Langone Health management including Research Finance will immediately begin to monitor all prepaid amottizations to ensure that the original invoice is not duplicated with the amortized cost. In addition, when compiling future PRF-Reporting Period submissions, Financial Reporting will review the listing of all prepaid costs for the relevant period and ensure appropriate accounting occurred for any prepaid costs identified as related to COVID-19.
