Today, you can find many brands selling essential oils and aromatherapy. After all, essential oils have been used since ancient times in civilizations worldwide. However, not all of them are created equal. As someone who likes to use refreshing scents throughout the house (& for my own body), I've created a list of trusted brands that make essential oils with the best sustainably-sourced ingredients. My absolute favorite is lavender whenever I wind down from a long day and get ready for bed. As a little girl, my mom would put lavender next to my pillow if I couldn't sleep well. It always worked, so I've continued to use essential oils throughout my life to this day. 1) [Appalachian Botanical Co.](https://shop.appalachianbotanical.com) Since 2019, this West Virginian sustainable essential oil brand has grown lavender and raised bees on reclaimed coal mine land. It is incredible how they are creating new economic opportunities on this type of land while also employing people with limited options for decent-paying jobs. What's interesting is the fact lavender thrives on this type of rocky-soil land, making it the perfect crop. 2) [Bursera](https://bursera.com) This essential oil brand is the complete package. From sustainably-derived ingredients to ethical manufacturing, Bursera is taking aromatherapy to the next level. Plus, with every purchase, they plant a tree. Bursera has partnered with Trees for the Future to plant young trees across six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also are carbon-neutral and use 100% sustainable packaging. In addition to planting trees, they help ocean clean-ups and donate to 1% for the Planet! 3) [RE Botanicals](https://www.rebotanicals.com/product-category/relief-body-oil/) A little different spin on using essential oils. RE Botanicals mixes CBD with essential oils to give you some fantastic roll-on products. I use them in my everyday life and love them. RE Botanicals is the first national brand to sell U.S.-grown, USDA-certified organic hemp. All their products are grown, extracted, and bottled at their USDA organic farm in South Carolina. If you are new to using CBD oils, they are great for several things, from stress to depression and acne to pain. 4) [Thrive Market](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8074381/type/dlg/https://thrivemarket.com/search/results/?filter%5Bcategories%5D=426&filter%5Bsearch%5D=thrive%20essential%20oils&selected_facet=essential%20oils%20%26%20aromatherapy) Have you tried Thrive Market yet? It's one of my favorite places to buy sustainable food and beauty products. You can find great deals on many different products, and they have their own line of essential oils. Their line is crafted from the highest quality, organic, and non-GMO ingredients. The 'specially selected botanicals are harvested, sorted, and then gently extracted using steam distillation to reduce deterioration of the aroma'. They are a Certified B Corp, & for every membership, one is given to a family in need. 5) [Vitruvi](https://vitruvi.com) You may recognize this brand from social media. It's a pretty popular one, and their diffusers look amazing. Vitruvi is an expert in natural scenting. Using the founders' knowledge of botanicals and traditional blending methods, they have created sophisticated essential oil products for everyday life. Using non-toxic, all-natural, 100% pure essential oils, they expertly source and blend unique aromas to help you take ownership of your space. "}
