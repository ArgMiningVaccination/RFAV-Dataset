This is a holistic healthcare that emphasizes prevention and treatment of disease by creating balance between mind, body and spirit. The effectiveness of Chinese medicine relies on maintaining health and preventing disease by seeing the body as a whole and honoring the healing process by balancing physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.
