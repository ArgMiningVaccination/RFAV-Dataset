The childhood immunization schedule, or childhood vaccine schedule, is the list of common vaccines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends most children should receive. Immunization is a way to protect your child from getting many different infections and diseases. Many of these illnesses spread easily from child to child and can cause serious health problems. They can even cause death. The childhood immunization schedule is the list of common vaccines the CDC recommends most children should receive. When should my child get immunized? Your child should receive their first doses of most vaccines during their first two years of life. They may need several doses of the vaccines to reach full protection. For example, the CDC recommends children receive their first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months of age or older. They should then receive a second dose before entering elementary school (about 4 to 6 years of age). Your baby can get their childhood vaccines at their regularly scheduled [well-baby checkups](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22063-baby-development-milestones-safety). How many vaccines do children get? By the age of 15 months, your baby may receive up to 10 different types of vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all healthy babies receive these initial vaccines. Your child may receive additional doses and other vaccines between the ages of 15 months and 16 years old. If your child has a chronic condition or a weakened [immune system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21196-immune-system), their pediatrician may recommend a different schedule. What are the different types of vaccines? The following vaccines can help protect your child from serious infection or disease.

They'll receive their final dose six months after their first dose. Children who start the HPV vaccine before they turn 15 years old only need two doses, given six to 12 months apart.

Are the vaccines safe? Yes. Vaccines for childhood diseases are very safe. Sometimes, a vaccine will cause mild side effects such as a sore arm or leg or a low fever. A bad side effect isn't likely to happen. Childhood diseases are a greater health risk to children than vaccines are. Ask your child's healthcare provider to tell you about the risks and side effects. When shouldn't my child be vaccinated? In a few cases, it's better to wait to get a vaccine. Some children who are very sick shouldn't get a vaccine at all. Reasons your child should wait or not get a vaccine may include: - Being sick with something more serious than a [cold](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold). - Having a bad reaction after the first dose of a vaccine. - Having sudden jerky body movements (convulsions), possibly caused by a vaccine. Frequently Asked Questions What's the difference between immunization and vaccination? The words \"immunization\" and \"vaccination\" are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings. One term describes the specific action, and the other describes the process. According to the CDC, vaccination is the act of introducing a vaccine to give you immunity to a specific disease. The definition of immunization is the process by which vaccination protects you from a disease. A note from Cleveland Clinic The sight of your baby getting a shot may make you cry along with them. But getting your child vaccinated according to the childhood immunization schedule is the best way to protect them against many different infections and diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend following a specific immunization schedule. However, talk to your child's pediatrician to find out what works best for your child. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.
