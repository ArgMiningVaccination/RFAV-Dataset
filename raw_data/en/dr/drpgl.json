Redd, MD, MPH, FACP Santa Fe Indian Hospital Carol Dahozy , RN, MSN Phoenix Area IHS CDC Clinical Reminder: Use of Fingerstick Devices on More than One Person Poses Risk for Transmitting Bloodborne Pathogens 2010 - \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has become increasingly concerned about the risks for transmitting hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and other bloodborne pathogens to persons undergoing fingerstick procedures for blood sampling -- for instance, persons with diabetes who require assistance monitoring their blood glucose levels. Reports of HBV infection outbreaks linked to diabetes care have been increasing. This notice serves as a reminder that fingerstick devices should never be used for more than one person.\" 2 CDC Clinical Reminder: Use of Fingerstick Devices on More than One Person Poses Risk for Transmitting Bloodborne Pathogens (cont.) http://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety/Fingerstick -DevicesBGM.html 3 IHS Priorities To renew and strengthen the partnership with T ribes and improve the tribal consultation process. To bring reform to the IHS in the context of na tional health insurance reform. To improve the quality of and access to care. To have everything we do be as transparent, a ccountable, fair, and inclusive as possible. 4 Patient Safety \"First, Do No Harm\" - Safe Care Primum non nocere! -Hippocrates? 5 Utility of a Test 6 Utility of a Test (cont.) 7 Utility of a Test (more) 8 Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose: A Crucial Tool Aids in adjustment of therapeutic regimen in r esponse to blood glucose. Helps individuals adjust their dietary intake, ph ysical activity, and insulin doses to improve glycemic control. AACE , A DA, AADE 9 Where is Glucose Monitoring Taking Place? Q#1 10 Assisted Monitoring of Blood Glucose (AMBG ) Blood glucose monitoring performed for one or more persons by either a healthcare provider or other caregiver. Typically performed serially for multiple p ersons. Risk of infection transmission (HIV, HCV, H BV) if those performing AMBG fail to select the appropriate equipment and follow basic infection control. 11 AMBG : One Meter for Multiple People Therapeutic reasons Screening/Educational venues 12 Locations: Living Facilities Individual: Consider use by multiple family me mbers Living facilities: Group homes, nursing homes, priso ns, dorms, camps 13 Locations: Medical Venues Hospitals Clinics Physicians' offices: CLIA w Pharmacist -dir ected diabetes self- management and education programs 14 Other Locations Worksites: Screening, education, therapeutic de cision making Schools: Usually therapeutic decision making ( but student may have personal meter) Diabetes Education/Screening programs: M alls, convention centers, faith -based locations, community centers 15 Indirect Contact Transmission The transfer of an infectious agent (e.g., HBV ) from one patient to another through: A contaminated intermediate object Blood glucose meter Reusable f ingerstick devices Or person Healthcare personnel hands 16 Person -to-Person Transmission of Bloodborne Viruses (or Other Pathogens) During Blood Glucose Monitoring 17 Person -to-Person Transmission of Bloodborne Viruses (or Other Pathogens) During Blood Glucose Monitoring (cont.) 18 Indirect Transmission of HBV During Diabetes Care 19 Outbreaks of HBV infection associated with blood glucose monitoring - 1990 to 2010, US 20 Reported Outbreaks: Tip of an Iceberg Under- r eporting of cases Long incubation period for H BV (up to 6 months) Most (50 -7 0%) infections are asymptomatic Many persons go undiagnosed Under- r ecognition of healthcare as a risk for viral hepatitis Traditionally, thought to be rare events in the US 21 Reported Outbreaks: Tip of an Iceberg (cont.) Older adults have multiple healthcare e xposures Identification of a single healthcare encounter as t he venue of transmission is difficult Under- i nvestigation of cases Limited resources at health department level Time consuming, expensive (patient notification, s creening) 22 Can the Meter Really be a Source of Transmission? NC Nursing Home, 2003 Only single -u se lancets were used and insulin vials were not shared Single blood glucose meter was used for all p atients and was not routinely cleaned between patients 23 Can the Meter Really be a Source of Transmission (cont.) High prevalence of blood contamination of me ters Survey of 12 hospitals 609 blood glucose meters tested for presence of h emoglobin 30.2% (range 0 - 60. 6%) meters had blood contamination 31.4% for on-m eter vs. 26.6% for off -meter test strip dosing Multiple outbreak examples where f ingerstick devices were not shared 24 Practices Associated with HBV Transmission During Assisted Monitoring of Blood Glucose 25 An Emerging Problem: New Devices Q #2&3 26 CDC INFECTION PREVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS 27 Hand Hygiene Wear gloves during blood glucose monitoring (or any other procedure that involves potential exposure to blood or body fluids) Change gloves between patient contacts 28 Hand Hygiene (cont.) Change gloves that have touched potentially blood- contaminated objects or fingerstick wounds before touching clean surfaces. Perform hand hygiene immediately after removal of gloves and before touching other medical supplies intended for use on other patients. 29 Fingerstick Devices Fingerstick devices (including lancet and lancet holder devices) should NEVER be used for more than one person Facilities should select and use single -use, auto -disabling lancing devices for each patient http://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety/blood -glucose -monitoring.html Q4&5 30 Insulin Pens Must NEVER Be Used for More than One Person http://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety/clinical -reminders/insulin -pens.html 31 Blood Glucose Meters Whenever possible, blood glucose meters should be assigned to an individual patient and NOT be shared. If blood glucose meters must be shared, the device should be cleaned and disinfected after every use, per the manufacturer's instructions. 32 Blood Glucose Meters (cont.) Select a device intended for use in healthcare settings and capable of withstanding frequent cleaning and disinfection. If the manufacturer does not specify how the device should be cleaned and disinfected, then it should not be shared. 33 Summary: Education is Key Increase awareness of the history of outbreaks related to assisted monitoring of Blood Glucose and the CDC Infection Prevention Recommendations. Review Infection Control and FDA recommendations for infection prevention with Point -of-Care Blood Testing Devices in settings where multiple use may occur (not just nursing homes). Review Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of glucometers: Learn about the correct cleaning agents.

Testing should be carried out within the health care setting because of the need for follow -up and discussion of abnormal results. Some American Indian and Alaska Native communities feel that fingerstick screening is an important or useful strategy in their community based diabetes programs. If you perform community based fingerstick testing: Understand this is not a diagnostic test Understand the limitations of the use of fingerstick for screening Ensure that proper infection control practice is used Have mechanism for referrals for follow -up in a timely manner.
