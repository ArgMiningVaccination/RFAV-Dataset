It includes your nutritional status, metabolism, immune function, microbiomethe collection of microbes living on and within your body, environmental exposures, and other factors. You can think of your terrain as your garden. The minerals, microorganisms, water, and other aspects of soil can promote healthy growth and bountiful outputs, or they can get in the way of healthy growth. Your inner body terrain can similarly promote healthy cell and organ function\u2014or it can favor the unwanted \"weeds\" of cancer. Your body terrain can directly affect your tumor's microenvironment\u2014the noncancerous cells and tissues and their processes that directly interact with your tumor. Your tumor can change its own microenvironment, and its microenvironment can affect how a tumor grows and spreads. We focus on eight terrain factors with known links to cancer development, growth, and spread.

Other practices such as smoking or drinking alcohol are linked to many of these terrain factors and to cancer development and outcomes. We discuss these in this handbook. If you suspect you have a terrain imbalance or simply want to learn more about your status, ask your medical professional (oncologist or primary care practitioner) to order tests. Blood tests, urinalysis, or other tests can find imbalances. Integrative physician and CancerChoices advisor Keith Block, MD, lists tests for detecting specific terrain imbalances and how to partner with your physician to find and manage these imbalances.

Your oncology team may also use some conventionalthe cancer care offered by conventionally trained physicians and most hospitals; examples are chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy therapies to enhance your body terrain and make your tumor microenvironment less welcoming and supportive\u2014in short, less hospitable\u2014to cancer. You'll find entry points for all these options below. By itself, optimizing your body terrain is not enough to control or cure cancer. But it's an important complement to conventional treatments, extending the benefits of those treatments by reducing your risk of recurrence and improving your overall health.
