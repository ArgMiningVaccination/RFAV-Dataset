Authorize the Auditor -Controller to make necessary final adjustments and other technical adjustments as presented during the budget hearings and your Board's deliberations; 2. Adopt the Capital Improvement Plan for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 -2015 through FY 2018 - 2019; 3. Adopt the Resolutions approving the fees for the Emergency Medical Services District, Vector Control Services District, Fire Department Emergency Medical Services, Flood Control District, Clean Water Protection, Public Works Agency -administered Cou nty Service Areas (CSA), and Lead Abatement CSA as presented on June 23 and 24, 2014; and 4. Adopt the FY 2014 -2015 Final Budget. DISCUSSION/SUMMARY : The FY 2014 -2015 Final Budget, which incorporates adjustments approved by your Board during budget delib erations, is balanced. The Final Budget for all funds totals $2.79 billion and provides funding for 9,518 full -time equivalent positions. The General Fund Budget totals $2.31 billion and supports 7,648 full -time equivalent positions. The Budget closes a $67.1 million funding gap through a combination of spending reductions, revenue increases and Fiscal Management Reward (FMR) program savings. To the extent possible, your Board's Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) criteria have been used to propose COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR Honorable Board of Supervisors - 2 - June 27, 2014 ii reductions within each program area. The Final Budget eliminates six vacant full -time equivalent positions to help close the funding gap. The following table summarizes net cost reductions required to close the funding gap: General Fund Reductions Program Area Net County Cost Reductions (millions) Full-time Equivalent Position Reductions General Government* $ 19.2 0.00 Health Care $ 23.7 2.00 Public Assistance $ 5.6 4.00 Public Protection $ 18.6 0.00 Total $ 67.1 6.00 * includes cost reductions in Capital Projects and Internal Services Funds The Final Budget uses $17.4 million in ongoing strategies and $49.7 million in one -time solutions. Fiscal Management Reward (FMR) Program savings account for $36.5 million or 73% of the one -time strategies and 54% of all budget balancing strategies. Countywide Strategies The early signs of economic recovery enabled us to include growth in both program and discretionary revenues in the initial phases of budget development. The Proposed Budget includes one -time strategies to reduce internal service fund costs in both the self -insured risk management and dental insurance programs. While these programs and savings are budgeted and reflected in the General Government program area, the net cost reduc tion strategies are considered countywide as they will affect all County departments. Board Policy Directives As part of your Board's deliberations on the Proposed Budget, the following policy directives were advanced and endorsed by Board members: Emergency Stabilization Fund for the County Area Agency on Aging's (AAA) Contractor/Senior Services Providers (Attachment 1) Direct the Social Services Agency (SSA) and Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) directors to develop a strategy to earmark one -time only emergency stabilization funds for the community -based organizations that will provide senior services through the Alameda County Area Agency on Aging in FY 2014 -15; Discuss the proposed strategy at the July 28, 2014, Social Services Committee meeti ng; and Honorable Board of Supervisors - 3 - June 27, 2014 iii Direct SSA and HCSA to collaboratively develop an integrated long -term sustainable plan of service delivery to older adults and submit the plan to a joint meeting of the Social Services and Health Committees during FY 2014 -15. Emergency Shelter P rogram Emergency Stabilization Funding (Attachment 2) Direct the County Administrator (CAO) and SSA Director to determine the appropriate funding level needed to provide one -time emergency stabilization funding to maintain current bed levels for shelter p rograms that provide emergency shelter services to families with wrap -around services on -site; set a base level for one -time emergency funding at $336,000; and present this proposal at the next available Social Services Committee meeting. Direct SSA to w ork with HCSA, the Community Development Agency (CDA) Housing and Community Development department, and any other relevant departments to develop a report and policy recommendations on warming centers, emergency shelters, rapid re - housing, and affordable h ousing programs in the County and to present their findings to the Social Services Committee by September 22, 2014. AB 109 - Public Safety Realignment Community Capacity Fund (Attachment 3) Establish a Community Capacity Fund supported within the AB 109 allocation that would be designated to support the development of a capacity building program based on evidence -based practices to serve the AB 109 population; utilize best practice models and data analysis to inform and evaluate community programs; and provide financial support to build strong community -based programs. Direct the Chief Probation Officer and other County members of the Community Corrections Partnership (CCP) Executive Committe e to establish and designate $3 milli on within the FY 2014 -15 AB 109 allocation for a Community Capacity Fund and designate $3 million annually from the AB 109 allocations for FY 2015 -16 and FY 2016 - 17. Direct the CCP Executive Committee to work with the Community Advisory Board (CAB) and, after the State has approved the AB 109 allocation formula, report back to the Board of Supervisors with a proposed FY 2014 -15 expenditure plan including a request to formally establish and fund the Community Capacity Fu nd within the County's AB 109 allocation. Alameda County's Wall of Debt (Attachment 3) Direct the CAO and Auditor -Controller to develop a multi -year plan in consultation with the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association (ACERA) to begin reducing the County's unfunded pension liability of $1.2 billion starting in FY 2014 -15, using existing designations and reserves, and present the proposed plan to the full Board of Supervisors through the County Administrator's Finance Committee by October 31, 201 4. Honorable Board of Supervisors - 4 - June 27, 2014 iv Fund Development/Grants Management (Attachment 3) Direct the CAO to work with County department heads and legislative advocates, and report back through the Personnel, Administration and Legislation (PAL) Committee, to develop a plan to enhance and cen tralize the County's fund development/grants management program, identify resource requirements and propose a timeline for transition/implementation. STATE AND FEDERAL BU DGET IMPACTS/PENDING FACTORS On June 20, 2014, Governor Brown signed the State of C alifornia's FY 2014 -15 Final Budget, along with most of the accompanying trailer bills. The State's Budget prioritizes paying down debt and contributing to a \"Rainy Day\" fund. While the $108 billion General Fund budget represents a $7.3 billion increase compared to the FY 2013 -14 Budget, it allocates very little additional funding for County safety -net programs that have been cut significantly in recent years. Modest funding increases include a 5% grant increase to CalWORKs families effective April 2015 and $20 million in CalWORKs housing funds statewide to help prevent homelessness. The budget also repeals the current lifetime ban on receiving CalWORKs and Cal Fresh benefits for individuals formerly convicted of drug -related felonies, which will help some successfully transition back to their communities. The Budget also rejects proposed restrictions on overtime for In -Home Support Services (IHSS) workers. How ever, the State Budget retains a 7% across -the-board reduction to IHSS -approved hours. In addition, even though Medi -Cal enrollment is growing rapidly, doctors who take Medi -Cal clients will continue to receive reduced payments, resulting in fewer provide rs serving this population. Low income patients will continue to experience waiting lists and difficulty accessing health care services. While the State Budget includes $100 million to begin repaying local jurisdictions statewide for bearing the costs o f adhering to pre -2004 State mandates, it also adds to the list of suspended mandates by making certain election mandates discretionary such as maintaining a permanent vote-by-mail list and checking signatures on provisional ballots. By suspending mandate s, the State removes its obligation to reimburse counties for providing certain services that in many cases residents have grown accustomed to receiving. The FY 2014 -15 State Budget includes several public safety proposals, including $500 million in bond financing for jail construction projects and $125 million in SB 678 funding to provide incentives to reduce recidivism. However, public safety realignment funding from the State continues to be inadequate to support the costs of the services now provided at the local level. Moreover, the State failed to cap the length of time inmates may serve in county jails. Even though county jails are not designed or staffed for long -term inmates, in some cases individuals may now be sentenced to spend 10 to 20 or mo re years in our local jails. The State's reduction of indigent health funding may have a significant impact on Alameda County's ability to provide medical services to the estimated 100,000 individuals that will Honorable Board of Supervisors - 5 - June 27, 2014 v remain uninsured under the Affordable Care A ct. The major cut in 1991 realignment funding may not be offset by the cost savings the State estimates that our County health system will achieve due to national health reform. Counties are once again being forced to accept new program responsibilities without adequate funding and assume greater risks for future State and federal law changes and potentially adverse court actions. As your Board well knows, the State has often turned to local government to help solve its budget challenges. Since FY 1992 -93 when the State imposed a shift of local property taxes to help meet its funding obligations to schools, Alameda County has transferred $5 billion in local discretionary funds to the State. In the coming year, it is estimated that Alameda County will be required to transfer an additional $355 million in local property taxes to the State. The latest funding shifts are coming even though the State is currently benefitting from higher income tax and sales tax revenues provided by voter -approved Propositio n 30 and by an improved economy. However, Proposition 30's higher tax rates are temporary - the quarter -cent sales tax increase expires in 2016 and the higher income tax rate expires in 2018. Moreover, as the country approaches the five and a half year a verage length of growth following a recession since World War II, another economic downturn is a certainty at some point. We must be very mindful of the additional responsibilities that the State continues to impose on counties knowing that the temporary taxes and higher revenues will expire in 2018. At the federal level, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that if current laws do not change, the federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year will be $492 billion, less than half of the $1 trilli on annual deficits of a few years ago. Perhaps more importantly, the deficit is also considerably lower relative to the size of the economy, currently 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) compared to 9.8% in 2009. However, if current laws do not change, increased federal costs due to an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and the growing interest payments on the federal debt will result in a return of annual deficits exceeding $1 trillion by 2022. Absent an extension of the current bipartisan budget deal or a new agreement, automatic sequestration cuts will return after FY 2015, with corresponding cuts to local funding. HUMAN IMPACTS The FY 2014 -2015 Proposed Budget document includes a seri es of updated reports that describes different safety net services, the population receiving each service, the changes in funding and services in recent years, and any proposed adjustments. Each of these \"Human Impact\" reports also provides the personal s tories of some of our program recipients. The reports were produced collaboratively by the Board of Supervisors, the Health Care Services Agency, Social Services Agency, General Services Agency, County Administrator's Office, community - based organizations and service recipients. The human impacts reports will also be included in the FY 2014 -2015 Final Budget document. As events change, the County will update the reports and hold additional hearings on the effects of adopted policies and pending proposals on our County residents. Honorable Board of Supervisors - 6 - June 27, 2014 vi Partnerships and Collaborations Partnerships and collaboration continue to drive creative service delivery methods that maximize resources and enhance effective coordination between departments and agencies, community - based orga nizations, labor and other stakeholders. These collaborations include: The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Corps program managed by our Public Health Department is a highly selective, rigorous academy that trains aspiring emergency medical professionals from the community. This program works closely with community partners - including Alameda Health System (AHS), Bay Emergency Medical Technicians, Paramedics Plu s and Royal Ambulance - to pay and train young emergency medical technicians through youth development, mentorship, and job training. The program is a national model that targets young men, ages 18 to 26, to help them become competent and successful medic al providers. The County's Public Works Agency and Flood Control District work with the California Department of Transportation and Oakland -based Civicorps in a unique collaboration providing roadside and flood control vegetation and debris removal. Civicorps , an accredited high school diploma and job training provider in the East Bay, employs and trains young adults ages 18 to 24 who have dropped out of school and are in need of job skills. The program has an impressive track record for transitioning y oung adults to college and/or productive employment. The County's Open Data Initiative led by the Information Technology Department is a key tool in engaging and educating our residents and communities about County government. In May, the County again te amed with public and private partners including technology firms Esri and Socrata to host the third in a series of hackathons branded as Apps Challenge to encourage community and youth collaboration in coding and designing mobile applications. Last fall, more than 100 County employees participated in the County's first all-employee hackathon called Rethink AC and another is planned for September. Several employee -spawned initiatives to improve operations - including new mobile apps and automated payment a nd client notification systems - have already been implemented by the County. The County's Sustainability Initiative and Climate Action Plan continue to provide a platform for collaboration among County agencies and departments and with our public, privat e and regional partners. - The innovative Regional Renewable Energy Procurement (R -REP) program valued at $131 million is a national model of collaboration among 19 Bay Area public agencies to further expand the generation of renewable energy at substantially lower costs. The Board recently approved contracts with solar energy firms Solar City and SunEdison , taking a major step toward seeing many renewable energy projects beginning this fall . Honorable Board of Supervisors - 7 - June 27, 2014 vii - Preparation for the widespread use of electric vehicles expands through implementation of two collaborative initiatives: the Bay Area Electric Vehicle (EV) Corridor Project, which is installing 40 EV charging stations across Alameda County, and the Local Government EV Fleet Demonstration Project, which is adding 90 all -electric vehicles and 90 EV charging stations across 10 Bay Area jurisdictions. The County's Project SEARCH program continues to provide valuable work experience for individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities, in collaboration with the non-profit East Bay Innovations . Numerous County agencies provide internships to Project SEARCH participants, boosting a program that has led to permanent employment for more than 20 program graduates since Alameda County launched the first -ever public sector Project SEARCH program. Innovative justice programs like the Veterans' Court and Realignment Court continue to expand. The Veterans' Treatment Court is intended to address the u nderlying issues of veterans that lead to criminal activity by linking them to appropriate services with the assistance of a Veterans' Court Coordinator. The Realignment Court provides centralized adjudication services for persons charged with Post -Releas e Community Supervision parole violations based on a partnership between our County public protection departments, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) , and the Superior Court. Under the leadership of the District Attorney (DA), the fight against human trafficking and the commercial, sexual exploitation of children continues and has now gained national momentum. This year, the DA's Office launched a Billboard Campaign , a partnership with MISSSEY (Motivating, Inspiring, Suppo rting and Serving Sexually Exploited Youth) , Clear Channel Communications , and a group of volunteer professionals . Creative messaging on billboards and bus stop shelters raises awareness about human trafficking and provides resource information to traffick ing victims. The campaign has already been replicated in other counties and drawn State and national recognition. The DA's recent initiative to ensure that Rape Kits are processed timely has also drawn national support with over $40 million in new grant funding included in the proposed federal budget at the request of the President and our Congressional delegation. The Year Ahead Although funds are limited and State and federal revenues have been curtailed, the improving local economy has allowed for modest service increases and infrastructure upgrades. In the upcoming fiscal year the County is able to fund a range of services and programs to improve the lives of County residents and lessen some of the human impacts of several years of budgetary cutba cks. Among them: Construction of the nine-story Highland Acute Care Tower - the County's largest ever capital project - is moving toward its 2017 completion date as we reach the final phases of a multi -year $668 million upgrade of the Highland Hospital campus of the Alameda Honorable Board of Supervisors - 8 - June 27, 2014 viii Health System (AHS) in Oakland. The project's first p hase, the LEED Gold rated Highland Care Pavilion, opened in 2013, the latest in a series of projects that has enhanced Alameda County's reputation as a leader in the construction of \"green\" government buildings. The San Lorenzo Library has moved to a temp orary location while work is progressing on a $9.4 million remodel of the facility. The upgrade, scheduled for completion in 2015, will almost double the size of the original Library and add more public meeting space. The essential health services fundin g that has been provided through voter -approved Measure A for both the Alameda Health System and the County will continue through 2034 following strong voter approval in June 2014 of Measure AA , which extended the \u00bd cent sales tax. Over $1 billion in sal es tax revenues have been dedicated to essential health services in our communities since Measure A was first approved by the voters in March 2004. The major renovation of a former office building at Peralta Oaks in Oakland is on track to be completed at the end of this year. It will co -locate the Coroner's Bureau and Public Health Lab, relocating from downtown Oakland, and the Crime Lab, moving from the Eden Township Station, to an updated facility. Our Climate Executive Team led by department heads an d key County staff is finalizing a second series of sustainability projects aiming to keep the County on track for its ambitious long -term goals to reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions. To complement our award -winning fleet of electric and hybrid veh icles, the County is adding infrastructure to encourage alternative and sustainable modes of employee transportation. Free parking is offered for some carpools and several bicycles will soon be added to the transportation fleet , allowing employees an alternative to travel by bicycle to local off -site meetings in lieu of checking out County motor pool cars. The new \"AlcoBike\" program also offers employees secure bicycle storage facilities. The third year of Public Safety Realig nment sees Alameda County embarking on major new initiatives to ensure that the County can maximize its effectiveness in helping formerly incarcerated individuals transition effectively back into the community. Renovation plans for a multi -service Transit ion and Day Reporting Center at 400 Broadway in Oakland are underway. The facility will be open year -round and will incorporate a full array of programs, services, treatments and resources to support successful re -entry and reduce recidivism. The long -awaited East County Hall of Justice in Dublin, funded with State bonds and local revenues dedicated to this $111 million project, will be under construction this fall after over a decade of planning, negotiations and approvals. A Design/Build contract was awarded to Hensel Phelps based on the bridging design by KMD Architects. When completed in spring 2017, the two -building complex will include a new Superior Court Honorable Board of Supervisors - 9 - June 27, 2014 ix of California courthouse with 13 courtrooms and offices for the District Attorney, Public D efender and Probation Department. Workforce development continues to be a priority countywide initiative with the SSA leading several key efforts in the coming year including: - Reforming the Career Centers in North, Central and South County , which includes implementing the use of an employer/job seeker database that will automate the matching process between available jobs and appropriate applicants based on education and work experience; - Increasing the resources available for wage subsidies in a continued effort to incentivize hiring, as well as provide additional financial resources to support local job creation ; and - Engaging the County's largest employers and procurers of goods in an \"anchor institution\" strategy to identify rep lacement jobs and supply chains. Building on the Vision 2016 Initiative and the County's strategic vision , we continue to plan for the future, anticipating changes in our environment, technology, workforce and workspace. The recently launched Millennial Initiative will engage our diverse multi - generational workforce in cross -sector teams to address a myriad of issues ranging from technology to innovation and entrepreneurship to leadership development. Youth initiatives like our New Beginnings Fellowship and leadership academies continue to thrive as we strive to attract, train and retain the next generation of workers to public service. Closing remarks During the economic downturn, your Board made difficult decisions - including reducing our workforce and operations - to preserve core services and avoid some of the severe fiscal problems that other jurisdictions experienced. Now with improved economic conditions, your Board has again demonstrated strong leadership in adopting a balanced budget, while a dhering to your financial management policies and making strategic investments to maintain core programs and services; to support our diverse workforce and communities; to upgrade our infrastructure; and to protect our fiscal integrity and financial sustai nability. Your commitment to looking ahead and planning for the future will help to ensure that Alameda County remains a statewide and national leader in innovation and collaboration, economic and workforce development, and community engagement and invest ment. Nobody knows how long improved economic conditions will last, or if the State's fiscal health will remain stable, but the leadership and commitment from many to work together for the common good has provided a solid foundation to support Alameda Cou nty's mission and vision. Once again, I extend my gratitude to all Agency and Department Heads for their ongoing efforts to curtail expenditures in anticipation of the coming budget year and for their significant Honorable Board of Supervisors - 10 - June 27, 2014 x contributions toward achieving a balanced budget. I also would like to acknowledge the guidance and support of the Budget Workgroup members. And, finally, I would like to thank your Board for the strong support and leadership you have provided during the FY 2014 -2015 budget process, as well as your ongoing commitment to an open and inclusive process that has involved all stakeholders. Very truly yours, /s/ Susan S. Muranishi County Administrator SSM Attachments c: Agency/Department Heads Budget Workgroup Legislative Advocates Labor Representatives Community -Based Organizations Boards and Commissions Attachment 1 xi xii Attachment 2 xiii xiv xv xvi xvii June 10, 2014 Honorable Board of Supervisors Administration Building Oakland, California 94612 SUBJECT: FISCAL YEAR 2014 -2015 PROPOSED BUDGET Dear Board Members: The County Administrator's Proposed Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 -2015 is balanced and provides $2.8 billion in spending for County programs and services. The Budget reflects input from your Board, agency and department heads, and other County stakehol ders to close a $67.1 million funding shortfall, the County's lowest deficit in seven years. The Budget does not propose layoffs or significant program reductions. By most measures, the national economy continues to improve, with particularly strong g rowth in the Bay Area. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages and benefits in the nine-county region rose more over the past year than in any other major metropolitan area in the United States. Alameda County's unemployment rate recently dropped below 6% for the first time since before the recession. Perhaps recognizing greater opportunity, Alameda County is attracting more residents and is one of the fastest growing counties in the region and State, with a population of almost 1.6 milli on people . Alameda County's population grew by 1.5% last year, making it and Santa Clara County the two fastest growing counties in the State. The City of Dublin, one of Alameda County's 14 cities, was the third -fastest growing city in California last year, increasing its population by 7.1%. The improving economy, low interest rates and greater demand have led to rising real estate values. Median home prices, which had lost close to half their value during the recession, have almost returned to their previous peaks, and foreclosures have declined dramatically. Reflecting higher real estate values, the Alameda County Assessment Roll increased 5.2% for FY 2013 -14. Although still lower growth than the pre -recession average, the increase is welcome follo wing the $7 billion in local government property tax revenue that was lost statewide during the recession, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office. Sales taxes are also increasing, an indication of greater consumer confidence and a brighter economic outlook in Alameda County than in recent years. COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR xviii Honorable Board of Supervisors - 2 - June 10, 2014 Unfortunately, the economic recovery has not benefitted everyone equally. Taking into account the cost of living, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation at 23.8%. In Alameda County, there are more than 50 neighborhoods with poverty rates t hat exceed 25%, and historically high numbers of families, adults, and children currently receive safety -net services. Recognizing that in spite of the country's great wealth, poverty persists unabated, on January 7, 2014, your Board adopted a resolution launching a \"New War on Poverty\" to raise awareness and seek solutions. In addition, the County continues to shine a spotlight on the people most affected by cumulative State budget reductions. These \"human impacts\" are again included in a special secti on of the Proposed Budget. STATE BUDGET Governor Brown deserves credit for returning the State's finances to more stable footing. Even with State revenues now exceeding previous forecasts by several billion dollars, the Governor maintains a cautious ap proach, citing a list of higher spending obligations that offset new revenues. Moreover, the revenue increases come largely from the State's most volatile revenue source: income taxes from capital gains. Stock market gains of almost 30% in 2013 are unlik ely to be duplicated. Rather than investing in new programs or restoring prior cuts, Governor Brown proposes a strong Rainy Day Fund that would pay off debt and build up reserves for the next economic downturn. The Governor's Budget also includes a new p roposal to shore up the underfunded teachers' pension retirement system. While now is not the time for massive new spending, given the hardship that State cuts have had on the most vulnerable members of our community, the State could consider restoring some of the cuts to poverty -fighting programs like CalFresh, subsidized chil dcare, and housing assistance for CalWORKs recipients. In addition, the State's transfer of many public safety programs to local government continues to pose new challenges, including the fact that County jails were not designed to house inmates for exten ded sentences. A California State Sheriff's Association survey reveals that over 1,700 inmates in County jails statewide are serving sentences of five years or longer. Even with public safety realignment, the State has not been able to comply fully with a federal court order to reduce overcrowding in California's prisons. Restoring planned cuts to public safety realignment funding and modest funding increases for programs targeted at reducing recidivism would serve the common goal of reducing prison and jail admissions. The Governor does propose a long -overdue acceleration of reimbursements to local governments for State -imposed mandates. Unfortunately, the Legislature appears eager to use the $100 million the Governor proposes returning to local govern ments in FY 2014 -15 as a means of paying for new investments in programs. The State should restore its own cuts to important programs, but not on the backs of local governments. The repayment of these mandates would help not only local governments but al so assist the State's goal of paying down its \"Wall of Debt.\" xix Honorable Board of Supervisors - 3 - June 10, 2014 HEALTH CARE REFORM California has been a leader in implementing national health care reform, and far higher numbers of Californians are signing up for health coverage than previously expected. The Governor's May Revise nearly doubles its enrollment estimates for the optiona l Medi -Cal expansion the State launched last year. Projected enrollments next year among those previously eligible to sign up for Medi -Cal have increased dramatically as well. Approximately 11.5 million Californians are projected to be on Medi -Cal in FY 2014 -15, almost a third of the State's population. Last year the State adopted a major new realignment of health and public assistance programs to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The State redirected $300 million statewide from county health dep artments to implement the State -administered Medi -Cal expansion program and to fund an increased local share of cost requirements for public assistance programs like CalWORKs and CalFresh. Alameda County's share of 1991 realignment funding for indigent health was cut by $11 million in FY 2013 -14. In FY 2014 -15, Governor Brown proposes redirecting $725 million statewide, which would strip out all of Alameda County's $44 million in 1991 realignment funding for indigent health. The loss of revenue will redu ce the Alameda Health System's contract for indigent health services, resulting in significant challenges for the public hospital system that serves vulnerable populations, including those least likely to benefit from coverage expansion under the ACA. To lessen the impact, the Proposed Budget adds $9.4 million in County General Fund support for primary care community -based providers, continuing for a full year the funding your Board approved for the current year. The shift of 1991 realignment funding cont inues to raise significant concerns about the ongoing cost to counties of providing services to those individuals not covered by the expansion. In Alameda County, an estimated 100,000 people may still be uninsured and will require County indigent health c are services. In addition, the transfer of projected cost savings comes in spite of the fact that the federal government will fully reimburse the State for its costs for the first three years of the optional Medi -Cal expansion. Glitches in the State's i mplementation of the ACA have had significant impacts on the Social Services Agency \u2014which is responsible for ACA implementation in Alameda County \u2014as well as applicants and health care providers. Ongoing problems with the State's computer system have creat ed a backlog of over 40,000 applications that Alameda County staff must review one - by-one. The Social Services Agency is currently prioritizing these cases while balancing new applications and processing Medi -Cal renewals for approximately 20,000 individu als per month. Applicants face uncertainty regarding whether they have Medi -Cal insurance coverage, while healthcare providers do not know whether they will receive reimbursements for serving pending applicants. xx Honorable Board of Supervisors - 4 - June 10, 2014 BUDGET OVERVIEW The FY 2014 -15 Proposed Budget for all funds totals $2.8 billion, an increase of $86.7 million, or 3.2%, from the FY 2013 -14 Final Budget. The General Fund, which funds most County operations, totals $2.3 billion, an increase of $53.5 million, or 2.4%. All Funds ($ billions) 2013 -14 Final 2014 -15 MOE 2014 -15 Proposed Change from 2013 -14 Appropriation $2.69 $2.80 ($ billions) 2013 -14 Final 2014 -15 MOE 2014 -15 Proposed Change from 2013 -14 Appropriation $2.26 $2.32 Budget includes funding to provide mandated and essential services, meet debt service obligations, maintain a minimum level of infrastructure and capital funding, and adhere to the Board's financial management policies. The Proposed Budget supports a workforce of almost 9,500 full -time equivalent (FTE) positions and reflects a net increase of 297 FTE. This includes mid -year Board -approved adjustments of 303 positions, offset by the elimination of 6 vacant FTE as part of budget balancing. The Proposed Budget funds cost -of-living adjustments (COLAs) for most of our employees based on negotiated labor agreements, and for many of our community -based organization (CBO) contractors. The Proposed Budget a lso includes $459.4 million for services provided by 242 CBOs, a decrease of $48 million from FY 2013 -14. The funding reduction is due to a decline in State funding for indigent health services under the presumption that most of those enrolled in indigent health programs will receive federally -supported or other subsidized health care insurance coverage under the ACA. The Health Care Services Agency's contracts with Alameda Health System (AHS) and various clinics to provide indigent health care services a re reduced as a result. AHS is budgeted to receive $77.3 million for these services, compared to $131 million in FY 2013 -14. Other CBOs funded in the Proposed Budget include non -profit service providers, cities, school districts, and local hospitals. A list of all CBO contracts with funding recommendations is included in the Appendix of the Proposed Budget document. xxi Honorable Board of Supervisors - 5 - June 10, 2014 Measure A, the voter -approved half -cent sales tax, continues to provide funding for essential health care services. AHS receives 75% of the revenue directly and the remaining 25% is allocated by the Board of Supervisors to support other essential health services. The Proposed Budget includes $28.7 million in Measu re A funds for non -AHS essential health services, a decrease of approximately $0.45 million or 1.5%, compared to the FY 2013 -14 budget based on the three year Measure A spending plan adopted by your Board. Recognizing the importance of this funding source , on June 3, 2014, voters supported Measure AA, extending the half cent sales tax dedicated to essential health care through 2034. Board -approved funding of $15.9 million for capital projects supported with General Fund property tax revenues is included i n the Proposed Budget. Prior to the State's dissolution of redevelopment agencies in February 2012, these discretionary property tax revenues had been committed to redevelopment projects in the County and many of our cities. The increase in capital proje ct funding is consistent with your Board's decision to allocate for five years up to $18 million annually of former redevelopment agency property tax increment to fund certain infrastructure and capital projects in the unincorporated areas of the County. Consistent with your Board's financial management policies, the Proposed Budget recommends increases of $5.6 million, the equivalent of 1% of discretionary revenue, for both capital projects and the general reserve. Contingencies for pending labor negotia tions, benefit cost increases, and other contractual obligations are also included in the Proposed Budget. CLOSING THE GAP The Proposed Budget closes a $67.1 million funding gap that was projected based on the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funding requirement. The funding gap was determined by identifying the difference between the cost of maintaining existing programs and projected revenues. The MOE Budget for the General Fund is $2.32 billion, an increase of $67.7 million, or 3.0%. Available re venues to finance the projected MOE costs totaled $2.26 billion, an increase of just $0.6 million, or 0.03%. To the extent possible, your Board's Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) priorities and Strategic Vision initiatives have been considered in developing balancing strategies within each program area. The table below summarizes the total proposed net cost reductions by program area: PROPOSED BUDGET BALANCING General Fund Program Area Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) General Government* 19.2 Health Care 23.7 Public Assistance 5.6 Public Protection 18.6 Total $67.1 * includes cost reductions in Capital Projects and Internal Service Funds xxii Honorable Board of Supervisors - 6 - June 10, 2014 Proposed solutions to close the $67.1 million funding gap include a combination of spending reductions, revenue increases, and one -time strategies. The Proposed Budget recommends the use of $17.4 million or 26% in ongoing strategies and $49.7 million or 74% in one -time strategies, with most of the one -time savings coming from the Fiscal Management Reward Program (FMR). The FMR net savings have been generated through the efforts of County agencies/departments to operate their programs efficiently and effectively within budget, to avoid further program and staffing reductions and preserve vital services. FMR is considered a one -time funding source as these savings may not be available to assist with balancing budgets in future years. A structural imbalance between ongoing revenues and expendit ures remains. Proposed Budget Balancing Strategies Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) Ongoing Strategies Program appropriation reductions $9.8 Program revenue increases $7.6 Subtotal Ongoing Strategies $17.4 One-Time Strategies Fiscal Management One-time revenues $8.7 Strategies $49.7 Grand Total Balancing Strategies $67.1 PROGRAM AREA NET COS T REDUCTIONS General Government (including Internal Service Funds and Capital Projects) - The General Government program area contributed net cost savings of $19.2 million through $5.1 million in Internal Service Fund savings in the County's self -insured general liability and dental programs; revenue increases of $2.8 million; and $11.3 million in FMR program savings. Health Care - The Health Care Services Agency contributed net cost savings of $23.7 million through $3.3 million in appropriation reductions, $6.4 million in i ncreased revenue, and $14.0 million in FMR Program savings. The spending reductions include $0.2 million from eliminating two vacant Public Health positions; $0.5 million cut to the Alameda Health System (AHS) indigent care contract; lowering community -based contracts by $0.7 million due to program completion and underutilization; a $0.6 million drop in Public Health diagnostic and therapy program, lab and equipment costs; a $1.0 million cost reduction in in -patient mental health services; and $0.3 million in other adjustments. Revenue increases include $3.1 million in Behavioral Care Medi -Cal funding; a $1.0 million in Mental Health Services Act funding; a $0.8 million in Environmental Health program revenue; the one -time use of $1.0 million of Tobacco Ma ster Settlement Fund revenue; and $0.5 million in one -time Measure A funds to support CBO contracts. xxiii Honorable Board of Supervisors - 7 - June 10, 2014 Public Assistance - The Public Assistance program area achieved net cost savings of $5.6 million, including $2.1 million in FMR program savings contributed by the Social Services Agency. In addition, revised projections of caseload declines in the foster care program resu lt in net savings of $1.9 million (reduced appropriations of $3 million, partly offset by reduced revenue of $1.1 million) plus about $0.4 million achieved by eliminating four vacant, project positions. Revenue increases from Fraud Recovery incentives and the CalFresh program account for $1.2 million in net cost savings. Public Protection - The Public Protection program area achieved net cost savings of $18.6 million through $2.4 million in appropriations reductions, $7.2 million in revenue increases, and over $9 million of FMR Program savings. Balancing strategies in the Sheriff's Office include a $1.6 million reduction in discretionary operating costs, a $0.8 million decrease in capital equipment expenses, and increased revenues of $2.6 million for inca rceration services provided to Sonoma County. FMR Program savings contributed by the District Attorney's Office, Probation Department, and Public Defender's Office, as well as Proposition 172 Public Safety sales tax revenue from a prior year designation f urther reduce the net cost of Public Protection programs. FISCAL MANAGEMENT RE WARD (FMR) PROGRAM S AVINGS Your Board's FMR Program allows General Fund departments to carry -over net savings each fiscal year to be used in subsequent years for budget balancing, one -time expenditures and program enhancements. Through ongoing cost -saving and revenue generation effo rts, County agencies/departments contributed $36.5 million in prior -year FMR savings to help balance the FY 2014 -15 budget. Program Area Use of FMR ($ millions) General Government $11.3 Health Care $14.0 Public Assistance $2.1 Public Protection $9.1 Total FMR $36.5 Ongoing efforts by County departments to reduce spending and conserve resources have enabled the County to mitigate major program reductions and maintain vital services. However, departments must balance these efforts with the need to fund increased costs and meet the growing demand for essential services in all program areas. xxiv Honorable Board of Supervisors - 8 - June 10, 2014 COUNTYWIDE STRATEGIE S In past years, it has sometimes been necessary to recommend countywide strategies that are not unique to a particular program area to help balance the budget. This year, the early signs of economic recovery enabled us to include growth in both program and discretionary revenues in the initial phases of budget development. The Proposed Budget includes one -time strategies to reduce Internal Service Fund costs in both the self -insured risk management and dental insurance programs. While these programs and s avings are budgeted and reflected in the General Government program area, the net cost reduction strategies are considered countywide as they will affect all County departments. PENDING FACTORS Numerous factors could impact the County's ability to prov ide services within existing resources in future years. The health of the economy affects the demand for the County's services as well as the revenues to pay for those services. After five consecutive years of modest growth, the Gross Domestic Product (G DP) declined in the first quarter of 2014. While probably more due to unusually harsh winter conditions in most of the rest of the country than indicative of a larger trend, better economic conditions will not last forever. The average length of a growth period in the Post -War era is five and a half years - similar to the County's funding gap trend over the last two decades. Events that could put the U.S. or world economies in recession include: the Federal Reserve's tapering of its bond purchasing progr am, tight lending from banks, slowing economic growth in China, the European economy, and/or the impact of conflicts around the world. With about half of the County's funding coming from the State and federal governments, policy decisions in Sacramento an d Washington, D.C. have a significant impact on the County. The State's shift of 1991 realignment funding for indigent health care brings greater uncertainty to counties already grappling with how to provide services to those who remain without health ins urance coverage. In spite of surging and higher -than-expected enrollment in Medi -Cal, the Governor has not proposed additional funding for provider payments, making it difficult to attract medical professionals to meet the growing caseload. Absent higher State funding for providers, accessing health care services will remain a challenge for many. Due to the unknown impacts of health care reform and other State cost shifts, the current year budget included a one -time designation of $12 million set aside f or future budget balancing. Most of that $12 million has now been allocated to assist health care programs with the transition to the ACA - primary care community -based contract agencies, the Alameda Alliance for Health and other indigent care providers. The Proposed Budget does not include continuation of that designation as there is a $9.4 million recommended increase to the health care budget to address ongoing needs of the community - based provider network under the ACA. xxv Honorable Board of Supervi sors - 9 - June 10, 2014 ALAMEDA COUNTY'S WALL OF DEBT Governor Brown's proposals to set aside excess State revenues for a \"rainy day\" and pay off the State's \"Wall of Debt\" have received headlines across the State and support for fiscal prudence and long-term financial stability. While your Board has general ly adhered to your long -standing financial management policies that include strategies and guidelines to build and maintain prudent reserves and \"rainy day\" funds, the County still has its own unfunded obligations that must be addressed eventually. Alameda County's \"Wall of Debt\" now totals almost $3 billion - about $1.2 billion represents pension costs for current and future retirees. In addition, the County has incurred $600 million of debt related to construction of the Acute Care Tower Replacement project for the Alameda Health System (AHS) and still has outstanding pension obligation bond debt that exceeds $450 million. Other debt includes the County's shared ownership of the Oakland -Alameda County Coliseum/Arena with over $100 million in outstand ing bonds and other prior capital commitments for essential facilities like the Juvenile Justice Center and Santa Rita Jail. Alameda County \"Wall of Debt\" Unfunded pension liability $1.2 billion Acute Care Tower debt $607 million Pension Obligation Bond debt $452 million Coliseum/Arena debt ( County share) $102 million Compensated Employee Absences Payable $63.1 million Other debt (Juvenile Justice, Santa Rita, etc.) $500 million Total Outstanding Debt $2.92 billion The debt incurred by the County for capital improvements has always been based on sound financial plans that identify ongoing revenue sources to retire the debt over time and ensure that the County is still able to maintain its core services and other mandated commitments. The Pr oposed Budget includes over $50 million for annual debt service payments, plus the County's annual required contributions (ARC) to the pension fund through the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association (ACERA). However, given the trend toward an im proved economy and the possibility of more discretionary revenues as sales and property tax collections improve, plus the County's ability to now retain property tax increment formerly allocated to city and county redevelopment agencies, it is an opportune time for your Board to consider developing a responsible and prudent plan to reduce the County's long -term debt obligations. Paying down the County's Wall of Debt will limit our liabilities, reduce the cost of annual principal and interest payments, furt her strengthen our credit ratings, and enable us to plan for a more sustainable future. The financial implications of current and future federal and State cost shifts, continued funding reductions, pending local negotiations with labor groups and health p lan carriers, and uncertainty regarding costs of public safety realignment, health care reform and a host of other issues, underscores the need to start the new fiscal year with a balanced budget that is fiscally sound. Your Board will again be faced with difficult decisions as you continue to provide the strong leadership necessary to maintain the County's fiscal integrity and provide vital services to our residents and those in need. xxvi Honorable Board of Supervisors - 10 - June 10, 2014 RECOMMENDATIONS The FY 2014 -15 Proposed Budget is balanced and reflects the collective effort and contributions of County stakeholders to develop a balanced and sustainable approach to providing services in the coming year. In addition, balancing the bud get using a significant amount of one -time funds will necessitate careful monitoring throughout the year to ensure that expenditures remain within budget and revenue estimates are fully realized. As you conduct public hearings and deliberate on the FY 201 4-15 Proposed Budget, your Board's leadership and strong fiscal management will assist the County in once again maintaining that critical balance between service demands and limited financial resources. Therefore, it is recommended that your Board: 1. Accept the FY 2014 -15 Proposed Budget for review pending public hearings; 2. Set public hearings on the Proposed Budget to commence on June 23, 2014 at 1:30 p.m. as outlined in the Attachment; and 3. Schedule public hearings and/or public meetings to consider charges for the Emergency Medical Services District, Vector Control Services District, Fire Department Emergency Medical Services, Flood Control District, Clean Water Protection, Public Works Agency - administered County Service Areas, and Lead Abatement as detailed in the attached budget hearing schedule.

The County was formed from the ter ritory of two counties created in 1850: Contra Costa and Santa Clara. It was given the local name for the region, Alameda, which translated loosely as \"a grove of poplars. \" The County 's 813 square miles encompass a varied geography ranging from bay wetla nds to rolling open spaces to hillside lakes and streams. Alameda is the seventh most populous county in California, and has 14 incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities. The total population is estimated to be 1,573,254 as of January 20 14, a 1.5% increase from a year ago. Oakland is the seat of County government and the largest city. Source: California Department of Finance, January 2014 Alameda County is characterized by rich diversity and culture. Population growth has occurred with the natural net increase of births over deaths, but also from substantial immigration, and Alameda County is now one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the Bay Area and the nation. Based on the 2010 Census, 31% of the population is foreign bor n. There is no majority racial or ethnic group in Alameda County. According to the California Department of Education, 57 languages were spoken by English language learners in the K -12 public school systems in Alameda County in 2012 -2013.

The unem ployment rate has dropped to 5.6 % in Alameda County as of May 2014, an improvement from the double -digit levels of a few years ago, and better than California 's 7.1% rate and the 6.1 % rate nationwide. However, many labor experts contend the drop is at least partly attributable to people dropping out of the labor force as t hey give up looking for work and to those who have had to settle for part-time jobs. ALAMEDA COUNTY UNEMP LOYMENT RATE Source: California Employment Development Department Accordin g to the U.S. Census Bureau , Alameda County 's median annual household income in 2012 was $71,516 with an average household size of 2.75 persons.

Alameda County median home values have increased significantly over the past fe w years and are nearing the peak of $619,000 in August 2007. The assessed value of property determines how much property taxes the County receives. Until four years ago, the assessment roll had grown each year since the 1950s. After two years of decline s followed by two years of modest growth , the Fiscal Year ( FY) 2013 -14 assessment roll posted an increase of 5.2 %. In many year s the assessment roll grows by 8 % or even 10% or more, providing much -needed revenues to support programs. About 90% of Alameda County 's discretionary revenue comes from property taxes, although the County receives only 15% of the property tax collected.

The discretionary revenue, which is primarily property tax based, represents the amount over which the Board has some discretion to allocate. The amount of discretionary revenue the County receives represents a small sha re of the total budget, $560.4 million, or about 2 4% of the General Fund budget or 2 0% of all funds. Due to State shifts of funding, in recent years Alameda County has received only about 15 cents of each property tax dollar collected in the County. With the State of California 's dissolution of redevelopment agencies effective February 1, 2012, property taxes that otherwise would have been allocated to redevelopment agencies will over time be allocated to other local entities, including Alameda County, but the amount or percentage is unknown at this time. * Over time, redevelopment agencies ' share of property taxes should be distributed to the other entities Use of FMR, $36.5 (2%) Program Revenue, $1,691.7 Debt Service Revenue, $25.3 (1%) BUDGET OVERVIEW 17 Discretionary Revenue by Source (in millions) Total Discretionary Revenue: $560.4 million Use of Discretionary Revenue by Program (in millions) Total Discretionary Revenue: $560.4 million Vehicle License Fee (ERAF), $169.7 (0%) Sales & Tax (ERAF), Assistance, $66.4 (12%) Capital Projects, $10.0 (2%) BUDGET OVERVIEW 18 The charts below show the impact of the State 's Education Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) shift, which began in FY 1992 -93 when the State cut funding for the schools and shifted property tax revenues from local jurisdictions to backfill the State cut.

The reduction in expenditures for community -based providers of indigent health services is offset by an increase in Measure A revenue and appropriations, which will prevent service reductions . The reduction in the indigent medical expense contract with the A lameda Health System (AHS) may not impact service delivery due to State and federal supplementary revenue and ra tes that will be realized by AHS in 2014 -15 under health care reform. The ending of the GOALS for Women program is by agreement with the contrac tor and is not expected to have a significant impact on services. The reduction in appropriation s for the Institution for Mental Disease s will not impact service delivery but may require future budget adjustments if this appropriation is billed to th e Coun ty (depending on the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit). The reduction in the Behavioral Health Telecare contract may reduce the availability of training for clinical staff; however, this line item in the Telecare contract has been traditionally underspent. 29 The reduction in behavioral health community -based provider contracts to align with service needs is not expected to have an impact on clients, patients or providers as these reductions will be applied to specific c ontracts that are underutilized (Jewish Fam ily and Children 's Services - $33,500 reduction; Seneca Center - $257,173 reduction; West Oakland Health Center - $150,000 reduction). The reduction in appropriation for the Family Health Services/California Children 's Services Diagnostic and Therapy progr am will diminish the ability to leverage State and federal r evenue, reduce service capacity, and result in longer waiting lists for these services. The reduction in appropriation s for the Communicable Diseases and HIV/AIDS services programs may limit the a bility to purchase needed lab supplies and equipment and upgrade outdated office equipment. The elimination of two vacant funded positions may limit support for the Public Health D epartment Information Technology help desk and reduce support to the Nursing Director in t he Public Health Nursing Division and the D ivision as a whole.

The Children 's Se rvices Budget highlights how the County's resources are allocated for services that protect and promote the well -being of children, and dem onstrates the County 's commitment to children. Appropriations and revenues for children 's services are budgeted in many Cou nty agencies and departments. To produce the Children's Services Budget, e ach County agency and department carefully analyzes its t otal budget to identify the dollars appropriated for children 's services . NOTES ON DEFINITIONS AND METHODS The Alameda County Children 's Services Budget reports all budgeted appropriations and revenues administered or provided by the Agencies and Departme nts of the County for children 's services. It is compiled from data provided by County Agencies and Departments and is a complex and careful extractio n of the portion of an Agency or Department 's total budget that is for children 's services. The County d oes not maintain a separate budget for children 's services. The Children 's Services Budget includes services that directly benefit children, such as child and youth health services, child welfare and juvenile justice services, as well as services provide d to parents or families on behalf of, or because of, the presence of a child, such as CalWORKs grants, child care, and child support services. A child is defined for the majority of services as being age 0 -17 years (that is, up to the 18 th birthday). However, services provided to youth over the age of 18 (for example, for youth emancipating from foster care) are also included in the Children 's Budget. Administrative costs of services, such as support staff, operating costs, etc., are not identified in th is report. Mandatory versus discretionary : A mandatory service is defined as a service or program that is required to be provided by law. Such services are frequently, although not always, funded by the federal and/or State government, and usually require matching County funding. Such matching County funding is considered non -discretionary. A discretionary service or funding is not required to be provided by law , or is dollars expended over and above required County matching funds . Discretionary service s may be funded entirely by the County or by a combination of sources including federal, State, or other sources. Not included in the Children 's Services Budget are allocations of universal expenditures that benefit all citizens uniformly , such as, enviro nmental protection or countywide law enforcement services. Also excluded are parts of programs such as CalWORKs fraud prevention, job training, or substance abuse, domestic violence and mental health programs that are provided for the adults in the progra ms. Budget versus actual spending is reported and readers should note that the amount appropriated for a program or service may differ from what is ultimately spent in the Fiscal Year. State funding in this document includes State general fund as well as 1991 and 2011 realignment revenue. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY CHILDREN'S SERVICES 47 A NOTE ON THE CHILDREN 'S MEMORIAL COMMITTEE In an annual public ceremony, the Alameda County Children 's Memorial Project remembers child victims of violence by installing a permanent plaque with the names of the childre n who died the previous year, and reading aloud the names of all children who have died by violence in the County in the past decade. County programs work to prevent child abuse, reduce youth violence, provide mental health services, and raise public awar eness to help reduce these deaths . FINANCIAL SUMMARIES BUDGET OVERVIEW The Alameda County Children 's Services budget for Fiscal Year 2014 -15 is $ 719,705,923 , an increase of $24, 941,799, or 3.6%, over Fiscal Year 2013 -14.

Infant mortality trend Alameda County 2000 -02 through 2009 -11 Source: Alameda County Vital Statistics Files Infant mortality is defined as the death of a child less than one year of age and is an important indicator of the health status of a co mmunity. Alameda County had 4.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2009 -11 reporting period, achieving the Healthy People 2010 target of 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. The rate for African American infants was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in that period, which did not achieve the target. However, the rate for African Americans shows a steady decrease, while there was no overall change in infant m ortality rates for any other racial/ethnic group in the time frame shown. County programs such as Black Infant Health work to achieve improvements in this important indicator.

CHILD WELFARE Alameda Co unty children supervised by Department of Children and Family Service s: in-home and out-of-home placements 2006 -2012 Care Children Receiving In -Home Services ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY CHILDREN'S SERVICES 65 The n umber of children receiving in -home and out -of-home child welfare services has been decreasing since 2006 (out-of-home) and 2010 (in -home) with a small up ward trend in both scenarios in 2013 . Flexible funding as a result of a Title IV -E waiver and related program innovations has contributed to this trend. The Title IV -E waiver is a federal suspension of rules for the use of foster care funding allowing the Department of Children and Family Services to determine how funding for child welfare services is allocated and the ability to retain any savings from a predetermined allocation. This flexibility has allowed the Department to use revenues and savings to fund new programs and models of service and to focus on prevention activities. JUVENILE JUSTICE Average daily population at Juvenile Justice Center (juvenile detention) 2003 to 2013 Source: Alameda County Probation Department Electronic GPS monitoring introduced by the Probation Department in the early 2000s and the Detention Risk Assessment Tool introduced in 2002 have contributed to a drop in minors being booked into the Juvenile Justice Center, as illu strated in the chart above.

The revenue impact of this reduction to the 2014 -15 budget as indicated in the above table is calculated based on a formula in the State budget legislation. The appropriation reduction in the table reflects a reduction in indigent services contracts affecting the Alameda Health System and community -based providers of indigent health services. The revenue is diverted to the State to pay the State share of the CalWORKs program. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY 240 ** The Low Income Health Program (LIHP) ended on December 31 , 2013.

Service Impacts The use of Tobacco Master Settlement Fund revenue will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs . The reduction in expenditure s for community -based providers of indigent health services is offset by an increase in Measure A revenue and appropriations, which will prevent service reductions . The reduction in the indigent medica l expense contract with the Alameda Health System (AHS) may not impact service delivery due to State and federal supplementary revenue and ra tes that will be realized by AHS in 2014 -15 under health care reform. The ending of the GOALS for Women program is by agreement with the contracto r and is not expected to have a significant impact on services. The reduction in appropriation for the Institution for Mental Disease s will not impact service delivery but may require future budget adjustments if this appropr iation is billed to the County (decision is contingent on the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit). ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY HEALTH CAR E SERVICES AGENCY 242 The reduction in the Behavioral Health Telecare contract may reduce the availability of training for clinical staff; however, this line item in the Telecare contr act has been traditionally underspent. The reduction in behavioral health community -based provider contracts to align with service needs is not expected to have an impact on clients, patients , or providers as these reductions will be applied to specific co ntracts that are underutilized (Jewish Family and Children 's Services - $33,500 reduction; Seneca Center - $257,173 reduction; West Oakland Health Center - $150,000 reduction). The reduction in appropriation for the Family Health Services/California Childr en's Services Diagnostic and Therapy program will diminish the ability to leverage State and federal re venue, reduce service capacity, and result in longer waiting lists for these services. The reduction in appropriation s for the Communicable Diseases and HIV/AIDS services programs may limit the ability to purchase needed lab supplies and equipment and upgrade outdated office equipment. The elimination of two vacant funded p ositions may limit support for the Public Health D epartment Information Technology h elp desk and reduce support to the Nursing Director in t he Public Health Nursing Division and the Division as a whole. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES FUNDING CONCERNS In Fiscal Year 2014 -15, the most significant issue facing HCSA is the continuation of the \"take back \" of 1991 Realignment funding for indigent health services. While $11 million was cut from the 2013 -14 budget in Alameda County for indigent health care services, the amount of the budget reduction for 2014 -15 is $42 million , which effectively strips out all 1991 Realignment funding for indigent health services. The funding cut reduces the Alameda Heal th System (formerly the Alameda County Medical Center) contract for indigent health services.

The revenue impact of this reduction to the 2014 -15 budget as indicated in the above table is calculated based on a formula in the State budget legislation. The appropriation reduction in the table reflects a reduction in indigent services contracts affecting the Alameda Health System and community -based providers of indigent health services.

Service Impacts Changes in caseload estimates do not impact services but reflect revised estimates of service need. Elimination of four vacant funded project positions is a technical adjustment to align the budget with actual staff and will have no impact on the delivery of services, as there are sufficient staff resources to meet needs. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs.

Although the economy is improving, ensuring adequate and stable funding for realigned State programs continues to be a challenge. Given continued economic fluctuations, there are concerns that sal es tax and vehicle license fee and other revenues available to fund the cost of program responsibilities transferred to the County may not be sufficient for Public Assistance and Health Care programs. Enrollment in Medi -Cal based on the f ederal Affordable Care Act has exceed ed initial estimates and is now projected to be 30% of the State population. A major uncertainty that is of great concern to the County is whether there will be sufficient State, federal and local resources for the enrollment of newly Medi -Cal eligible people, the transition of existing recipients to new programs, the retention of enrollees, and adequate health care for all residents of Alameda County. Other concerns include the continuing impact of federal sequestration on funding for aging and workforce service programs. In addition, after several years of service reductions and funding decreases, although CalWORKs recipients received a 5% grant increase, programs are generally seeing flat funding levels that are significantly less th an pre -recession levels, keeping the local safety net in a tenuous position. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT S IN 2013 -14 INCLUDE: DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES The Alameda County Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) takes incoming calls for Sonoma Count y. Effective March 2014, DCSS started taking call s for Stanislaus County as well. These collaborations create additional jobs in Alameda County, and bring new revenues to the County. DCSS has partnered with the Alameda County Library and serves as a pop -up library site. It has also established multiple relationships with local community -based organizations such as Centerforce to help its clients understand the importance of child support, and remove child support barriers to re - entry into the work force.

Awarded $100,000 planning grant with Community Resources for Independent Living and Center for Independent Living from the D epartment of California Health and Human Services to develop a designated local Aging and Disability Resource Connection. SOCIAL SERVICES CHIL DREN AND FAMILY SERV ICES The number of children in out -of-home placement has declined by 46.8% and the number of child welfare cases overall has declined by 43.0% since the beg inning of the Title IV -E Waiver in 2007. In 2013, out -of-home placements plateaued. However, the Department of Children and Family Services (CFS) continued to maintain the longer -term, overall placement and caseload declines, made continued progress on t he other Waiver goals, and continued meeting the needs of local children and families. Since the start of the Waiver, as a percentage of all children in foster care, the proportion of children placed: In group homes has declined by 41.7% (7.7% decline in 2013); In County foster family homes has increased by 84.8% (6.0% increase in 2013); and With relatives has increased by 7.9% (2.1%. increase in 2013). CFS operationaliz ed Extended Foster Care (AB 12) and successfully supported a cohort of 418 Non - Mino r Dependents (NMDs) ages 18 -21 (247 girls, 171 boys) within the first two years of implementation. Of critical importance for foster care youth transitioning into young adulthood, AB 12 Extended Foster Care ensures that NMDs reta in access to the full arra y of State -funded foster care services supporting safe and stable housing, educational opportunities, employment readiness and attainment, budgeting, and many other important competencies increasing the likelihood of positive life outcomes. SSA was awarde d a $720,000 two -year planning grant from t he U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to address youth at risk of homelessness. Named the Alameda County Youth Transitions Partnership, the 24 -month planning process (2013 -2015) will focus on current an d former foster youth ages 14 and older who are facing a challenging transition to adulthood that may include homelessness and housing instability. In 2013 the Department began a pilot of Permanency Round Tables (PRTs), an evidence -based best practice tha t features a professional case conferencing model designed to facilitate permanent, loving homes for youth in foster care. The launch included a department -wide kick -off event followed by two staff trainings, one caregiver training, and one attorney/bench training. Twenty - four PRTs were held in 2013, and SSA plans to continue this model. SOCIAL SERVICES WORK FORCE AND BENEFITS A DMINISTRATION SSA, in collaboration with the Health Care Services Agency (HCSA), implemented a Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Advocacy Housing Supplement Pilot project, which has provided additional cash benefits to a subset of General Assistance recipients. The results of the cohort for the pilot ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 304 included more than 100 individuals obtaining placements in permanent housing. This pilot is now a permanent program. For the first time, Cal -Learn and California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids ( CalWORKs ) head -of-household program participants 14 to 19 years of age were targeted to participate in the Summer and Afterschool Youth Employment and Education Program. 101 Cal -Learn and CalWORKs head of household individuals are actively participating in the employment program. The Alameda County State Work Participation Rate (WPR) rose from 10% to 14% during Fiscal Year 2013 -14, based on random samples identified by the State. This is an important milestone, as one of the Department 's goal s has been to increa se the County 's WPR . Employment and Training Services contractors enrolled 1,865 CalWORKs participants into employment an d training activities, resulting in 590 direct employment placements. Developed wage subsidy pilots with Inner City Advisors to place up to 100 CalWORKs clients in employment , and Roots Emancipators to train and place six formerly incarcerated individuals into manufacturing jobs. In collaboration with the Alameda County Community Food Bank, spearheaded and implemented CalFresh Super Enrollment Clinics, whereby outreach efforts to approximately 58,000 Medi -Cal recipients who were not receiving CalFresh ben efits were conducted by mass mailings. Sixteen enrollment clinics were held at partnering CBO sites where 455 applications were completed and 280 applications were approved, resulting in a 38% approval rate.

Rece nt numbers, however, indicate the PRCS population remains higher than anticipated. While the State Budget includes an $11.3 million augmentation to address the short -term increase in the PRCS population, it does not increase programmatic funds to strengthen counties ' ability to manage new criminal justice responsibilities over the long -term. The State Budget includes payment of pre-2004 mandate debt already owed to counties with the expectation that priority be given to implementation of 2011 Realignment and public safety. Furthermore, the formula for the distribution of AB 109 Public Safety Realignment base funding is still in development, and it is unknown at this time whether the County 's allocation will be sufficient to fund the cost of Public Safety program responsibilities realigned by the State.

This funding decrease is driven by the reduction in health care funding detailed below. Note that the term CBO is defined broadly here to include direct h uman services contrac ts with both non -profit and for -profit service providers, as well as cities, school districts, and local hospitals. The $3.0 million decrease in General Government is due to the completion of one large housing project in Housing & Com munity Development ; the loss of this $6.2 million contract is partially offset by the addition of over $3.0 million in new projects. The Lead Poisoning Prevention program is now the Healthy Homes Department , reflecting the broader range of home env ironmen tal issues addressed. The FY 2013-14 total for General Government has been adjusted by $5 ,000 to reflect two prior -year B oard actions. There is a $41.5 million decrease in Health Care contracts . This significant decrease is due to the State's shift of 1 991 realignment revenue away from indigent health services. This shift is based on the presumption that most of those previously enrolled in indigent health programs are now eligible for federally supported Medicaid/Medi -Cal or other subsidized health car e insurance coverage as a result of the State's Medi -Cal expansion and implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. The Health Care Services Agency contracts with Alameda Health System (AHS) and HealthPAC clinics to p rovide indigent health services; consequently , these providers are significantly impacted by the shift in funding . The $5.8 million increase in Public Assistance is due to an increase in program funding for Area Agency on Aging and CalWORKs service providers. The approximately $168,000 decrease in Public Protection is the result of grants ending for the District Attorney's and Probation Offices , though some of the providers and services have been absorbed in other programs. The Final Budget include s a 2% COLA for eligible CBO contracto rs totaling $3.8 mill ion, $15.8 million in M easure A funded contracts, and $77.3 million in contracted health care services delivered by AHS. A list of all the CBO contracts for FY 2014 -15 follows.
