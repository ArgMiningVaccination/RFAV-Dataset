[See an update on this post, with [more fallout from this case](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/07/university-terminates-affiliation-with-researcher-who-had-paper-on-covid-19-vaccines-retracted-as-mask-study-comes-under-scrutiny/).] As we have [previously noted](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/if-the-data-were-not-correct-whose-fault-is-this-authors-of-highly-criticized-covid-19-vaccine-study-defend-it/): The authors, including Harald Walach, who was also co-author of a just-published [paper in JAMA Pediatrics]questioning the safety of masks in children, had used data from the Dutch national registry of side effects. That registry [carries a warning label]about its use. The editors of Vaccines, which published the study last month, wrote that there were concerns over \"misrepresentation of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts and misrepresentation of the data.\" At least two members of the editorial board of Vaccines [have resigned](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/06/29/paper-claiming-two-deaths-from-covid-19-vaccination-for-every-three-prevented-cases-earns-expression-of-concern/) over the paper's publication. Yesterday, we published the [authors' response to a critique](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/07/01/if-the-data-were-not-correct-whose-fault-is-this-authors-of-highly-criticized-covid-19-vaccine-study-defend-it/) from Eug\u00e8ne Van Puijenbroek, of Lareb (The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre), where the data originated. In it, the authors wrote: We are happy to concede that the data we used - the large Israeli field study to gauge the number needed to vaccinate and the LAREB data to estimate side-effects and harms - are far from perfect, and we said so in our paper. But we did not use them incorrectly. We used imperfect data correctly. We are not responsible for the validity and correctness of the data, but for the correctness of the analysis. We contend that our analysis was correct. We agree with LAREB that their data is not good enough. But this is not our fault, nor can one deduce incorrect use of data or incorrect analysis. Apparently, the journal found that response wanting. Here's the [retraction notice](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/729), published today: The journal retracts the article, The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations\u2014We Should Rethink the Policy [ [1]], cited above. Serious concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding misinterpretation of data, leading to incorrect and distorted conclusions. The article was evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief with the support of several Editorial Board Members. They found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings. These include, but are not limited to: The data from the Lareb report ( [https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen]) in The Netherlands were used to calculate the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations. Unfortunately, in the manuscript by Harald Walach et al. these data were incorrectly interpreted which led to erroneous conclusions. The data was presented as being causally related to adverse events by the authors. This is inaccurate. In The Netherlands, healthcare professionals and patients are invited to report suspicions of adverse events that may be associated with vaccination. For this type of reporting a causal relation between the event and the vaccine is not needed, therefore a reported event that occurred after vaccination is not necessarily attributable to vaccination. Thus, reporting of a death following vaccination does not imply that this is a vaccine-related event. There are several other inaccuracies in the paper by Harald Walach et al. one of which is that fatal cases were certified by medical specialists. It should be known that even this false claim does not imply causation, which the authors imply. Further, the authors have called the events 'effects' and 'reactions' when this is not established, and until causality is established they are 'events' that may or may not be caused by exposure to a vaccine. It does not matter what statistics one may apply, this is incorrect and misleading. The authors were asked to respond to the claims, but were not able to do so satisfactorily. The authors were notified of the retraction and did not agree. Update, 2330 UTC, 7/4/21: Walach and a co-author, Rainer Klement, sent us a [statement they had submitted to Vaccines](http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Statement-on-Retraction_2.docx). In it, they write, \"The true reason seems to have been pressure on part of some editors of the journal\" and \"The timeline suggests that the Journal was not really interested in our response and that our response was irrelevant to the retraction.\" Read the [entire response here](http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Statement-on-Retraction_2.docx).
