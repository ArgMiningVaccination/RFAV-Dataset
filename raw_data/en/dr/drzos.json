Describe how the immunity induced by an intranasal vaccine may differ from the immunity induced by a killed vaccine. 5 19. Describe how the immunity induced by an MLV oral vaccine may differ from the immunity induced by a killed vaccine. 20. Describe when and how a killed vaccine can stimulate lactogenic (IgA in milk) immunity to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in a sow. 21. When given basic facts about a vaccine, use your knowledge of immunology to predict the type of immunity the vaccine would induce. 22. Describe the challenges of multifactorial diseases. 23. Illustrate and explain with a labeled drawing how it is often the additive effect of immunosuppressive factors that result in clinical disease and not one factor alone. Include at least two factors that decrease resistance to disease and one factor that will boost or increase resistance. Principles of Veterinary Vaccinology Introduction This set of lectures is designed to go along with the Principles of Veterinary Immunology online course. The target audience is veterinarians wanting information to help them make decisions regarding designing vaccination programs and to help understand why vaccines may sometimes fail to protect and may sometimes be associated with adverse events. The course covers factors to consider when vaccinating animals because most often there is not one simple answer to questions about vaccinations. Veterinarians need to call on their knowledge and experience and weigh multiple factors related to a specific animal or herd, its history, and its environment when designing vaccination programs. There is no such thing as a perfectly safe and perfectly effective vaccine; good vaccines are a balance of risks and benefits! Risks of Vaccination Known vaccine-related side effects Injection site-associated feline fibrosarcomas - a rare event; first identified in 1980s and originally was thought to be a result of vaccines injection but later determined that it could be any injection, not just vaccines. This began the discussion about the frequency of vaccination. Hypersensitivities Anaphylaxis Nonspecific systemic side effects - common and transient, usually not serious Fever, lethargy, loss of appetite a day or so after vaccination due to proinflammatory cytokine production occurs 12-28 hours after vaccination Localized reactions at the injection site Alterations in immune homeostasis - do vaccines contribute to these situations? Allergy in predisposed animals? Autoimmune disease in polyneuropathy - Guillain-Barre syndrome in humans, coonhound paralysis in dogs Always be aware of, and minimize potential risks, but, in general, the benefits of vaccinating with the core vaccines outweigh the risks Benefits of Vaccination Vaccines are essential for: Safe and efficient food production 6 Control of emerging and exotic diseases of animals and people Control of zoonotic diseases, e.g. rabies Reduction of transmission of food borne disease, e.g. salmonellosis in poultry, Reduction of animal suffering Reduction of the need for antibiotics to treat animals Control of diseases of companion animals and horses Prevention of deadly diseases - e.g., core vaccines in companion animals prevent deadly viral diseases Vaccination Principles Published by the AVMA Executive Board April 2001; revised April 2007) Introduction \"Selecting vaccine products and recommending vaccine programs are among the most complicated of medical decisions facing the veterinarian.\" Other highlights: \"Vaccine products vary in efficacy and safety and are not necessarily indicated for all patients.\" \"Vaccination protects a population of animals\"... \"Vaccination does not protect every individual patient even when they are properly vaccinated.\" (Herd immunity) \"Knowledge of immunology and vaccinology, including associated benefits and risks, and the pathobiology of infectious diseases, are necessary to implement an effective vaccination program.\" Conclusion \"Revaccination recommendations should be designed to maintain clinically relevant immunity while minimizing adverse event potential.\" Basis for Protective Immunity Introduction The pathogenesis and virulence factors of an organism are important factors for determining what type of immune response will provide the best protection to disease. Usually, the best immunity to a disease is recovery from disease. Vaccination tries to mimic immunity induced by the natural infection while sparing the animal the clinical disease and illness associated with natural infection. Types of Immune Responses to a Pathogen Include: Humoral response: Circulating antibody = IgM and IgG Mucosal antibody response IgA on the mucosal surface IgE just under the mucosal surface located on mast cells Cell-mediated response: Cytokine secretion - a complex mixture of various Example - TH1 (CD4+) cell cytokines Interferon gamma (IFN), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 2 (IL2) Enhance cell mediated immunity by activating macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and TC cells Cytotoxic T cells (TC cells/CD8+)- recognize foreign antigen and MHCI and directly kill infected cells Gamma d elta () T cells - help protect mucosal epithelium, may act more quickly after initial exposure than CD4 and CD8 T cells 7 Important antigens: Organisms have many antigens but only a few are important for inducing a protective immune response. When you know about the pathogenesis of the organism, you can make a good guess about what is needed for a protective immune response. Examples of Pathogenic Mechanisms and Protective Defensive Mechanisms Pathogenic Mechanisms Defensive Mechanisms Some examples Adherence to m ucosa Mucosal antibody (IgA) E. coli, Viremia Neutralizing antibody West phagocytosis Extracellular bacteria: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus Intracytoplasmic growth Cytotoxic T cells Intracellular bacteria and viruses Rapid virus replication Interferons - Type I and Type II Viruses that spread more quickly than the immune response can produce antibodies , e.g. rhinoviruses Intracellular growth/ growth in phagosome TH1 cytokines - e.g. Any virus that grows inside the cell, Mycobacteria, Brucella Infect epithelial cells T cells - especially at mucosal surfaces Bacterial Antigens Bacterial Antigens Important Considerations in Vaccine Development External Pili Flagella Capsule Antibody important to block adherence Antibody can opsonize for phagocytosis Internal Important antigens vs not important Antibody not protective (does not get inside of cells) Cell-mediated immunity (CMI ) may be important Secreted Exotoxins Need growth conditions that result in secretion of important factors Neutralizing Ab is important Endotoxin - lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gram negative bacteria Neutralizing antibody 8 "}
