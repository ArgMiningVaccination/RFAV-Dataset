It should serve the function well. It's nice looking and the two wheel feature on the back is pretty cool. The instructions are terrible but you can figure it out. I'm. Not sure how the wheels will hold up. They are very plastic like. Over pleased.

She loves going to the bike path. I love that it keeps her mobile instead of just sitting in the house. She is already excited about getting a bigger bike in the future!

As for the bike itself, the double back wheel helps in making it easier to balance the bike, but it's not as though it will stay up on its own. My daughters will be three next month and they're starting to get the hang of it. However, if your child doesn't have the best balance, this may be a bit frustrating to start. It would be great if you could spread the wheels out a bit farther on the rear axle, but it doesn't seem to be an option currently. It's great that it doesn't have pedals, so kids can work on their balance without having to divide their focus on pedaling. Overall, I think this bike is a really cool idea in terms of aiding the transition from a tricycle to a more standard two wheel bike.

It was easy to assemble and came with all tools necessary. I assembled it in less than 5 minutes. The wider double tire in the back seems to be a big help also. It took my daughter a few attempts to figure out how to use it but since then she hasn't put it down! Would definitely buy again Date published: 2021-01-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by chris0414 from great little bicycle!!It was a gift for my 3 year old niece and the parents liked it. Easy to assemble. Needed an extra set of hands to put together but pretty easy over all It's so smooth on all kinds of surface and light. Really helpful for learning balance! Date published: 2021-01-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by CR41 from Great first bike!!I picked this up for my soon to be 2-year-old nephew a few weeks ago and it has been a hit so far. He's a little young still, but picked up the basic idea of the balance bike right away and he loves it. Perfect size for his age and will be a great head start when learning how to ride. My kids learned to ride in a matter of days after getting on this balance bike when they were younger. The best recommendation I can give to anyone who will be teaching their kid to ride and want a head start. Truly a life hack you'll never regret!

She is able to use her feet to balance and really focus in on the steering and guidance concepts. We have a small bike with training wheels as well that we rotate with but after about a weeks use of this specific balance bike she seems to have significantly improved! Not only is she improving daily, but seems to also really enjoy cruising around on her new \"stylish\" bike. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to improve "}
