Also Etowa, Jesty, & Vukic (2011), indicated that Aboriginal people have a holistic definition of health that involves a balance of emotional, mental, spiritual and emotional health which has its origins in the medicine wheel and that cultural traditions such as sweat lodges, talking circles, drumming circles, and smudging are crucial elements of healing and empowerment. The medicine wheel is used as a tool to emphasize the need for bal\u00acance between these dimensions of life, as well as the holistic Every culture is different, and are unique by their beliefs, values, remedies, and many people live by that, many people believe in all these topics, and many people also think that everything is a lie. The most common customs of Zacatecas are the Festivals, Festivals, and Fairs of Zacatecas. The main festivals in Zacatecas are the religious ones that are celebrated in each one of the municipalities in honor to the patron of the place, also the regional celebrations, in the capital of the state the celebrations are celebrated in the month of September, being day 8 when The Virgin of Patronage is also commemorated. There are also various events in the fair 's cultural and artistic facilities, such as bullfights, Palenque, exhibitions, dances, horse races and gastronomic exhibitions. Also, there are There are multiple approaches to healing the body throughout the world. Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly Herbal remedies are not as simple as just determining the illness and giving the prescribed medicine, without having knowledge of the body. The fundamental element of medicine in the Medieval time period is the theory of humours. This theory followed through until they reach the 19th century where more modern analysis could conducted. Humours also known as principle fluids are made up of four different fluid found in each individual: black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm. Each of the fluids are found in different organ of the body, black bile resides in the spleen and is the cause for melancholy, yellow bile is secreted by the liver and can cause irascibility, phlegm comes from the lungs and can be denounced to sluggishness, and the final There are many different cultures in the world and how they approach medical needs may not all be the same. As a Vietnamese American I know both ways how American people and Vietnamese people approach for healthcare. Most American when we are sick we go to the doctors and they diagnose us with whatever and give us a prescription for medication or would refer us out to a specialist that would be able to help us. While Asians or better yet Vietnamese when we get sick we sometimes do not just go to the doctors we try herbal medications at home on our own and on what knowledge we know and from our friends and families. Also we believe in that acupuncture can help us from a lot of different things it can help with trembling, aches and such. Americans Today's society consist of a variety of different cultures. Each cultures has their own identity, customs, and beliefs. In my community we have several strong, family oriented cultures. The two that were chosen was the Hispanics community and the Haliwa-Saponi Native American community. It was very interesting to see that while this communities are different they share some strong similarities, such as family ties. This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. In the 1700s, Americans owed their medical knowledge to the colonists. It was not until 1861, when the Civil War began, that Americans started realizing that they needed to make changes. The Civil War had a major influence on medicine in America. Other than the fact that medicine during the Civil War was more modernized than that during the colonial times, there are many other factors that give evidence that medicine during the Civil War was just simply better. It had improved because the people were more educated, The Appalachia region is less racial and culturally diverse than the rest of the United States. Though, this seems to be gradually shifting. Traditionally, the region has been largely occupied by non-Hispanic whites. The 1990 census exposed the beginning of racial and ethnic change of the Appalachian region (Salob, 2014). The proportion of African Americans was 24.9 percent which was approximately three times greater than non-Hispanic whites at 8.1 percent The poverty rate amongst African Americans in Appalachia was 27 percent with 12.1 percent being non-Hispanic whites. In Appalachia, rates of deep poverty were lowest among whites and Asians and high among African Americans. Poverty in Appalachia evidently continues if deficiency is Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment choice, they have the option if that is what they and their patients think is best. The state that has experienced the most expansion has been Oregon, but each state has its own formulary which Naturopaths can work from. If I end up working in a licensure state, it will be important to have pharmaceuticals as an option to treat my patients. My main goal as a Naturopathic Physician is to help my patients Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Health care providers need to treat patients holistically with respect of their cultural values and traditions, which may interfere and sometimes complicate a recommended treatment, not to mention a significant disparities in oral and general health in these minorities of cultural population have been noticed.(2,3) Western medicine is increasing the lives of many in different ways using advances in the medical field. Western medicine is the process of looking at the body like a machine it finds a problem and fixes that problem. Today Western medicine is superior and eastern medicine is considered taboo. Eastern medicine looks at the body as a garden and instead of giving you medication they try to start at the root of the problem by talking about what's going on in your life. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities.

These are some of the states that \"qi\" appears in our daily lives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), qi plays as a fundamental component from time to time explaining its ideas. Theories of both Chinese and Western medicine exist for helping people maintain good health and away from deceases. Western medicine relies more on scientific proof \"Western medicine places strong emphasis on the physical structures of the body, which are made up of different organic and inorganic substances, proteins, tissues and cells.\" (Shen Lung Ltd, 2002) Unlike western medicine, TMC originates and relies very much on Chinese philosophical theories. And the theory of qi is one of them. This essay will be explaining what qi is in Chinese medicine, including its general concept, movement and flow in human body, functions, what would be "}
