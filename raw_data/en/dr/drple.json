We are glad to have the opportunity to wo rk with you. Our mission is to provide high qualit y holistic medicine and physiatry while continuing to participate in several major in surance plans. This page will review our policies a nd procedures. Please see our website, cohlife.org for more information about Holistic Medicine and P hysiatry. 1. Clinical policies You are welcome to have friends and family partici pate in your visits and other activities. If you wi sh for the physician to discuss your case without your presence, a special HIPAA fo rm will need to be filled out beforehand. You are expected to maintain a relationship with a primary care physician \"PCP\" to handle routine med ical issues such as medication renewals (for medications not prescribed or adjusted by me) vaccines, colds, and related co nventional care. In addition, your PCP or other physician(s) may be needed to ini tiate or continue certain pharmaceuticals (such as blood pressure, diabetic, pain or thyroid medications) prescribed prior to or during your holistic medical treatment program. In holistic medicine, we work as a team with the p hysician, patient and staff all having certain resp onsibilities. Each visit will end with a written visit summary with specific tasks that yo u will be expected to complete prior to your next v isit. Repeated visits without engagement in the process (i.e. reasonable completi on of tasks) may be a cause for discharge from the holistic program. During office visits, let's be sure to renew presc riptions. There is fee for unreasonably urgent rene wals between visits. You will be required to provide copies of any docu ments that are pertinent to your care or that you w ant Dr. Cheikin to review. COH staff cannot provide such copy services due to time constraints. Forms will be completed at our discretion. Some mu st be filled by your PCP or other practitioner(s). Nutriceutical supplements are provided in the same way as pharmaceuticals. We make our best effort t o provide effective agents for your problems. We cannot guarantee results and cannot accept returns except for replacing clear ma nufacturing defects. Test doses are available for many agents. Many of our patients are very sensitive to chemica ls. Please do not wear any commercial scents or lot ions or previously-worn clothes that may contain such scents. 2. Scheduling Before beginning treatment, you will be informed a bout the recommended scope of treatment including t he frequency of visits, lab tests and estimated costs to safely and effectively manage your holistic program. If you cannot attend visits or follow the prescribed protocols, the holistic program will be placed on h old or terminated. For most active programs, visits will be required at least every 3-4 months. Once your goals are met, \"maintenance\" status will require visits once or twice per year, to be mutual ly determined and documented in your visit note. We will schedule office visits for 30-45 minutes. If you need more time, we can schedule more freque nt visits to cover your medical needs. You can also elect to pay privately if you w ant an extended visit, but this must be scheduled i n advance. Lateness of more than 10 minutes will be treated a s a partial no-show. If you are concerned about mak ing appointments in advance, we will try to accommodate your needs if a rranged in advance. Because of the complex needs of our patients, we so metimes run late and cannot guarantee an exact star t time. Please plan your appointment accordingly, including time f or the important checkout after the visit with the physician. If you cannot work within this parameter, then we can disc uss options during our first visit. If your insurance carrier requires a referral, it i s your responsibility to make sure the referral is obtained from your primary care physician before the visit. You will be financially responsible fo r the office visit if a referral is not obtained. If an office visit is cancelled due to lack of referral, you will be char ged a cancellation fee. Cancellation fees and additional policies are spec ified in the Initial Registration document and rela ted documents. 3. Covered and Non-Covered Services a. Health plans usually cover (but we do not repre sent or study your individual plan; see separate Health Insurance Policy) : Initial office visits up to 60 minutes (only \"face -to-face time\" is covered; and you will need a referral at t he time of visit if you have an HMO) Follow-up office visits between 15-40 minutes (sam e requirements as initial visit) Conventional lab tests and review during office vi sits Conventional medications and treatments prescribed by a physician if on the plan's formulary (and subject to the individual plan's entitlements & lim its) Phone calls to other physicians and practitioners during office visits Counseling of patient Coordination of care with family members during office visits b. Your health insurance plan will not cover these fees (but some may be charged to a Healthcare Savings Account (HSA)): Copays (due at time of visit) and Deductibles Office visits that go over time Holistic Services and access to proprietary web si te materials that will be reviewed separately and for which ther e are separate fees that you will know of in advance. \"Non-covered\" lab tests and their Interpretation b y the physician \"Case Management\" assistance with health carrier issues (such as coverage, referrals) and legal/administrative ma tters Phone and email communications with the patient if excessive or utilized in lieu of an office visit. Phone calls to other practitioners not during offi ce visit time Review of tests and other information outside of t he visit Copying costs as specified by statute Medical forms and letters that you provide for oth er agencies Due to the ongoing malpractice and health insurance crisis in Pennsylvania, many holistic doctors have left the state and/or have stopped participating in insurance plans. Agreeing to these mutual commitments at the beginning of our relationship will allow us to make the most of our visits, and allow us to focus on providing you with the best quality we can. Tha nk you in advance for your understanding and cooperation. Please feel free to discuss any concerns you have about the above duri ng our visit(s). I have read, understand and agree to be bound by th e above policies. I agree to save a copy for my re cords. __________________________________________________ _______________ f_p&p_2021_04_29.docx Patient's (or BOTH parent/guardian's) signature Date Michael Cheikin M.D., REQUEST & CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE I, ____________________ ______ consent and request to participate in the Medicine is an art of healing involving the evaluation and t reatment of the body, mind and spirit, using a prog ram that is specifically tailored to re- establishing balance in the body.

The followin g notices and policies apply: 1. It is your responsibility and entitlement to und erstand what your insurance plan covers and does no t. You should review your policy with your carrier before accepti ng any services, whether medical, lab or other. Bec ause of the huge numbers of insurance plans, we are unable to m anage the specifics of your plan. There is no guara ntee that any service will be covered by your carrier. S ome plans require you to go to specific labs (i.e. Quest or LabCorp). 2. All the labs that Dr. Cheikin orders are \"medica lly necessary and reasonable,\" which means that in his opinion as a licensed physician, he believes that the tests he orders will help diagnose and guide treatment for your problem(s). However, we have no say in your insuran ce carrier's policies regarding coverage, deductibl es, co- pays, exclusions or what they deem to be \"experimen tal\". We will do our best to provide appropriate di agnostic and treatment codes to medically justify the servic es provided. This does not ensure coverage by your insurance. You will have the opportunity to review your lab or ders with your insurance carrier before doing any test. 3. As best as we know, we will tell you in advance if any tests are not \"covered\" by your insurance pl an. Non- covered tests usually include those for halides, to xins such as heavy metals and pesticides, and other s. We will only order these tests with your advance consent an d payment. Some of the \"non-covered\" lab costs, may be eligible for reimbursement if you have a HSA (Healt h Care Savings Account) or MSA (Medical Savings Acc ount). 4. If you know that your carrier does not \"cover\" c ertain important labs (such as homocysteine by Aetn a or MTHFR by the Blues) that are provided by conventional lab s such as Quest or LabCorp, we can often perform th e lab at a discount compared to what you might pay. In such cases, we must work out the details in advance. 6. Fees for \"non-covered\" labs provided by our office, which include design and interpretation, are non- refundable . You are required to complete any test kits within 30 days of receipt unless otherwise noted in your written visit note or plan. 7. There is a fee for the review, design, interpre tation of a metabolic lab panels not provided withi n the scope of conventional practice. This fee also covers the des ign and support of a supplement protocol(s) that ar e based on such testing. We encourage labs in sets of two, si nce testing your individual response to a supplemen t or lifestyle protocol is the point of doing the tests in the first place. No insurance company pays for interpretation of metabolic labs and design of supplement protocol (s) ordered within the scope of this holistic practice . 8. You are responsible for returning for an office vis it within 3-4 weeks after having labs performed , to interpret the labs and to adjust your program accor dingly. We cannot send you copies of labs without r eview and interpretation, because of the medico-legal respons ibility for acting upon these studies. For your saf ety, without review, labs will only be released to a physician w ho is assuming responsibility for you continued car e (i.e. your primary care or other). You can get copies of many of your labs from portals provided by LabCorp, Ques t and other labs. 9. The \"reference ranges\" provided by most labs ar e based on a \"typical\" American population and DO N OT represent \"normal\" or \"healthy\". I t is potentially dangerous to self-interpret labs that are within and outside of the reference range to self-diagnose without the pa rticipation of a licensed physician.
