Using creative means to address lifestyle and environmental issues can make the difference between debilitating heart disease and a life that is more fully lived. At the University of Miami Health System, we are pioneering the way that physicians are trained in recent advancements in heart disease treatment. That means you, as a patient, are treated by physicians who are leaders and mentors in this field, true experts who have seen more cases of your type of heart disease than any other hospital in the region. At the same time, we realize that treating the whole patient means coordinating disease-specific care with holistic preventive and recuperative practices that address the risk factors for future or existing heart disease. Cardiovascular conditions benefitting from complementary therapies include: - Coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis - Palpitations - Cholesterol Disorders - High blood pressure - Heart attack - Diabetes - A family history of heart disease - Chest pains not related to heart disease - Stress and muscle tension - Anxiety - Smoking addiction - Eating disorders - Sleeping problems Tests Genetic Testing Genetic tests may help determine the genetic causes of many inherited cardiac diseases. Your doctor may recommend echocardiography on a regular basis for family members with an identified variant. Transthoracic Echocardiogram A device (transducer) is pressed firmly against your skin and aims an ultrasound beam through your chest to your heart, producing moving images of the working of the heart. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) This special type of echocardiogram is usually done when your doctor wants to look more closely at your heart to see if it could be producing blood clots. TEE uses ultrasound to examine the structures of the heart, by placing a small transducer into the esophagus. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Wires (electrodes) attached to adhesive pads on your skin measure electrical impulses from your heart. An ECG can detect enlarged chambers of your heart and abnormal heart rhythms. Treadmill Stress Test Your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored while you walk on a treadmill. It allows your doctor to evaluate symptoms, determine your exercise capacity, and see if exercise provokes abnormal heart rhythms. This test is sometimes performed with echocardiography. Holter Monitor For this test, you exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike. When your heart rate reaches peak levels, your doctor will take ultrasound images of your heart to determine whether your heart muscle is getting enough oxygen while you exercise. Metabolic Stress Testing Electrical activity of the heart is measured while you walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bicycle. In addition, your respiratory rate, tidal volumes, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are measured to gauge the heart and lungs' reaction to increased workloads. Nuclear Stress Testing A nuclear stress test measures blood flow to your heart at rest and while your heart is working harder as a result of exertion or medication. It involves injecting a radioactive dye into your bloodstream to highlight areas of low blood flow through the heart and damaged heart muscle. Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) CCTA uses an injection of iodine contrast material and CT scanning to examine the arteries that supply blood to the heart and determine whether they have been narrowed by plaque buildup. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiac MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the structures within the heart and detect or monitor cardiac disease. Cardiac Catheterization This procedure uses a catheter threaded through blood vessels into the heart to see inside the heart, measure pressures, look at blood vessels and help determine therapy options. UHealth is home to the Elaine and Sydney Sussman Cardiac Catheterization Lab, which provides advanced imaging capabilities and pinpoint accuracy for new and complex procedures.
