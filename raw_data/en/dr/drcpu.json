Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons. Chronic urticaria is diagnosed when recurrent crops of urticaria continue for more than 6 weeks. Chronic urticaria negatively influences the patient's quality of life because of the itching or physical discomfort during outbreaks. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods, insect stings, sunlight exposure, or medications can all cause histamine release for hives to flare. It is often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed. The current first-line treatment for hives is non-sedating antihistamines. However it is only for alleviating symptoms and there are multiple side effects for using anti histamine, such as headache, fatigue, dry mouth, hay fever, allergies, etc. Acupuncture therapy has very few adverse effects and is widely used for the treatment of urticaria in Asia. In TCM, acupuncture is believed to function by regulating the balance of Qi circulation. The potential mechanism of acupuncture for treating urticaria might be the suppression of the immunological reaction. Studies in animals and humans signified that acupuncture can attenuate histamine effect, modulate the function of the immune system and decrease the adhesion molecule. Many clinical studies have reported that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of urticaria. And here they are: Conclusion: Acupuncture treatment found to be significantly more or equally effective than the western medicine. Conclusion: Acupuncture plus other treatment was significantly superior to western medicine alone and autologous blood injection plus herbal medicine was better than herbal medicine alone in increasing the number of cured patients.
