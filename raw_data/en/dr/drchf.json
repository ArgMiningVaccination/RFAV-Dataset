A Passion For Helping Others \"I always knew I wanted a career in the field of health because I love helping people. My cousin is a chiropractor, and while trying to decide on a holistic career path, I shadowed her at her clinic. All it took was one day for me to make up my mind. By observing the warm personal connections that my cousin had with her patients, I knew chiropractic was the profession for me.\" Education and Experience Dr. Luke received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from [Palmer College of Chiropractic](https://www.palmer.edu/) in Davenport, Iowa. While still a student in clinic, he encountered a patient who had severe neck and upper back pain. He couldn't carry out even simple acts of daily living. \"This man had already seen three other chiropractors, and nothing was helping. As a student, I felt a little intimidated, but I gave it my all. I began to adjust him and added in specific exercises (The McKenzie Method) for him to practice at home. By the third visit, the man came in for his appointment happy and excited; the pain was going away! This experience made me realize that chiropractic has so much to offer because of the diversity of cutting-edge adjustment styles.\" A Thirst For Knowledge Following his graduation from Palmer College, Dr. Luke jumped in with both feet and spent a month at a solo chiropractic clinic in Peru. \"I was inundated with patients for the entire time I was there. It was fascinating and refreshing to work with a culture that takes a completely holistic approach to health care. I felt very grateful for the experience.\" Dr. Luke's additional postgraduate coursework includes - Certification in Active Release Techniques (ART) - Certification in Activator Methods\u00ae - Certification in dry needling technology - Webster Technique certification Outside The Office Traveling and exploring areas around Lakeview are favorite pastimes of Dr. Luke.

A Desire For Work Fulfillment \"As an undergrad with a major in biology, I completed a summer internship working in a lab, spending days working in isolation. I quickly realized I was a people person and lab work was not going to be a part of my destiny. After enduring intense daily headaches, I began to see a chiropractor. My results were so profound that I became seriously interested in chiropractic as a profession.\" After shadowing several area chiropractors, Dr. Andrea had the opportunity to hear the President of Palmer College speak at the pre-chiropractic club on her college campus. He ended his speech with these riveting words: \"Chiropractic is a profession where people want to go to work every day. Even after so-called retirement, they still practice.\" A Broad And Extensive Education Dr. Andrea earned her Doctor of Chiropractic degree from [Palmer College of Chiropractic](https://www.palmer.edu/) in Davenport, Iowa. As a student, she had the opportunity to participate in their Clinic Abroad Program in Brazil, where she and other classmates treated low-income people in many cities. She clearly remembers three treatments she delivered to a young Brazilian man who was suffering from numbness along the inner thighs up to the groin, accompanied by bowel and bladder problems. While standing in line to get on the bus to leave, she saw this same man searching through the crowd for her. \"He ran up to me with so much joy in his face; all his symptoms had disappeared! That I was able to help him as a student completely cemented my purpose.\" Clinical Excellence For Dr. Andrea, the most fulfilling and motivating aspect of her practice is the relationships she forms with those she serves.
