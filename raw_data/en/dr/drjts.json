At this timepoint, 43% (n=23/53) had no fluid in the for EYLEA (n=14/53) (p=0.0667); and 51% (n=27) had no subfield compared to 34% for EYLEA (n=18) (p=0.0770). At week 16, patients in both treatment groups had received three initial doses (administered at weeks 0, 4 and 8), after which dosing was extended to every 12 weeks. In new results presented for the first time, aflibercept 8 mg continued to show numeric improvements in anatomical and vision outcomes compared to EYLEA through 44 weeks. \"These Phase 2 data in wet AMD demonstrate the exciting potential for aflibercept 8 mg to maintain dryness and improve vision compared to the standard-of-care EYLEA,\" said Dr. Eyes treated with aflibercept 8 mg were more likely to be dry in the center subfield on optical coherence tomography (OCT) compared to EYLEA at every timepoint measured throughout the trial after the initial monthly dosing period. At week 44 when the trial ended, key anatomical and vision changes included: - 40% (n=21/53) of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg did not have fluid in the center subfield compared to 28% (n=15/53) of patients treated with EYLEA (nominal p=0.2185). - Twice as many patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg (32%, n=17/53) had no macular fluid compared to patients treated with EYLEA (15%, n=8/53) (nominal p=0.0395), as measured by spectral domain OCT. Measuring macular fluid provides an evaluation of a larger area of the retina compared to the center subfield and may provide a better understanding of the anatomical effects of treatment in wet AMD. - 7.9 average letter improvement from baseline in the aflibercept 8 mg group, compared to 5.1 letters in the EYLEA group, as measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (nominal p=0.1957). - Nearly half (47%) of aflibercept 8 mg patients achieved at least a 10-letter gain (2 lines on a vision test) and more than a quarter (28%) achieved more than 15 letters (3 lines on a vision test), compared to 35% and 18% for patients treated with EYLEA, respectively. Through 44 weeks, adverse events (AEs) in the study eye occurred in 38% (n=20/53) of both aflibercept 8 mg and EYLEA patients. There were no serious AEs of intraocular inflammation (including occlusive retinal vasculitis), and no anti-platelet trialists' collaboration (APTC)-defined arterial thromboembolic events. The most common ocular AEs that occurred more frequently in the aflibercept 8 mg group were vitreous detachment (4 aflibercept 8 mg, 2 EYLEA), conjunctival hemorrhage (3 aflibercept 8 mg, 2 EYLEA) and retinal tear (2 aflibercept 8 mg, 0 EYLEA). There was one patient death in the aflibercept 8 mg unrelated to treatment. \"After more than two decades of following the science in retinal diseases, we are very proud of our legacy helping millions of patients to retain or improve their vision with EYLEA, which has set a very high bar for any new treatment,\" said Wet AMD is the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years and older in the Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer. This new, concentrated high-dose aflibercept formulation enables a greater amount of medicine to be administered with each treatment, and could potentially extend the time between doses while retaining the efficacy and safety profile seen with EYLEA. Aflibercept 8 mg is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. About the Phase 2 Trial The Phase 2 randomized, single-masked CANDELA trial ( [NCT04126317](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3441258-1&h=1299289035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3268287-1%26h%3D262085559%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclinicaltrials.gov%252Fct2%252Fshow%252FNCT04126317%253Fterm%253Dcandela%2526cond%253DWet%252BAge-related%252BMacular%252BDegeneration%2526draw%253D2%2526rank%253D1%26a%3DNCT04126317&a=NCT04126317)) enrolled 106 treatment-na\u00efve patients with wet AMD. The trial was designed to investigate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of aflibercept 8 mg compared to the currently-approved 2 mg dose of EYLEA. Patients were randomized into two groups, with one group receiving aflibercept 8 mg (n=53) and the other group receiving EYLEA (n=53). Patients in both groups received three initial intravitreal injections (weeks 0, 4 and 8), before the primary endpoint was assessed at week 16, after which dosing was extended to every 12 weeks, or more frequently if required due to persistent or worsening disease. Efficacy was assessed via the presence of retinal fluid in the center subfield on optical coherence tomography at this timepoint. Trial participants were at least 50 years of age (mean: 77 years), mean baseline retinal thickness was 502.1 microns, and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ETDRS letter score was between 24 to 78 in the study eye (mean: 59 letters). About the Phase 3 Clinical Program There are two ongoing pivotal trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of aflibercept 8 mg versus EYLEA. In diabetic macular edema PHOTON trial ( [NCT04429503](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3441258-1&h=2585973112&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3268287-1%26h%3D1661156692%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclinicaltrials.gov%252Fct2%252Fshow%252FNCT04429503%253Fterm%253DNCT04429503%2526draw%253D2%2526rank%253D1%26a%3DNCT04429503&a=NCT04429503)). In wet Phase multi-center, randomized, double-masked PULSAR trial ( [NCT04423718](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3441258-1&h=3175486344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3268287-1%26h%3D2904091243%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclinicaltrials.gov%252Fct2%252Fshow%252FNCT04423718%253Fterm%253DNCT04423718%2526draw%253D2%2526rank%253D1%26a%3DNCT04423718&a=NCT04423718)) in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Across both trials, patients are randomized into one of three treatment groups, testing aflibercept 8 mg with dosing regimens at either 12- or 16-week intervals or EYLEA with an 8-week dosing regimen. IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS INDICATIONS EYLEA\u00ae (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA. - Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately. - There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies. ADVERSE REACTIONS - Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. - The most common adverse reactions (5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. - Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.
