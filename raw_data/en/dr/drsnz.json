Sivin This annotated bibliography covers science and medicine in traditional and modern China. It is organized as follows: HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN IMPERIAL CHINA [*](#HSIMP) Reference Works [*](#HSREF) General [*](#HSGEN) Science and Society [*](#SCISOC) Science and Philosophy [*](#SCIPHIL) Science and Religion [*](#SCIREL) The Early Encounter With Europe [*](#TRANS) Mathematics and Divination [*](#MATH) Astronomy (geomancy), Cartography, and Earth Sciences [*](#GEO) HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY CHINA [*](#BM20C) HISTORY OF MEDICINE IN IMPERIAL CHINA [*](#MEDIMP) Reference Works [*](#MEDREF) Studies Useful for Orientation [*](#MEDOR) Medicine and Related Topics [*](#MEDREL) Materia Medica [*](#MATMED) HISTORY OF MEDICINE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY CHINA [*](#MED20C) Reference Works [*](#MEDREF2) Medicine and Related Topics [*](#MEDRET) This list emphasizes recent publications, for two reasons. With respect to China before ca. 1800, the bibliographies in Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China (see below, p. [*](#SCC)) are extremely rich, and merely need to be supplemented. Although they are unannotated, the reader can easily use the indexes to find evaluations of sources. There is no correspondingly thorough survey for the last two centuries, but on the other hand a large part of the literature on that period published more than a decade ago is already obsolete. The obvious differences in the subdivisions of this bibliography reflect the varying character and extent of the literature in each category. Books on traditional medicine keep pouring out, most of them with no scholarly value, because, unlike the old astronomy, alchemy, and so on, medicine is still widely practiced and the commercial demand, outside China as well as inside, is enormous. Historians have conspicuously neglected recent technology and science. Most publications are concerned with policy about them rather than the work and the people who did them. Publications are included mostly because of their quality and usefulness, a few in order to warn readers that the promise of their titles is specious. Most of the books about Chinese medicine not listed here are of no use at all. HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN IMPERIAL CHINA Cullen, Christopher. 1983. Science and Medicine in China.

An Annotated Bibliography analytical annual bibliography of current sinological articles and books in humanities and social sciences published in Chinese, Japanese, and European languages.

Science across Cultures: An Annotated Bibliography of Books on Non-Western Science, Technology, and Medicine. Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 1597. London: Garland Publishing. Useful for cross-cultural studies, but not a first choice for China. Entries are neither comprehensive nor carefully chosen. Notes generally give an accurate idea of topics, but do not evaluate. It is impossible to tell whether an item is a classic or incompetent, an especially serious problem with respect to medicine. Selin, Helaine. 1997.

[*](#SCC)). \"The single work of scholarship which in our time has raised the banner of human unity most bravely and most triumphantly\" (Philip Morrison). Based on a great mass of scattered research in European languages and Chinese, and work in the sources by the author and several collaborators. Recent volumes are by other authors. Audacious, literate, and arranged for maximal accessiblity, with enormous bibliographies. Needham, Joseph, et al. 1969. The Grand Titration. Science and Society in East and West. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd. Needham's collected arguments for the primacy of social and economic factors in the conditioning of Chinese scientific achievement. Particularly important is \"Science and Society in East and West\" (190-217) and his survey of noncyclical time conceptions, \"Time and Eastern Man\" (218-298). One can follow in this collection of papers, published from 1944 on, the development and modification of the author's views. See the review in Journal of Asian Studies, 1971, 30: 870-873. Needham, Joseph. 1970. Clerks and Craftsmen in China and the West. Lectures and Addresses on the History of Science and Technology. Cambridge University Press.

Four informal lectures, of which only one is based on previously unpublished research. Perdue, Peter C. 1999. China in the Early Modern World. Short Cuts, Myths and Realities. Education about Asia, 4. 1: 21-26. Rebuts common misconceptions: that Chinese humanism was anti-scientific, that the government was intolerant of commerce, that people lacked freedom; emphasizes China's involvement in global system ca. 1500 on. Ronan, Colin A. 1978- . The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China. An Abridgement of Joseph Needham's Original Text. 3 vols. to date. Cambridge University Press. A readable but mechanical multi-volume condensation, which does not correct substantive errors, even those corrected by Needham in subsequent volumes of his series. Idiosyncratic short bibliographies. Skimming the original is likely to be more useful. Sivin, Nathan, editor. 1977. Science and Technology in East Asia. History of Science: Selections from Isis, 4.

Chinese Thought, Society, and Science. The Intellectual and Social Background of Science and Technology in Pre-modern China. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. A summing up by a substantial contributor to the history of Chinese philosophy. A major theme is that \"written Chinese has . . . hindered more than it has helped the development of scientific ways of thinking in China,\" but the book does not study the scientific and medical literature, and does not directly link early philosophy and later technical activity or society. Graham, A. C., translator. 1981. Chuang-tzu. The Seven Inner Chapters and Other Writings. London: George Allen & Unwin. By far the best translation to date of a classic influential upon attitudes toward Nature. For documentation see Graham, Chuang-tzu.

Excellent survey, with much attention to observational astronomy and instruments. Uses little important research by Japanese historians. Chinese astronomy was calendrical, that is, oriented toward the production of a complete ephemeris. Needham misleads the reader when he dismisses the calendrical problem as trivial, and deals with other aspects of astronomy as though they were autonomous. In most other respects accurate; in case of doubt, check sources. Schafer, Edward H. 1977. Pacing the Void. T'ang Approaches to the Stars. Berkeley: University of California Press.

A historical survey of alchemy (including the physiological and spiritual disciplines of internal alchemy ), mainly from the point of view of modern chemistry. This anachronistic bias often distracts from understanding what alchemists were trying to do; in particular, part 5 on \"physiological alchemy\" as \"proto-biochemistry\" is badly misleading, as are Needham's arguments that alchemy is essentially Taoist in some sense. The comparative study of Chinese, Islamic, and Hellenistic alchemy in vol.5, part 4, 323-509, is exceptionally useful if approached critically. Needham, Joseph.
