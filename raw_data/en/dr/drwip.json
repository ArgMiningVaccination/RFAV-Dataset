She is the author of several books on spirituality, including \"Physics, Philosophy & Nondual Spiritual Inquiry.\" Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on June 25, 2019 Central to Taoist worldview and practice is qi (chi). Literally, the word qi means \"breath,\" 'air\" or \"gas, but figuratively, qi is life-force\u2014that which animates the forms of the world. It is the vibratory nature of phenomena\u2014the flow and tremoring that is happening continuously at molecular, atomic and sub-atomic levels. This principle of a driving life force is, of course, common to many cultures and religious traditions. In Japan it is called \"ki,\" and in India, \"prana\" or \"shakti.\" The ancient Egyptians referred to it as \"ka\" and the ancient Greeks as \"pneuma.\" For Native Americans it is the \"Great Spirit\" and for Christians, the \"Holy Spirit.\" In Africa, it's known as \"ashe\" and in Hawaii as \"ha\" or \"mana.\" In China, the understanding of qi is inherent in the very language. For instance, the literal translation of the Chinese character meaning \"health\" is \"original qi.\" The literal translation of the character for \"vitality\" is \"high-quality qi.\" The literal translation of the character meaning \"friendly\" is \"peaceful qi.\" Many Different Kinds of Qi Practitioners of Chinese Medicine and qigong have identified many different kinds of qi. Within the human body there is the qi that we're born with, called Yuan qi or ancestral qi. The qi that we absorb during our lives from food, water, air and qigong practice is called Hou tain qi or post-natal qi. The qi that flows at the surface of the body, as a protective sheathe, is called Wei qi or protective qi. Each internal organ also has its own qi/life-force, e.g. spleen-qi, lung-qi, kidney-qi. According to Taoist cosmology, the two most fundamental forms of qi are Yin-qi and Yang-qi\u2014the primordial feminine and masculine energies. Many qigong practices utilize heaven qi and earth qi, as well as the qi that emanates specifically from trees, flowers, lakes, and mountains. Balanced and Free-Flowing Qi = Health The fundamental insight of qigong and Chinese Medicine (acupuncture and herbal medicine) is that balanced and free-flowing qi results in health; while stagnant or imbalanced qi leads to disease. This is true not only at the level of the human body, but also in terms of natural landscapes\u2014mountains, rivers, forests\u2014and man-made structures\u2014houses, office buildings, and parks. In the same way that an acupuncturist diagnoses energetic imbalances, and works to re-establish free-flowing qi in the human body, so does the practitioner of Feng Shui perceive energetic imbalances in natural or man-made landscapes, and then apply various techniques to remedy those imbalances. In both cases, the goal is to establish a more open flow of energy in the particular internal or external environment. We can understand Taoist ceremony, also, as being a form of qigong or Feng Shui, since specific actions and arrangements of ritual objects are used to invoke the flow of sacred energy. Like a powerful acupuncture treatment, the successful ritual opens a portal between the human realm and the realms of the spirits, deities, and immortals. Feeling the Qi The capacity to perceive the flow of qi directly\u2014to actually see or feel it\u2014is something that can be cultivated through training in qigong or acupuncture. Like any skill, some people are better at it than others. For some it seems to come \"naturally,\" for others it's more of a challenge. Even if it's not consciously cultivated or acknowledged, most of us can tell the difference between someone who has \"great energy\" and someone from whom we feel a \"bad vibe.\" And most of us are able to notice, when we enter a room, whether the atmosphere seems relaxed and uplifted, or tense and heavy. To the extent that we notice such things, we are perceiving the level of qi. Although we are typically in the habit of perceiving our world in terms of solid shapes and forms, Taoism teaches that we can train ourselves to perceive in other ways, and a good place to start is with our own human body. Though we may now experience our body as being rather solid, at a molecular level it is comprised mostly of water\u2014a very fluid substance! And at an atomic level, it is 99.99% space\u2014a vast (and infinitely intelligent) emptiness. As we practice qigong and Inner Alchemy, we cultivate the capacity to perceive at all of these different levels\u2014to feel ourselves and our world as fluid and spacious, as well as being filled with apparently-solid forms. As we become more adept at this skill, we become directly aware of the vibratory nature of all-that-is. Not only do we experience our bodies as being comprised of patterns and flows of qi, but also come to understand that \"emotions\" and \"thoughts\" are also forms of energy. These insights give rise then to the potential for newly-powerful and deliciously-creative action within this tremoring, vibratory world. Modern technology is thought to create significant interference with the natural flow of qi due to the prevalence of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) created by high-tension electrical power lines, microwaves, wi-fi signals and other atmospheric force-fields. Development of technological corrections for EMF radiation, such as EarthCalm EMF Protection - For A Healthy Home & Balanced Body-Mind, may offer some protection to assist the normal flow of qi. Some experts highly recommend various EarthCalm devices or other means of EMF protection as a shield against this electromagnetic \"smog.\" Those who practice Taoist yoga, meditation, qigong and martial arts, as well as those with particular sensitivities, may well want to consider such protections.
