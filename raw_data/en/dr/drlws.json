Led by Moshe Talpaz, M.D.\u2014an internationally renowned researcher who helped to develop Gleevec, one of the most effective targeted treatments developed for cancer\u2014the center is examining potential drugs and therapies for all types of cancer at the earliest stage of the FDA approval process. Phase 1 trials usually involve a small number of people who have not bene ted from currently available treatments. Patients who volunteer to participate are strictly monitored by faculty physicians, research nurses and data managers dedicated speci cally to the center. Emulating the overall Cancer Center's commitment to bringing clinicians and researchers together in one space, the Phase 1/Translational Research Center houses a labora-tory equipped to assess the biological impact of potential therapies used in the clinic. This dynamic model has already garnered interest from leading biotechnology and pharma-ceutical companies seeking to collaborate on this important work that could lead to tomorrow's cures.

We talked with Linda thomas, manager of tobacco Consultation services for u-m's m-fit program, about kicking the addiction. Q: How do you respond to people who think that because they already have cancer, there's no point in quitting? A: the research shows two things: first, people who have any type of cancer who quit smoking have better quality of life. Inflamma - tion in the lungs decreases, allowing more oxy - gen to flow, which helps with fatigue. second, if you look at studies examining the effects of lung cancer treatment, regardless of whether it's chemotherapy, surgery or radiation, life ex - pectancy is longer for those who quit smoking. Q: How do you know when you're ready to stop smoking? A: people who are addicted to a substance are never going to be 100 percent ready to quit. We tell people it's OK to love smoking and to want to continue to enjoy it, but if there's 51 percent of you that recognizes it's not good for you and you don't want to smoke, then it's time to start quitting. Q: What do you mean by \"start quitting\"? A: the average smoker makes nine to 11 quit attempts before becoming an ex-smoker. It's important to realize you're not weak if you've tried a couple times and haven't been successful. nicotine is a real addiction; staying off it requires management similar to any chronic disease. the only failure in quitting smoking is when a person quits trying to quit. THRIVE SPRIng 08 4fOrum start disorder they're self-medicating with nicotine. smoking becomes a coping mechanism: \"I feel bad, but when I smoke a cigarette, I feel better.\" Q: So it may become a way to cope with a cancer diagnosis then, too? A: guilt is a nasty emotion, and it's some - thing that can get in the way of the quitting. It's very easy for people to get caught in a cycle of \"I did this to myself, so why should I quit smoking?\" But it's a matter of learning to deal with the negative aspects of life the way non- smokers or ex-smokers deal with them. Instead of a cigarette, maybe you seek out a friend to talk to or learn to meditate. Q: What kinds of medications are available to help? A: nicotine replacement in the form of patches, gums, lozenges or inhalers can help prevent symptoms of withdrawal without exposing a person to the 4,000 other chemicals in cigarettes. Other options are Chantix, which blocks nicotine receptors in the brain, or the antidepressant Zyban, which has been shown to stave off cravings. Q: Why would someone need an antidepressant to help quit? A: the nicotine in cigarettes, sadly, serves pretty well as an antidepressant. And studies have shown that 45 percent to 55 percent of smokers may have an underlying depressive st pping The average smoker makes nine to 11 quit attempts before becoming an ex-smokerCLICK To learn more about how to get free help for quitting smoking, please call 734-936-5988 or e-mail quitsmok - ing@med.umich.edu .

How do you handle couples where only one person wants to quit? A: there needs to be some negotiation be - tween the person trying to quit and the person still smoking to make sure both feel like the other is being respectful. maybe you create smoking and non-smoking areas in your home, or you agree never to offer cigarettes to some - one trying to quit. Q: Do you have any suggestions for ways to cope with triggers that cause someone to crave a ciga - rette? A: It's not uncommon for me to have some - one come into my office and say, \"I'm ready to quit and I'm going to exercise instead.\" Well, if you smoke a pack a day, it's estimated that you spend about three hours and 20 minutes on smoking or smoking-related behavior; very few people are ready to exercise that much. It's important to develop a new menu of behaviors to replace smoking. Adjusting the daily routine is important, too. If you're used to reading the morning paper with a cigarette, maybe sit in a different chair or take a shower first instead. Q: Finally, if people you love smoke, how do you encourage them to stop? A: motivation has to come from inside. Lectures and guilt trips don't work, and if anything, may cause a smoker to become more entrenched in the habit. for some, money may be a motivator: a pack-a-day smoker could save over $2,000 a year on cigarettes. get them to start talking about what they want for the future; try to help them see that smoking won't help them achieve those goals. most impor - tantly, tell them how much you love them and that you're there to support them when they're ready to quit.

We've assembled some tips to help keep your conversations with friends and acquain - tances out of the weeds. Regardless of how positive your outlook, the flood of questions can be exhausting. Jose suggests appointing close friends or family members as spokespeople for you. Ask them to send out periodic updates to the circles of friends they know so you don't have to repeat every new development. Or, consider a Web site, like Care Pages. Avail - able through the U-M Cancer Center, this free Web site allows you to set up a page to post updates that people can access on a pass - word-protected basis. Let someone else do the talking.4 Center yourself.2 If someone starts prattling on about some - thing insensitive or inappropriate, don't hesitate to cut them off. Being direct doesn't mean you're rude. Chris Henrickson, a Cancer Center social worker, suggests you say something like, \"Thanks for your concern, but that's not something I really want to discuss.\" Then ask a question about a completely different topic to get the conversa - tion moving in another direction. If you can't redirect the discussion, walk away. Be prepared. 1 You know the questions will come. What's more important is how you will answer them. Think about what you're comfortable talking about and with whom. Take time to discuss your feelings with your closest family and friends so you're all on the same wavelength. Consider developing some standard replies so that you don't have to figure out what's ap - propriate each time someone new asks you a question. People react to the way you present information almost as much as to the infor - mation you present. Take time to get your own attitude toward cancer in order. Heather Jose, a nine-year survivor of stage IV breast cancer, used nutrition, exercise, visualization and prayer to complement the treatment she received at the U-M Cancer Center. Jose's mantra is \"Everyday I am killing cancer,\" which is also the subtitle to her 2004 memoir, \"Letters to Sydney.\" By adopting that kind of attitude, it helps others to take a positive approach as well. 3Learn to change the subject.8feAture st Ory THRIVE SPRIng 08 8CLICK For more resources, including links to Jose's Web site and Care Pages, please visit mcancer. org/thrive . In an effort to be helpful, sometimes people can take it too far. For Jose, it was frustrating when well-intentioned friends would try to carry her child for her because they thought she was too weak. Politely refuse any help that you feel is overstepping and let people know you are still capable of doing a lot, even if it's not as much as before. You are in charge of your own experience, and it's OK to have emotional needs, Henrick - son said. If someone says something insensi - tive, such as \"You're overreacting,\" make the choice whether it's healthier to distance yourself from that person or to try to clue the person in. Don't waste time on people who drain your energy. At some point, you may find that you and your family have more in common with other families affected by cancer. Seek out new friends via support groups and online forums to provide an outlet for thoughts and feelings that other people can't understand. Most people have different circles of friends and family; think of this as an addition to your social sphere, rather than a replacement. Everyone can't be in on the joke, but espe - cially with close family, friends and other survivors, find space for a little humor. Jose said she and her husband couldn't stop laugh - ing after her stem-cell transplant because she spent an entire day training to try to stand up for two minutes. \"People walking by prob - ably thought it was the psych ward,\" she said. \"Humor can be really helpful if you have the right people around.\" Keep a sense of humor.7 Show your strength.6 Don't apologize for your needs.5 Look for new relationships.8L fe, THRIVE SPRIng 089 vALerIe deLeKtA LAnded her f Irst JOB As An eLemen - tAry sChOOL mus IC teACher In the sum - mer Of 2006. the JOB mArKet In mIChIgAn WAsn't gre At, sO she reLOCA ted In Ju Ly tO AtLAntA, LeAvIng Be- hInd A neWLy re KIn- dLed re LAtIOnsh Ip WIth A BOyfrIend frOm COLL ege.fACing CAnCer in the pri Me of youthCOver st Ory the job was going well, and when she started to feel sick, she just assumed it was run-of-the-mill germs from the kids. she's always been kind of clumsy, so she didn't think too much of the bruises all over her body, either. In september, she finally went to the doctor and had some blood tests. the doctor called back on a sunday. she needed to go to the emergency room right away. three days later, at age 23, she was diagnosed with leukemia. \"down there, I had a job, even a good paying job for just being out of college,\" delekta said. \"And now I'm back here working part time, looking for substitute jobs and hoping next year to get a good permanent one.\" According to the Centers for disease Control, less than 4 percent of newly diagnosed cancers are found in patients between the ages of 15 and 39.thanks to Web sites like planet Cancer (planetCancer. com) and books like Crazy, Sexy Cancer Tips , young people are connecting, writing a new storyline for a dif - ferent kind of cancer experience. here at the u-m Cancer Center, help is available closer to home\u2014and in person. eighteen years ago, Jane deering, a Cancer Center social worker, started a support group for young adults after noticing some of her hodgkin's disease patients were un - comfortable talking to friends their own age who hadn't had cancer. \"As time went on, we learned that it wasn't just about people in active treatment. post-treatment patients had lots of issues that cropped up at different points during survivorship: starting a new relationship, trying to build a career, wanting to have a child, fears of recurrence,\" deering said. \"What really impressed and surprised me Cancer diagnoses in patients ages 15-39 account for about 4 percent of new cancer cases.

Like the Cancer Center's support group, the site is a safe haven where young adults can say whatever they need to\u2014even the stuff that would seem inappropri - ate or in bad taste in a different social setting. young people are young: they're irreverent, funny and ready to push back. Courtney Clark, director of mar - keting and development for the Web site and a two-year melanoma survivor, said the site reflects a certain silliness: she dubbed her tumor \"v oldewort,\" a take on the villain of \u0007 now\u0007a\u0007Cancer\u0007Center\u0007 social\u0007worker,\u0007was\u0007one\u0007 \u0007 of\u0007the\u0007original\u0007members\u0007 \u0007 of\u0007the\u0007Young\u0007Adult\u0007Support\u0007 Group. The hardest thing about being a young adult with cancer is being disconnected from where you should be in the world.\" \"Connecting with other young people with cancer is vital because older people with cancer don't view it the same way and younger people without cancer don't get it, she said. \"the hardest thing about being a young adult with cancer is being disconnected from where you should be in the world,\" Clark said. \"right when you should be focusing on building a life, you're fighting for your life instead. A lot of things get thrown off track, and you wind up with this disconnect from the people around you. that, to me, was the isolating part.\" That isolation is what Deering saw in an 18-year- old patient named Toni Spano. Diagnosed in 1989 with Hodgkin's disease, Spano was always social, but she found that her diagnosis changed relationships with friends. One of Spano's closest friends was there for her in the beginning, but as time went on, her friend found a new best friend. Cancer proved too heavy for her boyfriend, too. spano was one of the patients who inspired deering to start the support group; deering inspired spano, too. twenty years later, the hodgkin's survivor is a social worker at the Cancer Center herself. \"my friends went on doing what they were supposed to be doing,\" said spano- english, who is now married. \"I chose to isolate myself. Cancer wasn't as common then; people didn't go around bald. I tried to act normal, like nothing was wrong, and that put a lot of pressure on me.\" Tweeners of Medicine James geiger, m.d., a pediatric surgical oncologist at the u-m Cancer Center, said this age group faces a lot of unique stresses, stresses that pediatric oncologists may be better equipped to handle. missing school and related social activities can be alienating. \"It's really important to involve the patient in deci - sion-making,\" he said. \"many do better when they feel like at least they have some control.\"THRIVE SPRIng 0811for delekta, the cancer diagnosis helped to solidify her relationship with her boyfriend, phil. After her diagnosis, phil, a doctoral student in u-m's Cellular and molecular Biology program, flew to Atlanta to visit dur - ing her 40-day stay in the hospital. the two were play - ing a game after delekta's blood stem cell transplant. As delekta was downing her cocktail of pills for the night, phil got down on his knee, pulled out a ring he had designed and proposed to valerie. \"It was a really fun time despite it being crazy,\" delekta said. \"It certainly isn't a good thing that cancer happened, and I wouldn't necessarily say I'm glad, but at the same time, I've learned so much and grown closer to people. I wouldn't be living up here and married already. I'm enjoying it.\" the delektas would like to have children, but they know that v alerie's fertility may be compromised by her treatment. Like other young cancer patients, she'll just have to wait and see. Which is what spano-english had to do, too. she had prepared herself and her husband, nick, for the possibil - ity that she might not be able to have children. she had known others in the support group who adopted, but at age 37, she gave birth to a baby girl, erin. \"every time I'd talk with the doctors, they would tell me that there's really no test. the only way you'd know is if you try,\" spano-english said. \"I call my daughter an angel, and she truly is.\" For Jason Zao, that meant maintaining a long-held goal: graduating at the top of his class at Plymouth- Canton High School. Diagnosed with a brain tumor at 16, Zao was determined to take on as much as he did before he had cancer. Ten years later, he still thinks it was a good goal\u2014he did graduate at the top of his class\u2014but he had to make adjustments along the way. After a second brain surgery and some time off, Zao enrolled at the university of michigan in 2000, but it turned out to be too much. Instead, he graduated from Washtenaw Community College with an associate's de - gree in Web design before moving on to eastern michi - gan university, from which he graduated in April with a bachelor's of science in teaching and health education. \"When I first joined the y oung Adult support group, I was very angry with the situation,\" said Zao, who, be - cause of the poor job market, has gone back to school for another teaching endorsement in social studies. \"But even the first year, it just got a lot easier. It felt good talking about it with the group and getting to know people. I feel good about still going even after cancer and being able to help other people.\" The Disease, Not the Horoscope And the group is trying to nudge Zao a bit, too. Although he's been talking about dating for the past year or two, it still doesn't seem like the right time, he said. But some of the group members keep telling him they're going to help him write a profile for match.com. dating can be tricky for young people who have had cancer. What do you tell? And how early in the relation - ship should you talk about it? spano-english always let people know pretty early on. \"In some ways, it's a scare tactic,\" she said. \"I'd throw it out there, and if they couldn't handle it, why put in the time now? I'd rather not get too attached.\"It felt good talking about it with the group and getting to know people.

But that can be confusing for people who have maintained heart-healthy, low-fat diets. And increasing calorie intake can wreak havoc on sugar levels for people with diabetes. talk with your health-care team about your new dietary needs. If you have diabetes, don't eat less to avoid high blood sugars; it can cause weight loss. y ou may find that you need to ask your physician to adjust your medications. the key is to get the biggest bang for your bite. If you aren't comfortable pouring whole milk over your morning Cheerios, then maybe try adding a banana spread with peanut butter. pack your diet with natural, whole-grain foods, rather than highly refined, processed food. shop the perimeter of your grocery store, where you'll find fruits, vegetables, dairy prod - ucts and lean meats. Be leery of packaged foods, even if they claim to be \"low fat,\" \"healthy\" or \"all natural.\" these foods tend to contain extra sugars and sodium, and have lower overall nutritional value. making radical shifts in your diet can be upsetting, especially if you thought you've been following the right course to manage other health problems. It may make sense for you to talk with a member of our psychOncology team to help work through the added stress a new way of eating can bring.

Case-by-case evaluations are available to all cancer patients in our clinic. your health may be complicated right now, but eating doesn't have to be.Maintaining a stable weight during treatment is key. Although you may need to eat more fat than usual, it's important to choose wisely. Rather than butter and cream, consider unsaturated fats high in omega 3s. These types of fats come from plants, but are also found in fish. Here are some examples: HEALTHy FATSby Joan Daniels, R.D., and Nancy Burke, R.D.

The Hutchinson study showed that between 14 percent and 32 percent of cancer survivors started taking supplements after diagnosis. Women, people with higher levels of education and breast cancer survivors were more likely to use supplements. In addition, between 26 percent and 77 percent of can - cer survivors reported using multivitamins, compared with one-third of the general population. Brenner said using a multivitamin won't hurt, but that most people can get the vitamins and minerals they need by eating a balanced diet. Most people do not need more nutrients than the Rec - ommended Dietary Allowance, guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help people develop nutritional goals. A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology showed that cancer patients and survivors are more likely than the general American population to use vitamin and mineral supplements, despite potential risks. The study, conducted by researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, reviewed 32 studies on supplement use among adult cancer patients and survivors between 1999 and 2006. It found that between 64 percent and 81 percent of survivors reported using supplements, as compared with 50 percent of the general population. \"People think if a little is good, a lot is better, and that's plain not true. It can be worse,\" said Dean Brenner, M.D., a U-M professor of internal medicine and pharmacology who was not involved in the study. Brenner cited a study showing that certain doses of THRIVE SPRIng 0815\"All you have to do is go into a so-called health food store to see the huge amounts of formulated materials with outrageous claims. Our researchers took a field trip recently to one, and we just shook our heads and said, 'Where do these claims come from?'\" Brenner said. \"There is no evidence that there is any benefit to taking anything beyond the RDA. Individuals with requirements exceeding the RDA should be evaluated and cared for by a competent physician.\" FEW BREAST CAnCER SURgEOnS DISCUSS RECOnSTRUCTIOn OPTIOnS, U-M STUDY FInDS reconstruction with their surgeon before their surgery. Patients were also asked whether knowing about reconstruction options affected their decision.Only a third of patients with breast cancer dis - cussed reconstruction options with their surgeons before their initial surgeries, according to a recent U-M Cancer Center study in the journal Cancer . What's more, women who did discuss recon - struction up front were four times more likely to have a mastectomy. \"For women who have the option of either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, long-term outcomes are the same regardless of which surgery a woman chooses. But that choice could have significant impact on a woman's quality of life, sexuality and body image. It's important for women to understand all of their surgical options\u2014including breast reconstruction\u2014so they can make the best choice for themselves,\" said study author Amy Alderman, M.D., M.P .H., assistant professor of plastic surgery at the U-M Medical School. The study looked at 1,178 women from the Detroit and Los Angeles metropolitan areas who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Patients were contacted about three months after diagnosis and were asked whether they had discussed breast The researchers found that younger and more educated women were more likely to discuss reconstruction with their surgeon\u2014and that this discussion significantly affected a woman's treatment decision . Breast reconstruction can be performed immedi - ately after a mastectomy, which removes the entire breast. This type of reconstruction leads to better aesthetic outcomes and psychological benefits for the patient, compared to delayed reconstruction, previous studies have shown. \"To many women, breast reconstruction is a symbol of hope that they can get past this cancer diagnosis. Reconstruction is not necessarily the right option for every woman and not everyone is going to choose reconstruction, but I think it's important that every woman is informed of what the benefits of reconstruction can be for their physical and emotional well-being,\" Alderman said.
