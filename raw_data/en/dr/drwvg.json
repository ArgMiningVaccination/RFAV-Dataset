I can only assume they had all read an article suggesting that popping a zinc pill would act as a cure-all. If you are ever swayed by such articles, I'd like to offer you a few words of warning. Many readers don't realise that some articles written by nutritional therapists are either directly or indirectly commissioned by companies which manufacture supplements and who clearly have a vested interest in promoting sales. Some journalists, furthermore, find it quite difficult either to gain access to unbiased research or to consult independent nutritional consultants and practitioners. On top of this, far too many therapists are either not sufficiently qualified to make a sound clinical judgment or have been offered a financial incentive to sell certain supplements. Because many therapists are paid a share of the profits of such sales, journalists and patients who consult them may be given subjective, rather than objective, advice. The incorrect prescribing of supplements was recently highlighted by Which Health (published by the Consumers Association). It was highly critical of food therapists, concluding that, as a body, they had a 'haphazard and inconsistent approach'. The report cited the experiences of undercover researchers who reported symptoms of irritable-bowel syndrome (IBS) to 14 nutritional therapists. The report's findings included the following criticisms: Five of the therapists made no reference to the researchers' GPs, and only three recommended that the researchers should consult their doctors. The dietary advice given by most of the therapists was general healthy-eating advice rather than information about how to combat the reported symptoms of IBS. Some dietary advice that was given was simply wrong, for example, recommending carrot juice as a good source of calcium. Products were recommended or sold at 12 of the consultations. These included vitamin and mineral supplements, digestive enzymes, linseed oil, blue-green algae, lecithin granules, psyllium husks, herb and vitamin mixtures and probiotic supplements. Yet according to an expert consulted by Which Health , 'only two of these (probiotic and psyllium husks) were considered as possibly beneficial'. One of the most dubious products sold (for \u00a316.95) was a bottle of aerobic oxygen, which, according to a Which Health expert, would provide no more oxygen than a glass of water. In summary, Which Health 's research shows the nutritional therapists consulted were not only giving poor advice, but that many were also not referring people with potentially serious problems to their GPs. These findings do not surprise me. You may recall that last year I explained the difference between dieticians and nutritionists, a distinction that I think is worth repeating. Dieticians must hold a dietetic degree or diploma (having previously received a degree in a related subject) and must also work within the medical profession - they cannot see people without a medical referral. In addition, dieticians are regulated by both the British Dietetic Association and the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. Nutritionists, nutritional therapists, food therapists or diet therapists - or whatever they style themselves - are not currently regulated by any legal body, with the result that anyone can set up in practice. While I, along with the Consumers Association, do recognise some organisations, such as the Society for the Promotion of Nutritional Therapy, the British Association of Nutritional Therapists (BANT) and the Institute of Optimum Nutrition (ION) - none of these are regulated by law, which means that we cannot rely on their standards of care. Indeed, Which Health found that 'the performance of the BANT nutritional therapists wasn't any better than that of the other therapists'. For its part, BANT says that by choosing a BANT-registered therapist you have the assurance that the therapist is insured and that you furthermore have the benefit of a body to complain to should you be unhappy with your treatment. The best way in which to safeguard your health - and your wallet - is to contact the British Dietetic Association (0121 616 4900) and ask for its list of state-registered dieticians (SRDs). In order to qualify for the SRD accreditation, dieticians must work within the medical profession and cannot give you specific advice until you have officially registered with them as a patient. (This professional stipulation explains why I cannot answer a reader's individual health or therapeutic queries. Unless you are registered with my practice as a patient, I can only give general advice.) Although it may sound pedantic, this rule serves to protect you. For the majority of people, food can be a marvellous healer, but incorrectly prescribed, food can also cause devastating damage. To give just one example, if your dietician doesn't know that you are taking the antidepressant drug monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and recommends you eat more cheese, the consequent interaction between the drug and the cheese could be fatal. This is why it is vital you are referred to a dietician by your GP. Remember, too, that dieticians are barred from selling nutritional supplements, although they can recommend a particular supplement and dosage. Unfortunately, many doctors won't offer to refer you to a dietician because they don't believe that diet can play a role in helping you to overcome your particular condition (which may be why some people consult nutritionists who don't require a referral from a GP). Quite understandably, many medical practitioners whom I have questioned don't have confidence in the dietetic or nutritional professions because they feel they cannot rely on the qualifications of nutritionists and don't fully understand the distinction between dieticians and nutritionists. Yet I firmly believe doctors should be in favour of referring people to dieticians. After all, changing someone's diet can improve their health without the need to resort to expensive medication and treatments. Finally, back to zinc; one of the most popular supplements being prescribed at the moment. This element performs many important functions within the body, including maintaining a healthy immune system. A deficiency of zinc may result in a loss of appetite, the slow healing of wounds, skin complaints and sexual problems ranging from a low libido through a low-sperm count to sterility. It is vital that you don't take more than 15 to 20mg of zinc a day, however, because excess zinc can cause your body to become more susceptible to bacterial infections (which may explain why some people develop chest infections after they have taken a zinc supplement to get over a cold). In order to ensure their zinc levels remain balanced, I prefer to encourage my patients to eat more zinc-rich foods, from which the body will absorb only what it needs and no more. Such foods include shellfish and canned sardines, turkey, duck, goose and lean meats like beef, lamb and, pork, as well as liver and kidneys. Parmesan and other hard, or crumbly, cheeses, including Cheddar, also contain high levels of zinc, as do eggs, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pulses, nuts and seeds (also in peanut butter and tahini), dried apricots, fresh peas and, finally, passion fruit. You should ideally include one of these rich sources of zinc in your daily diet, perhaps in the form of a sandwich made with wholemeal bread, Cheddar cheese and tomato chutney, or one of my own favourite childhood snacks, tinned sardines on warm toast. If you don't like or eat many of these foods, consult a dietician for advice on alternative options. "}
