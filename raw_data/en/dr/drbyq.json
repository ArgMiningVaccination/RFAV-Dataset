Early detection is possible with a blood test that measures prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme linked to cancerous changes in the prostate, a walnut-sized gland wedged between a man's bladder and urethra. Though PSA is produced normally by the prostate gland, elevated levels can indicate a variety of conditions, including cancer. Every 2.4 minutes a man is diagnosed with prostate cancer and every 18 minutes another man dies. Nationally, the disease will strike more than 220,000 times this year and take nearly 29,000 lives, according to the American Cancer Society's 2003 Facts and Figures . Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. African-American men are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer as white or Asian men. The American Urological Association recommends both a digital rectal exam and a PSA test after age 50, and earlier for African-American men or those with a direct family history of the disease. Recent enhancements to the blood test allow physicians to analyze how much of the PSA enzyme is \"free,\" or unbound to protein. According to a recent study in the journal Urology, men at high risk should be tested to determine the percentage of free PSA. The greater the \"free fraction,\" the less doctors worry about cancer. Prostate cancer can grow very slowly or with devastating speed. Although professional groups differ in their PSA testing recommendations, many physicians believe that early detection is the only safeguard against the most lethal form of the disease. Doctors do know that prostate cancer isbeing found earlier\u2014and the death rate is going down.PSA Perspectives Before a power outage strikes, have a radio, flashlight and can opener on hand. Don't rush to the store only to find all the D batteries gone. Get ready for winter storms or other cold-weather emergencies by stockpiling bottled water, prepared foods and blankets. Keep a pair of comfortable walking shoes at work, so you won't have to face an emergency in high heels or tight wingtips. Always keep a small amount of cash handy and the gas tank half full. Pr epare a \"disaster kit\" for home and office that includes: Battery-operated radio Hand can opener Flashlight Cell phone Essentials like toilet paper In the unlikely event that Hartford Hospital's cogeneration facility(which supplies power to the hospital) and the local electric company were tofail simultaneously, the hospital's emergency diesel generator would begin to draw on underground fuel tanks. \"Last summer's power grid blackout across the Northeast caused a few internal problems,\" says senior engineer Mark English, \"but even with that voltage sag the hospital never lost power.\" Blackout Basics3Arthur Tarantino, M.DPHYSICIAN PROFILE What scares a man more than loss of virility? The trade- mark blue pill called Viagra has become so popular since itsintroduction five years ago that nine tablets are dispensed worldwide every second . Four out of five men have found that Viagra works, adding up to sales of $919 million in the United States. A faster-acting competitor called Levitra has recently entered the market, backed by an advertising blitz targeted to the National Football League's weekly audience of more than 100 million male viewers. On the sidelines, waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration after success in Europe is Cialis, dubbed \"the weekender\" because of its long-lasting effects. According to the most recent figures from the National Institutes of Health, up to 30 million Americans experience chronic erectile dysfunction (ED), while transient difficulties strike half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70. Men with even mild ED, embarrassed by their inability to perform, may avoid sex altogether and sink gradually into impotence. ED may arrive with shocking suddenness after treatment for prostate cancer. Lying beneath the bladder, the prostate gland is surrounded by vital nerves that can be damaged despite a surgeon's best efforts to spare them, while radiation can affect the delicate neurovascularstructures that lie on top of the prostate. \"Treatment effects from prostate cancer account for only a fraction of ED patients compared with the vast numbers of men with benign prostate conditions or vascular problems caused by poor blood flow,\" says Arthur E. Tarantino, M.D., aHartford Hospital urologist. \"ED is often a silent symptom of cardiac disease.\" Physicians are investigating crucial links between ED and cardiovascular problems that appear to be associated with inflammation of blood vessels. Men who take nitrate-based drugs forangina can't take Viagra because of life-threatening risks to the heart. Drugs like Viagra are not aphrodisiacs\u2014they enhance blood flow, not libido\u2014and only work when the man is sexually excited. Though Viagra lasts up to four hours, it doesn't mean a manwill be aroused the whole time, just that he has a four-hour \"window\" of time. Though it takes more than great sex to make a happy marriage, intimacy does enliven a relationship. Even occasional ED can have a dampening effect on a satisfying sex life. \"The wife or partner has to be equally enthusiastic about sexual intimacy with a man who is taking Viagra,\" explains Dr. Tarantino. \"A lot of research is going into ways to enhance the experi- ence for women.\" \"We spend so much time worrying about his performance that everything is focused on him,\" says Donna (not her real name), whose husband has been cancer-free for five years after prostate surgery. \"Sometimes I feel like I should forget about sex and just be grateful he isn'tdying.\" Common side effects of Viagra include headache, facial flushing and upset stomach and, less commonly, blurred vision. \"When his eyes are bloodshot and his face is red as a beet, I knowhe's taken a pill,\" says Donna. \"He gets a massive sinus attack and can't breathe as blood swells the membranes in his nose. Viagra even makes him ticklish. It certainly ruins spontane- ity, but luckily we have an open relationship and can talk about what is and isn't working.\" After attending a support group at Hartford Hospital for family members and partners of men with prostate cancer, Donna recalls being amazed at the openness of the discussion. \"Here was a group of guys sitting around talking about sexual performance in intimate detail,\" shesays. \"My husband calls it the 'reluctant brotherhood' of who need Viagra.\"Arthur E. Tarantino, M.D., a Board-certified urologist with Connecticut Surgical Group, was recentlyelected president of the medical staff at Hartford Hospital. A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Georgetown UniversitySchool of Medicine, he did his residency in urology at the Lahey Clinic nearBoston, Massachusetts. An assistant clinical professor of surgery at theUniversity of Connecticut, Dr. Tarantino is on the faculty of the urology residency program at UConn Health Center. He is part of a team thatteaches a procedure called hand-assisted laparascopic nephrectomy,an innovative method for removal of cancerous kidneys developed atHartford Hospital. When he's not in the operating room, heenjoys spending time with his wife and two young daughters, playinggolf, traveling, antiquing and reading everything from junk novels tobiographies. Sexual Healing4What's going around... News & Breakthroughs Anti-Viral Veggies Broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts inhibit the growth of both oral and genital types of herpes virus, according to prelimi- nary research presented at the recent InterscienceConference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. The American Social HealthAssociation says up to 80 percent of adults in the U.S. have oral herpes andabout one in five has genital herpes.Race for the Cure Breast cancer survival rates continue to rise, says the American Cancer Society, thanks to early detectionand better treatments for the disease. But the disparity between whiteand African-American women is widening. African-American womenare 30 percent more likely than white women to die of breast cancer, whichaccounts for nearly one out of three cancers diagnosed in U.S. women.Pet Theory Despite a long-held belief that cats and dogs contrib- ute to childhood allergies, evidence is mounting thatpets may actually reduce allergy risk. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immu-nology says new studies confirm that babies raised in a home with two ormore cats or dogs are less likely to develop allergies than kids raised withoutpets.Eyes on A Gene A defective gene is toblame for age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that typicallyafflicts those 65 and older. Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University have pinpointed the mutated gene, reports Human Molecular Genetics.Eight million Americans suffer from the disease, which blinds victims bydestroying the central part of the retina.Cryoablation for Liver Cancer Dr. Rocco Orlando P I O N E E R I N G Because it is one of the most malignant forms of cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) is a disease that has traditionally been very difficult to treat. Each year, up to 1.25 million people die from liver cancer worldwide. Patients suffering from the disease generally have a poor prognosis. Surgical removal of liver tumors, traditionally the only curative treatment option, is the \"gold standard\" against which all other therapies are measured. Although removalof the tumor improves survival, only about 35 percent of patients are candidates for surgery. For others, minimally invasive \"ablation\" of the tumors\u2014a process that destroys the tumors without removing them\u2014may be possible. \"There are two options for ablation\u2014fire and ice,\" explains Rocco Orlando, III, M.D., a surgeon with Connecticut Surgical Group at Hartford Hospital and professorof clinical surgery at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.\"Fire,\" or radiofrequency (RF) ablation, is an innovative treat- ment for some patients whose liver tumors can not be removed surgically. It is useful for those with only a few lesions and isgenerally used for palliation rather than cure. \"Ice,\" or cryoablation, is the process of using ultrasound-guided probes to destroy cancer cells at freezing temperatures. RF ablation is usually performed using ultrasound and image- guided placement of a special needle to \"burn\" away tumors.Cryoablation, by comparison, is a minimally invasive on laparoscopic techniques to \"freeze\" laparoscopic solid organ surgery, thelatest frontier in minimally invasive surgery, further expands asurgeon's ability to cryoablate large liver tumors. During cryoablation, an argon gas-filled probe forms an ice ball that encompasses the tumor. The tumor is frozen, thawed, andrefrozen until the malignant cells are completely destroyed. The freeze-thaw process is monitored with ultrasound in order topreserve as much nearby healthy tissue as possible. \"Ultrasoundguidance during laparoscopic exploration enables the surgeon tolocate preoperatively diagnosed lesions and establish thepresence of additional lesions,\" explains Dr. Orlando. Cryoablation is used to treat tumors that have originated in the liver or have spread to the liver from another site. Cryoablationis often used as an alternative or an adjunct to conventionalsurgery. Widely metastatic (spread) disease is not generallytreatable with cryoablation, although the technique can becombined with the placement of an implantable pump thatdelivers doses of chemotherapy agents over three to six months. Without treatment, the median survival time is less than a year and only about 1 percent of patients with malignant livertumors survive as long as five years. \"Most patients with livertumors are not candidates for transplant since the drugs usedfor immunosuppression often allows the cancer to run wild and cause rapid recurrence,\" says Dr. Orlando.5Here's to Your Health The ingredient in red wine that makes it healthy for your heart may also be good for your lungs, according to the journal Thorax. The anti-inflamma- tory effects of resveratrol,an antioxidant compound found in the skins of grapes and other red fruits,may slow the progression of the lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease (COPD).MS Goes Up in Smokers Multiple sclerosis is nearly three times higher in men who smoke and about twice as high in women smokersthan nonsmokers, warn researchers in Norway and at Harvard University. One in 200 American women are at risk for the disease, in which immune cells mistakenlyattack and destroy the fatty material that sheathes nerve fibers.Hepatitis Hope An experimental drug couldbe a new weapon against hepatitis C, a disease that afflicts more than 170million people around the globe. Nature reports that the new drug, the first in aclass called NS3 protease inhibitors, targets an enzyme to block viralreplication. No vaccine exists against hepatitis C, which causes permanentliver damage and death.Dad's Lethal Legacy Your father's genes may be to blame for some cancers, according to the U.S.National Cancer Institute. The father's genome seems to have the ability toaccelerate growth, while the mother's genome has the ability to retard growth.When an early genetic bal- ancing process goes wrong, it may spur a tumor's out-of-control cell growth and contribute to the formation of some cancers.An estimated 16 million Americans have osteoarthritis, the most common type of degenerative joint disease. As the disease progresses, sufferers lose more and more of the cartilage layer that cushions joints. Because of the ex- tremely high forces on our hips, these joints are frequentlysubject to the arthritic process. The disease often starts in middle age, and since the Baby Boomer generation is aging, a growing number of active people may become candidatesfor total hip replacement (THR). A decade ago, orthopedic surgeons were reluctant to perform THR in younger patients for fear that an artificialhip would wear out quickly in more active individuals. But new high-tech materials now hold promise for long-term durability. Inaddition, recently developed minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques are bringing shorter hospital stays, smallerscars and dramatically faster recovery times. Only recently, hip-replacement surgery required a foot-long incision, deep muscle cutting and retraction to expose and replace the damaged joint. As the result of a collaborative effort between manufacturer Zimmer, Inc. of Indiana and the orthopedic surgeryteam at the Rush-Presbyterian Hospi- tal in Chicago, a radically new ap- proach to performing THR was devel-oped, called two-incision MIS hip replacement . This new, fluoroscopicallyguided procedure enables surgeons to perform the operation without open exposure. Blood loss is minimized and the risk ofinfection and dislocation potentially reduced. \"With this new MIS method, we don't detach any muscle from bone,\" explains Steven F. Schutzer, M.D., a Hartford Hospitalorthopedic surgeon who performed the first two-incision MIShip joint replacement in New England. \"We simply retract themuscle layers, reach in with special instruments and use the fluoroscope to guide the procedure. All it takes is a 1 1/2 inch incision in the buttock for placement of one component anda 2-inch incision in the groin for the other component.Patients have done remarkably well.\" Since last February, when he performed the first two-incision MIS hip replacement, Dr. Schutzer has offered the minimally invasive surgery to a select group ofyounger patients interested in an acceler- ated rehabilitation program and able to care for themselves at home afterward. Thegoal is for these patients to be discharged home with physical therapy and nursing services within 24-48 hours of the proce-dure. Close follow-up of these patients, as part of a national and international study, will ultimately determine whether there areany other as yet unrecognized potential longterm benefits of the two-incision MIS total hip replacement surgery.Two-Incision Hip Replacement Surgery T H E N E W M E D I C I N E Dr. Steven Schutzer6si n s arning g w Mononucleosis Mononucleosis (called mono for short) is caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes family. The infection is usually passed from one person to another by kissing. Though the virus is found in saliva and mucus, mono spreads much less easily than the common cold.Generally, you can only get mono once. Signs of mono usually develop from four to six weeks after exposure to the virus. Symptoms include: fever sore throat h eadache white patches on the back of the throat swollen lymph glands in the neck f atigue and lethargy lack of appetite enlarged spleen (rare) The infection usually occurs in people 15 to 35 years old. Physicians confirm a diagnosis of mono with bloodtests that show an elevated white blood cell count, an increased percentage of certain atypical white blood cells, and a positive reaction to a \"mono spot\" test.Symptoms generally last about four weeks before the infection goes away on its own.Cardiologists often advise patients to take a single 81-mg. \"baby\" aspirin dailyto reduce the risk of recurrent heart attack or stroke.

Some say the \"Rx\" symbol is an ancient invocation to the Roman god Jupiter, while others credit the Egyptian god Horus\u2014 the one in the pyramid on the dollar bill. The real history of pharmacy, however,begins with the Chinese, whose herbal medicine dates from at least 3,000 B.C. Today, digital technology is shaping the pharmacy of the future. The U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion has proposed new regulations that will require \"bar coding\" of all prescription medications, some over-the-counter drugs and vaccines. Though there is as yet no industry standard, the FDA is proposing rules to require digital labeling of almost all medications and blood productsas part of a wide-ranging effort to improve patient safety. \"Patient safety always comes first,\" says Gregory Gousse, B.S., M.S., FASHP, director of Hartford Hospital's Department of Pharmacy Services. The hospital is considering a system for inpatient bar coding. Before dispensing a drug, nurses would pass a bar code reader like those seen in stores overtheir identification badge, over the medication and then over the digital bar code on a patient's wristband. The readout would show the name of the drug, dosage, any alerts based on the patient's status and the badge number of the person who last administered the drug. The hospital's Pyxis dispensing machines already provide a safeguardagainst errors by making drugs available to nursing staff only after the correct information has been checked and input into a computerized medication profile.it the leading cause of death of American women. Nearly two thirds of the women who die abruptly from a heart attack have nowarning symptoms. \"Women over age 50 and men over age 40 should take an aspirin every day toreduce their risk of a first heart attack,\" warns Paul Thompson, M.D., director ofpreventive cardiology atHartford Hospital. \"Talk to your doctor first to makesure you don't have anycontraindications for aspirintherapy, such as an ulcer orstomach bleeding.\" At the first sign of a heart attack , chew \u2014don't swallow whole\u2014one regular who Pharmacy Factsheart attack as regular- strength aspirin, with lesschance of gastrointestinalupset. Every year, nearly 500,000 women in the United Statessuffer a heart attack,makingthat aspirin breaks up sticky artery-clogging platelets thatblock blood flow. \"We haveseen patients with classicheart attack symptoms arrive at the hospital with their arteries open after taking anaspirin.\" Women are especially likely to benefit from aspirin therapy since their bloodvessels tend to be smaller. Women with narrowed arteries are likely to have aheart attack\u2014though the same is not true for men, according to the Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion. Even more ominous is the fact that half of allwomen will die from a first heart attack compared with only a third of men. Womenoften worry more about breast cancer, while heart disease\u2014the number-one killer\u2014strikes one in three. 7Dementia once was considered an inevitable consequence of the aging process, afflicting a large percentage of the population to varying degrees. In recent decades we have come to see this debilitating feature of aging as the product of illness, and in more recent years, have developed treat- ments that can slow its progression. Dementia affects approximately 12 percent of people over age 65 and nearly half of people over age 85. While there are many causes, Alzheimer's disease is the diagnosis in about two-thirds of patients with dementia. Not long ago,a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was determined largely by a process of elimination, that is, by determining that other causes were not present. But today, researchers havebeen able to identify the particular impairments that Alzheimer's disease causes in memory, language, personality, functioning and judgment. Alzheimer's disease, named after the German physician who first described it in 1906, follows an irreversible and disabling course. Cognitive ability and memory gradually decline as the disorder destroys areas deep within the brain. Not all memory loss is Alzheimer's disease, however, but the illness can now be diagnosed with a high degree of accuracy and distinguished from other types of dementia. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is an important first step for a patient because other conditions can look like the illness but would require different treatments. \"There are more than 150 causes of dementia,\" says Robert Dicks, M.D., director of the geriatrics program at Hartford Hospital.\"Most aren't reversible, but other conditions can be treated to prevent further deterioration. Dementia can be caused by conditions as diverse as Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism,vitamin B 12 deficiency or a medication mix-up.\" Scientists know that aging brains affected by Alzheimer's disease develop large numbers of amyloid-containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that interfere with theactivity of the brain and make thinking go awry. ResearchersDefining Dementia are closing in on a better understanding of what causesamyloid to accumulate and hopefully to find ways to stem the destructive process. Living longer increases the probability of suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which now afflicts 100,000 people in Connecticut and as many as 4 million people across theUnited States. A recent survey found that drug companies are testing more than 800 potential medications for diseases associated with aging. Early diagnosis of memory disorders is critical, according to Karen Blank, M.D., a senior research psychiatrist at TheInstitute of Living who evaluates elderly patients for symptoms of dementia. \"Medications have been convinc- ingly shown to delay the deterioration that leads tonursing home placement,\" she explains. \"Drugs such as Aricept, Reminyl and Exelon, which belong to a class of medications called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, have proven to be effective at slowing the process of deteriora- tion. In addition, a promising new drug called Memantine that was first used in Europe was recently approved by theFood and Drug Administration as the first treatment specifically approved for late stages of the disease.\" But she cautions against giving false hope to families of themost severely ill patients. The Institute of Living/Hartford Hospital will soon be opening a Memory Assessment and Research Center specializing in the evaluation of cognitive impairment and the early detection of dementia. The Center will providestate-of-the-art initial assessment using an interdiscipli- nary team model and will provide consultation to referring physicians regarding differential diagnosis, dementiatreatment, and availability of resources. The Memory Assessment and Research Center will be integrated into the continuum of care for patients with dementia and will bedesigned to compliment existing clinical and research programs in Neurology, Geriatric Services, and Psychiatry. 8Non Profit Organization U.S. Postage PAID Hartford, CT Permit No. 436180 S EYMOUR STREET HARTFORD , CT 06102-5037Cook'sCircle Ingredients 2 small (or 1 large) jicama* (2 cups when sliced) 2 medium oranges, peeled and sliced1 cup of sliced beets (canned or fresh steamed) 1/4 cup crushed peanuts 2 cups romaine lettuce (may be chopped or used whole as base) Vinaigrette dressing 3 tablespoons olive oil1 tablespoon vinegar 1 teaspoon honey 2 tablespoons orange juicesalt and pepper to taste (optional) Arrange a bed of lettuce on a large serving platter, then add the remaining vegetables\u2014first thejicama slices, then the oranges, then the beetsin the center.
