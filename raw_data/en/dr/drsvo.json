It is highly addictive. It is ruining too many lives across our country... Our nation is committed to protecting our citizens and our young people from the scourge of methamphetamine.\" \u2014George W. Bush, President of the United States March 9, 2006 The President's National Drug Control Strategy describes the Administration's strategic approach for reducing illicit drug use in the United States. The Administration's Synthetic Drug Control Strategy is a companion to the National Strategy . It fol\u00ad lows the main principles set out in the National Strategy : that supply and demand are the ultimate drivers in all illicit drug markets and that a balanced approach incorporating prevention, treatment, and market disruption initiatives (such as interdic\u00ad tion, arrests, prosecutions, and regulatory interventions) is the best way to reduce the supply of, and demand for, illicit drugs. 1 The Synthetics Strategy also adheres to the format of the National Strategy by setting ambitious goals for reducing syn\u00ad thetic drug use at a rate approximating 5 percent each year. Specifically , the Synthetics Strategy outlines a strategy for reducing past\u00admonth methamphetamine use by 15 percent over three years and past\u00admonth prescription drug abus e 2 by 15 per \u00ad cent over three years. Additionally , because the production of methamphetamine poses significant human and envir onmental risks, the Administration has also set a goal of reducing domes\u00ad tic methamphetamine laboratories by 25 percent over three years. This and past administrations have traditionally avoided promulgating drug control strategies focused on a single drug or a single categor y of drugs. However , the unique natur e of illicit markets for synthetic drugs warrants a targeted response, partly because those markets contain unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Unlike marijuana or cocaine, for example, either the final synthetic drug (as with prescription drugs) or its ingre\u00addients (as with methamphetamine) are designed for legal pos\u00adsession and use. Other reasons include the extreme health and environmental problems associ\u00ad ated with the production of drugs such as methamphetamine and the indisputably destructive nature of methamphetamine use itself.

A number of documents incorporating those discussions in a more comprehensive manner have already been published. Among them are the National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan (October 2004) 3 and the govern\u00ad ment's Interim Report (May 2005)4 on the imple\u00ad mentation of that plan. The former outlined recom\u00ad mendations for action by the executive and legisla\u00ad tive branches of the Federal government; the latter reported on progress in enacting those recommen\u00addations. The Synthetics Strategy is the culmination Prevalence (2005). 2004 National DHHS Pub. No. SMA 05\u00ad4062, Rockville, MD.

It is additionally important because of two ways in which it differs from, and supersedes,5 the Action Plan . First, the Synthetics Strategy sets measurable goals for success. Second, it does not simply make recommendations for government action, but in fact commits the Administration to a concrete course of action designed to achieve the aforementioned goals by the end of the President's second term in office. The Synthetics Strategy adher es to the following outline. Following this introduction, it describes the state of the illicit markets for methamphetamine and controlled substance pr e\u00ad scription drugs, including pr ogress made over the last several years. It then sets targets for reduced numbers in three principal categories: illicit methamphetamine use, domestic metham\u00ad phetamine laboratories, and the illicit use of controlled substance prescription drugs. This por\u00ad tion explains the fundamental principles and insights guiding the Synthetics Strategy and describes how performance goals will be measured. Next, the document describes the strategy itself, explaining how , given the cur rent state of the illicit synthetic drug market, the Administration will meet targets for use and production by the end of 2008. Here, both supply reduction and demand reduction activities are addressed for both methamphetamine use and contr olled substance prescription drug abuse. Finally , the end of the document addresses the problem of responding to the aftermath of methamphetamine production. Improving our knowledge about the health and environmental consequences of methamphetamine labs is criti\u00adcally important towar d improving the safety and security of Americans, including the childr en who are found in or near toxic laboratories. 3 National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan , October 2004, Office of National Drug Contr ol Policy , U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 4 Interim Report from the Interagency Working Group on Synthetic Drugs to the Director of National Drug Control Policy, Attorney General, and Secretary for Health and Human Services , May 23, 2005 , printed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Washington, DC. 5 The National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan contained 46 action recommendations. The status of these is reported in the Appendix. The Synthetic Drugs Interagency Working Gr oup will continue to work on implementing recommendations and discussing progress. 2 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Continuing Progress: A Status Report The implementation of the President's National Drug Control Strategy has produced results. Data regarding drug use trends since 2001 support the notion that national strategies utilizing prevention, treatment, law enforce\u00ad ment, and other market disruption tools can contribute to sustained reductions in drug use. The goal of the Synthetics Strategy is to build upon the successes of the National Strategy by focusing on the use and production of methamphetamine and on the non\u00ad medical use of controlled substance prescriptions. Recent positive developments include decreases in the past\u00admonth use of any illicit drug among youth6 by 19 per cent7 and past month use of methamphetamine use by 36 per cent8 since 2001. Similarly , the use of steroids dropped dramatically among youth from 2001 to 2004 with the use of steroids down 38 percent, 37 per \u00ad cent, and 30 percent for lifetime, past year, and past\u00admonth use, respectively. The past\u00admonth use among teens of hallucinogens and LSD use is down by nearly two\u00adthirds, as is past\u00admonth Ecstasy (3, 4 methylenedioxy\u00admetham \u00ad phetamine, or MDMA) use. Marijuana use has also dropped in all three cate\u00adgories: 13 percent for lifetime use, 15 percent for past year use, and 19 percent for past\u00admonth use, decreas\u00ading 28 percent among 8th graders (from 9.2 percent to 6.6 percent), and 23 percent among 10th graders (from 19.8 percent to 15.2 percent).

After peaking with more than 17,500 laboratory incidents reported in 2004, data for the first 10 months of 20059 show a substantial and significant reduction in methamphetamine laboratory incidents (15,203 in the first 10 months of 2004, compared to 11,189 in the first 10 months of 2005\u2014a 26.4 percent reduction). Since 2002, the number of domestic \"super labs\" reported\u2014those methamphetamine laboratories with a production capac\u00ad ity estimated at 10 or more pounds within a 24\u00adhour period\u2014has posted a dramatic decline, falling from 144 in 2002 to just 38 in 2005, due largely to Federal law enforcement interven\u00adtions at our shared border with Canada and to cooperation with Canadian authorities to stem the smuggling of pseudoephedrine into the United States. With a new anti\u00admethamphetamine law 10 recently passed by the United States Congress and signed by the President\u2014the strongest Federal anti\u00admethamphetamine legislation enacted in our Nation's history\u2014the Administration seeks to continue such reductions. Nationally, concern regarding the illicit use or production of methamphetamine continues, due to the uniquely destructive nature of methamphetamine itself; the increase in domestic methamphetamine laboratories during the late 1990s and early 2000s 11 and their environmental impact; the eastward migration of methamphetamine use and production across our Nation; the growing presence of methamphetamine super labs in Mexico; and the growing control of the U.S. methamphetamine market by Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Concerns also con\u00ad tinue regarding the nonmedical use of controlled substance prescription drugs, the fastest\u00adrising categor y of drug abuse in recent years.12 The production and use of methamphetamine and the nonmedical use of controlled substance prescription drugs ar e among the Administration' s fore\u00ad most concerns related to illicit drugs. However , decreases in teen drug use seen since 2001 and the drop in methamphetamine laborator y numbers are positive developments upon which to build. The Administration is committed to continuing this momentum. In light of both the overall progress observed in recent years and the ongoing challenges our Nation faces r egarding the illicit use, distribution, and production of synthetic drugs, a report to the American people on the government's strategy to use both traditional and new tools to fight methamphetamine and the nonmedical use of controlled substance prescriptions is timely and important. Setting Targets First released in February 2002 for this Administration, the President's National Drug Control Strategy set specific and ambitious targets for reducing drug use in America. The National Strategy called for a 10\u00adpercent reduction over two years, and a 25\u00adpercent reduction over five years, in the current (past\u00admonth) use of any illicit drug in America. It set these goals 9 Methamphetamine laboratory numbers tend to be complete after six months. As of the date of publication, methampheta\u00ad mine laboratory number data were current through October 2005. 10 USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 , Public Law 109\u00ad177. 11 El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), Clandestine Laborator y Seizure System (CLSS). 12 Substance and Mental Health Services Administration (2004).

Comparably, the Synthetics Strategy contains three primary goals. The first two are a 15\u00adpercent reduction in both methamphetamine use and prescription drug abuse in the overall population (ages 12 and up) by the end of 2008, using 2005 as the baseline. These two goals are set for the following reasons. First, these tar\u00ad gets adhere to the goals of the National Strategy in that they are focused on decreasing use by approximately five percent a year. Second, recent statistics on drug use are encouraging and indicate that these goals are achievable, as noted in the section above detailing recent trends in drug use and production. Unlike the National Strategy , the Synthetics Strategy does not consider youth synthetic drug use a separate performance measure, because the average age of metham\u00ad phetamine initiation is 22.1 years. 13 Similarly, for most prescription drug abuse, the average age of initiation is in the 23-25 age range. Like the National Strategy , future reports on the Synthetics Strategy will measure trends in the illicit use of methamphetamine and prescription drugs using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health . The Synthetics Strategy will measure declines in the use of two synthetic drug groups\u2014methamphetamine and illicit prescription drugs\u2014as primary indicators for performance measurement. It will not include as a pri\u00ad mary perfor mance measure other synthetic drugs, such as Ecstasy and LSD. This is for two reasons. First, methamphetamine and prescription drugs cur rently con \u00ad stitute the primar y synthetic drugs of national concern. The destructive nature of methamphetamine use and production is well documented. 14 Prescription drugs, as noted earlier, constitute the most prevalent drug use cat\u00adegory in the area of synthetic drug abuse. Second, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health , an annual government report, already measures use for all drugs, including club drugs, on an annual basis. 15 For those reasons, future reports outlining the progress of the The 18-25) abuse (12-17, 18-24) Decrease in meth ER admissions Decrease in prescription drugs ER admissions I ISynthetic Drug Control Strategy: Setting T argets and Measuring Pr ogress Primar y Measuring T ools National Survey on Drug Use and Health El Paso Intelligence Center , Clandestine Laborator y Seizur e System Secondary Indicators Decline past\u00adyear initiates of meth (12-17, Decline in past\u00adyear initiates, prescription drug ncrease in age of initiation for meth Increase in age of initiation for prescription drugs ncrease in perception of risk 13 The President's National Drug Control Strategy , by contrast, considers youth illicit drug use a separate goal, partly because the age of initiation for the most commonly used drug, marijuana, averages 18.0 years, and also occurs at younger ages. 14 See, e.g., White, S.R.

Only lifetime measures, as opposed to current (past\u00admonth) drug use measures, will be available. 5 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Synthetics Strategy will include information on use trends for these other synthetic drugs, but will not utilize that data as a primary performance measurement tool. It is important, however, to acknowledge the difficulty of accurately measuring a 15\u00adpercent change in the use of methamphetamine and prescription drugs. Methamphetamine users and prescription drug abusers account for only 0.2 percent and 2.5 percent of the population, respectively. A 15\u00adpercent change, therefore, is equivalent to a fluctuation of 0.03 percent and 0.375 percent, respectively, of the overall population. The actual numbers\u2014a reduction in 87,000 methamphetamine users and 901,000 prescription drug abusers\u2014would save thousands of lives and be momentous for individuals, their families, their communities, and the Nation as a whole. However, measuring fluctuations of this degree in the overall population of the Nation is rather challenging from a statistical perspective. Future reports on the Synthetics Strategy will also cite additional data to help identify progress toward the goals for reducing the illicit use of methamphetamine and controlled sub\u00adstance prescription drugs. Although the National Survey will be the primary tool utilized in per\u00ad formance measurement, future reports from the government on the implementation of the Synthetics Strategy will also include secondary indicators that will add additional dimensions to understanding and measuring the Administration's performance. The following seven trends will also be used to evaluate the overall success of the Administration's Synthetics Strategy : 1. A decline in the number of past\u00adyear initiates in the 12-17 and 18-25 age ranges for methamphetamine (Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health ) 2. A decline in the number of past\u00adyear initiates in the 12-17 and 18-25 age ranges for prescription drugs (Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health ) 3. A decrease in the number of emergency room admissions related to methamphetamine (Source: Drug Abuse Warning Network ) 4. A decrease in the number of emergency room admissions related to prescription drug abuse (Source: Drug Abuse Warning Network ) 5. An increase in the average age of initiation for methamphetamine (Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health ) 6. An increase in the average age of initiation for prescription drug abuse (Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health ) 7. An increase in the percentage of youth who report perceived risk associated with both methamphetamine and prescription drug abuse (Source: Monitoring the Future ) Meanwhile, there are several other data sets that merit observation but contain inherent limi\u00ad tations. The concern with some data sets\u2014indicators such as the numbers of arrests, treatment admissions, and drug seizures\u2014is that a rise in those numbers could arguably be interpreted as a positive development or a negative one, depending upon the circumstances; the same is true for a decline in those numbers. For example, an increase in methamphetamine\u00adrelated arrests in a given city might be due to enhanced law enforcement focus on the problem, but it also might 6 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY be because there is more methamphetamine in that city. For this reason, monitoring of three commonly used indi\u00ad cators\u2014arrests related to synthetic drugs, methampheta\u00ad mine seizures at the Southwest border, and the number or rate of treatment admissions for synthetic drugs\u2014will be interpreted in a context that explains some larger trend. Increases or decreases in these numbers, standing alone, will not be considered indicative of more or less synthetic drug use in America. The third primary performance objective of the Synthetics Strategy \u2014reducing domestic methamphetamine laboratories by 25 percent\u2014will measure laboratories seized within our borders in 2008, using 2005 as a base\u00adline. The Administration is concerned about the uniquely destructive and poisonous nature of methamphetamine laboratories. Much of the national concern over metham\u00ad phetamine pertains as much to its domestic production as to its use. There were approximately 17,500 16 methamphetamine laboratory incidents17 in 2004 within our borders\u2014up from about 9,000 in 2000. Final numbers for 2005 will not be available until later in 2006, but early figures indicate a 26.4\u00adpercent reduction (January to October 2005, compared to the same 10\u00admonth period a year earlier). The Administration is committed to continuing this positive trend by working with States to effectuate significant and dramatic reductions in methamphetamine laborator y numbers by the end of the Pr esident's second ter m in office. If the 26.4\u00adpercent reduction is continued for the r emainder of 2005, the Administration estimates that ther e will have been 12,000-13,000 methamphetamine laborato\u00ad ry incidents in the United States during 2005. The Administration aims for laborator y incident numbers of approximately 10,500 or less in 2008, which would represent a nearly 25\u00adpercent reduction in lab numbers over three years, or a 40\u00adpercent reduction from 2004\u2014the year in which aggressive State\u00adlevel restrictions on the retail sale of pseudoephedrine were effective in several States. Meth 16,224 2003: 17,458 2004: 2005 15,203 lab incidents 11,189 lab incidents Source: El Paso Intelligence Center, Clandestine Laboratory Seizure System The chief means of measuring the number of domestic laboratories within the United States will be the Clandestine Laborator y Seizur e System (CLSS), a function per formed by the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC). 16 Repor ts from States regarding the number of labs seized in 2004 are not yet complete\u2014an issue discussed in this report. For the purposes of this section discussing targets, we note that at the time this document was drafted, lab numbers for 2004 stood at about 17,450 and were not expected to go above 17,600 once final figures were tallied. 17 The EPIC CLSS definition of \"methamphetamine laborator y incident\" includes operational methamphetamine laboratories, chemical dumpsites, and combinations of glasswar e and chemical precursors to methamphetamine that appear to have been or gan\u00ad ized in contemplation of producing the drug. 7 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Methamphetamine Supply: A Concurrent International and Domestic Focus The most urgent priority of the Federal government toward reducing the supply of metham\u00ad phetamine in the United States will be to tighten the international market for chemical precursors, such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine,18 used to produce the drug. Most of the methampheta\u00ad mine used in America\u2014probably between 75 and 85 percent\u2014is made with chemical precursors that are diverted at some point from the international stream of commerce. The remainder of the methamphetamine is produced from chemical precursors that are purchased at the wholesale or retail level and diverted for use in illicit production in the United States. Although domestic enforcement continues to be a priority, the impact of State laws controlling retail access to precur\u00ad sors, together with Federal, State, and local enforcement efforts, has had a significant impact on the domestic production of methamphetamine. As a result, a larger proportion of methampheta\u00admine consumed in the United States is now coming across the border as a final product, com\u00ad pared to that which is produced domestically in small, toxic laboratories (STLs). 19 Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Status as of April 2006 WA CNH MThe International Market: Methamphetamine producers Methamphetamine source countriesPseudoephedrine/ephedrine exportersTaiwan Philippines Singapore 18 This document will frequently use the term pseudoephedrine to generically describe three chemicals commonly used as methamphetamine and amphetamine precursors: pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpr opanolamine. 19 STLs are defined as laboratories with a methamphetamine production capacity of less than 10 pounds in a 24\u00adhour period. 9 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Until May 2005, when the Interim Report was released, the domestic methamphetamine mar\u00ad ket was generally described as being sourced from two types of methamphetamine laboratories: domestic and foreign superlabs,20 which were estimated to account for 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the country, and STLs, which were estimated to account for approxi\u00ad mately 20 percent of the methamphetamine used in the country.21 Despite the small proportion produced by the STLs, the small labs themselves constituted more than 99 percent of all methamphetamine laboratory incidents within the United States. A point of concern was the indisputable rise in domestic laboratory seizures, peaking at approximately 17,500 in 2004. Starting with Oklahoma in April 2004, States began to respond to the methamphetamine lab problem by enacting a variety of restrictions on the retail sale of over\u00adthe\u00adcounter cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine. Some States, including Oklahoma, restricted the sale of pseu\u00ad doephedrine to pharmacies. At the time the May 2005 Interim Report was released, reliable data regarding the impact of these laws was just beginning to emerge from a handful of these States. Federal policy makers began to reassess the methamphetamine market, and were asked to reevaluate the relative market share of superlabs and STLs using data which were recent but not yet wholly affected by the new State\u00adlevel regulations. Three general factors were consid\u00adered: the relative numbers of each type of domestic laboratory seized, the estimated production capacity of each of those laboratories, and the amount of methamphetamine seized at the United States border. Based on these data, the Administration estimated in the Interim Report that 65 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States came from the larger labs, both domestic and foreign, and up to 35 percent came from STLs that wer e solely domestic. These data suggested that small labs wer e collectively gaining and operators of larger labs were losing market share. This was consistent with what com\u00admunities were reporting: more methamphetamine labs. With the passage of restric\u00ad tions in 2005 on the retail sale of pseudoephedrine in about 35 States, along with continued law enforcement ef forts by Federal, State, and local authori\u00ad ties, the percentage of metham\u00ad phetamine consumed in the United States originating from STLs appears to have decreased, and law enforcement is reporting that much more of the methamphetamine seized appears to be coming from superlabs. Although new State\u00adlevel restrictions have proven to be successful, they never theless affect primarily the STLs, not the domestic and foreign superlabs.

An associated dynamic appears to be the move of those superlabs to outside our coun\u00ad try. This is bolstered by the decline in domestic superlab seizures between 2002 and 2005. Restricting the methamphetamine supply requires coordinated efforts by Federal and State authorities. The Federal government provides significant assistance to State and local law enforcement in responding to STLs, and will continue to do so. But the Federal government car\u00ad ries the primary responsibility for disrupting the share of the market belonging to the operators of the larger laboratories in foreign settings. Federal, State, and local governments share respon\u00ad sibility for attacking the large domestic laboratories. Although effective precursor control can and does work to limit supply, the methampheta\u00ad mine market is so fluid that it is critical to inhibit supply concurrently at both the international and local levels to prevent the shifting of market share among superlab and STL operators. The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy There are three fundamental aspects to the Federal government's strategy to tighten the inter\u00ad national market for pseudoephedrine and similar precursor chemicals: first, acquisition of better information about the international trade in pseudoephedrine and similar chemicals; second, swift and effective implementation of the methamphetamine\u00adrelated provisions included in the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (\"Combat Meth Act\") of 2005; and third, continued law enforcement and border control activities, in particular, continued partnership with Mexico. In order to more effectively address the trafficking of methamphetamine, Federal law enforce\u00ad ment needs better information about the trade in precursor chemicals. Law enforcement has found that when a producer country exports the precursor chemical, shipments may be inter\u00ad cepted or diverted to another country. After leaving the exporting country, precursor chemicals will often be diverted to a transit country and leave the legitimate stream of commerce. From that point, the chemicals are made available to clandestine lab manufacturers for the production of methamphetamine. The methamphetamine comes across the border into the United States as a finished product. The more that the DEA and its foreign law enforcement counterparts know about where these chemicals are produced, how much is produced, where the shipments are supposed to go, and\u2014just as critically on the receiving end\u2014how much of the chemical a coun\u00ad try realistically needs to meet health and industrial needs, the more effective law enforcement can be in working with counterparts in other nations to ensure that these chemicals do not end up in methamphetamine laboratories. There are established methods of acquiring this information when the United States is a party to a transaction involving methamphetamine precursor chemicals. The more difficult problem lies in law enforcement acquiring this information when the United States is not a party to the transaction. Generally speaking, when the United States is neither the recipient nor the sender of the original precursor chemicals, United States law enforcement does not have access to infor\u00ad mation about the transactions. Such information would allow law enforcement to conduct more effective investigations, starting at the source of an otherwise legal product. 11 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY The State Department and the DEA currently work with the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) to acquire more complete, accurate, and timely information about international chemical transactions to which the United States is a party. The INCB regularly publishes annu\u00ad al assessments of the legitimate scientific and medical needs that countries have for substances classified as Schedules I through V drugs under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and the Single Convention on Narcotics of 1961. This information is helpful to exporting and importing countries because if a country is attempting to export more than the amount published in the annual assessment for the receiving country, the INCB may request that the exporting country suspend the shipment until the authorities of the receiving country confirm the legitimacy of the import request and authenticate the import documents. Previously, the INCB collected information on pseudoephedrine and similar methampheta\u00ad mine precursors, but it was able to provide the information only to the countries that were par\u00ad ties to the international transaction. An additional problem is that the prevailing interpretation of the applicable international convention makes it optional for countries to regulate pharma\u00ad ceutical preparations containing precursor chemicals (products that contain those chemicals in combination with other chemicals). This is unfortunate, for diversion of pills containing pseu\u00ad doephedrine is the predominant means of supplying almost all small labs and many large labs in North America. Pseudoephedrine is easily extracted from these over\u00adthe\u00adcounter drugs. Due to these concerns, the Administration has worked with allies in the international commu\u00ad nity to draft, promote, and adopt a resolution on synthetic drug precursors, particularly methamphetamine precursors, at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), which is the central policy\u00admaking body within the United Nations sys \u00ad tem dealing with dr ug\u00adrelated matters. The CND is charged with analyzing the world drug situ \u00ad ation and developing proposals to strengthen the inter national drug control system. In Mar ch 2006, the CND adopted the synthetic drug precursor resolution proposed by the United States and cosponsored by a number of CND member nations. The resolution requests countries to permit the INCB to share shipment information on phar\u00ad maceutical preparations containing methamphetamine precursors with law enforcement and regulatory authorities to prevent or interdict diverted shipments. The resolution also requests countries to provide information on all shipments of these chemicals and the associated pharma\u00ad ceutical preparations. Mor eover , the resolution encourages all countries to provide estimates of legitimate requirements for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenyl\u00ad2\u00adpropanone as well as pharmaceutical preparations. Finally, the resolution requests importing countries to ensure that impor ts of these substances and preparations containing the substances ar e commensurate with legitimate requirements. Acquiring information about an international transaction to which the United States is not a party is not without precedent. For example, the United States and Mexico have obtained a commitment by Hong Kong to prenotify the receiving country before shipment and not to ship chemicals to the United States, Mexico, or Panama until receiving an impor t permit or equiva\u00ad lent documentation. This is important because Hong Kong has in the past been a source of pseudoephedrine tablets diverted to methamphetamine labs in Mexico. Using this model, it is a 12 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY priority of the Synthetics Strategy for the United States to reach similar agreements with other producing countries, the most significant of which are Germany, China, and India. The State and Justice Departments will continue to develop procedures with producer countries in order to obtain general information about global precursor chemical transactions. Chemicals diverted anywhere in the world can and do end up as methamphetamine consumed in America. The Administration's efforts to develop these procedures have already begun and will contin\u00ad ue throughout 2006. Twice in December 2005\u2014at the United States/European Union Troika meeting on December 7 and subsequently at the meeting of the Joint Chemical Working Group established by the United States/European Community Chemical Control Agreement on December 16\u2014the Administration laid the groundwork for a higher level of information shar\u00ad ing. These central concerns have also been raised in subsequent international meetings. The Administration has set a goal of reaching agreement on these points by the end of 2006 or earli\u00ader if possible. While the relevance of such information to law enforcement is paramount, the Administration recognizes that it may also be considered commercial. As such, the United States will pledge to use this information only for law enforcement purposes and not in the furtherance of any com\u00ad mercial objectives. Many countries that are already fighting the methamphetamine problem, including those in the Asian region, recognize the importance of sharing such information. The second prong of the Federal government's strategy to tighten the international precursor market involves implementation of the Combat Meth Act. This important legislation, passed by Congress and recently signed by the President, contains a comprehensive set of regulations designed to help tighten the market for pseudoephedrine and other chemical precursors to methamphetamine. The provisions in some States' chemical control laws wer e adapted, setting a Federal r egulator y floor while allowing more aggressive State restrictions. In addition to setting a nationwide baseline standar d for the retail sale of products containing pseudoephedrine, the new law eliminates loopholes in the law that methamphetamine traffickers exploited. The Combat Meth Act contains other important provisions that are relevant to international efforts. Among the provisions of the new law that will affect large lab operators are enhanced criminal penalties for methamphetamine cooks and traffickers; requirements for estimates of the impor t and expor t market for pseudoephedrine, which help the Administration better under \u00ad stand and restrict the illegal international trade of pseudoephedrine; and new requirements regarding production quotas for precursor chemicals. The Administration is committed to imple\u00ad menting and utilizing the new tools provided by Congress in the Combat Meth Act. The new law contains a number of provisions that address retail sellers and purchasers of products containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, requiring, among other provisions, that these products be kept behind store counters or in a locked cabinet not accessible to customers; that the retail seller maintain a written or electronic list of transactions involving these products; that the purchaser display a government\u00adissued identification car d and sign the logbook; that the seller may not sell more than 3.6 grams of the products in a daily period, or 7.5 grams of the product in a 30\u00adday period to the same customer; and that an individual may not knowingly or intentionally purchase mor e than 9 grams in a 30\u00adday period. As of April 8, 2006, nonliquids 13 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY (tablets, capsules, and gel capsules) of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine may no longer be sold in bottles at the retail level; instead, they must be sold in blister packs. While some of these provisions have already taken effect, others will take effect on September 30, 2006. The Combat Meth Act further requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to issue regulations and criteria, such as criteria for the written or electronic logbook maintained by the seller and regulations establishing an Internet\u00adbased program to provide employee training criteria to retailers and allow retailers to certify compliance with the training requirements. The DOJ is working expeditiously to publish these criteria and regulations. Additionally, the Combat Meth Act provides the DEA with additional control over the spot market for pseudoephedrine products. Currently, importers or exporters must notify the DEA about shipments coming into the United States, as well as the amount and purchaser of the product. Prior to the passage of the Combat Meth Act, once a transaction had been approved by the DEA, the importer or exporter could substitute a purchaser without notifying the DEA if the original purchaser dropped out of the transaction. Under the new law, if the originally declared sale by the importer or exporter falls through, and if the transaction would otherwise require 15 days advance notice (i.e., not to a \"regular customer\" abroad or a \"regular importer\" at home), the importer or exporter will be required to file a second notice with the DEA identifying the new proposed purchaser. The DEA will then have 15 days to review the new transaction and decide whether it presents a sufficient risk of diversion to warrant suspen\u00adsion of the transaction. The Combat Meth Act further provides the DOJ with the authority to establish pr oduction quotas for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, utilizing the pr eexisting model for production quotas of controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II.22 In establish \u00ad ing the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) each year for other controlled substances, the Department, through the DEA, relies on the following sources of information and will do so for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (defined as scheduled listed chemical products under the Act) as well: industr y data provided through applications for pr ocurement quota and manufacturing quota, which includes information relating to inventory, production, and sales data; information from DEA\u00adregistered manufacturers regarding product development and r esear ch efforts; export requirements; information on medical need as provided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); prescription and sales data provided by various vendors; and information relating to diversion and abuse. Once the APQ is established, the DEA can provide DEA\u00adregister ed manufacturers with manufacturing and procurement quotas, thereby fulfilling its requirements under the Act. In accordance with the r equir ements of the Combat Meth Act, the DOJ will submit on a semiannual basis a report to Congress that describes the allocation of the resources of the DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the investigation and prosecution of violations of the Controlled Substances Act involving methamphetamine and describes the measures being taken to give priority in the allocation of resources involving these violations. Similarly, the 22 See 21 U.S.C. 826. 14 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Department of Transportation (DOT) will submit biennial reports regarding the designation of chemical precursors as hazardous materials. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will submit a report based upon information collected from law enforcement, States, and other relevant stakeholders identifying byproducts of the methamphetamine production process and identifying those byproducts that constitute hazardous waste. Also, the new law requires the State Department to identify the five largest exporting coun\u00ad tries and the five largest importing countries of chemicals such as pseudoephedrine.23 The Combat Meth Act also requires the State Department to issue a report certifying these countries' cooperation with the United States in the area of methamphetamine chemical precursor control; noncompliant countries will, under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, be subject to penalties. In these cases, the State Department will submit a report to Congress, within 180 days after the determination is made, outlining a comprehensive plan to address the diversion of chemicals from these countries. As of the time of this publication, the Administration had already begun work on these estimates. Briefly stated, 19 companies export ephedrine to the United States, and 20 export pseudoephedrine to the United States. These are located in India, Germany, France, Declared Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine Imports: 1990 to 2004 (Bulk and Combo Products) Kgs 0100,000200,000300,000400,000500,000600,000700,000800,000900,0001,000,000 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004PSE CP and Bulk Ephedrine CP and Bulk Source: Drug Enforcement Administration. 23 The Administration notes that the United States reexports significant amounts of products containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine and is expected to rank among the top five exporters. 15 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Switzerland, Canada, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Belgium, and Italy. Consistent with the Combat Meth Act, the first report will be provided to Congress no later than March 2007. In addition to the resolution at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs previously referenced, the United States will continue to raise the importance of better estimating the legitimate need each country has for pseudoephedrine and other precursors. Mexico has determined its legiti\u00ad mate need and sharply reduced its authorized imports for 2006. As indicated above, the Administration will also begin the process of determining the legitimate domestic need for such products, consistent with the Combat Meth Act. The target date for completing this is January 1, 2007. Accurately estimating the legitimate market in the United States for pseudoephedrine and sim\u00ad ilar chemicals will be a challenge. However, data already available indicate a correlation between the growth in methamphetamine labs in America and the growth in imports of pseu\u00ad doephedrine. Between 1990 and 2004, the population of the United States rose 19 percent, while pseudoephedrine imports rose 262 percent, and ephedrine imports were up 59 percent. 24 There is a legitimate and lawful need for these products, and some portion of the increased demand may be due to the popularity and effectiveness of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, to suggest that the acceleration in the increase in pseudoephedrine imports compared to population growth is entirely due to legitimate demand, or is because of a staggering increase in the number of cold sufferers, ignores the simple fact that methamphetamine production in the United States went up during this time period. Clearly, some percentage of the increase in pseu\u00addoephedrine imports was fueled by the demand for methamphetamine in our own country. The thir d prong of the international precursor strategy is to continue working closely with Mexico through aggressive law enforcement activities against precursor traf ficking and metham \u00ad phetamine production and trafficking, and to strengthen border protection at our shared border with Mexico. Improving our bilateral ef forts with Mexico to prevent methamphetamine smug \u00ad gling, working with Mexican law enforcement, and encouraging the Mexican government to reduce precursor chemical diversion are also called for in the Combat Meth Act. Toward that end, the United States has been helping Mexico train and equip methamphetamine\u00adfocused law enfor cement teams to combat the spread of methamphetamine production in Mexico. The Administration will continue its efforts to assist Mexico with its enforcement efforts by provid\u00ading laborator y cleanup and investigation training for Mexican law enforcement. Thus far , the DEA has provided three training courses on methamphetamine to 80 Mexican investigators and 18 prosecutors, as well as chemical equipment for the purpose of responding to methampheta\u00ad mine labs. The DOJ Narcotic and Dangerous Dr ug Section and the DEA offices in Mexico, with assistance from several U.S. Attorney offices, conducted two workshops for selected Mexican prosecutors in early 2004 and late 2005. Another important development involves Mexico's own regulatory strategy to restrict access to the ingredients used in methamphetamine. Through its Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitar y Risks (COFEPRIS), Mexico is implementing several impor tant 24 Source: Drug Enfor cement Administration. Companies importing these products ar e required to submit import figures to the DEA under 21 USC. 16 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY controls on pseudoephedrine. Those already in effect include limiting retail sales to pharmacies, placing pseudoephedrine behind pharmacy counters, and limiting sales quantities. In addition, Mexico has recently imposed a policy of limiting imports of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to manufacturers. Wholesale distributors are barred from importing raw pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, importers can import only shipments of no more than 3,000 kilograms at any one time. Such restrictions will assist in denying ingredients to the large clandestine labs. Mexico has also taken the important step of imposing import quotas tied to estimates of licit demand, or the actual national need for pseudoephedrine. A recent study conducted by Mexico's government revealed that there was a significant excess of pseudoephedrine imports over Mexico's estimated licit needs. Accordingly, authorities are working to restrict pseu\u00ad doephedrine imports to those that are actually needed for medical and industrial purposes. As called for by the Combat Meth Act, the Administration will submit an annual report to Congress regarding cooperation with Mexico in this area. The first report will be submitted by the State Department to Congress no later than March 2007. Meanwhile, United States law enforcement agencies continue to seize increasing amounts of metham\u00ad phetamine at our Southwest Border. Seizures have almost doubled between 2000 and 2004. Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies have had several initiatives in recent years specifically designed to tar get methamphetamine superlabs and pr e\u00ad cursor suppliers in Mexico. Continued aggressive law enforce\u00adment efforts, implemented concurrent\u00ad ly with efforts to tighten the market for chemicals used to make metham \u00ad phetamine, ar e critical toward perma\u00ad nently methampheta\u00ad mine market.

Another aspect of the Administration's strategy is to support the important role that Federal, State, and local law enforcement have in combining intelligence against the operators of the large laboratories and trafficking networks. Specifically, American law enforcement agencies are, through traditional law enforcement activities and intelligence sharing, well placed to identify and target methamphetamine trafficking operations by analyzing the patter n of illicit chemical shipments. In May 2004, Federal, State, and local investigators met in California to address the increased methamphetamine market share of Mexican drug traffickers. Law enforcement stud\u00ad ied current Mexican drug trafficking operations in California, utilizing intelligence from vari\u00adous agencies. Although investigations about a single methamphetamine lab often may r eveal 17 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY limited information, combining information gleaned from other investigations allows a bigger picture to emerge as to the source of the ingredients. This intelligence\u00addriven law enforcement approach is the concept behind the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Fusion Center. The OCDETF Fusion Center is creat\u00ad ing a comprehensive data center containing the drug and drug\u00adrelated financial intelligence information from the OCDETF\u00admember agencies, the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC), EPIC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The OCDETF Fusion Center is designed to conduct cross\u00adagency integration and analysis of drug and related financial data, to create comprehensive intelligence pictures of targeted organizations, and to pass actionable leads through the multiagency Special Operations Division (SOD) to field investigators. Ultimately, by \"fusing\" the investigative information that has traditionally been stovepiped in each investiga\u00adtive agency, one complete picture of these organizations will emerge, resulting in the develop\u00adment of coordinated multijurisdictional investigations of the most significant drug trafficking and money laundering networks. As a result, the OCDETF Fusion Center will be a critical com\u00ad ponent in identifying the major methamphetamine trafficking organizations in the United States and those chemical suppliers that facilitate methamphetamine manufacturing. Guided by the analysis of the OCDETF Fusion Center, the OCDETF Program can bring the collective resources of its Federal, State, and local partners to bear against those producing or facilitating the production of methamphetamine destined for the United States. This shared intelligence approach, also utilized by High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDT A) program Intelligence Centers, is important because it responds to a simple truth about the illicit methamphetamine market: those organizations that ar e making the largest amounts of methamphetamine have a clear vision of the entir e production and distribution scheme, star ting from the point the pseudoephedrine is legally produced, to its smuggling, conversion into methamphetamine, distribution, and ultimate consumption, as well as the financial aspects asso \u00ad ciated with this process. To succeed in disrupting this market, law enforcement cannot limit its understanding or efforts to individual market segments-but must understand, and respond to, the complete market plan of the traffickers. Intelligence\u00adbased initiatives that capture, assess, coordinate, and shar e information from Federal, State, and local agencies ar e the most effective means of accomplishing this objective. Finally , also on the international front, the Departments of State and Health and Human Services (HHS) will work with the World Health Organization to promote private\u00adsector research and development of substances that are capable of replacing precursors used in methamphetamine production. The chief example of this is phenylepherine, which is cur rently marketed in over\u00adthe\u00adcounter cold and allergy medications and, unlike products containing pseudoephedrine, cannot be used in the methamphetamine production process. The speedy replacement on a global scale of methamphetamine precursors with substances that ar e safe and effective in treating the symptoms of allergies and colds (and that meet the other industrial uses of pseudoephedrine) but cannot be used to make methamphetamine would significantly impair the international market for methamphetamine. 18 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY The Domestic Focus on Methamphetamine and Other Synthetics The Administration will continue to partner with State, county, tribal, and city governments over the next three years to attack the illicit use of methamphetamine. State and local partners are crucial in carrying out the Administration's strategy for the synthetic drug problem, utilizing law enforcement, treatment, and prevention. After all, the overwhelming number of drug arrests and prosecutions\u2014certainly above 90 percent\u2014are handled by State and local authorities, rather than by Federal agents or prosecutors. Most government\u00adsupported treatment, although often funded by Federal grants, is implemented by State or local officials. In addition, States have taken the lead in enacting regulations of precursor chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, that are used in the production of methamphetamine. A substantial amount of the credit for the recent reductions in methamphetamine labs seen in some States belongs to those State policymakers. In order for the Synthetics Strategy to be effective, there must be a coordinated strategic response among Federal, State, and local governments, and some degree of cohesive\u00ad ness between the Federal strategy and State and local strategies. The Administration recognizes, however , that the manifestation of the synthetic drug problem in one State may be dif ferent from that in another State. The right balance is for the Federal government to work with States and local governments to encourage and assist in the devel \u00ad opment of State and local drug control strategies that include a focus on synthetic drugs, provide information wher e available, and allocate r esour ces wher e possible. The Administration will strengthen its partnerships with State and local officials through the following efforts over the next three years, and will: 2006 and Beyond: Strategic Goals Identify and share best practices Expand Drug Endangered Children training Programs Cosponsor four regional methamphetamine Expand methamphetamine toxicity knowledge base Working with State Policy Makers in Support State drug control strategies Expand Drug Endangered Children programs Support treatment and prevention programs Improve reporting of meth lab data Expand Prescription Drug Monitoring conferences Continue law enforcement training Provide r esources for methamphetamine lab cleanup, treatment, and pr evention Encourage States to include in their comprehensive drug control strategies a plan to address regional methamphetamine and controlled substance prescription drug abuse threats. Identify and shar e the most effective State\u00adlevel approaches for reducing methampheta\u00ad mine production and use, as well as controlled substance prescription drug diversion Work to expand Drug Endangered Children programs and training to all 50 States by the end of 2008. Continue support of treatment and prevention programs (e.g., by expanding drug courts and student drug testing programs). Improve data collection related to methamphetamine use and production. Work to expand prescription drug monitoring programs to all 50 States by the end of 2008. 19 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Cosponsor and fund four regional methamphetamine conferences (with HHS and DOJ) in 2006 to coordinate the efforts set forth above. Continue ambitious training programs for law enforcement (e.g., DEA\u00adled training at Quantico). Provide funds for laboratory seizure and clean up through the Community Oriented Policing (COPS) program. Provide procedures and standards for laboratory cleanup, and improve our national knowledge base as to toxicity. State and City Drug Control Strategies A coordinated drug control strategy can assist State and local governments in focusing attention and resources on the specific drug problem facing their State or region. The creation of a State drug control strategy defines the precise nature of the problem; generates \"buy\u00adin\" among various agencies, private entities, and individuals to a collective solution; and assists at budget time in allocating resources most effectively. Some States have drug control strategies; most do not. An example of one State with a drug control strategy is Iowa. Like the National Strategy, Iowa's Drug Contr ol Strategy is released annually by the chief dr ug policy official (the director of the Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy) and describes the current state of drug use in Iowa, the State administration's plan to combat drug use, and the resources committed to addressing the problem. Each year, the Iowa Strategy is developed and released in collaboration with the Drug Policy Advisory Council, a group of drug policy exper ts in Iowa r epresenting prosecutors, treatment special\u00ad enforcement, pr even\u00ad tion specialists, judges, correc\u00ad tions officials, educators, public health specialists, human serv\u00ad ices professionals, and juvenile justice officials.

The Iowa Strategy subsequently describes the state of treatment and prevention efforts in the State related to methamphetamine, as well as new efforts to stem controlled sub\u00ad stance prescription drug abuse through the administrative implementation of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. The Iowa Strategy also discusses alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and the problem of drug\u00adendangered children, describing both the nature of the problem and the State administration's plan to address it. Over the next three years, the Administration will work with State drug control officials to assist in providing information regarding the most effective State strategies for responding to the methamphetamine threat. As a forum for doing this, the Administration will hold four regional summits on methamphetamine, followed by a National Methamphetamine Summit sponsored by the White House. The purpose of these summits will be to review and consolidate all pertinent information about methamphetamine use and production to date, to invite States to share best practices in reducing use and production, to provide a forum for States to share information with the Federal government, and to encourage States to craft drug control strategies that are respon\u00ad sive to the methamphetamine problem. In the period leading up to these summits, the Administration will make available to the appropriate State officials the various State drug control strategies, especially those which include a focus on methamphetamine or controlled substance prescription drug abuse. Also, the Administration will develop a summar y of State and local best practices in developing metham \u00ad phetamine strategies and harnessing r esour ces to confront the problem. Several States have already developed key legislative and policy approaches to address methamphetamine thr ough prevention, enforcement, treatment, and related efforts. Additionally, many local prevention, treatment, and law enforcement efforts occur at the city level. Through the Major Cities Initiative, Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has facilitated partnerships of Federal, State, and local officials from the prevention, treatment, and law enforcement com\u00admunities to collaboratively respond to city drug challenges. In these cities, ONDCP has convened government and agency officials, community leaders, and educators to develop strategic action plans based on thorough assessments of the specific drug threats in their communities, which often include metham\u00ad phetamine and controlled substance prescription drugs. This initiative has assisted city leaders in leveraging existing resources for more effective, focused efforts. Additionally, ONDCP published Cities Without Drugs: The Major Cities Guide to Reducing Substance Abuse in Your Community as a r esource to guide communities through this process. There are several specific policy areas in which Federal, State, and local governments need to partner in order to address the problem of synthetic drug abuse. 21 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Reducing Methamphetamine Laboratory Numbers Any effective State strategy on methamphetamine must include a plan to reduce the number of methamphetamine labs\u2014or, in the limited number of States (primarily in New England) where methamphetamine labs are few, a plan to prevent their emergence. This is also a critical objective of the Administration's Synthetics Strategy , which has set a goal of a 25\u00adpercent reduc\u00ad tion in domestic methamphetamine lab incident numbers by the end of 2008. The role of the Administration on this issue is twofold: first, to provide reliable data to the States regarding the impact and effectiveness of various State\u00adlevel approaches; second, to implement the new provi\u00ad sions of the Combat Meth Act, which sets national restrictions on the retail sale of products containing pseudoephedrine. In 2005, several States directly addressed the problem of local methamphetamine production and dramatically reduced the number of methamphetamine labs in their own States. In doing so, State policy makers had to balance the needs of law enforcement with the need for legiti\u00ad mate consumer access to cold remedies. Thirty\u00adthree States enacted legislation25 in 2005 that imposed various restrictions on the retail sale of pseudoephedrine. One State, Oklahoma, enacted such legislation in 2004. In addition, Virginia accomplished a similar result through Executive Directive by the Governor. The Administration' s Action Plan noted this new law in Oklahoma, the first State to limit pseu \u00ad doephedrine sales to pharmacies. Subsequently , the Interim Repor t cited early data fr om two States that had implemented strict approaches, Oklahoma and Oregon. Since that time, more compr ehensive data has become available. The exact natur e of the regulations implemented in these 35 States varies. As a general matter , most of these States already restricted, prior to the Combat Meth Act, the amount of pseudoephedrine that could be purchased in a particular time period (e.g., only allowing the purchase of up to 3.6 grams in the course of a single transaction or over a 30 day period). The strictest regulations limited sales of pseudoephedrine products to pharmacies, required that the products be kept behind the counter, and instructed pharmacists to ask for identification and have the customer sign a logbook. Other States adopted some, but not all, of the strictest regu\u00adlations. For example, some States have allowed nonpharmaceutical outlets to sell the products but require placement of products behind the counter. In order to provide State policy makers with more rigorous detail about the impact of the various types of restrictions and to compare the effect of each of the 35 States' new regulations in detail, the National Institute of Justice has approved an 18\u00admonth study to analyze which provisions in which States appear to have had the most impact. Even in advance of the publication of the National Institute of Justice study, provisional data suggest that States that adopted more stringent restrictions generally saw steeper declines in methamphetamine lab numbers. The State data demonstrate that reasonable restrictions on the retail sale of pseudoephedrine are effective mechanisms for reducing methamphetamine produc\u00adtion in a given State. Emerging downward trends in national lab incidents are largely due to the lab reductions in the States with retail sale restrictions. 25 This information is current as of April 2006. 22 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Number of Number of incidents incidents during time same time period, Percent Enacted Until period previous year change 04/06/04 May\u00ad04 -43 Lesser Restrictions Dakota 02/25/05 Oct\u00ad05 12 20 -40 Mississippi 03/03/05 06/23/05 Jul\u00ad05 Oct\u00ad05 1 3 -67 Hawaii 07/05/05 * * * * * Louisiana 07/12/05 * * * * * Michigan 07/19/05 * * * * * Illinois 08/12/05 * * * * * New Jersey 08/24/05 * * * * * 09/27/05 * * * * * 10/04/05 * * * * * Date State From Schedule V\u00adtype restrictions Oklahoma Mar\u00ad05 Apr\u00ad05 Apr\u00ad05 Tennessee Apr\u00ad05 Virginia (Exec directive) Apr\u00ad05 North Dakota Washington Wisconsin Texas North Car olina California State Methamphetamine Laboratory Incidents by Restriction Level *Statutor y restrictions in these states ar e too recent for reliable data.

Source: EPIC CLSS. 23 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY As more conclusive data from the States became available, the Administration urged Congress to pass Federal legislation that would balance the needs of law enforcement while ensuring that legitimate consumers con\u00ad tinued to have access to cold remedies. The Federal government recognizes that the methamphetamine problem is not uniform across the country\u2014some States, such as California, Nevada, and Missouri, have wres\u00ad tled with high numbers of methamphetamine labs, while other States, such as Rhode Island and Connecticut, continue to see relatively low numbers of labs. Under the Combat Meth Act, State lawmakers retain the right to decide whether the national baseline standard is suffi\u00ad cient or whether more restrictive regulations limiting sales to pharmacies are warranted in their State. In addition, because the Act imposes a uniform baseline floor across the Nation, it will deter methamphetamine pro\u00adducers from crossing State lines to purchase precursor chemicals or set up their labs. The Administration will monitor the ef fect of the new national baseline restrictions, as well as trends in States such as Oklahoma and Oregon, which have more restrictive regulations. ONDCP will work with State legislators seeking to introduce precursor\u00adrelated legislation to provide the most updated and informative scientific research available. For example, in 2005, some States exempted from regulation gelatin capsules or liquid products containing pseu\u00ad doephedrine, believing that these products could not be converted into methamphetamine. 26 Although it is mor e difficult to use these products in the production of the drug, law enforce\u00ad ment chemists have in fact been able to use these products to produce methamphetamine. Such information is important for State policy makers to consider . Identifying Meth Chemical Buyers i phetamine production in the United States. For example, in 2001, it developed the Precursor chemicals and reduce the manufacture of metham\u00ad ers and by funding multimedia public awareness relationships between law enforcement and precur\u00ad sor chemical retailers and wholesalers. Oregon State Police have designed a methamphet\u00ad amine precursor database that houses precursor available 24 hours a day for law enforcement ized by county of purchase. The database feeds the identify suspicious purchases by persons who may The Central Valley HIDTA has spearheaded several nitiatives that create partnerships among retailers and law enforcement agencies to reduce metham\u00ad Vendor Program to identify buyers of precursor phetamine. Additionally, many HIDTAs have sup\u00ad ported retail watch programs by supplying brochures and other educational materials to retail\u00ad training programs in an effort to support working In another related initiative, the Oregon HIDTA and chemical sales r ecords that can be queried and used to identify patterns of abuse. The database is investigators and analysts, while reports are item\u00ad precursor chemical tracking program by helping to be producing methamphetamine. Additionally, the Administration will continue to monitor alternative sources of pseu\u00ad doephedrine, including the acquisition of pseudoephedrine over the Internet. This may be par tic\u00ad ularly relevant in States with more stringent restrictions on in\u00adperson sales of pseudoephedrine than the Federal restrictions impose. Anecdotal information from a few law enforcement agencies suggests that some methamphetamine cooks ar e looking to the Internet to pur chase pseudoephedrine; no data yet indicate, however, that this is emerging as a primary source of chemicals. The limits on amounts of pseudoephedrine sold to any individual in the Combat 26 See Restrictions on Over\u00adthe\u00adCounter Sales/Purchases of Products Containing Pseudoephedrine , Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, March 8, 2006, available at <www.natlalliance.org>. 24 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Meth Act apply to Internet transactions and include verification and reporting requirements. Such tools will assist law enforcement in responding to illicit Internet sales of pseudoephedrine Methamphetamine in Tribal Areas Included in the Administration's efforts to work with State governments will be its partner\u00ad ship with tribal authorities. Tribal law enforcement officers are steadily coming into contact with methamphetamine and methamphetamine labs. The DOJ will expand training for tribal law enforcement officers in methamphetamine use and laboratory awareness, recognition, and investigation and in officer\u00adsafety issues related to methamphetamine. The DOJ, supported by the National Narcotics Officers Association, will work with other Federal agencies, such as the DOT and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to coordinate and support this training. Impr oving Data on Methamphetamine Laboratories The collection of data regarding the number of methamphetamine laboratories found every month in each State is critical to keeping Federal and State policy makers apprised as to which State approaches work best to reduce local methamphetamine production. These data can also influence funding and is central to identifying strategies that can best address the problem of methamphetamine pr oduction. The central mechanism for tracking domestic methamphetamine laboratory numbers is the CLSS, par t of the DEA's EPIC and funded by the HIDTA program. EPIC's CLSS relies on State policy and police officials to quickly and accurately r eport laborator y seizures into this central database. However, there is sometimes a disparity in the timeliness and completeness of report\u00ad ing from states. Problems include: Time lag in reporting . Methamphetamine laboratory numbers tend to \"stabilize\"\u2014in other words, the reporting from States is mostly complete\u2014after six months or even longer. States should set a goal of reducing the stabilization period to three months or less. Decentralized/incomplete reporting . Not all State, county, and city law enforcement agencies r eport laborator y numbers, leading to an incomplete pictur e of methampheta \u00ad mine lab trends in that State. The Administration will encourage all States to centralize their reporting process, using a common definition of what constitutes a methampheta\u00ad mine lab incident. Toward this end, ONDCP has already released voluntary standards to top drug policy offi\u00ad cials in all 50 States. ONDCP and the DEA will work closely with these State officials over the coming year to improve data collection in this area.27 Improved reporting may result in an artificial rise in reported methamphetamine labs to EPIC's CLSS. As States improve the speed and completeness of their reporting, EPIC will be counting a greater proportion of methamphetamine labs that actually exist, including those that might not have previously been reported to EPIC. ONDCP and the DEA will evaluate, at some point near the end of 2006, whether improvements in the reporting of methamphetamine lab incidents are significant enough to warrant a \"data\u00adbreak\" in our counting of methamphetamine labs (meaning that data after 2006 may not be comparable to earlier years). 25 27 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Treating Methamphetamine Users A critical element in reducing demand for methamphetamine is to ensure that those who need treatment get the help they need. The Federal government supports State efforts in this area through grants and other programs. The Administration will continue to support State and local treatment activities as part of the national strategy to reduce demand for methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. Treatment and Research There is a common misperception that methamphetamine is so addictive that it is impossible to treat. There is no doubt as to the addictive nature of the drug or that in many cases, longer and more committed intervention is necessary. The Administration is committed to increasing support to State and local programs that work, such as model drug court and treatment pro\u00ad grams. At the same time, the Administration is working to enhance scientific understanding of effective treatment options for synthetic drug treatment. The National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) is continuing to research the most effective way of treating methamphetamine addiction. At present, the most effective treatments for methamphetamine addiction appear to be cognitive behavioral interventions, similar to those used for cocaine abusers. These approaches are designed to help modify the patient's thinking, expectations, and behaviors and to increase life skills. Additionally, methamphetamine recovery suppor t groups also appear to be effective adjuncts to behavioral interventions that can lead to long\u00adterm drug\u00adfree recovery. Additionally , in spring 2006, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) held two regional meetings with States on methamphetamine.28 The summits were specifically designed for those State agency staf f involved in developing, regulating, and funding methamphetamine treatment. The summits were geared toward program administrators and cli\u00adnicians responsible for frontline treatment. A major aim of the summits was to help participants better connect science to practice and thus strengthen the likelihood of positive outcomes for clients with methamphetamine pr oblems. Drug Courts As noted in the 2006 National Strategy , the Administration continues to support drug courts as an innovative approach for helping nonviolent offenders achieve drug\u00adfree lives. The coercive power of the courts, together with the support of family, friends, and counselors, has been shown to be an effective mechanism for achieving drug abstinence and reducing recidivism. One study has shown that 43.5 percent of offenders who did not par ticipate in drug court programs are rearrested for a serious offense, while only 16.4 percent of drug court graduates are rearrest\u00ad ed. 29 For Fiscal Year 2007, the President has requested a significant increase in support to States for drug courts above the enacted Fiscal Year 2006 level. 28 April 5\u00ad7 and May 23\u00ad25. 29 J. Roman, W . Townsend, and A. Bhati (2003, July). National estimates of drug court recidivism rates. Washington, DC: National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice. These figures are for all drug court participants, not just those with a history of methamphetamine use. 26 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Access to Recovery In 2003, President Bush announced the Access to Recovery (ATR) program. ATR is a voucher\u00adbased program intended to expand consumer choice and access to effective substance abuse treatment and recovery support services, including faith\u00adbased providers. In August of 2004, SAMHSA awarded grants to 14 States and one tribal organization. It is estimated that this cohort of grantees will serve approximately 125,000 individuals over the three\u00adyear life of the grants. Two examples of States specifically focusing on methamphetamine as part of their ATR pro\u00ad gram are Tennessee, which has a special focus on persons abusing or addicted to methampheta\u00ad mine in rural and Appalachia areas, and Wyoming. In the President's 2007 budget, the ATR program has been expanded to include approximately $25 million in vouchers for methamphetamine treatment that will fund approximately 10 grants to State applicants whose epidemiological data indicate high methamphetamine prevalence. Treatment in Rural Areas In August 2005, SAMHSA's Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) announced 11 new , three\u00adyear grants to provide treatment for methamphetamine abuse and other emerging drugs for adults residing in rural communities. These grants total $5.4 million for the first year and approximately $16.2 million for all three years. These new grants, as well as the six PRNS grants awarded in 2004 through this program, sup\u00ad port treatment in rural areas that have been particularly hard\u00adhit by methamphetamine abuse. Although studies indicate that the prevalence of methamphetamine use has remained roughly constant, the number of persons obtaining treatment for methamphetamine abuse has increased dramatically\u2014up nearly 8 percent from 2002 to 2003, continuing a trend seen since 1993. 30 In Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Utah, more than 20 percent of drug treatment admissions were due to methamphetamine abuse; Iowa's rate is just over 19 per\u00ad cent. In comparison, methamphetamine and amphetamine account for 7.4 percent of substance abuse treatment admissions nationally. 31 30 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment Ser vices Administration, Office of Applied Studies.

In 2003, NIDA revised its Preventing Drug Use Among Children and Adolescents: A Research\u00adBased Guide for Parents, Educators, and Community Leaders , which presents updated research\u00adbased prevention principles, an overview of pr ogram planning, and critical first steps for those learning about prevention. Because the goal of drug abuse prevention efforts is to pr event the initiation of drug use, most of these prevention efforts are not targeted toward any specific drug. However , recent results also demonstrate that these universal prevention programs can be effective at reducing methamphetamine abuse specifically .32 National Y outh Anti\u00adDrug Media Campaign The commer cials suppor ted by ONDCP and the Par tnership for a Dr ug\u00adFr ee America (PDF A) have been an important tool in reducing youth drug use by 19 percent since 2001. The concept is simple: Using television, the Inter net, and other media to disseminate infor mation, youth and parents ar e given tools and infor mation to make better decisions about illicit dr ugs. The National Y outh Anti\u00adDrug Media Campaign has primarily disseminated information about marijuana because it is over whelmingly the dr ug of choice for most youth.33 Starting in advertising campaign to highlight the dangers of methamphetamine. The anti\u00admethamphetamine media campaign and the utilization of these commercials by the communities late 2005, however , ONDCP and PDFA launched a new television most affected by methamphetamine are important components of the Administration' s plan to prevent the use of the dr ug among both youth and the general population. 32 Spoth et al., in press, Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. 33 Source: Monitoring the Future study. 28 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY The anti\u00admethamphetamine campaign was launched in Springfield, Missouri, and is being expanded to 23 cities nationwide. The campaign challenges individuals to learn more about the threats methamphetamine poses to both their families and communities with two main themes: \"So, Who Has the Drug Problem Now?\" and \"End Meth in Your Town.\" The real\u00adlife stories of people affected by methamphetamine are combined with scenarios that depict the unique sec\u00ad ondhand threat methamphetamine poses to communities at large. An important component of the ultimate success of this campaign will be for local radio and television stations to continue to voluntarily air these commercials. Strategic Prevention Framework SAMHSA's Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) is an ambitious effort to decrease substance use and abuse, promote mental health, prevent mental disorders, and reduce disability, comor\u00ad bidity, and relapse related to substance abuse and use. The SPF implements a five\u00adstep process to promote positive youth development, reduce risk\u00adtaking behaviors, build assets and resilience, and prevent problem behaviors. Adopting this approach to prevention can assist communities and families that are potentially vulnerable to methamphetamine and its negative consequences. 29 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Controlled Substance Prescription Drug Abuse The Administration has set a goal of a 15\u00adpercent reduction in the abuse, sometimes called the nonmedical use, of prescription drugs by the end of 2008. This is an ambitious goal. Prescription drugs account for the second\u00admost commonly abused category of drugs, behind marijuana and ahead of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other drugs. Achieving this goal will require reducing the number of those abusing prescription drugs as well as reversing a rising trend. The Administration's approach to this problem strives to balance two general policy concerns. The first is to be aggressive in reducing controlled substance prescription drug abuse. The second is to avoid overreaching and making the lawful acquisition of controlled substance prescription drugs unduly cumbersome. The Administration is committed to balancing the need for prevention, education, and enforcement with the need for legitimate access to controlled substance prescrip\u00ad tion drugs.

Source: National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2005 . In developing a strategy to balance these priorities, the Administration has worked to acquire better data as to how people who abuse controlled substance prescriptions acquire the drugs. This question highlights an important difference between drugs such as heroin or marijuana and con\u00ad trolled substance prescription drugs. The former, being presumptively illegal, are often obtained through secretive and dangerous transactions. However, controlled substance prescription drugs are available for legitimate purposes through one's physician and pharmacy. Mechanisms that are other wise legal are often manipulated to acquire controlled substance prescription drugs for illegal purposes. As such, typical drug control strategies focused on clandestine drugs do not necessarily lend themselves to a strategy for controlled substance prescription drugs. 31 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Common methods of controlled substance prescription drug diversion include: Doctor shopping or other prescription fraud Illegal online pharmacies Theft and burglary (from residences, pharmacies, etc.) Stereotypical drug dealing (selling pills to others) Receiving from friends or family, often for little or no cost Overprescribing (negligent or occasionally even intentional overprescribing by physi\u00ad cians or other prescribers) Although general methods of diversion have been identified, what is not yet adequately understood is the relative proportion of these methods of diversion (which methods are the most common, which are less so, and in what proportion). Helpful data of this sort is just beginning to emerge. To improve the national understanding of this problem, the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health for the first time asked questions attempting to delineate these methods of diversion. These data are expected to be released in September 2006. The 2006 Survey will seek even more detailed data from respondents. Doctor Shopping and Prescription Fraud The 2004, 2005, and 2006 National Strategies recognized the problem of prescription drug diversion via \"doctor shopping.\" Generally , this ter m refers to the visit by an individual\u2014who 32 Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Status as of April 2006 Source: ONDCP, State and Local GA HIAKPDMP Status (as of April 2006) Active Proposed No LegislationApprovedThe International Market Methamphetamine Precursors United countriesPseudoephedrine/ephedrine exportersTaiwan Philippines SingaporeSYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY may or may not have legitimate medical needs\u2014to several doctors, each of whom writes a pre\u00ad scription for a controlled substance. The individual will visit several pharmacies, receiving more of the drug than intended by any single physician, typically for the purpose of feeding an addic\u00ad tion. Associated illegal activities may include the forgery of prescriptions, further multiplying the extent of diversion, or the sale or transfer of the drug to others. Unfortunately, in many States, physicians and pharmacists have not been able to automatically cross\u00adcheck other prescriptions given to the same patient. In 2004, the Administration announced its intent to respond to this problem by supporting Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). That commitment continues as part of the Synthetics Strategy . PDMPs help cut down on prescription fraud and doctor shopping by giving physicians and pharmacists more complete information about a patient's con\u00ad trolled substance prescriptions. These pro\u00adgrams vary by State, but generally share the characteristic of allowing prescribers (e.g., a physician) and dispensers (e.g., a pharma\u00ad cist) to input and receive accurate and time\u00ad ly controlled substance prescription history information while ensuring patient access to needed treatment. Most States also have some mechanism for law enforcement to receive this information in cases wher e criminal activity is suspected. Health car e providers can use this information as a tool for the early identification of patients at risk for addiction in order to initiate appropriate med\u00ad ical interventions, and the justice system can use this information to assist in the enforcement of laws controlling the sale and use of controlled substance prescription medication. Drug Abuse Prevention address the growing abuse of OxyContin\u00ae and monitored Schedule II controlled substances in one State\u00addefined health district. By November 2004, the database contained over 460,000 prescrip\u00ad tions, and over 1,000 requests for data had been successful in addressing diversion that legislation was passed in 2005 to extend the program to the entire State beginning in FY 2006. The program will capture data for all Schedule II-IV prescriptions. Virginia: Investing in Prescription In 2003, the State of Virginia implemented a limited PDMP in the southwestern portion of the State to other prescription drugs. Virginia's limited PDMP processed. Virginia's limited PDMP proved to be so At the beginning of this Administration, approximately 15 PDMPs wer e in existence in the Nation. The program has steadily expanded, such that today, there are 28 States with active or planned PDMPs\u2014nearly double the number in existence in 2001. The Administration will encourage all States to adopt these programs by the end of 2008. A critical avenue of Federal support for States is through the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Grants Program at the DOJ. These grants can be used to implement or enhance PDMPs at the State level. The President has requested that Congress provide $9.9 mil\u00adlion for the program in Fiscal Year 2007 in order to expand the program to new States and enhance the program wher e it already exists. 34 The priorities of the Administration with r espect to PDMPs are to: Work with States that have PDMPs to obtain better data as to the extent and natur e of the controlled substance prescription drug abuse threat. States can receive up to $350,000 to launch a PDMP\u2014an amount most States have found more than adequate for start\u00adup costs and the first year of operation. 33 34 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Encourage the expansion of the PDMP program nationwide (as indicated by the map on page 32, in addition to the 28 States with active or planned PDMPs, several other States, shown in yellow, have introduced legislation to authorize a PDMP). Share best practices information with States that already have PDMPs (e.g., on cost\u00ad effectiveness, the benefits to monitoring all scheduled controlled substances, and meas\u00ad uring performance). In addition, HHS will, as required by law, issue a report regarding whether the implementa\u00ad tion of these programs has had a substantial negative effect on patient access to treatment, including therapy for pain or controlled substance abuse; pediatric patient access to treatment; or patient enrollment in research or clinical trials in which, following the protocol that has been approved by the relevant institutional review board for the research or clinical trial, the patient has obtained a controlled substance from either the scientific investigator conducting such research or clinical trial or the agent thereof. The Administration will work to ensure that con\u00ad trolled substance prescription drug monitoring efforts in the States balance and support the needs of individual patients, the health care system, and law enforcement. Illegal Online Pharmacies As the number of Americans with Internet access has increased, so too have opportunities for individuals to acquire controlled substance prescription drugs over the Internet. There are strong societal benefits from allowing individuals with a valid prescription to get their prescrip\u00ad tions over the Internet, as long as the Internet pharmacy is a legitimate one. This may be helpful in rural areas or for individuals who ar e homebound due to illness or other factors. However , the anonymity of the Internet and the proliferation of Web sites that facilitate illicit transactions for controlled substance prescription drugs have given drug abusers the ability to circumvent the law as well as sound medical practice. There are legitimate pharmacies that provide services over the Internet and that operate well within the bounds of both the law and sound medical practice. However, they are far outnum\u00ad bered by the legion of rogue online pharmacy Web sites and other sites that link Internet users to those sites wher e contr olled substances can actually be or dered without a valid pr escription. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has established a registry of pharmacies that operate online and meet certain criteria, including compliance with licensing and inspection requir ements of their State and each State to which they dispense phar maceuticals. By contrast, other Web sites used by Internet facilitators will often advertise themselves as pharmacies, but they do not operate in the same manner as brick\u00adand\u00admortar pharmacies. Many of these Web sites advertise controlled substances without a prescription. Such online Web sites usually act as a facilitator, or middleman, between an individual seeking controlled substance prescription drugs and a doctor and a pharmacy willing to provide these drugs without deter\u00ad mining whether the individual has a legitimate medical need. Of particular concer n is the cursor y and abbreviated nature of the medical interaction. The Internet facilitator will provide only a cursory doctor consultation by computer or telephone for 34 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY customers, which is not meant to elicit meaningful health information. The doctor writing the prescription will never actually see the patient to verify the information provided by the individ\u00adual. As such, many Web sites have no way of verifying the age of the recipient. Unlike when the patient sees the doctor, a minor can easily log onto a Web site and fill out an inaccurate age. Doctors, who are often paid by the number of prescriptions they sign in these situations, have no incentive to spend time seeking additional patient information. Law enforcement has discov\u00ad ered Web site\u00adaffiliated doctors who sign hundreds or thousands of prescriptions a day. After receiving the prescription from the doctor, the facilitator will then submit the prescription to a cooperating pharmacy. Because there is no identifying information on the Web site, it is difficult for law enforcement to track any of the individuals behind the Web site. The Administration is already using available tools, conducting investigations of rogue Internet\u00adfacilitator Web sites and working to intercept controlled substance prescriptions illegal\u00ad ly sent into the United States through the mail system. For example, the DEA's Internet investi\u00ad gation unit at its Special Operations Division continues to coordinate Internet cases, and the DEA has issued immediate suspensions of numerous Internet pharmacies. DOJ has prosecuted doctors and pharmacies who illegally distribute via the Internet. However, in the Administration's Interim Report , this problem was identified as one for which Federal legisla\u00ad tion is required. 35 States can also play a significant role in addressing the problem of online facil\u00ad itators, particularly through PDMPs. As part of the Administration's work with States regarding PDMPs over the next three years, States will be encouraged to consider addressing, either by statute, regulation, or interstate agreement, situations in which: Pharmacies in the State dispense or deliver controlled substance prescription drugs to an address of a patient in another State. Pharmacies or other dispensers located in another State dispense or deliver controlled substance prescription drugs to an address of a patient in their own State. Pharmacies or other dispensers in another State that dispense or deliver controlled sub\u00adstance prescription drugs to a patient with an official address in their own State. The Administration will continue to use the tools at its disposal to target, investigate, prose\u00ad cute, and dismantle illicit online pharmacies. Improper Prescribing The overwhelming majority of prescribing in America is conducted responsibly, but the small number of physicians who overprescribe controlled substances\u2014carelessly at best, knowingly at worst\u2014help supply America's second most widespread drug addiction problem. Although the problem exists, the number of physicians responsible for this problem is a very small fraction of those licensed to prescribe controlled substances in the United States. 35 The 2005 Interim Report of the Synthetic Drug Interagency Working Gr oup stated \"Federal legislation [is] necessar y to ensure that online pharmacies adequately identify themselves to consumers. The law must be clarified to ensure that controlled substances are only dispensed for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of a doctor's professional practice, and not on the basis of a suspect online questionnaire where the doctor never sets eye on the consumer.\" 35 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY While conducting investigations related to improper prescribing, among other things, law enforcement looks to whether the prescribing is consistent with sound medical judgment and prevailing medical standards. As part of the Administration's strategy to reduce opportunities to divert controlled substance prescriptions, law enforcement will continue to examine situations where prescribers write prescriptions for an unusually and obviously high number of controlled substances absent legitimate circumstances. Sharing Among Family and Friends Preliminary data suggest that the most common way in which controlled substance prescrip\u00ad tions are diverted may be through friends and family.36 For example, a person with a lawful and medical need for some amount of a controlled substance uses only a portion of the pre\u00ad scribed amount. Then a family member complains of pain, and the former patient shares excess medication. Alternatively, for a family member addicted to controlled substance prescription drugs, the mere availability of unused controlled substance prescriptions in the house may prove to be an irresistible temptation. The solution to this problem lies both with the medical community and in a renewed public commitment to dispose of unused and unneeded medications quickly and safely . With respect to the medical community, it is important that prescribers consider the potential for abuse of con\u00adtrolled substances and prescribe only the amount of a controlled substance required medically. Patients must also be educated about the legal and social ramifications of providing a contr olled substance to a friend or family member. It is not merely illegal, but could feed, or lead to, an addiction. The Administration's strategy in this area involves a closer partnership with the medical com\u00ad munity, as well as a public education campaign. In 2006, the Administration will call together representatives of the medical and pharmaceutical communities to discuss the problem and to encourage medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies to take a leading role in educat\u00ad ing patients as to the importance of quickly and safely disposing of unneeded medications. 36 Special data run for ONDCP, Preliminary data from the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health ; data are for the first half of the year and are unweighted. 36 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY \"AFTERMETH\": Following the Aftermath of Methamphetamine Production As noted at the beginning of the Synthetics Strategy , the core objectives of both this docu\u00ad ment and the National Strategy relate to reducing drug use and/or production. Until this sec\u00ad tion, discussion has been limited to initiatives and policy developments that will contribute directly or indirectly to those core objectives. Improving the national understanding of how to respond to methamphetamine laboratories in American neighborhoods will not directly con\u00adtribute to those core performance measures, but it is nevertheless critically important. The Administration aims for a dramatic decline in methamphetamine laboratories over the next three years, but even one methamphetamine laboratory carries potentially severe conse\u00ad quences that last far beyond the production process, both to human health and the environ\u00ad ment. Those affected may include first responders to methamphetamine laboratories, such as police, firefighters, and medical personnel; those who transport chemicals away from the labo\u00ad ratory site; current owners and subsequent purchasers of real or personal property; neighbors; and children found at or near laborator y sites. Also, improper disposal of the byproducts of methamphetamine production can adversely impact the environment. The purpose of this section of the Synthetics Strategy is not to describe the dangers associated with methamphetamine laboratory production. Those hazards have been well noted in other publications. 37 Rather, this section commits the Administration to a plan to expand and improve the knowledge base regarding the proper environmental response to methamphetamine labora\u00adtories, based on the best scientific research available. This section focuses on three areas of inquiry: What we currently know about securing methamphetamine laboratory sites: the short\u00adterm response to methamphetamine laboratories by police, cleanup personnel, firefighters, and medical personnel; the subsequent response by cleanup personnel; and the safe transport of chemicals seized and removed from the sites. What we know about remediation, and developing a national standar d or guideline for \"how clean is clean\" based on a better understanding of acceptable levels of risk at former methamphetamine laboratories. Our national response when children ar e found in or near methamphetamine laboratories. This section also discusses the state of the science and technology of site securing, cleanup, transportation, and remediation and proposes practices and/or policies that reflect the latest understanding of the associated health risks, methodologies, and technologies available to site responders. Some of the States and agencies most affected by methamphetamine abuse and lab\u00adoratory remediation have written detailed guidelines for responding to the toxic hazards associ\u00adated with post\u00adproduction discoveries. See Footnote 13. 37 37 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY The First 24 Hours: Securing Laboratory Sites In the National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan and subsequent Interim Report , the Administration committed to updating and releasing the \" Red Book ,\"38 DEA's compendium of procedures for how to approach and secure clandestine laboratories, making them as safe as possible for police, firefighters, medical personnel, and other officials with an immediate need to enter the site. Following through on this promise, the Red Book , originally published in March 1990, has been updated and will be re\u00adreleased this year.39 The Synthetics Strategy discussion relating to this topic is necessarily brief and is not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive review of the Red Book by first responders. States and local\u00ad ities are urged to review the Red Book in its entirety for a detailed review of procedures to Chemical Flammability* Acetic anhydride Moderate Moderate Anhydrous Ammonia High N/A Rapid asphyxia Benzene Moderate\u00adHigh High Blood Disorders; Carcinogen Moderate Probable carcinogen Cyclohexane Low High Ethyl Ether N/A High Ethanol Low High Disorientation Hydrogen Cyanide Extreme Low Rapid asphyxia High Low Hydriodic Acid High Low Irritant; Corrosive N/A Mod Iodine N/A Mod Oxidizer; Corrosive Lead Acetate High Low Blood Disorders Lithium Aluminum Hydride Moderate High High Low Irritant; Corrosive Methylamine High Extreme Petroleum Ether Low Extreme Disorientation, unconsciousness Phenylacetic Acid Low Low Irritant Piperdine Moderate High Corrosive Low Low Reactive; Explosive High Low May cause cancer Sodium (metal) High Low N/A N/A Thionyl Chloride High Low Typical Chemicals Found in Drug Laboratories Toxicity* Other Properities/Effects Irritant; us Acid Corrosive reactive; Explosive Mercury Chloride Corrosive Red Phosphor us Safrole Water reactive; Corrosive Sodium hydr oxide Corrosive Water reactive; Corrosive * Based primarily on National Fire Protection Association Standards 38 \"Guidelines for the Cleanup of Clandestine Drug Laboratories \u00ad 2005 Edition,\" Drug Enforcement Administration. 39 When released, the Red Book will be available on the DEA's Web site <www.dea.gov>. 38 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY follow when securing these sites. What is important to note is that the Red Book describes rec\u00ad ommended procedures for responding to clandestine laboratories, contains substantial informa\u00ad tion about who to contact in various situations, and also discusses the support that the DOJ, through the DEA, provides to State and local authorities in securing and cleaning up clandestine drug laboratories. How Clean is Clean? Understanding Remediation The previous several paragraphs dealt primarily with the immediate response to clandestine drug laboratories. Compared to first responder issues, a more complicated and less understood area of science is the optimal set and sequencing of response actions at former methampheta\u00ad mine lab sites that may possess residual chemical contamination. Remediation occurs after the chemicals and gross contamination have been removed, and the site is secured and no longer subject to criminal investigation. Currently, remediation involves utilizing recognized procedures and technology\u00adbased standards to restore former methamphetamine labs to a State in which the property can be inhabited again\u2014or instead identify properties that are not yet ready for reoccupation and must undergo further treatment. It is important to better develop this science. Some recent studies have highlighted the length of time that chemicals used in methamphetamine production can remain in carpet, walls, floor\u00adboards, or other structures. 40 The attendant and continuing toxicity of these chemicals are potentially a significant health hazar d for subsequent inhabitants of the property, many of whom may be unaware as to the status of the property and its use as a former methampheta\u00admine laboratory. Although defining acceptable levels of risk for the presence of individual chemicals is impor\u00ad tant, more pressing challenges include understanding how long the chemicals may remain after methamphetamine production, what signs should alert a property owner to the existence of these chemicals, and the best means of assessing risk and at what junctures. Even more compli\u00ad cated are questions related to the various legal implications attendant to ownership or control over a former methamphetamine lab site, including the duty to disclose a former lab site, the lia\u00ad bility of a current or former owner as well as culpable renters, insurance\u00adrelated issues, and the duty of agents of property sellers to disclose pertinent information. Much of the development of law and policy in this area has occurred and will likely continue to occur in States, counties, and cities, including questions of liability and responsibility.41 However, the onus for scientific inquiry will largely belong to the Federal government and pri\u00ad vate researchers. As part of the Administration's Synthetics Strategy , the Government aims to improve our national understanding of identifying the point at which former methamphetamine laboratories become clean enough to inhabit again. By January 2008, the Administration, led by the EPA in close coordination with the DEA, will publish guidelines identifying the best prac\u00adtices (beyond the compilation of State guidelines that currently exists) and include any relevant findings from the research effort described below for the remediation of former methampheta\u00ad mine laboratories. 40 See, e.g., A 24\u00adhour Study to Investigate Chemical Exposures Associated with Clandestine Methamphetamine Laboratories , August 11, 2005, Martyny, Erb, et. al., National Jewish Medical and Research Center. 41 See, e.g., Washington State Senate Bill 6239. 39 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY The Federal government also aims to release by January 2011 draft Federal health\u00adbased guidelines for remediation. Once again, the scientific basis for these guidelines will rely on the results of the research effort described below. The EPA, in close coordination with DEA,42 will be primarily responsible for developing these guidelines. History: Previous Inquiries on Remediation In 1990, a Joint Federal Task Force, made up of representatives from the DEA, the EPA, and the United States Coast Guard and established under the Anti\u00adDrug Abuse Act of 1988, issued guidelines to assist State and local officials conducting clandestine laboratory cleanups. These guidelines presented a framework for the entire process of cleaning up clandestine laboratories and integrated EPA approaches for cleaning up hazardous waste sites with the experiences of DEA field investigators and EPA emergency response staff. Since the release of those guidelines, some States have issued standards, guidelines, and sug\u00ad gested practices for remediation. The primary emphasis and focus of State strategies is on the suitability of the property for unrestricted rehabitation or use. Typically, the State lead agency or local health department assumes responsibility for evaluating the site and associated documenta\u00ad tion to determine the need for remediation action. As with the 1990 endeavors, recommended practices will be crafted as part of a collaborative effort with other Federal agencies. The recommendations will reflect commonalities and lessons learned from State\u00adspecific guidelines, as augmented by the latest science and research developed by the EPA with support from the DEA and other agencies. Research Strategy Development Within six months, the Administration, led by the EPA in cooperation with the DEA, will publish a \"Laborator y Aftermeth\" research strategy, which will identify the types of research needed to support Federal health\u00adbased guidelines for remediating methamphetamine laborato\u00adries. This strategy will, in addition to other topics, include: Evaluation of existing methods and development of new methods to quantify r esidual concentrations and associated environmental exposures associated with different methods of producing methamphetamine (e.g., red phosphor ous, lithium/ammonia) in differ ent types of structures (e.g., single family homes, apartments, hotel rooms) with different types of furnishings (e.g., furniture, flooring, wall treatments). Evaluation of existing methods and development of new methods to assess potential contamination in mechanical systems (e.g., ventilation systems, plumbing, septic tanks) and the surrounding environment (e.g., soil, wells) and associated exposure risks. 42 As noted in the Red Book , one of the two enduring policies that have guided and driven the DEA Clandestine Laboratory Cleanup Program, sent to the President in 1989 in a joint letter from the Administrators of DEA and EPA, presented the two agen\u00ad cies' agreement that law enforcement's job is complete with respect to the cleanup of a clandestine laboratory after 1) the removal of the evidence, chemicals and contaminated apparatus; 2) posting of a notice at the site; and 3) written notification to the property owner, health department, and environmental agency. Remediation of the property, although a potentially significant health and environmental concern, is not within the purview of the law enforcement agency seizing an illegal drug laboratory. 40 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Comparison of environmental contamination levels and exposures to existing toxicity (human and ecological) data on methamphetamine, its precursors, and its byproducts; where needed, providing new toxicity data for those exposures anticipated to pose the greatest potential risks. Evaluation of the effectiveness and unintended byproducts of different approaches for reducing residual methamphetamine and associated exposures (e.g., elevated tempera\u00ad ture and ventilation rates, bleaching). Completing this program of research expeditiously will require a combination of field work, chamber studies, and modeling. The Administration will work with and draw upon the research of others in accomplishing this ambitious effort. Upon completion of this effort, a workshop will be held to discuss the respective roles of both Federal agencies and others in implementing this strategy. Helping Child Victims of Methamphetamine Over the last several years, a number of stories in the media have highlighted the toll that methamphetamine production takes on young children\u2014uniquely vulnerable to toxicity and poisoning and victims of, not participants in, their parents' or other adults' illegal production of methamphetamine. A core element of the Administration's response to this has been the support of Drug Endangered Children (DEC) alliances within States and training throughout the Nation. DEC programs train first responders and other authorities on the best way to help and protect children who are found in the vicinity of methamphetamine production or who are identified through methamphetamine investigations. At present, this training has been provided in 28 States. T o improve and enhance suppor t of this program: ONDCP will work with State legislatures and policy makers throughout the Nation to encourage all 50 States to have personnel trained in DEC pr ocedur es by 2008. DOJ will continue support for DEC training carried out by the National Alliance for Drug Endangered Children and will disseminate information on best practices to profes\u00ad sionals in relevant multiple disciplines; DOJ will also establish a National DEC Coordinating Council, which will be cochaired by HHS, to improve collaboration between Federal and State DEC partners; additionally, DOJ will establish DEC proto\u00ad cols and expand training in conjunction with tribal authorities to address DEC issues in Indian Country. HHS will continue to emphasize issues related to the well\u00adbeing of drug endangered children. For example: SAMHSA, through its Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, will continue to requir e coordination with DEC programs as a component of the Juvenile and Family Drug Court grants. 41 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY SAMHSA and the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF), through their jointly funded National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW), will provide, if requested, technical assistance to communi\u00ad ties and/or States that are providing DEC trainings.43 Additionally, SAMHSA and ACYF held a national conference, Methamphetamine: Child Welfare Impact and Response, May 8-9, 2006 which addressed DEC issues, and included participation from State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, State Child Welfare Directors, and other related disciplines. In order to better understand the developmental consequences of prenatal methamphetamine exposure, NIDA is supporting a large\u00adscale study evaluating methamphetamine effects on cognition, social relationships, motor skills, and medical status and is comparing outcomes to well\u00admatched controls for socioe\u00ad conomic status and other variables in seven hospitals in Iowa, Oklahoma, Califor nia, and Hawaii\u2014States where methamphetamine abuse is prevalent. NIDA is supporting a study, in cooperation with the Los Angeles Drug Endangered Children Program and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, to investigate the medical and developmental outcomes of methamphetamine\u00adexposed children as well as the child welfare case manage\u00adment services treatment and placement outcomes for these children. The aforementioned four regional methamphetamine conferences in 2006, which are being planned and conducted by the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, will include DEC best practices and implementation. 43 Technical assistance will be provided to the extent possible using available funds. 42 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Appendix Status of National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan Recommendations This appendix lists the status of the 46 recommendations of the National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan. As in the May 2005 Interim Report to the Attorney General, Secretary of Health and Human Service, and Director of National Drug Control Policy from the Synthetic Drug Interagency Working Group, the Synthetic Drug Interagency Working Group (SDIWG) reports these recommendations in three categories. Where necessary, the recommendation is followed by a brief explanation as to its status. Category A: Recommendations that have been completed, are in progress, or are ongoing (45) Category B: Recommendations with which there is substantial agreement in principle but which will require Federal legislation to be fully effective (1) Category C: Recommendations regarding which one or more Federal agencies participating in the SGIWG determined merit further discussion (0) The SDIWG is a multiagency working group that is co\u00adchaired by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is additionally composed of members from the Department of Transportation (DOT), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), United States Trade Representative (USTR), United States Department of State (DOS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Categor y A: Recommendations that ar e completed or ongoing. 1. Develop an Early Alert and Response Mechanism. Establish a comprehensive, interagency early warning and response system to detect the emergence of new drugs and tr ends. Status: The Early Alert and Response Mechanism is led by the DEA and utilizes a combination of DEA 's Methamphetamine Task Force (MTF) and other information capabilities regarding controlled substance prescription drug abuse. The MTF collects investigative and intelligence information concerning methamphetamine trafficking and trends fr om domestic and foreign DEA offices, State, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies, domestic and foreign regulatory counterparts and competent authorities, pros\u00ad ecutors, law enforcement professional groups (such as the Clandestine Laboratory Investigators Association), and law enforcement networking groups (such as the HIDTA\u00adsponsored National Methamphetamine Chemical Initiative). MTF components analyze this information on a monthly basis, focusing their efforts in such areas as trends in chemical trafficking and manufacturing methods, clandestine laborator y 43 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY cleanup issues, changes in trafficking routes and patterns, regional abuse and distribu\u00ad tion patterns, chemical and equipment sources and methods of procurement, foreign and domestic precursor sources, smuggling, methods of financing, and other issues that effect the overall methamphetamine trafficking situation worldwide. After completing the analysis of this information, MTF components identify specific methamphetamine relat\u00ad ed issues that require action. The MTF formulates ideas and methodologies that will provide potential solutions to address the identified issues. With respect to investigations related to improper prescribing, among other things, law enforcement looks to whether the prescribing is consistent with sound medical judgment and prevailing medical standards. As part of the Administration's strategy to reduce opportunities to divert controlled substance prescriptions, law enforcement will continue to examine situations where prescribers write prescriptions for an unusually and obvi\u00ad ously high number of controlled substances absent legitimate circumstances. This infor\u00ad mation also helps to identify emerging synthetic drugs of abuse. After recommendations are formulated and vetted through pertinent DEA Sections, they are forwarded to the SDIWG for review and action. The SDIWG brings together all Federal agencies that have statutory jurisdiction concerning any aspect of methampheta\u00ad mine manufacture, trafficking, or abuse, and controlled substance prescription drug diversion, and the SDIWG is charged with making policy recommendations concerning emerging trends in the abuse of synthetic drugs. If approved by the SDIWG, the recom\u00admendations made by the MTF ar e forwarded to policy makers for further action and incorporation into the Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 2. Impr ove Data on Afflicted Geographic Ar eas. Build on existing Geographical Infor mation System (GIS) resources and databases to integrate federally mandated drug test results, crime laborator y evidence analysis, population demographics, and other meaningful data pertaining to synthetic drugs and diverted pharmaceuticals in a manner that supports geographically based prevention and intervention efforts. Status: Although treated as a separate recommendation in the Action Plan , this is being incorporated into the Early Alert and Response Mechanism, as review by SDIWG mem\u00ad ber departments of drug threats and tr ends is continuing. 3. Work with Manufacturers to Reformulate Abused Pharmaceutical Products. Continue to suppor t the ef forts of firms that manufacture frequently diverted pharmaceutical prod\u00ad ucts to reformulate their products so as to reduce diversion and abuse. Encourage manu\u00ad facturers to explore methods to render products containing key precursors, such as pseu\u00ad doephedrine, ineffective in the clandestine production of methamphetamine and pain control products, such as OxyContin\u00ae, less suitable for snorting or injection. Status: The DEA has engaged in discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers on this topic. Some manufacturers have already moved to market alternatives to chemicals that may be used as methamphetamine precursors. The Administration will continue to be 44 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY supportive of industry efforts to reduce controlled substance prescription drug abuse through reformulation, consistent with the requirement for FDA approval. 4. Target Raves Where Drug Use is Facilitated. Focus attention on the promoters and oper\u00ad ators of rave events that facilitate the trafficking and abuse of MDMA and other club drugs, making innovative and effective use of the Federal \"crack house\" statute, includ\u00ad ing amendments in the Rave Act. Status: The DEA will continue to monitor, investigate and prosecute cases presented to Federal authorities involving raves and other social events involving open distribution of club drugs. 5. Increase Internet Investigations. Expand investigations and prosecutions of Internet\u00ad based synthetic and pharmaceutical drug diversion and sales to include the establishment of task forces and coordination mechanisms dedicated to this purpose. Agencies should work with Internet Service Providers to assist them in limiting children's access to illegal drug sites. Status: The DEA, with cooperation from FDA, continues to target Internet\u00adbased synthetic and pharmaceutical drug diversion and sales. NDIC has prioritized Document Exploitation support to Internet diversion and narcotic analgesic investigations, which account for nearly 30 percent of the Document Exploitation missions conducted annually by NDIC. 6. Target Narcotic Analgesic Diversion. Support efforts to target individuals and organiza\u00ad tions involved in the diversion, illegal sale, pharmacy theft, fraud, and abuse of OxyContin\u00ae and other drug products containing oxycodone, hydrocodone, or hydro\u00ad morphone, such as Vicodin\u00ae and Lor cet\u00ae. Status: Targeting the diversion of controlled substance prescription drugs, including nar\u00ad cotic analgesics, is a significant focus of the Synthetic Drug Control Strategy and is dis \u00ad cussed more fully in the body of this document. NDIC has prioritized Document Exploitation support to Internet diversion and narcotic analgesic investigations, which account for nearly 30 percent of the Document Exploitation missions conducted annual \u00ad ly by NDIC. 7. Enhance Public Outreach Ef forts Focusing on Synthetic Drugs. Develop a multimedia education campaign on the consumption of synthetic drugs, focusing initially on methamphetamine. The program should, as appropriate, incorporate messages about the envir onmental threat and risks to children fr om clandestine labs. Ensure adequate dis\u00ad semination of all pertinent materials and information on synthetic drugs through the Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug\u00adFree Schools. Status: ONDCP has allocated approximately $1 million of the National Youth Anti\u00adDrug Media Campaign budget to outreach on synthetic drugs, including television commer cials in some of the areas most affected by methamphetamine. 45 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY 8. Develop Best Practices to Assist Drug\u00adEndangered Children. Develop protocols for assisting drug\u00adendangered children that generally address staff training; roles and responsibilities of intervening agencies; appropriate reporting; cross reporting; informa\u00ad tion sharing and confidentiality; safety procedures for children, families, and responding personnel; interviewing procedures; evidence collection and preservation procedures; medical care procedures; and community resource development. Status: Ongoing. See Helping Child Victims of Methamphetamine, 2006 National Drug Control Strategy . 9. Research and Develop Targeted Prevention Programs. Support research on the initiation of methamphetamine use and the progression of use leading to addiction. Programs should be developed to target high\u00adrisk groups or communities and to increase commu\u00ad nity involvement in prevention efforts. Status: Ongoing. See Prevention: Setting a National Standard, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 10. Increase Treatment Capacity. Assess treatment needs for synthetic and diverted pharma\u00ad ceutical drug addiction, and, if necessary, expand that capacity in the community and in correctional facilities. Particular emphasis should be given to the development of addi\u00ad tional treatment capacity for methamphetamine users, including follow\u00adup services that address the protracted recovery period associated with methamphetamine dependency. Status: Ongoing. See Treating Methamphetamine Users, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 11. Resear ch Treatment for Synthetic Drug Abuse. Increase research on the physical and psychological effects of methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs, as well as on the development of effective treatment protocols for synthetic drugs. Status: Ongoing. See Treating Methamphetamine Users, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 12. Develop Early Response Treatment Protocols. Develop and disseminate early\u00adresponse protocols addressing requests for treatment of dependency on emerging synthetic drugs and diverted phar maceuticals. Status: Ongoing. The Administration supports a screening, brief\u00adintervention, referral, and treatment model that is designed to identify and address a range of dr ug pr oblems in a variety of settings. This model can also be used to identify appropriate interventions for those who are experiencing problems with emerging synthetic and controlled sub\u00adstance prescription drugs. See also Treating Methamphetamine Users, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 13. Study Options for Criminal Justice System T reatment. Invest in additional studies on the efficacy of various comprehensive treatment programs for synthetic drug abuse and on their adaptability to diverse individual and community needs, especially those unique to the criminal justice system. 46 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Status: Ongoing. See Treating Methamphetamine Users, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 14. Expand Dissemination of Treatment Best Practices. Expand capabilities to disseminate pertinent research results and best practices training techniques as part of the overall effort to increase access to effective treatments for dependencies on synthetic and diverted pharmaceutical drugs. Status: Ongoing. See Treating Methamphetamine Users, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 15. Support Stronger State Controls on Precursor Chemicals. States that face significant levels of clandestine lab activity and chemical diversion are urged to consider the imposition of more stringent controls than those currently in place at the Federal level. Several States, notably Oklahoma, have recently enacted strict retail\u00adlevel controls. Status: Completed. The President signed the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, which included stronger national controls on precursor chemicals through the provisions in Title VII, the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (Combat Meth Act). 16. Strengthen Cooperation with Mexico. Solidify significant recent advancements by Mexico to increase the effectiveness of bilateral chemical control with the United States through continued partnership and meetings with the pertinent Mexican components, including the drug intelligence center (CENAPI\u2014el Centro Nacional de Planeaci\u00f3n Analisis y Informaci\u00f3n para a la Delicuencia), the Federal Investigative Agency (AFI\u2014Agencia Federal de Investigaci\u00f3n), the Federal Commission for the Protection from Sanitar y Risk (COFEPRIS\u2014Comisi\u00f3n Federal para la Protecci\u00f3n contra Riesgos Sanitarios), and the Health Commission, as well as the Bilateral Inter diction Working Group, the Senior Law Enforcement Plenary, and the Binational Committee. Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 17. Enhance Coordination and Information Exchange with Canada. Enhance ongoing coor\u00ad dination with Canada Customs and Revenue Agency on border detection, targeting and interdiction ef forts, and ensur e appropriate focus by Canada\u00adU.S. joint Integrated Border Enforcement teams on the precursor chemical and synthetic drug threats. Further expand the ongoing exchange of information concerning Canadian businesses involved in the importation, production, and distribution of pseudoephedrine\u2014particularly those firms whose products have frequently been diverted or smuggled into the United States. Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Gover nment' s International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 18. Strengthen the Multilateral Chemical Control System. Garner international support for making existing multilateral chemical controls more universal, formal and well\u00adsupported by international institutions, including UN bodies such as the INCBs, 47 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY and regional bodies such as the Organization of American States' Inter\u00adAmerican Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD). Work to realize the full potential of Project PRISM, and build support for the application of the 1988 UN Convention to pharma\u00ad ceutical preparations containing precursor chemicals that can be easily recovered for use in illicit drug production. Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 19. Exchange Information with Chemical Producing Countries. Continue ongoing informa\u00ad tion\u00adsharing efforts with the countries that produce precursor chemicals used to make amphetamine\u00adtype stimulants, particularly China, India, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. 20. Educate Store Employees. Building on efforts begun in a number of States, work to develop a model training program for pharmacists, retail management, and store employees concerning suspicious pseudoephedrine purchases, as well as suspicious sales of chemicals and items used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Status: Programs such as Meth Watch help train store employees regarding suspicious chemical purchases. 21. Encourage Voluntary Controls by Retail Pharmacies and Stores. Seek the voluntary par\u00ad ticipation of major retail chains in programs to control pseudoephedrine products through restrictions on the quantity that can be purchased at a single time. Also suppor t the voluntar y movement of pseudoephedrine products from stores' open shelves to behind pharmacy counters or other manned counters in retail settings where pharmacies are not on site. Status: The Combat Meth Act requires that products containing pseudoephedrine be kept behind the counter or in a locked cabinet and restricts the quantity that can be sold to any individual to 3.6 grams per day and 7.5 grams per month. 22. Suppor t State Prescription Monitoring Pr ograms. Support States' creation of prescription monitoring programs designed to detect inappropriate prescribing patterns and prescrip\u00ad tion fraud. Law enforcement and regulatory entities should have access to information in cases of apparent diversion or inappropriate prescribing of contr olled substances, and some provision for state\u00adto\u00adstate communication of adverse information should be examined. Supporting legislation should be explored. Status: Ongoing. See Doctor Shopping and Controlled substance prescription Fraud, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 23. Target Pseudoephedrine and Iodine Smuggling to and from Mexico. Focus law enforce\u00ad ment resources on stopping the recently noted flow of suspicious shipments of precursor chemicals, notably pseudoephedrine, from Asia to Mexico, apparently destined for 48 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY clandestine methamphetamine labs in Mexico and the United States. Also focus on the smuggling of iodine from Mexico. In all such cases, law enforcement should identify and aggressively pursue the persons and firms responsible. Status: Ongoing. See T he Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 24. Focus on Canadian Synthetics and Chemical Smugglers. Expand joint U.S.\u00adCanadian investigations into the smuggling of chemicals, methamphetamine, MDMA, and other club drugs and diverted pharmaceuticals. Assign high priority to investigations of large seizures of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine from Canada, and develop prosecutable cases against rogue Canadian companies and their principals. Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 25. Investigate Ties between Canadian and Mexican Criminals. Analyze law enforcement reporting and intelligence with respect to Canadian pseudoephedrine and ties between Canadian sellers and Mexican lab operators in California. Analysis of the flow of funds generated from sales of pseudoephedrine in Canada and the United State should be coordinated by the appropriate agencies within the concerned departments . Status: Ongoing. See The Federal Government's International Methamphetamine Strategy, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy . 26. Investigate Asian and European Sources of Synthetic Drugs. Work with international law enforcement partners and regional groups to investigate Asian criminal groups in North America and in Asia that increasingly may be engaged in producing and traf fick\u00ad ing synthetic drugs and their precursor chemicals. Enhance bilateral ef forts with the Netherlands and other MDMA-producing countries in Europe to build investigations, share information, and extradite criminals where appropriate. Status: Ongoing. 27. Apply Updated Clandestine Lab Cleanup Guidelines. Disseminate and apply the latest guidelines for the cleanup of clandestine methamphetamine labs, and where necessary, coordinate environmental remediation by appr opriate entities. These protocols for adul\u00ad teration and destruction of precursor and essential chemicals, glassware, and metham\u00adphetamine waste should be part of clandestine laboratory certification training. Status: Ongoing. The Red Book will be released later this year. See also AFTERMETH: Following the Aftermath of Methamphetamine Production, 2006 Synthetic Drug Contr ol Strategy . 28. Share Law Enforcement Best Practices. Based on the successes achieved by local law enfor cement in Souther n Califor nia using reverse\u00adbuy investigations and by communities in the Midwest that have set more strenuous penalties and regulations regarding synthet\u00ad ic drugs, establish a mechanism for sharing best practices among Federal, State and local 49 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY law enforcement as well as with international partners who are confronting synthetic drug threats. Status: Ongoing. See The Domestic Focus on Methamphetamine and Other Synthetics, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. In late 2005, the NDIC Document Exploitation Division began to provide training at the Justice Training Center in Quantico to DEA Diversion Investigators on the use of document exploitation as a best practice to support diversion investigations. 29. Increase Access to Civil Penalty Case Experts. The Department of Justice should develop and disseminate a list of attorneys who have experience in civil penalty cases under the Controlled Substances Act and who are available to assist U.S. Attorney's Offices in dis\u00ad tricts where such cases have never or rarely been referred or pursued. Status: Complete. This list has been disseminated to U.S. Attorneys' offices nationwide. 30. Enhance Methamphetamine Profiling Efforts. Increase the number of samples available for analysis in DEA's methamphetamine profiling program by incorporating samples of the drug seized by State and local law enforcement at super labs or from shipments strongly suspected of originating from such large\u00adscale operations. Also leverage infor\u00admation on chemicals, adulterants, cutting agents, and equipment found at the site. Status: Ongoing, through DEA's National Forensic Laboratory Information System. 31. Increase Prosecutor and LEA Training. Recognizing the unique issues presented by chemical and methamphetamine cases, the Federal government should, as resources per\u00ad mit, offer training for criminal and civil prosecutors and Federal, State and local law enfor cement agents mor e frequently and in dif ferent regions of the country. Status: Ongoing. In late 2005, the NDIC Document Exploitation Division began to pr o\u00ad vide training at the Justice Training Center in Quantico to DEA Diversion Investigators on the use of document exploitation as a best practice to support diversion investiga\u00ad tions. 32. Make Full Use of Charging and Sentencing Options. Prosecutors should make full use of Federal Sentencing Guidelines provisions, which set a sentencing floor (of 70-87 months) for any case involving methamphetamine manufactur e that creates a substantial risk of harm to human life. Federal prosecutors should also make greater use of the environmental enhancement for clandestine drug manufacturing involving \"unlawful dischar ge, emission, or release into the environment of a hazardous or toxic substance or for the unlawful transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste.\" Status: Ongoing. 33. Seek Updated Sentencing Guidelines for Club Drugs. Work with the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review data on the impact and effectiveness of current sentences for traf\u00adficking in ketamine, GHB and its precursors and analogues, and other club drugs, and, if advisable, propose enhanced guidelines sentences. 50 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Status: In the PROTECT Act, Congress told the U.S. Sentencing Commission last year to look into sentencing for GHB, and as a result, the Commission increased the sentences and also clarified how analogue offenses are sentenced. Now that the Commission has increased the guidelines, the SDIWG will periodically monitor whether this is an item that requires further attention. 34. Remove the Blister Pack Exemption. Support legislation that removes the blister pack exemption and eliminates distinctions based on the form of packaging. Status: The Administration supported this legislation, which was signed into law by the President. 35. Regulate Chemical Spot Market. As an extension of existing authority over imports, law enforcement should seek the legislative authority to regulate sales of bulk chemicals on the domestic spot market by notification and approval of any deviations in quantity or customer from the import declaration. Status: The Administration supported legislation accomplishing this objective. The legis\u00ad lation was signed into law by the President. 36. Enable Import Controls on Bulk Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine. Seek legislation that would treat the post\u00adimportation handling of bulk ephedrine and bulk pseudoephedrine in a similar manner, for regulatory purposes, as Federal laws now treat the post\u00adimpor\u00ad tation processing of Schedule I and II controlled substances. Impose such controls on these critical precursors as are needed to limit imports to those necessary for legitimate commer cial needs and for maintenance of effective control over chemical diversion. Status: The Administration supported legislation accomplishing this objective. The legis \u00ad lation was signed into law by the Pr esident. 37. Prevent Exploitation of Mail Services. Work with the U.S. Postal Service and private express mail delivery services to target illegal mail\u00adorder sales of chemical precursors, synthetic drugs, and pharmaceuticals, both domestically and internationally. Status: Ongoing. 38. Consider New Legislation on Club Dr ugs. Federal officials should continue efforts to develop additional legislation to address legal issues that often arise with respect to club drugs and rave\u00adtype events. For example, the distribution of imitation controlled sub\u00ad stances could be explicitly criminalized at the Federal level, and the provisions gover ning controlled substance analogues and counterfeits could be clarified. Status: The SDIWG does not believe that legislation involving chemicals involving 1,4 butanediol and GBL are required at this time. However, the SDIWG will continue to periodically monitor cases involving these chemicals. 39. Develop Guidelines for Juvenile Drug Treatment. Fund research on and pursue the development of guidelines with respect to the treatment of juveniles, who often are not adequately served in existing drug treatment programs designed for adults. 51 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Status: Ongoing. NIDA will continue to support research on juvenile drug treatment and, as better research becomes available, disseminate best practices information for juvenile drug treatment, and NIDA will report back to the SDIWG on an estimated timeline for expanded information on juvenile drug treatment best practices. 40. Improve Education and Training on Pharmaceuticals. Ensure product labeling that clear\u00ad ly articulates conditions for the safe and effective use of controlled substances, including full disclosure of safety issues associated with pharmaceuticals. Develop a mechanism for the wider dissemination and completion of approved Continuing Medical Education courses for physicians who prescribe controlled substances. Develop Internet public serv\u00ad ice announcements regarding the potential dangers and illegality of online direct pur\u00adchase of controlled substances. Status: The Food and Drug Administration has the responsibility for pharmaceutical product labeling, and SAMHSA engages in a variety of education and training activities concerning controlled substance prescription drug abuse. ONDCP will convene a meet\u00ad ing later this year with pharmaceutical manufacturers to discuss better labeling and patient education regarding the disposal of controlled substance prescription drugs. 41. Examine the Use of Prescription Narcotics. Assess the scope and magnitude of the licit and illicit use of prescription narcotic analgesics, in particular OxyContin\u00ae, including the pursuit of additional data sources in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institute for Justice (NIJ), private entities, and others. Status: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) has been recalibrated to ask mor e detailed questions about the scope of prescription drug abuse. A high priority of the Administration is to improve data about the sources of diversion. (e.g., r egarding the percentage of controlled substance prescription drug abuse in the United States enabled through the Internet, through doctor shopping, through street\u00adlevel drug deal\u00ad ing, et cetera). 42. Determine Licit Chemical Needs. In cooperation with industry, commission a statistical analysis to estimate the legitimate needs for pseudoephedrine and ephedrine pr oducts\u2014 including combination products such as ephedrine with guaifenesin\u2014both nationwide and regionally. Status: Pursuant to the requirements of the Combat Meth Act, the Administration seeks to accomplish this by January 1, 2007. 43. Review Lab Cleanup Resources. Ensure adequate funding sources for clandestine laboratory and dumpsite cleanups, including funding for sufficient personnel to support laborator y cleanups and hazardous waste disposal, so that cleanup costs ar e not a disin\u00ad centive to laboratory investigations or takedowns. Federal officials, in collaboration with state agencies, should conduct a needs assessment to identify potential program improvements and make recommendations on the specific suppor t needed and the funds required. 52 SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY Status: Both the current fiscal year budget and proposed budget for fiscal year 2007 pro\u00ad vide adequate funding to support State laboratory and dumpsite cleanups. The container program for seized materials\u2014requiring about a $40,000 initial outlay per jurisdiction\u2014 is also being expanded. 44. Improve Intelligence Efforts Related to Synthetic Drugs. Intensify intelligence compo\u00ad nents' focus on gathering and sharing information regarding the nature and scope of synthetic drugs trafficking. Make full use of NDIC's real\u00adtime analytical database for both pre\u00ad and post\u00adoperation link analysis and document exploitation. Strengthen mech\u00adanisms for sharing actionable intelligence, trend analysis, and information on criminal organizations among the United States and concerned Western European countries. Status: The OCDETF Fusion Center, EPIC, and Methamphetamine Task Force are among the governmental components that consider information and intelligence regard\u00ad ing synthetic drug control trafficking. This information is shared with the SDIWG as appropriate. Almost one\u00adthird of NDIC's Document Exploitation missions are conduct\u00aded in support of major licit drug diversion cases. These missions have provided support to diversion investigations that have resulted in convictions and sentences of medical practitioners not easily obtained. Moreover, the real\u00adtime analytical intelligence databas\u00ad es created to support these missions have been provided to the OCDETF Fusion Center to support its operational mission. 45. Limit Online Chemical Sales. Continue ongoing efforts to advise the owners and opera\u00ad tors of major online auction Web sites of the use of precursor chemicals in clandestine labs, and urge them to consider banning the sale of precursors chemicals over their W eb sites. Status: Ongoing. The DEA has worked with companies such as eBay to accomplish this recommendation. The Administration will continue to work with other online Web sites identified as providing precursor chemicals. Categor y B: Recommendations with which ther e is substantial agreement in principle but which will require Federal legislation to be fully effective. 46. Strengthen Controls on Internet Sales. Support legislation that regulates the burgeoning business of Internet sales of drugs, particularly controlled substances, by prohibiting the dispensing of controlled substances online without a valid prescription. Status: See discussion in Illegal Online Pharmacies, 2006 Synthetic Drug Control Strategy. Category C: Recommendations regarding which one or more Federal agencies participating in the SGIWG determined merit further discussion. None. 53 "}
