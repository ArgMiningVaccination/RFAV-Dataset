Autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are general terms for a group of complex neurodevelopmental conditions. The diagnostic classification system (DSM-5, May 2013) combines the previous subcategories of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not other- wise specified (PDD-NOS) into the one category of ASD. ASD is present early in life and medically characterized by varying degrees of skill development in: Communication/language Social abilities Restricted/unusual patterns of activities and interests The characteristics of ASD can be present in different combinations and at different levels of ability. Often specific behaviors vary widely from person to person. ASD occurs in as many as 1 in 36 children, is about four times more common in boys than in girls, and occurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups. What causes ASD? The specific causes are not yet known, although there is consensus that genetic vulnerability and unidentified environmental factors cause atypical brain development related to core features. While scientists are looking into possible environmental origins, there is no current established scientific link to proposed causes such as vaccines, diet, or toxin/environmental exposure.How can I tell if a child has autism? There are at present no medical or genetic tests specific to ASD. Diagnosis is determined by assessing and observing a child's behavior. No two children with autism are alike, but some features may be identifiable as early as 18 months, or even sooner. Early indicators include delayed language, deficits in nonverbal communication (e.g., pointing, eye contact), inconsistent response to sounds (especially name), difficulty directing parent's attention, underdeveloped imitation, repetitive toy play. Not every child with ASD will have difficulties in all of these areas. The isolated presence of one of these behaviors does not warrant an ASD diagnosis. It is the collection of these behavior patterns that leads to a diagnosis. What should I do if I think my child may have autism? Parents and other caregivers are typically the first to notice autism indicators. Some parents describe children whose development has been atypical since birth, while others describe children who were developing typically and then seemed to lose skills. Other parents do not notice atypical behaviors until their child enters school. Early identification and early intervention are key to optimizing outcomes. If you think you see indicators of autism, talk to your pediatrician or a behavioral professional about getting your child screened for ASD. How is autism treated? There is no \"cure\" for autism; however, research indicates that behavioral intervention can improve the lives of children with ASD and their families. There is no single treatment protocol for all children with ASD, but many different behavioral and educational programs have demonstrated positive effects. Some of the most common interventions are applied behavior analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, parenting programs, and structured teaching methods. An important aspect of any intervention program is that each child's treatment is tailored to meet their individual needs.
