This year, in particular, there may be a feeling of urgency to try to emerge and catch up from what was a most difficult 18-month period. The worst of the pandemic seems to be behind us, but no one is pre - pared to declare that we have controlled it just yet. Beyond the lessons learned, and the personal losses that we all suffered during the pandemic, COVID-19 is leaving a somber trail of statistics and numbers. The virus has forever changed the way we approach our lives and daily activities. With the \"reopening\" , some of our traditional yearly Society meetings have welcomed in person attendees again, but a hybrid model with a predominantly virtual presence is likely to remain the norm for months, if not years, to come. The high quality scientific and educational content of these meetings are powerful signs of the strength of our specialty and, among many other things, remind us that the future of Radiology is bright and healthy. The fall issue of our Department's Newsletter has numerous stories and topics that undoubtedly will be of interest to all. It highlights the many accomplishments of members of our department, welcomes new members in different areas and provides information and updates about our cli - nical services and operations. As always, sincere thanks to all who contributed to the Newsletter and remember that all comments and suggestions for content are most welcome. 2 / From the Desk oF Dr. Asim MianDr. Asim Mian was promoted to Associate Professor of Radiology.

KudosThis past academic year, many BUMC faculty received local, regional and national recognition. Please con - gratulate the following individuals for their accomplishments during the 2020-2021 academic year:4 / From the Desk oF BMC Radiology's global outreach to help COVID families During the second wave of the relentless COVID-19 pandemic, India was in a very difficult and des - perate situation. The country was poorly prepared for the tsunami of cases in the second wave which was significantly higher than the first. India recorded over 400,000 cases at the peak of the second wave with at least 4000 deaths per day. The government decided to lock down the entire country to curb the spread, and the daily wagers were not able to feed their families. EKAM-USA is a non-profit NGO that works towards providing quality healthcare to children and mothers in India who are in need. My family supports this organization. When I heard that EKAM is volun - teering and partnering with a team of dedicated personnel on ground in my hometown, Bangalore, and are running a campaign \"Feed the Hungry-Covid-19 relief in India\" to assist families during this crisis, I decided to help out. Funds from this campaign were being used to purchase grains, fruits and vegetables and put together groceries for families that would be enough for one week. We created a go fund me page and sent an email out to the entire radiology staff and support personnel. We, the BMC family raised a generous amount $1,345 over a period of 2 months and donated it to EKAM. Groceries were donated to 20 families using the funds we raised. Thank you all for the open-heartedness and EKAM-USA and I express our sincere gratitude for all your contributions. Dr. Bindu SettyCOVID-19 Relief From the Desk oF / 5 Department News Dr. Christina LeBedis Completes the 2021 Marathon! Why did I run the 2021 marathon? The answer began many moons ago.... After a long day of lectures at AFIP at Walter Reed, I decided to go to the military gym and stretch my legs by walking on the treadmill. After a few ambling-along-minutes watching the TV news dangling above, a man multiple decades my senior got on the treadmill next to me and began running - gazelle style. Mortified by my pokey civilian pace, I up-ped my speed with autho - rity as though I was just warming up. Beep. Beep. Beepity-beep. With lactic acid now coursing through my veins, a woman with a prosthetic leg got on the treadmill on my other side and began running like the wind. Instinctively, my hand reached forward. Flanked by \"gazelle\" and \"run like the wind\" , I wondered if it was possible to be left behind in a stationary race. \"Decidedly so\" , I lamented. Beep. Beep. Triple, quadruple beepity-beep. Tripping, achy and winded, my first-ever-since-high-school 2 mile run was over. Military folks DO NOT mess around. This was the \"will of steel\" crew. I hated running, but the \"no excuses\" air hung thick. The weight of it was palpable. Six weeks later, I returned to Boston having run EVERY single day since I had left. A tongue-in-cheek, newly minted \"elite military athlete\" , Avneesh gave me a then-en-vogue pair of Nike pedometer sneakers which linked to Nike+ on my iPod for my birthday. Wait...he knew I hated running! Decked out in my new gag gift, I thought \"just watch me\" . To my surprise, running was suddenly easier. AND I was being congratulated by famous people via my iPod for my \"fastest\" or \"longest\" run yet, leveling up with colored karate-esque belts and earning gear for my sporty avatar. I was hooked. Capital H. Emboldened, I called my former-track-athlete-superstar sister and challenged her to run the 2010 Boston half marathon with me. In dismay at her I-ha - te-runnning sister, she responded \"You're nuts. You sure? You're ON\" . Running across the 2010 BAA half marathon finish line, we plotted to run monthly race-cations where she and I would meet to run events around the country. Fun was had, photos taken, and participation medals won. By late 2011 with numerous miles in the rearview mirror, I was ready to level up again. I had the Boston marathon in my sights and the charity to do it with. Enjoying (and occasionally seeking) things that terrify me, I clicked \"submit\" on my application for Team BMC's 2012 marathon team. That 86 degree April 2012 day, I ran with Team BMC pride. Marriage, two children and a pancreatic cancer-surviving-journey with my mother later, I have been waiting in the wings drea - ming of a 10th anniversary run. On July 1st, Dr. Ravin Davidoff sent an email call for marathon runners with the added benefit being able to raise money for the BMC department of your choosing. Head racing, heart pounding and totally undertrained without numerous recent race-cations in my back pocket, I clicked \"submit\" again on July 4th to run the 2021 Boston marathon and raise money for the Radiology department that has given me so much. This was my chance to marry my dream of harnes - sing Radiology's potential to augment cancer screening across our health care system and run my early-10th anniversary lap. Invigorated with purpose and hatching multidisciplinary cancer screening plans in my head, I ran many buggy, muggy miles watching the summer sun rise and fall. My running progress was Garmin-measurable and cancer screening dreams seemed closer in reach as intoxicatingly-positive Peloton marathon coaches chanted in my ear. Stars were aligning. Miles were melting away behind me. Destinations now visible. \"Hopkinton awaits\" I thought as I rose on the 11th. A bouncy, seatbelt-less school bus ride later, we were at the start. Blue and yellow marathon colors everywhere with crowds chanting near and far, WE WERE OFF! I started off down the hill too fast, and perhaps overcaffeinated, with adrenaline pumping. Six miles in and short of breath, I glanced at my watch. 195 bpm. Disbelief forced me to walk. I have NEVER seen that number on my Garmin. And I look at it often. Was it or I going to explode? I saw the blurry likeness of \"gazelle\" that day as he whizzed by, this time dressed in full army fatigue with combat boots racing up a hill. \"Run like the wind\" flew past me too, this time leaving me in the actual dust. Kissing my goal time goodbye and slightly worried that my BAA avatar would die of slowness on watching screens at work and friend's homes, I embraced the energy of the 125th marathon 2+ years after it had last been run in person, hugs from friends and family, photo ops, chanting and the glorious October day. I raced my kids up the last part of Heartbreak Hill, appreciated Team BMC-clad Avneesh with cowbell in hand for all he is and does and marveled at my enviably optimistic-can do-sunny mother shouting my name with glee. The winds of \"no excuses\" rustled the orangey autumn leaves and blew me down the course. What a day it was to be alive making memories, running for beloved BMC and raising money to improve cancer screening! Dr. Christina LeBedis6 / From the Desk oF This academic year, we have welcomed several new faculty members: Chad Farris MD PhD (neuroradiology); Michael Was - serman MD (neuroradiology); Jordana Phillips MD (breast imaging); and, Laura Semine-Misbach MD (breast imaging). Each of these individuals bring unique skills and expertise to their respective sections, and all are certain to add subs - tantial value on all three fronts of our tri - partite mission - teaching, research and patient care. In addition, we welcomed Mr. Yi-An Huang to the role of Executive Director for the Departments of Radiolo - gy, Radiation Oncology and Otolaryngo - logy. He brings broad experience in both strategy and clinical operations and we are certain to benefit from his leadership as we expand our clinical practice over the next several years. We also were very fortunate to welcome many new staff and technologists to our department -- Martha Yulfo (Breast Imaging Front Desk), Robert Koehler (technologist in MRI), Igor Ricardo (technologist in Diagnostic Imaging), Kellen Oliviera (technologist in Diagnostic Imaging), Miriam Ramos (te - chnologist in Diagnostic Imaging), Madi - son Fiasconaro (technologist in Diagnos - Department Newstic Imaging), Samar El-Khatib (technologist in Nuclear Medicine), and Rebecca Heath (technologist in Nuclear Medicine). Finally, we congratulate Ariel Jackman on her pro - motion to Diagnostic Radiology Evening Supervisor and Zee Santana to Team Lead for Radiology Registration. As the department continues to grow, we are also blessed with many notable achievements by our faculty and trainees, many of which were highlighted in the Kudos section above. However, in addition to those noted above, Dr. Michael Fishman and Dr. Priscilla Slanetz were featured faculty for the JACR Journal Club focusing on burnout and resilience during radiology residency training given their recent JACR publication on this topic. Dr. Jorge Soto finished his term as President of the American Society of Emergency Radiology with an in-person meeting in Florida, one of the first national radiology in-person meetings since the start of the pandemic. And we look forward to hearing about many more accomplishments in our next issue as many faculty and trainees will be presenting at the annual meeting of RSNA this coming November. Dr. Priscilla Slanetz EPIC Radiant As you may have heard, we are officially beginning the journey of replacing our PACS system, with the goal of having a new system in place around 1 year from now. BMC has hired a consultant to help us with our decision, and we are engaging representatives from across the department to provide feedback, with full institutional support. We are excited to learn about the different offerings from the various PACS vendors, and we will be soliciting feedback as we narrow our decision. Dr. Avneesh GuptaFrom the Desk oF / 7 Department News Drs. Fishman and Slanetz discussed their article on burnout and resiliency of radiology trainees during the most recent Journal of the American College of Radiology (JACR) Journal Club. You can check out the publication at: https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(21)00118-6/ pdf JACR Update 8 / From the Desk oF Neuroradiology The Neuroradiology section at Boston Me - dical Center/Boston University School of Medicine is devoted to delivering excellent patient care. We provide our expertise in the field of Neuroradiology and Head and Neck Radiology. We cover diverse fields ranging from trauma and emergency settings to congenital/ developmental conditions and onco - logic imaging. Four of our neuroradiologists - Mari - za Clement (section chief of Emergency Radiology), Harp Bedi, Siavash Behbahani, and Michael Wasser - man - also cover the after-hours as faculty of the Emergency Radiology section, providing seamless Neuroradiology subspecialty service, a vital compo - nent of our BMC Emergency and Trauma Service. Each neuroradiologist has a specific focus of clinical and research interest, provides expert services, leads the multidisciplinary conferences, and functions as a liaison between Neuroradiology and each clinical service, for example, Mohamad Abdalkader - Neuro IR, Carlota Andreu-Arasa - Head and Stroke, Asim Mian - fMRI, Bindu Setty - Pediatric, etc. Many of our clinical colleagues are from surgical subspecialties such as Neurosurgery, Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Ophthalmology, Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, and Orthopedic Surgery. Neurology has several distinct subsections, such as Stroke, Neuro Critical Care, Neuro-oncology, Multiple Sclerosis, Movement Disorders, Epilepsy, Neurodegenerative disorders, etc. Each team has very different needs. We offer a diverse selection of CT and MRI acqui - sitions and reconstruction protocols to provide excellent patient-specific care. Education of our trainees, including medical students, residents, and fellows, is a vital compo - nent of the Neuroradiology section. Our section is home to many education leaders; Asim Mian (Radiology Residency Program Director), Michael Director), and Bedi Harp Education, Neuroradiology Fellowship Program Director). Siavash Beh - bahani is the resident education lead for the Neuroradiology rotation. Judy Post is an outstanding educator, an exceptio - nal resource for our trainees. Many of our past residents have advanced to very strong Neuroradiology fellowship pro - grams, including here at BMC. Programs are thankful to have BMC residents as their fellows and appreciate the quality of Neuroradiology training at BMC. We also host many trainees from other departments such as Neurology, Pediatric Neu - rology, and Neurosurgery, which helps improve multidis - ciplinary patient care. Additionally, our staff regularly gives lectures to trainees from other departments. Under the leadership of Glenn Barest (Director, Ra - diology Quality and Safety), the Neuroradiology section has been keeping a high standard of quality of service and pa - tient safety. It is imperative to always perform a patient-cen - tered practice. Careful reviews of the EMR and prior exams are essential. It is very important to recognize that we are part of the clinical team and significantly impact patient care. Research is a critical component of academic radiology. All faculty in the Neuroradiology section are involved in multiple projects, ranging from very technical, cutting-edge projects to educational projects. We are dedicated to exploring new knowledge and improving patient care. We welcome trainees of all levels to join our projects, and indeed many are actively involved. Chad Farris returned to our section in July 2021. He is a great resource for Neuroradiology research for all faculty and trainees. Our Neuroradiology section is fortunate to have a very diverse faculty. Having a diverse and inclusive team helps us understand and work with our patients and trainees from various backgrounds. We are very proud of being an essential part of the clinical service and education in our Radiology department. We look forward to continuing to see many of our residents pursue Neuroradiology as their lifeti - me career and provide excellent patient care. Dr. Osamu SakaiFrom the Desk oF / 9 Interventional Radiology We have Radiology Grand Rounds 6-8 times a year, typically on the first Thursday of the month. Unfortunately, we are unable to have the speaker physically on our campus under the current circumstances. For this reason, Grand Rounds lecture will need to be remote. However, on the bright side, geographical limitations are no longer an issue and we can now easily invite speakers from the West Coast and abroad. Grand Rounds are excellent opportunities to learn directly from the expert in the field and to get to know the speaker personally. It is a critical component of our education in the department for all levels, including residents, fellows, attendings, medical stu - dents and other clinical colleagues. We have outlined a diverse set of topics for this year and will be carefully selecting a speaker from each subspecialty. In addition, we invite one or two speakers on non-cli - nical topics every year, such as business, education, diversity, wellness, etc. The topic and content of the lecture is very important. An ideal speaker will help us update our knowledge, improve our practice, collabo - rate with other institutions on education Dr. Suvranu Ganguliand research, and for residents, will help guide fellowship selection. Due to social distancing requirements, we are unable to have dinners with the invited speakers. However I am hoping we can set up a virtual (i.e. zoom) chat room to have more individual conversations if the time allows.10 / From the Desk oF Faculty Development Building a network of collaborators within and outside your department has numerous benefits. Not only can it increase your academic productivity, but also such networks provide support and guidance as you progress throughout your career. Participating in one of the many faculty development opportu - nities offered by the Boston University Medical Campus is one fairly easy way to make such connections; however, all of these programs require an application, support from the department, and a time commit - ment to fully engage in the sessions. For those in our department who have participated in one or more of these offerings, the feedback has been uniformly positive. For those who might be interested, there are the following current programs to consider: early career, clinical leadership, mid-career faculty leadership, narrative writing, academic writing, underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and women's leadership. More details about each of these programs can be found at the following website: https://www.bumc. bu.edu/bumg/professional-development/ In addition to these more structured faculty development opportunities, it is also critical to be sure that your BU Profile is up-to-date and accurate. The BU Profile provides a means for others to find and connect with you over similar interests. Just like your CV, it is advisable to review your profile at least once a year and to make any updates to your activities and accomplishments. Most of you already have a BU profile as it was created when you joined the faculty. BU also automatically updates your profile with any new publications. However, if you do not have a profile, please reach out to bumchelp@bu.edu and provi - de them with the following information: 1. Attach the most recent copy of your CV. If recent pubs are missing, please augment with a bios - ketch or publication list. 2. If you are volunteer/affiliate faculty at another organization, provide your position title and depart - ment/other organization entity with your current primary organization. 3. If it is not on your CV, provide your full name. Please include your middle name if you have one, even if you do not want your middle name displayed. 4. Indicate how you would like your full name to appear at the top of your profile, along with your educational degrees. 5. Attach a headshot photo to add to your profile. 6. Provide an \"elevator pitch\" narrative description of your professional expertise and interests 7. If you have grants, send a link to one of your NIH RePORTER grants (or the project number), if you are a PI/project leader formally listed. From this grant, it is possible to link to all of your other grants automatically. 8. Sign up for an ORCID ID and report your ORCID to BU using the \"BU ORCID Interface\" on that se - cond site. This will also connect your ORCID to BU Profiles. If you need assistance, email bumchelp@ bu.edu. 9. Send a list of keywords that best reflect your scholarly expertise - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ mesh.Dr. Priscilla SlanetzFrom the Desk oF / 11 Other Optional components to consider including: 10. Send any external website links that are representative of your expertise, research, or scholarly ou - tput. Examples might include a LinkedIn profile, My NCBI, a BU department or external profile, or a lab/ research website. 11. Send website links to professional videos, curriculum, social media, such as LinkedIn; ResearchGa - te; Twitter handle/SlideShare profile/YouTube videos, etc. 12. Send any honors and awards you wish to display publicly in chronological order (Start/End date, Name of Honor and Organization/Institution bestowing honor) 13. If applicable, send us any mentoring role(s) and a mentoring narrative. See mentoring in the FAQ section for more. The roles are defined here. There is more on mentoring in BU Profiles at https://profi - les.bu.edu/WhatsNew/#details_indicate_willingness. Once your BU profile has been created or for those of you who have a profile, you should regularly: 14. Review your publications list - is it accurate? BU Profiles' automatic disambiguation tries to find you via PubMed. If you are getting a lot of incorrect pubs, email bumchelp@bu.edu. 15. Report your ORCID to BU, which will connect it to BU Profiles. To do this, use the \"BU ORCID Inter - face\" button at http://www.bu.edu/orcid. That site also has more information on ORCID. If you need assistance, please email bumchelp@bu.edu. 16. Consider adding gender pronouns to display on your profile. You can do this by logging using the Edit menu, after logging in (Login to BU Profiles in the upper right hand corner of every page, then use the Edit menu). More info on gender pronouns is here. 17. Browse some harder-to-spot features within Profiles: a. NIH iCite integration: https://profiles.bu.edu/Tuhina.Neogi - go to the publications tab and click the green iCite analysis button. More info is here. b. Media mentions & social media integration: https://profiles.bu.edu/Sandro.Galea - go to the Social/Media tab and browse Media Mentions, Tweets, Twitter Likes and Featured Videos. More info on media mentions is here. c. Alt Metric and Dimension badges linked to individual publications. Hovering over the badges or clicking on them will exhibit different behavior. Only 2 years+ pubs tend to have Dimension badges, but Alt Metrics can appear at any time. More info on Alt Metric is here, and Dimensions is here. Although these steps seem a bit labor intensive, remember that a little work can go a long way in advancing your career and helping you reach your goals. More importantly, collaborating with others makes the process far more enjoyable and potentially will lead to impact on a much larger audience here at BU and beyond. Faculty Development12 / From the Desk oF Radiology Education It's a new academic year and we are excited to continue a rich and productive lear - ning/teaching environment with some new educational initiatives.We have begun \"block schedules\" for the resident noon conference series. We hope that this new format will help residents build on the same theme throughout the week to reinforce learning and long term retention. Additionally, we hope to increase the number of case conferences during the noon slot so residents practice the art of taking cases. We appreciate all of the hard work the staff is putting in with this new format. This year, in order to promote social interaction and connection, the residents have been divided in social \"Pods\" , a group of residents from all four years. The four Pods have been intermittently scheduling social events and also holding events with other Pods throughout the month. We hope the Pods will help close the social gap created by the pandemic and residents will feel a deeper sense of belonging and connection with their peers. We look forward to another great academic year and hope to implement new and innovate teaching techniques throughout the year. Please let me know if there is anything specific you'd like to learn this year and we can make it happen! Dr. Harprit Bedi Residency Update We were all excited to have our new first year radiology residents begin their journey with us. As expected, they have been enthusiastic and hard working while trying to manage the fire hose that is the first few months of residency. As they rotate through the department, please give them a warm welcome to the BMC radiology family! It's hard to believe that fall is nearly here and our interview season will be star - ting soon! As we did last year, this year's interviews will also be virtual with no appli - cants being present on campus. While there are both pros and cons to virtual inter - views, we are in full preparation to make sure it is a success as it was last year thanks to the incredible work done by Dionne and Albert and all the residents and faculty who participated. We will also be updating our \"swag bags'' based on feedback and some great tips from our residents! Sadly, Albert has moved on to pursue a career in engineering which was his major in college. He did a great job during the time he was with us and he will be missed. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors. Dr. Asim MianFrom the Desk oF / 13 Teaching Tips: Burnout Burnout is defined as \"a state of mental and physical exhaustion related to work or caregiving\"1. Three major components of burnout include emotional exhaustion, low self-esteem, and depersonalization2. Professional burnout within the field of diagnostic radiology has been previously studied, and is known to negatively affect happiness, job satisfaction, clinical perfor - mance, and patient care3,4. Burnout is a concern not only for attending physicians within the field of radiology, but those in training as well, as trainees are subject to similar risk factors, including long hours and difficult shifts5. In fact, studies show that trainees and mid-ca - reer attendings have the highest rates of burnout among physicians6. Technologists are also at increased risk for burnout. So, in order to help decrease the risk for burnout, the following key steps are recommended: 3 2 1 Prioritize lifestyle and balance: When busy work weeks sap your energy, it can be easy to let im - portant things like exercise, healthy eating, and hobbies fall by the wayside. Many forms of aerobic exercise, including walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling, have been proven to help improve mood. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, adults should build up to 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise each week for maximal health benefits. If you're interested in starting a new exercise program, discuss how best to do this with your PCP. Healthy eating is an important part of self-care, and it doesn't have to be difficult, even on a busy day. When making meal choices, the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition recommends lean protein, whole grains, and lots of fruits and vegetables. Also, try to reach for water instead of carbo - nated sugary sodas. Make time for yourself! Try to dedicate a minimum of 60 minutes each week to a hobby or passion. Enroll in that art class that you've always wanted to try, work on your Spanish, finish writing your novel, go salsa dancing... In order to take the best care of our patients, it's essen - tial that we take care of ourselves! Surround yourself by supportive people: Feelings of isolation at work and at home can increase the risk for burnout. It's important for self-health to have positive social connections, which can include fa - mily, friends and colleagues. Seek out opportunities to spend time with family, friends and colleagues, but wear a mask indoors or in close quarters as you would not want to become ill with COVID. Also, consider checking out the resources on the American College of Radiology website at: https://www.acr. org/Member-Resources/Benefits/Well-Being. Seek help when needed: Understand that burnout is a common phenomenon experienced by medical professionals. It's important to recognize risk factors and symptoms of burnout, and to seek help when needed. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, a self-test available online, is a well-studied measure of bur - nout, and can help you identify if you're at risk. The American College of Radiology also has a Well-Be - ing Index survey tool that can be used to monitor your level of wellness. If you find that you are at-risk or \"burned-out\" , don't hesitate to seek help - we must all be ready to take care of each other, especially during this ongoing pandemic.Promoting Wellness and Avoiding Burnout During the Ongoing Pandemic Dr. Priscilla Slanetz14 / From the Desk oF Special Announcements In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, click here to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected breast cancer screening and breast imaging practices.
