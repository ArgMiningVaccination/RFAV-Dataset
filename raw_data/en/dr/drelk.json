Your immune system relies on your body's overall health to maintain its effectiveness. Poor nutrition, stress, and exposure to disease-causing elements all increase your risk of getting sick. How Does Acupuncture Help? The equivalent of our immune systems in Chinese Medicine is called Wei Qi, or Defensive Qi. It runs between the skin and muscle, it is made from food and water, and it is the first line of defense to protect the body from external pathogens. A strong Wei Qi acts as a barrier that protects and defends the body from foreign substances which cause disease and illness. However, when our Wei Qi is weak, it decreases the body's ability to protect from external pathogens, and one's health is compromised. Regular acupuncture treatments strengthen, support, and rebalance the immune system, providing the body with proper tools to fend off colds and flu. Acupuncture can also shorten the length of any cold coming on and even stop it from taking you out. Acupuncture can also help reduce stress, which is a significant factor in the immune system's ability to fight off infection. Acupuncture stimulates and balances the immune system to create a strong line of defense. Acupuncture increases your number of immune cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and T-cells. It also helps those with immune-related illnesses by encouraging immune cells to reproduce and boost the body's defense. Why is Acupuncture so effective? Most treatments are directed towards relieving the symptoms rather than solving the underlying issue. Acupuncture is unique in that it works to result in a more long-lasting remedy for your immune system. Each acupuncture treatment is specific to each person. Other Ways to keep your Immune System healthy? In addition to Acupuncture, food and lifestyle can affect the immune system. Get enough sleep, plan time to relax and unwind and exercise regularly. In between your acupuncture treatments, a great way to stay healthy is with some acupressure you can do yourself. Applying pressure to acupuncture points can help stimulate the channels and communicate with the nervous system. Some important points to stimulate our natural immune system are: Gall Bladder 20 Kidney 27 Stomach 36 Lung 7 Large Intestine 4 When locating these points, feel for a tender spot. Spend at least 30 seconds on each point. Apply firm pressure while breathing steadily into your abdomen.
