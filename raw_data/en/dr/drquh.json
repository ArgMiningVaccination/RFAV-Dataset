Director, Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices Director, Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Brain and Behavior Institute EDUCATION Ph.D., University of Colorado at Boulder, 1989 BACKGROUND William E. Bentley is the Robert E. Fischell Distinguished Professor of Engineering and was founding Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering. He is currently Inaugural Director of the Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices and director of the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute (Mtech). He is also appointed to the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park and the [Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research](http://ibbr.umd.edu). At Maryland since 1989, Dr. Bentley has focused his research on the development of molecular tools that facilitate the expression of biologically active proteins, having authored over 350 related archival publications. Recent interests are on deciphering and manipulating signal transduction pathways, including those of bacterial communication networks, for altering cell phenotype. To enable discovery, his lab develops new strategies for opening 'communication' between devices and biological systems by the creation and facile assembly of biologically functional interfaces. These concepts are emerging within the fields of 'biofabrication' that exploits biological components and processes for assembly and 'bioelectronics\" that interface electronics with biology. He has served on advisory committees for the NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, FDA, USDA, and several state agencies. He has mentored more than 40 PhDs and 15 postdocs, many now in leadership roles within industry, federal agencies, and academia. He co-founded a protein manufacturing company, Chesapeake PERL, based on insect larvae as mini bioreactors. Dr. Bentley was recipient of the SIM's Schering-Plough Young Investigator Award, the Charles Thom Award of the SIMB, the Marvin Johnson Award of the BIOT Division in the ACS, and the AIChE's FPB Division Award. He is also a Fellow of the ACS, AAAS, and AIMBE and is an elected member of the American Academy of Microbiology.
