In clinical practice it is the process of identifying the specific pattern of disharmony or imbalance that is causing a patient's symptoms and determining the appropriate treatment. In TCM, the body is seen as a complex system of interconnected functions and processes that are in balance when the person is healthy. When there is an imbalance, the body experiences symptoms and signs that reflect the nature and severity of the disharmony. Differential diagnosis involves a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms and signs, including their physical, emotional, and mental states, as well as their pulse and tongue. The TCM practitioner will consider the patient's age, gender, constitution, and other factors that may be relevant to the diagnosis. The TCM practitioner will use this information to identify the pattern of disharmony and determine the appropriate treatment. This may include acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietary recommendations, and other therapies. Differential diagnosis is an integral part of the TCM clinical process, and it requires a deep understanding of TCM theory and a skilled and experienced practitioner to correctly diagnose and treat the patient.

[Triple Burner (San Jiao)](#triple) Pattern/Syndrome Differentiation In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), pattern/syndrome differentiation refers to the process of identifying patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and developing a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. TCM practitioners use a variety of diagnostic tools and frameworks, such as the [eight principles (Ba Gang)](#eight), Ying, Xue)](#four), [five elements (Wu Xing)](#five), [Qi, blood, and body fluids (Qi, Xue, Jin Ye)](#qi), and the [triple burner (San Jiao)](#triple), to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. The goal of pattern/syndrome differentiation in TCM is to identify the root cause of a patient's condition or imbalance and to treat the whole person, rather than just the symptoms. TCM practitioners may use a variety of treatment modalities, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and dietary and lifestyle recommendations, to restore balance and promote health in the body. Eight Principles (Ba Gang) The eight principles (Ba Gang) in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are a set of diagnostic categories that practitioners use to classify patterns of disharmony or imbalance in the body. These principles are: - Yin and yang: This principle refers to the balance of two opposing and complementary forces in the body. In TCM, yin represents the feminine, passive, and receptive aspects of the body, while yang represents the masculine, active, and expressive aspects. - Interior and exterior: This principle refers to the location of an imbalance or condition within the body. An interior condition is one that affects the internal organs, while an exterior condition affects the surface of the body. - Cold and heat: This principle refers to the presence of excess or deficiency of either cold or heat in the body. In TCM, cold is thought to constrict and contract the body, while heat expands and stimulates it. - Deficiency and excess: This principle refers to the presence of either a deficiency or excess of certain substances in the body, such as Qi (vital energy), blood, or fluids. - Full and empty: This principle refers to the presence of either excess or deficiency of certain substances in the body. A full condition is one in which there is an excess of substances, while an empty condition is one in which there is a deficiency. - Qi and blood stagnation: This principle refers to the proper flow of Qi (vital energy) and blood in the body. Stagnation refers to a blockage or disruption in the flow of these substances, which can lead to various health issues. - Upward and downward: This principle refers to the movement of Qi (vital energy) and other substances in the body. An upward movement refers to the upward movement of substances, while a downward movement refers to the downward movement. - Excess and deficiency of organ systems: This principle refers to the balance of function between the various organ systems in the body. An excess or deficiency of function in one or more organ systems may indicate an imbalance or disharmony in the body. Questions about Yo San University? [Ask Us Now!](#form4) Organs (Zang Fu) The concept of pattern/syndrome differentiation using organs (Zang Fu) refers to the use of the organs and organ systems in the body to diagnose and treat imbalances or conditions. TCM practitioners view the organs and organ systems as interconnected and interdependent, and they believe that imbalances or disharmonies in one part of the body can affect the overall health and functioning of the whole. TCM practitioners use the concept of Zang Fu to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. To do this, practitioners may assess the patient's symptoms, observe the body, and take a detailed medical history to gather information about the patient's overall health and any imbalances or conditions present. There are five main organs (Zang) in TCM that are believed to be the most important for maintaining health and balance in the body. These organs are: - Heart: The heart is considered the most important organ in TCM and is believed to be responsible for the circulation of blood, the production of Qi (vital energy), and the expression of emotion. - Liver: The liver is responsible for storing and regulating the flow of blood, as well as maintaining the smooth flow of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body. - Spleen: The spleen is responsible for the production and transportation of blood and Qi (vital energy), as well as the transformation and transportation of fluids in the body. - Lung: The lung is responsible for the intake of Qi (vital energy) and the distribution of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body, as well as the regulation of the body's water metabolism. - Kidney: The kidney is responsible for the production of Qi (vital energy) and the regulation of water metabolism, as well as the storage of essential substances, such as bone marrow and Jing (vital essence). TCM practitioners may also consider the six organs (Fu) in the body, which are: - Small intestine: The small intestine is responsible for separating and absorbing nutrients from food. - Large intestine: The large intestine is responsible for the absorption of water and the elimination of waste from the body. - Stomach: The stomach is responsible for the digestion and absorption of food. - Bladder: The bladder is responsible for the storage and elimination of urine. - Gallbladder: The gallbladder is responsible for the production and secretion of bile. - San Jiao (triple energizer): The triple energizer is responsible for the regulation of the body's temperature, fluids, and circulation. TCM practitioners use the concept of Zang Fu to diagnose and treat imbalances or conditions in the body by focusing on the organs and organ systems that are believed to be involved in the imbalance or condition. This category is part of the [Yo San University Master's Degree Program](https://yosan.edu/programs/masters-acupuncture-traditional-chinese-medicine/) Meridian/Channel (Jing Luo) In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the concept of pattern/syndrome differentiation using meridian/channel (Jing Luo) theory refers to the use of the meridians and channels in the body to diagnose and treat imbalances or conditions. In TCM, the meridians and channels are thought to be pathways through which Qi (vital energy) and blood flow throughout the body. TCM practitioners use the concept of Jing Luo to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. To do this, practitioners may assess the patient's symptoms, observe the body, and take a detailed medical history to gather information about the patient's overall health and any imbalances or conditions present. There are 12 main meridians (Jing Luo) in TCM that are believed to be the most important for maintaining health and balance in the body. These meridians are: - Lung meridian: The lung meridian is responsible for the intake of Qi (vital energy) and the distribution of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body, as well as the regulation of the body's water metabolism. - Large intestine meridian: The large intestine meridian is responsible for the absorption of water and the elimination of waste from the body. - Stomach meridian: The stomach meridian is responsible for the digestion and absorption of food. - Spleen meridian: The spleen meridian is responsible for the production and transportation of blood and Qi (vital energy), as well as the transformation and transportation of fluids in the body. - Heart meridian: The heart meridian is responsible for the circulation of blood, the production of Qi (vital energy), and the expression of emotion. - Small intestine meridian: The small intestine meridian is responsible for separating and absorbing nutrients from food. - Bladder meridian: The bladder meridian is responsible for the storage and elimination of urine. - Kidney meridian: The kidney meridian is responsible for the production of Qi (vital energy) and the regulation of water metabolism, as well as the storage of essential substances, such as bone marrow and Jing (vital essence). - Pericardium meridian: The pericardium meridian is responsible for protecting the heart and regulating the circulation of Qi (vital energy) and blood. - Triple energizer meridian: The triple energizer meridian is responsible for the regulation of the body's temperature, fluids, and circulation. - Gallbladder meridian: The gallbladder meridian is responsible for the production and secretion of bile. - Liver meridian: The liver meridian is responsible for storing and regulating the flow of blood, as well as maintaining the smooth flow of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body. TCM practitioners may use a variety of treatment modalities, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and dietary and lifestyle recommendations, to restore balance and promote health by targeting specific meridians and channels in the body. Six Stages (Liu Jing) The six stages (Liu Jing) theory in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a diagnostic framework that practitioners use to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. In TCM, the six stages refer to six different patterns of disharmony or imbalance that can occur in the body, and each stage is associated with a specific set of symptoms and treatment principles. The six stages are: - Wind: The wind stage is characterized by symptoms such as fever, chills, and joint pain. Treatment for the wind stage involves the use of warming and tonifying herbs and acupuncture points to strengthen the body's resistance to external pathogens. - Dampness: The dampness stage is characterized by symptoms such as swelling, edema, and a feeling of heaviness. Treatment for the dampness stage involves the use of diuretic and drying herbs and acupuncture points to drain excess fluids from the body. - Heat: The heat stage is characterized by symptoms such as fever, thirst, and a red tongue. Treatment for the heat stage involves the use of cooling and clearing herbs and acupuncture points to reduce heat and inflammation in the body. - Dryness: The dryness stage is characterized by symptoms such as dry skin, dry mouth, and constipation.

Treatment for the fire stage involves the use of calming and nourishing herbs and acupuncture points to balance and nourish the body. TCM practitioners use the six stages theory in combination with other diagnostic tools, such as observation of the body and assessment of symptoms, to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. Four Levels (Wei, Qi, Ying, Xue) The four levels (Wei, Qi, Ying, Xue) theory in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a diagnostic framework that practitioners use to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. In TCM, the four levels refer to four different layers or levels of the body, and each level is associated with a specific set of symptoms and treatment principles. The four levels are: - Wei (defensive) level: The Wei level is the outermost layer of the body and is responsible for protecting the body from external pathogens and toxins. Symptoms of imbalance at the Wei level may include fever, chills, and joint pain. Treatment for the Wei level involves the use of warming and tonifying herbs and acupuncture points to strengthen the body's resistance to external pathogens. - Qi (vital energy) level: The Qi level is the second layer of the body and is responsible for the production and circulation of Qi (vital energy) throughout the body. Symptoms of imbalance at the Qi level may include fatigue, shortness of breath, and digestive issues. Treatment for the Qi level involves the use of herbs and acupuncture points to tonify and regulate Qi (vital energy) in the body. - Ying (nutritive) level: The Ying level is the third layer of the body and is responsible for the nourishment and support of the body's tissues and organs. Symptoms of imbalance at the Ying level may include weakness, anemia, and poor appetite. Treatment for the Ying level involves the use of nourishing and tonifying herbs and acupuncture points to support and nourish the body's tissues and organs. - Xue (blood) level: The Xue level is the innermost layer of the body and is responsible for the circulation of blood throughout the body. Symptoms of imbalance at the Xue level may include irregular menstruation, blood disorders, and blood stasis. Treatment for the Xue level involves the use of herbs and acupuncture points to regulate and nourish the blood and promote circulation. Five Elements (Wu Xing) The five elements (Wu Xing) theory in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a diagnostic framework that practitioners use to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. In TCM, the five elements refer to five different aspects or qualities that are believed to be present in all living things and to influence the functioning of the body. The five elements are: - Wood: The wood element is associated with the liver and gallbladder, and it is believed to be responsible for the smooth flow of Qi (vital energy) and the regulation of emotion. Symptoms of imbalance in the wood element may include anger, frustration, and irritability. Treatment for the wood element involves the use of calming and nourishing herbs and acupuncture points to support the liver and gallbladder and promote the smooth flow of Qi (vital energy). - Fire: The fire element is associated with the heart and small intestine, and it is believed to be responsible for the circulation of blood and the expression of emotion. Symptoms of imbalance in the fire element may include anxiety, insomnia, and heart palpitations. Treatment for the fire element involves the use of calming and nourishing herbs and acupuncture points to support the heart and small intestine and promote the circulation of blood. - Earth: The earth element is associated with the spleen and stomach, and it is believed to be responsible for the transformation and transportation of nutrients in the body. Symptoms of imbalance in the earth element may include poor appetite, bloating, and indigestion. Treatment for the earth element involves the use of nourishing and tonifying herbs and acupuncture points to support the spleen and stomach and promote the transformation and transportation of nutrients in the body. - Metal: The metal element is associated with the lung and large intestine, and it is believed to be responsible for the regulation of the body's water metabolism and the elimination of waste. Symptoms of imbalance in the metal element may include respiratory issues, constipation, and dryness. Treatment for the metal element involves the use of moistening and nourishing herbs and acupuncture points to support the lung and large intestine and promote the regulation of the body's water metabolism and the elimination of waste. - Water: The water element is associated with the kidney and bladder, and it is believed to be responsible for the production of Qi (vital energy) and the regulation of water metabolism in the body. Symptoms of imbalance in the water element may include fatigue, low back pain, and urinary issues. Treatment for the water element involves the use of tonifying and nourishing herbs and acupuncture points to support the kidney and bladder and promote the production of Qi (vital energy) and the regulation of water metabolism in the body. TCM practitioners use the five elements theory in combination with other diagnostic tools to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. Qi, Blood, Body Fluids (Qi, Xue, Jin Ye) In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the concept of pattern/syndrome differentiation using Qi, blood, and body fluids (Qi, Xue, Jin Ye) refers to the use of the body's vital substances to diagnose and treat imbalances or conditions. TCM practitioners view Qi (vital energy), blood, and body fluids as essential substances that are necessary for maintaining health and balance in the body. TCM practitioners use the concept of Qi, blood, and body fluids to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. To do this, practitioners may assess the patient's symptoms, observe the body, and take a detailed medical history to gather information about the patient's overall health and any imbalances or conditions present. There are three main substances in TCM that are believed to be the most important for maintaining health and balance in the body: - Qi (vital energy): Qi is the vital energy that is believed to circulate throughout the body and to be necessary for the proper functioning of the body's organs and systems. Symptoms of Qi imbalances may include fatigue, shortness of breath, and digestive issues. Treatment for Qi imbalances may involve the use of herbs and acupuncture points to tonify and regulate Qi (vital energy) in the body. - Blood: Blood is the vital substance that is believed to nourish and support the body's tissues and organs. Symptoms of blood imbalances may include weakness, anemia, and poor appetite. Treatment for blood imbalances may involve the use of nourishing and tonifying herbs and acupuncture points to support and nourish the body's tissues and organs. - Body fluids: Body fluids are the vital substances that are believed to moisten and nourish the body's tissues and organs. Symptoms of body fluid imbalances may include dry skin, dry mouth, and constipation. Triple Burner (San Jiao) In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the concept of pattern/syndrome differentiation using the triple burner (San Jiao) refers to the use of the triple burner system to diagnose and treat imbalances or conditions. In TCM, the triple burner is a system of three interconnected organs that are believed to be responsible for the regulation of the body's temperature, fluids, and circulation. TCM practitioners use the concept of the triple burner to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health. To do this, practitioners may assess the patient's symptoms, observe the body, and take a detailed medical history to gather information about the patient's overall health and any imbalances or conditions present. There are three main organs in the triple burner system: - Upper burner: The upper burner is responsible for the regulation of the body's fluids and is associated with the lung and large intestine. Symptoms of upper burner imbalances may include respiratory issues, constipation, and dryness. - Middle burner: The middle burner is responsible for the regulation of the body's temperature and is associated with the stomach and spleen. Symptoms of middle burner imbalances may include poor appetite, bloating, and indigestion. - Lower burner: The lower burner is responsible for the regulation of the body's circulation and is associated with the small intestine and bladder. Symptoms of lower burner imbalances may include irregular menstruation, blood disorders, and urinary issues. TCM practitioners use the triple burner concept in combination with other diagnostic tools, such as observation of the body and assessment of symptoms, to identify patterns of imbalance or disharmony in the body and to develop a treatment plan to restore balance and promote health.
