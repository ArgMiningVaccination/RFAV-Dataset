The beauty of data conjugated through hindsight is that we know that something very special happened in the past year, year 60 of our history. Did we ever let the clutch out! Milestones were everywhere: university designation, now, \"We are NUNM!\" Nine academic programs (including the new undergraduate programs announced this year), our largest graduating class ever, our largest incoming class ever, our most productive research year ever, and the largest number of continuing medical and community education events in six decades of serving our natural medicine communities. We're also proud that our anniversary year saw a slew of new books from the NUNM Press, including the much anticipated Food as Medicine Everyday book based on our popular classes of the same name. Importantly, the campus footprint continues to evolve as we await final permission from the city to take over control of the street beside the Spaulding House, which will then blossom into a new garden. We continue to be creative with our existing space too, as work continues to repurpose and remodel campus buildings into offices, a proposed teaching kitchen, and facilities for our coming sports medicine program. There's more. More staff, more space, more classrooms, growing cash flow, and an expanding community of partners, donors and colleagues, all building an enduring network of friends for Oregon's newest university. We are in a celebratory spirit as our beloved NCNM has become NUNM, a postsecondary and postgraduate institution. We head into our seventh decade strong and poised confidently for a future that wants us. Underneath the tangible accomplishments, the visible changes and the expansion of our beloved NUNM lies a deep, aligned, authentic belief in, and an unapologetic and fearless commitment to, the idea that natural medicine is the medicine the planet needs. The numbers in this report speak to the relevance and value of our rapidly diversifying program mix, the timely promise of our new undergraduate programs, and our solid reputation in the research community. They also speak to our growing international presence with the global health degree program, and to our leadership in conferences like the International Congress on Naturopathic Medicine, happening in Barcelona in July 2016. Most importantly, this report chronicles an inspired community that continues to respond to a call to action to build the principles and philosophy of the natural medicine systems we love and serve. We invite you to read on and join the celebration! David J. Schleich, PhD Willow Moore, DC, ND President, NUNM Board Chair, NUNM Letter from the President & Board Chair We head into our seventh decade strong and poised confidently for a future that wants us. 4 2015-2016 Annual Report 2015-2016 Annual Report 5 On its 60th anniversary, NCNM becomes a university and continues to make history as a top medical institution, now known as NUNM. Most of the time it's difficult, if not impossible, to perceive history in the making. Other times, you just know. There was no question that history was being made at North America's leading college of natural medicine this past year. On May 28, National College of Natural Medicine, originally founded as National College of Naturopathic Medicine, celebrated its 60th anniversary as \"the profession's college. \" A little over a month later, the college announced the launch of a new era as National University of Natural Medicine. Few from that small founding group of naturopathic doctors are around to tell the tale. However, we know from their writings, recordings and archival documents that four students, guided by a handful of unpaid faculty and staff, began classes in a rented storefront on Portland's Hawthorne Boulevard in the fall of 1956. That group and the many staff, faculty and some 2,600 alumni who followed, also passed on something less tangible, but still evident 60 years later: a legacy of persistence and an unwavering belief in the natural way of healing. The legacy continued Feb. 19, 2016, as the NCNM Board of Directors voted to adopt the name of National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM). The change, effective June 28, marked a further expansion of the college's curricula into new bachelor's degree programs, one in nutrition and one in integrative health sciences, to begin in the fall of 2016. Work commenced throughout the year to recruit students, hire faculty and ready facilities for an anticipated 30 new students. To meet the needs of the school's continuing growth, the campus began planning a new teaching kitchen and laying the foundation for a new sports medicine program. Barlean's, the maker of fish oils and other organic specialty oils, donated $380,000 toward the kitchen, and rebuilding work began in late spring on a storage building next to NUNM's Administration Building. Once completed, staff from the Service Building will move into the new wing of the Admin Building, and planning is underway to remodel the former Service Building for a new kitchen, offices and sports medicine-related facilities. Another highlight this year included recognition by the state of Oregon for ongoing efforts to enhance patient care at the NCNM Clinic on campus. The Oregon Health Authority designated the clinic, now known as NUNM Health Centers\u2014 Lair Hill, as a top-tier Patient-Centered Primary Care Home, its highest level of healthcare certification. NUNM is one of the very few natural medicine clinics to receive this award to date. The move to university status also meant a substantial rebranding, with announcements far and wide to the new university's many supporters and constituents. In addition, the change necessitated the design of a new logo, many changes on the website and publications, as well as the roll out of new campus signage. Our Campus There was no question that history was being made at North America's leading college of natural medicine this past year. neon sign at night 6 2015-2016 Annual Report 2015-2016 Annual Report 7 Academic programs continue to expand offerings, refine and enhance natural medicine education. It has almost become commonplace: National College of Natural Medicine, now National University of Natural Medicine, has been racking up record numbers of graduates in the last few years, while welcoming record incoming classes. One of the key factors in that growth has been the expansion of the university's curricula. NUNM now offers nine accredited degree programs in naturopathic medicine, classical Chinese medicine, integrative medicine research, nutrition, global health, integrative mental health and integrative health sciences, with plans underway for more programs in the future. The university's Helfgott Research Institute, home to a growing body of evidence-based natural medicine research, got an extensive boost from the National Institutes of Health with the award of more than $3 million in research grants. The grants, via the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, are for two five-year research grants, one on mindfulness-based stress reduction for multiple sclerosis and the other for cross-training of investigators to translate and apply complementary and alternative medicine concepts. In the College of Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM), the year's big news was the arrival of the first new cohort of Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM) students. Ten CCM students registered for the program in fall 2015, which builds on and expands the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine's lineage- based approach to teaching, with the DSOM's deeper immersion into the ancient Chinese medical texts. A site visit by accreditors from the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) this spring was especially encouraging, and the university hopes for full accreditation approval of the DSOM in the next fiscal year. Two CCM faculty members, six students and three alumni journeyed to China to visit with noted Chinese medicine practitioner Li Xin, take classes, and visit the Chinese Medicine Museum and Zidao Jingshe (Natural Path Academy) in Shanghai. CCM, which has long drawn faculty from China, continues to forge and maintain ties with Chinese medicine and higher education institutions. After much work and a year of classes the verdict is in: the College of Naturopathic Medicine's curriculum overhaul is a hit. While still a work in progress, the new block format has students mastering fewer subjects per term coupled with more hands-on lab and clinic experiences starting in the first year. The new approach is multidimensional, with concepts such as ethics and cultural competency and naturopathic philosophy woven throughout the curriculum. Faculty report that there are far more insightful questions from first-year students than in the past. The university continues to make great progress with the development of new residencies so that naturopathic grads now have many more residency opportunities than in the past. From a single residency in 1979, full-salaried naturopathic residencies have grown to 14 on-site and some 28 off-site locations across the country.Program Development The university continues to make great progress with the development of new residencies so that naturopathic grads now have considerably more residency opportunities than in the past. 8 2015-2016 Annual Report 2015-2016 Annual Report 9 NUNM's Health Centers, institutes and educational programs continue to connect with businesses and a community hungry for natural medicine care and information. From practically the beginning of its 60-year existence, NUNM has had considerable community contact through its classes and clinics. While that teaching and healthcare service model continues to grow, with our satellite clinic in Beaverton and an Eastside Portland clinic in the planning stages, NUNM also continues to reach out through community classes, its thriving institutes and expanding business partnerships. That latter group, known as NUNM Partners, with well over 60 businesses, led by Bob's Red Mill (with $1 million in donations) and Barlean's (with $500,000 in funding), provide critical support for NUNM's education, research and residency programs. Bob's Red Mill, among its many contributions, sponsors an annual Integrative Medicine Scholarship Contest, which features area medical students competing for scholarship money through the creation of videos about whole foods. NUNM student Anaheed Little won $4,000 as a finalist for her video on spelt. Barlean's donated $380,000 for a new teaching kitchen on campus, part of an anticipated sports medicine program. Another partner, Galen's Way, is helping \"green\" the urban campus with a second garden, which has also opened up educational opportunities with area elementary schools, with hands-on gardening experiences for students from the nearby Southwest Charter School and Gresham's Reynolds Academy. One of the year's most exciting philanthropy stories was the growth of alumni giving. The fiscal year brought in $32,472, the largest one-year total in school history, according to the Advancement Office. Also on campus, the Age Wise Institute is the latest addition to a group that includes the Traditional Roots Institute, Women in Balance Institute and Food as Medicine Institute. Located in the Spaulding House, the new institute seeks to promote healthy aging through community-based programs, education and research. Natural medicine and wellness classes have been launched at senior centers and senior living facilities. Through a partnership with Portland's Terwilliger Plaza, an independent living and retirement community, the institute delivered classes on medicinal honey making and herbal tea blending. In addition, the institute sponsored the visit of a naturopathic physician to Rose Villa, another retirement community in Milwaukie, Oregon. The doctor will make house calls there on an on-call basis. While classes such the popular Food as Medicine Everyday series from the Food as Medicine Institute (FAMI) continue to be a solid source of revenue, institute-sponsored conferences were also successful. NUNM held its first Integrative Sports Medicine Conference in November, foreshadowing a proposed new sports medicine degree program; the annual Food as Medicine Symposium was in February, and the third annual Traditional Roots Herbal Conference in May packed in medicinal plant experts and aficionados alike.Community Engagement & Philanthropy From practically the beginning of its 60-year existence, NUNM has had considerable community contact through its classes and clinics. 2015-2016 Annual Report 11 FAMI nutrition experts Drs. Julie Briley and Courtney Jackson celebrated the publication by the NUNM Press of their book Food as Medicine Everyday: Reclaim Your Health with Whole Foods. The book has been a hot seller for the NUNM alumnae and faculty, leading a growing number of titles from the press on naturopathic medicine issues, history and other subjects. Of course, no year would be complete without graduation. The largest graduating class in the school's history, more than 200 students, got a joyous send-off. This year's celebration was punctuated by a keynote address by Dr. Gordon Smith, class of 1976, environmentalist, Native American health advocate and co-founder of the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. The annual Min Zidell Garden Gala, a pre-commencement gathering, featured Helen Ebers and Lauren Proctor, nieces of naturopathic pioneer Dr. Benedict Lust, with a keynote address from Mark Blumenthal, esteemed founder of the American Botanical Council. Also near the end of the fiscal year, the NCNM Clinic, now known as the NUNM Health Centers, announced a key new partnership with Portland's Cascade AIDS Project (CAP) to provide primary care at Pivot, an LGBTQ community space. The agreement strengthens NUNM's longtime commitment to health and well-being for the city's LGBTQ population. NUNM continues to work closely with its Lair Hill neighbors on land use, campus expansion and transportation issues. NUNM is an active participant in the Southwest Corridor Plan, which will add mass transit options to the area, and works closely with the South Portland Neighborhood Association on such issues as turning SW Hooker Street over to campus use as garden space. 10 2015-2016 Annual Report Sources & contractsGovernment grants & contractsSales & services \u2014 clinics & the storeOther revenue \u2014 net Total revenue3% TUTION RATE INCREASE6.1% REVENUE FROM TUITION AND FEESSTUDENT NUNM'S DOE * RATIO2.6 *department of educationFactsQuick 2015/2016}due to higher enrollment, new programs and strong retention rates for the 2015-16 academic year 12 2015-2016 Annual Report Financial Statements NUNM's performance in several critical areas is summarized in the pages that follow.
