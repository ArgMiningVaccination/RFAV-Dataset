EDITOR-IN-CHIEF Richard Vach rvach @chiroeco.com ASSOCIATE EDITOR 904-567-1542 jpruitt@chiroeco.com and Helen C. Luckey If you haven't considered serving the senior or 65-plus population with additional services, or even special - izing in senior health and wellness, this issue may change your mind. Demographic stats: The Baby Boomer demographic will increase today's over-65 population by almost double in approximately the next 25 years according to the Centers for Disease Control; due to technological and health advances, older Americans are now better surviving acute episodes of chronic diseases \u2014 heart attacks, strokes, mastectomies \u2014 that ended lives in earlier years and are recovering to high-health lifestyles; This age group has more disposable income \u2014 lots more; This age group is also pushing demand for greater chiropractic care , as seen in current legislation on the books, including increased military coverage for families, expanded care for chronic pain patients, etc. Supplement/anti-aging stats: More than three-quarters of U.S. adults (77%) report taking dietary supplements, according to the most recent CRN Consumer Survey on Dietary Supplements ; Anxiety and stress are the top health concern in the 2nd annual national survey on emerging ingredient categories commissioned by Trust Transparency Center, at 30% of adults surveyed; The world wellness economy is a whopping $3.7 trillion according to MarketWatch, and anti-aging is expected to rise to $216 billion by 2021, according to Zion Market Research; According to the 2019 Chiropractic Economics Salary & Expense Survey , doctors of chiropractic across the U.S. reported that wellness products and services offered by chiropractors rose a healthy 33% over last year, and anti-aging services and product offerings from chiropractors rose by 25%.Prepare for fall(s) A large part of servicing the senior demographic for years to come will be keeping seniors on their feet. Chiropractors are the No. 1 line of defense when it comes to seniors and injury \u2014 or death \u2014 from falls. Approximately one out of three adults aged 65 and older falls each year, according to the CDC. This is extra-concerning when you learn that falls are the leading cause of injury-related death for the 65+ age group. DCs are the first line of defense by assisting with better posture, strengthening lower backs for balance, restoring full ranges of motion, and introducing and reaffirming a general approach to staying pain-free during seniors' Golden Years. The chiropractic care you supply effectively addresses chronic pain and the drivers that cause posture problems as well as influence balance \u2014 and most importantly can prevent future falls. A \"Falls Treatment Program\" for seniors can consist of a balance exercise program that improves strength, reaction time and positional awareness; manipulation of the spine, feet and ankles to restore arthritic joints; and fine motor skills including ankle and hip positioning to avoid backward falls, just to name a few strategies. Combined with other applications, the options are limitless for increased senior wellness services. Establish your authority \"Understanding the relationship between balance, posture and lower-back pain is an important connection for patients, the general public and other health professionals to make,\" writes Steven Weiniger, DC, for Chiropractic Economics . \"The well- established link between back pain and fall risk presents the chiropractic profession with another important opportunity to move from 'alternative' to 'cultural authority' for the treatment of fall risk in the elderly.\" To your practice's success, Richard Vach EDITOR-IN-CHIEFBABY BOOMERS ARE SUPER- CHARGING THE SENIOR MARKET 8 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMFor 67 years, Foot Levelers has been using weight-bearing methodologies to hand-craft the world's best custom orthotics.

The celebration began on Sept. 19 with a presentation by alumnus Joshua Kollmann, DC, \"Building a Pro Career with Elite Athletes.\" Kollmann has served as chiropractor for the NFL's Carolina Panthers and as part of the PGA Sports Medicine Team for close to a decade. College, community and health profession leaders gathered Sept. 20 at the sold-out President's Dinner to celebrate NYCC's 100 years of excellence in natural health care education.

The awards are presented by Ragan Communications, a provider of conferences and training for PR, media relations and corporate communications professionals. \"Being named an honorable mention recipient by Ragan in this prestigious, highly competitive program is equivalent to a film receiving an Academy Award nomination,\" said F4CP Executive Vice President Sherry McAllister, DC. ChiroEco.com/f4cp-pr-awardWhat doesn't kill you does make you stronger Scientists at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management have established a causal relationship between failure and future success, proving German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's adage that \"what does not kill me makes me stronger.\" The researchers utilized advanced analytics to assess the relationship between professional failure and success for young scientists. They found, in contrast to their initial expectations, that failure early in one's career leads to greater success in the long term for those who try again. \"The attrition rate does increase for those who fail early in their careers,\" lead author Yang Wang wrote. \"But those who stick it out, on average, perform much better in the long term, suggesting that if it doesn't kill you, it really does make you stronger.\" ChiroEco.com/stronger TRENDING STORIESYOUR ONLINE CHIROPRACTIC COMMUNITY facebook.com/ChiroEcoMag twitter.com/ChiroEcoMag instagram.com/ChiroEcoMag Favorite us on Apple News Webinars Podcasts Resource Centers Videos Job Board Buyers Guide Surveys Industry Research School Guide Students Products & Services Current News MISSED THE LAST ISSUE?

That reflects a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% since 2016. (More statistical insights in this area are available at zionmarketresearch.com.) People want to spend their money on strategies that will make them look younger. However, the pressure to look younger can also spark resistance against a beauty industry that prizes youth and urges people, especially women, to fight the signs of aging with every product they purchase. As a chiropractor you're not in the beauty business, but you have a unique angle on this market: Your treatments can help people not only look younger but feel younger. You can provide many services that will get them feeling younger \u2014 such as help losing weight, relieving chronic pain, recommending supplements to help restore their vitality, and addressing injuries so they can keep up an active lifestyle. When you promote your anti-aging services via social media, focus on how patients will feel after treatment. Everyone \u2014 no matter what their opinion of the beauty industry \u2014 wants to feel better!

The findings suggest it is possible to recover from the disease without extreme lifestyle interventions or calorie restrictions. Type 2 diabetes affects 400 million people worldwide and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, blindness and amputations. While the disease can be managed through a combination of positive lifestyle changes and medication, it is also possible for the high blood glucose levels that define diabetes to return to normal \u2014 through significant calorie restriction and weight loss. An intensive low-calorie diet involving a total daily intake of 700 calories (less than one cheeseburger) for eight weeks has been associated with remission in almost nine out of 10 people with recently-diagnosed diabetes, and in half of people with longstanding disease. However, there is little evidence to show whether the same effect can be achieved by people undergoing less-intensive interventions, which are more feasible and potentially scalable to the wider population. To answer this question, a team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge studied data from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial, a prospective cohort study of 867 people with newly-diagnosed diabetes aged 40-69 years recruited from general practices in the eastern region. The researchers found that 257 subjects (30%) were in remission at five-year follow-up. \u2014 Science Daily, sciencedaily.com ChiroEco.com/diabetes-remissionHEALTH NEWS Type 2 diabetes remission possible with 'achievable' weight loss BY THE NUMBERS: ACTIVE AGING CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 15\"Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been.\" \u2014 David Bowie Seniors surveyed who are \"satisfied with their lives.\" Source: National Council on AgingAmericans over age 70 who do not meet vegetable intake recommendations Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionProjected 65+ population in the U.S. by 2060, which would be more than double that of 2014 Source: HealthyPeople.gov 98million 86% 79% 80% 61%19minutes As the result of a fall, an older American dies every 19 minutes in the U.S. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionApproximate number of older adults who suffer from a chronic disease, 77% of whom have two or more Source: National Council on Agingmen womenPROFITABLE PRACTICE New data on chronic pain and exercise creates opportunity New research revealed in a story from National Public Radio in September reaffirmed the opposite of what health care providers believed for the longest time \u2014 chronic pain sufferers should exercise to relieve pain rather than staying immobile. The news is good for chiropractors who incorporate wellness, exercise, physical therapy or weight loss into their practices, since the majority of chiropractic patients are seen for chronic back or neck pain. While moving was thought to make the pain worse for chronic pain sufferers, researchers now say the opposite is true and that with the help of the brain, exercise can help reduce the pain. \"With chronic pain, the body almost gets into this downward spiral where...you get fearful of movement, then you don't move, then you get weak, then you get more pain,\" says Douglas Ebner, a physical therapist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, speaking to U.S. News and World Report . \"Then they don't want to do anything, and then they get even weaker.\" Now research is showing even the smallest level of exercise for chronic pain patients, built up over time, can alleviate pain with the help of the brain. Pairing chiropractic care and exercise is providing research-based alternatives to opioids and other drugs for pain.

BACK LOG SCHOOL NEWS Palmer College of Chiropractic receives $1 million gift to transform student union The student union at Palmer College of Chiropractic will soon be re-imagined thanks to a $1 million gift from Bruce C. Hagen, DC, and his wife Bethel M. Hagen. The future Hagen Student Union will be a welcoming, modern space where students, faculty, staff and alumni will gather for years to come. In honor of their generosity, Palmer College has named the student union the Bruce and Bethel Hagen Student Union. A dedication ceremony was held in August, during Palmer's Homecoming weekend in Davenport, Iowa. Bruce Hagen, a 1953 Palmer graduate, made the decision to become a chiropractor to serve others, as he had done with the U.S. Air Force during World War II. Originally from Wisconsin, the Hagens made their home in Sioux Falls, S.D., after graduation. There they raised two daughters and four sons while maintaining a successful practice. Three of their sons went on to become Palmer-graduate chiropractors, and their grandson is now attending Palmer's main campus. \"We're grateful to Dr. Hagen and his wife for this incredibly generous gift that will help Palmer continue to deliver a leading educational experience for future chiropractors,\" said Dennis Marchiori, DC, PhD, chancellor and CEO, Palmer College of Chiropractic. \"This gift will play a vital role in plans to enhance and modernize our campus.\" \"I hope this will encourage others to give to the college, because we ought to do something above and beyond to make it possible for students to have a better education,\" Bruce Hagen said. \u2014 Palmer College of Chiropractic, palmer.edu ChiroEco.com/palmer-student-union 16 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COM Receive direct access to Dr. Meletis for answers to CBD questions VESIsorb\u00ae Technology for improved today's best-in-class CBD product, produced under the highest ethical and quality standards, sold only through Health Care Professionals.

That's part of my healthy aging strategy.\" Use mobilization, manipulation, and all other manual techniques to help achieve re-awakening of lost ROM. Don't be greedy; tell it like it is First off, don't be a greedy doctor. Don't perform more treatment than patients really need, and only provide suggestions and products that one personally uses. And tell it like it is! If you see a patient who needs to lose weight, stop smoking, de-stress or get active, then be that doctor to lay out a plan. Don't hesitate to get involved with your patients' medical doctors. If you need to, refer to MD specialists for clearance before starting an exercise program or a fat-loss program, especially if the patient has a known pre-existing condition. Ask if there are any activities they should avoid. Get a qualified instructor or become that doctor who can regress and progress workouts to every patient's ability and needs. Ideally you would be able to train patients in-person in your office; if for whatever reason that's not possible, at minimum get some personal training yourself. A good place to start is the American Chiropractic Association Rehab Symposium in March 2020 in Tempe, Ariz. ( ACARehabCouncil.org ). Exercise training done right leads to stronger muscles and bones, which in turn lead to multiple benefits, such as: \u0084\u0084less degeneration of cognitive function \u0084\u0084reversal of muscle wastage \u0084\u0084decreased risk of Alzheimer's \u0084\u0084control of diabetes Movement and exercise are the key to staying strong, energetic and healthy as one gets older. Tips for seniors Seniors, if they can get down and up off the floor, need to learn some foam rolling. If they can only stand, then do propriocep - tion training and joint mobility exercises, especially at the ankle, Older people can benefit greatly from simple proprioceptive training, joint-by-joint mobility training, and gait training, but because of old patterns, they have to be approached in a completely different way. 20 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COM10 Reasons To Choose ChiroTouch Most-referred Over half of customers referred by a friend or coach1 Most customers Trusted by 21,000 providers and in over 13,000 practices in the U.S .

Next, instruct them in dynamic warm-ups that are geared toward keeping upright with better posture and maintaining good gait. Patients enjoy learning the techniques and usually have the required patience. Working with older and de-conditioned populations and doing a little exercise training changes lives. They should know squat Patients should be able to do their age in bodyweight squats. Then recommend they do the number of bodyweight squats of the age they want to live to be. Squats will help patients main - tain ankle, knee, hip and lumbopelvic mobility, and when they do that many in a row (or in sets) there is also a cardio benefit. Older patients don't lose the desire to move, so with an eye toward avoiding joint problems and poor movement patterns, this will decrease degenerative joint disease. It may take a lot of practice and time performing the movement correctly to overcome bad patterns. Older people can benefit greatly from simple proprioceptive training, joint-by-joint mobility training, and gait training, but because of old patterns, they have to be approached in a completely different way. Some methods include ELDOA, tai chi, CLX bands and yoga as the most useful exercise tools for all populations. Work toward keeping the brain neurologically \"on\" and the body \"fit.\" Watching the diet Recommending a Mediterranean Diet, cleanses at least once a year, and looking at lab reports to discuss individualized supplements are tips for older patients struggling with weight or health. For fat loss go to the ketogenic diet. Measure a patient's body composition with a machine, and based on the lean muscle mass number in pounds, that's the number of grams of protein patients should consume a day. The researcher Longo, who wrote the book The Longevity Diet , suggests that we eat mostly vegan (notice the plant-based diet movement on the rise?), plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of 2-3 per week. A protein guide: Protein below age 65 \u2014 keep protein intake low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). Protein over age 65 \u2014 slightly increase protein intake, but also increase consumption of fish, eggs, white meat, and PROTEIN BELOW AGE 65 Recommend low intake of 0.31-0.36 grams per pound of body weight 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMExperience the Care Plan Calculator integrating ChiroHealthUSA\u00ae as part of the equation.

Every patient I see with nice skin (men and women), I ask them, \"What is your beauty tip?\" The answer has always been a daily application of sunscreen on the face.

The government and other health care providers are recognizing the effectiveness of chiropractic care, but this comes with greater responsibility.THE SILVER TSUNAMI Is your practice prepared for the coming 65-and-over patient wave? BY RAY FOXWORTH, DC, FICC, MCS-P TIME TO READ: 9-11 MIN. TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ENROLL IN MEDICARE EVERY DAY. By 2020, 64 million will be enrolled, and 80 million by 2030. By 2050, MedPAC estimates that people over 65 will represent more than 20% of the U.S. population. Today's aging population is healthier and living longer, and their goal is to continue living in their own homes. According to AARP, nearly 90% of people over age 65 want to stay at home for as long as possible. They have a mindset of, \"Think health, not wealth.\" Many in our profession still have reservations about treating Medicare patients, but we have never been better positioned to take care of this aging generation. CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 29FEATURE STORY Viewing Medicare through the right lens It is not surprising that many in our profession view Medicare negatively. The U.S. Office of Inspector General (OIG) has issued reports over the last several years defining critical issues related to chiropractic billing and documentation. In 2018, the OIG Work Report announced the highest rate of improper payment (from 2010-15) ranging from 43.9-54.1% for chiropractic services, compared with 9.9-12.9% for all other Part B services. As a result we have seen a rise in audits for Medicare patients throughout our profession. In a recent interview with my friend R.J. Crawford, DC, he shared that many doctors who face the decision to participate with insurance and Medicare wonder, \"Is it worth it?\" This fear is due in large part to the stories and headlines across the country that make Medicare look worse than the boogeyman when it comes to the potential for audit or investigation that could lead to career-ending fines and penalties. In discussing this with consultants around the country, I found there has been an increase in audits, but that it has not been limited to Medicare. As one consultant who has worked on hundreds of cases over the years stated, \"only 24% of the cases I have consulted on were initiated by Medicare; the rest were undertaken by insurance companies.\" The silver tsunami The onset of the \"silver tsunami\" is serious for those responsible for protecting the integrity of the Medicare fund. They must ensure that those funds are available for the millions of bene - ficiaries who depend on them, and the millions more who will depend on them in the future. Part of the problem with chiropractic and Medicare has been that each Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) separately defined their interpretation of Medicare policy. This left 12 potentially different interpretations. Medicare sees this as a problem. \"The good news,\" said Scott Munsterman, DC, FICC, CPCO, an acknowledged expert on the transforming model of health care delivery, \"is that work has been accomplished behind the scenes by Drs. Steve Conway and Michael Jacklitch, who worked one-on-one with chief medical directors of all of the Medicare contractors to arrive at a consensus in how Medicare policy for chiropractic care should be interpreted and implemented.\" Having a universal interpretation puts everyone on the same page, and Medicare is now using this universal approach to teach chiropractors and \"claims reviewers\" alike. Without this universal approach, chiropractors could have seen policy decisions that substantially restricted care for Medicare patients, the largest growing population in our country. Steve Conway, DC, JD, stated that the most common request Highest rate of improper payment for chiropractic services, 2018 OIG Work Report43.9-54.1% The public wants what chiropractic care offers. Other health care providers and payers are recognizing the effectiveness of chiropractic care. 30 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMFEATURE STORY he receives from chiropractors across the country is, \"Just tell me what to do.\" But he spends more time teaching them what not to do. Seem counterintuitive? \"I find that many of us in the profession learn more from the mistakes of the past,\" Conway says. And he's right. As he and his good friends, Michael Jacklitch, DC, and Munsterman, continue to share the universal interpretation of policy from Medicare across the country, the error rate for chiropractic services billed is decreasing. So what are the most common mistakes that Conway shares with his audience? 1. Start-Over Diagnosis: This strategy is often used because the doctor was told by an \"expert\" that if you change the diagnosis, then everything starts over and you can keep treating the patient. The OIG is concerned about this approach because it doesn't match the start-treat-release process of a true episode of care. 2. No End in Sight: The doctor keeps treating a patient 2-3 times a week. The patient has pain and/or other functional deficiencies that the doctor uses as evidence for treatment. Here, there is no end in sight to the patient's treatment plan \u2014 if this patient has a \"treatment plan\" at all. 3. Keep Changing the Goal: I often hear the advice, \"If you just continue setting mini-goals, and reaching them, then you can keep treating the patient.\" The problem is that there is no \"episode of care\" with a definitive beginning, middle and end. 4. Maintenance-Only Approach: Unfortunately, some \"expert\" told chiropractors that the way to avoid billing Medicare altogether (and to collect directly from patients) is to have them sign an ABN form on the initial visit. Of all the problems shared by Conway in his lectures, this one has the most serious consequences. The OIG views this practice as intentional fraud, and they are actively investigating these cases. New Medicare legislation In a November 2018 press release, the American Chiropractic Association announced that legislation had been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would expand Medicare's coverage of services provided by chiropractors within the scope of their license. The bill would allow Medicare beneficiaries to access the chiropractic profession's wide-ranging, non-drug approach to pain management, which includes manual manipu - lation of the spine and extremities, joint mobilization, soft-tissue massage techniques, physiological therapies, exercise instruc - tion and activity advice. Access to non-drug approaches to pain management under Medicare, as well as private health care plans, has become increasingly important in the wake of the national opioid crisis, according to the ACA.With all of this power and positioning comes a great responsibility for the entire profession to put what we know into practice and resolve our documentation issues once and for all. 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMFEATURE STORY In 1906, statesman Winston Churchill said, \"Where there is great power, there is a great responsibility. Where there is less power, there is less responsibility. And where there is no power, there can, I think, be no responsibility.\" This statement has never been more applicable to our profession as it is today. Amid the opioid crisis, chiropractic has been acknowledged as a solution for pain management by the medical community, thereby giving us the power to be paid for the broad range of services we provide for our Medicare patients ( Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians , 2017). Meeting public demand The public wants what chiropractic care offers. Other health care providers and payers are recognizing the effectiveness of chiropractic care. Patient satisfaction and experience ratings for chiropractic physicians are higher than for any other provider type. But, with all of this power and positioning comes a great responsi - bility for the entire profession to put what we know into practice and resolve our documentation issues once and for all. Without continuing efforts to lower chiropractic error rates with Medicare, the request to expand coverage will fall on deaf ears in Congress, CMS and the Office of Inspector General. The silver tsunami will show up in our offices. Let's start showing up for them and learning how we can all improve, standardize Medicare policy across the nation, and improve our documentation and efforts to educate the Medicare reviewers. This isn't just an \"us\" problem; it's a Congressional problem, a policy problem and a Medicare (MAC) problem. It is time to stop pointing fingers at all the stakeholders. Finding fault is easy, but finding a fix is more important \u2014 and we are on the way as a profession to doing just that.

It is safe and effective, which needs to be proven by larger-scale human studies.CBD'S INTRIGUING ROLE IN JOINT HEALTH Besides inflammation, CBD impacts arthritis and more BY CHRIS D. MELETIS, ND TIME TO READ: 5-7 MIN. FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, CANNABIS HAS BEEN USED BY PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PAIN, including joint-related disorders. Today, joint pain is the largest medical reason for requesting use of the drug.1 In comparison, it is only relatively recently that researchers have started to investigate cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, for its beneficial effects on the joints. Many of the pre-clinical findings confirm what chiropractors and doctors are witnessing in clinical practice \u2014 that CBD is likely an effective option for patients with arthritis. The endocannabinoid system and joint health Although an extensive discussion of the endocannabinoid system is outside the scope of this article, it is necessary to recap some basic functions of this system to understand its effects on pain. The endocannabinoid system comprises the cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2), their endogenous ligands known as endocannabinoids, and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. The two primary endocannabinoids are anandamide and 2-arachido - noylglycerol (2-AG). It has recently been discovered that other receptors such as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), 36 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMRESEARCH RESULTS peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR), and G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) play a critical role in the endocannabinoid system.2 Although CBD is a phytocannabinoid, its effects on joint health and inflammation are not primarily mediated directly through the traditional endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Rather, it coupled receptors.\u00b3 CBD's modulation of the endocannabinoid system also occurs through its ability to inhibit FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down the endocannabinoid anandamide.4 Additionally, CBD has immunoregulatory effects that are of special interest in rheumatoid arthritis, which is characterized by immune cell infiltration into joints.3 For example, CBD can dose-dependently suppress lymphocyte proliferation.5 It also induces regulatory T-cells.3 It's important to note that CBD does not inhibit either the COX-1 or COX-2 enzymes.6,7 Inhibition of these enzymes can lead to gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding (COX-1) or myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular events (COX-2). Promising preclinical studies A number of preclinical studies in rodent models have yielded promising results in regards to CBD's ability to modulate joint health. Philpott and associates induced osteoarthritis (OA) in rats and then measured joint pain, inflammation, and joint nerve myelination.8 The researchers then observed the effects of both ther - apeutic and prophylactic peripheral CBD administration. In from end-stage OA, CBD dose-dependently reduced joint afferent firing rate and improved weight bearing. CBD treatment also decreased acute, transient joint inflammation. CBD administered prophylactically blocked the development of induced joint pain at later time points. Furthermore, CBD was neuroprotective. In summary, local CBD administration inhibited OA pain while prophylactic CBD treatment stopped the later development of pain and nerve damage in joints with OA. In another rat model of arthritis, Hammell and colleagues induced arthritis in rats and then administered transdermal CBD for four consecutive days afterward.9 In a dose- dependent manner, transdermal CBD Although CBD is a phytocannabinoid, its effects on joint health and inflammation are not primarily mediated directly through the traditional endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2.

The rats' increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) was reduced after CBD administration. Additionally, levels of proinflammatory biomarkers declined after CBD. Oral administration of CBD Costa and coworkers determined the effect of oral administration of CBD.10 The researchers induced inflamma - tion in rat paws. For three days after the onset of acute inflammation, the researchers administered 5-40 mg/kg of oral CBD to the animals. A single dose of CBD dose-dependently improved edema. Additional daily doses led to further reductions. Prostaglandin E2 plasma levels, generation of oxygen free radicals \u2014 all markers of inflammation \u2014 also declined after three doses of CBD. A mouse model found similar results as the preceding rat studies. CBD administered either orally or through i.p. after the onset of clinical symptoms interfered with the progression of arthritis.5 CBD protected the joints against severe damage. There was also a decline in tumor necrosis factor release by knee synovial cells. Intriguing results The clinical and the pre-clinical research that exists on CBD and joint health is intriguing. Given the results of the existing studies, it is somewhat surprising that larger-scale human studies investigating CBD and joint health have not been more actively pursued. The promising results achieved with CBD in clinical practice indicate it is safe and effective. It should be noted, however, that the goal of CBD supplementation is balancing rather than overstimulating the endocannabinoid system. This is why it is recommended for patients to start with a lower dosage of CBD and work up to a sufficient amount to produce optimal results. CHRIS D.

THE TAKEAWAY New research on supplementation is guiding wellness practitioners regarding estrogen metabolism. Diindolylmethane (DIM) supplements, curcumin and grape seed extract are only a few supplements that research is showing can regulate proper estrogen metabolism as well as reduce cancer risk. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS HEARD FROM PATIENTS is about the potential negative effects of hormones \u2014 especially estrogen. It sometimes surprises patients when they are told that estrogen is not necessarily a problem \u2014 it's the paths that estrogen takes in the body that are the problem. There are three major types of estrogen: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and estriol top-level outline, because there are subtypes within those forms as well. The key is that estrogen is not just a single hormone \u2014 it's more like a big family. And sometimes one of the family members can choose a path that is not helpful or healthy. In fact, when estrogens metabolize down the wrong pathways, they can contribute to endometriosis or cervical, ovarian, or breast cancer. 1-5 Estrogen from outside sources Complicating the issue even further is the problem of xenoestro - gens, including estrogen mimics that attach to receptors in the body and come from environmental sources like herbicides, pesticides and plastics. Fo rtunately, there is a solution. 6 Your patients have probably heard about the powerful health benefits of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables. These vegetables contain a compound that converts to a substance called diindolylmethane, commonly known as DIM. Getting this compound through diet alone can be difficult. For a therapeutic level, you'd need to eat about two pounds of broccoli. Supplementation is a much more practical solution, to say the least. Reduces growth in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the same cell growth also inhibited by curcuminGRAPE SEED EXTRACT 40 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH Clinically-studied supplemental DIM can direct estrogen toward a beneficial pathway and help balance the ratio of good estrogen metabolites (2-hydroxyestrone) versus bad (16-hydroxyestrone). This can help shuttle xenoestrogens and spent estrogen out of the body more efficiently. 7-9 DIM research DIM has some strong evidence behind its use to potentially reduce the risk of serious conditions, including breast and cervical cancer. In a Canadian clinical study, women taking DIM showed an increase in BRCA1 expression \u2014 a gene and its protein which can help inhibit breast cancer \u2014 by 34%.10 A study at the University of California at Berkeley found that DIM had an anti-tumor effect on endometrial cancer cells, and other research shows that adding DIM to a regimen of dienogest may make the medication more effective and help reduce pelvic pain and bleeding in patients with endometriosis.11,12 Aside from DIM, two other botanical ingredients recommended are curcumin from turmeric, and grape seed extract. Both have been shown to work in combination to inhibit tumor growth, and each one is powerful separately as well. 13 Curcumin prevents fat deposits in the liver and enhances detoxification enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, making it easier for the body to rid itself of estrogen mimics and other unhealthy compounds. 14,15 CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 41WELLNESS APPROACH References can be found online at chiroeco.comHowever, because plain curcumin extracts can be difficult for the body to absorb, and limit its efficacy, what's recommended is a curcumin blended with turmeric essential oil for enhanced absorption, plus the benefits of ar-turmerone, a compound present in the oil. 16 Grape seed extract has been shown to partially inhibit aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen into estrogen. Understandably, breast tissue typically has higher levels of aromatase. A study published in the journal Cancer Research showed that grape seed inhibited aromatase activity and reduced growth in MCF-7 breast cancer cells \u2014 the same cell growth also inhibited by curcumin. 17,18 Additionally, grape has been shown in scientific studies to prevent cancer cells from connecting to blood vessels, depriving them of oxygen and nutrients. A natural protein associated with the development of blood vessel growth is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 19 Supplement choices There are many grape seed extracts available, and in fact, some practitioners and patients may feel like this ingredient is old news. Recommended either on its own or in conjunc - tion with DIM and curcumin is a French grape seed extract that is currently showing some exciting results in cellular studies. It is tannin-free, which makes it a highly absorbable source of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and maximize the botanical's potential. Proper estrogen metabolism affects virtually every aspect of health.

NUMBNESS FINANCIAL ADVICE SELF-CARE TOOLS FOR PATIENTS AND NBA CHAMPIONS Send patients home with self-care tools to improve outcomes and relationships BY MICHAEL A. COHEN, DAC, DC TIME TO READ: 4-6 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Self-care tools are a key offering for chiropractic clinics to develop patients who return to the clinic looser to make treatments easier. And patients can now train themselves with the help of technology. MANY CHIROPRACTORS ARE INTERESTED IN GIVING PATIENTS SELF- CARE TOOLS to continue their care after leaving the clinic. Over the years the most common is the tennis ball, which many athletic trainers also travel with, advising their clients to roll around on the floor on them to alleviate muscle aches and pains. I started using them in my practice, and soon every patient left my office with a \"tennis ball program.\" It was a simple, cost-effective way to get patients to work on areas of myofascial restriction in the comfort of their own home. Compliance was good and it definitely worked \u2014 previously tight areas in patients' erector or gluteal musculature would return looser, making patients happier and treatments easier. But soon the limitations became apparent. The tennis ball was far from the optimum shape. It was a sphere, so you couldn't apply it directly on the spine as the spinous processes had nowhere to go \u2014 it would just hurt, and it would compress and lose shape under load. Then the truth dawned \u2014 a tennis ball is made for tennis! A self-care tool for the human body A number of self-care tools have been specifically designed for the human body.

Giving patients the power Like many chiropractors, physical trainers are often physically overbur -dened with treating patients and don't have time for extensive PT. Speaking with the head trainer for the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club we found a similar situation, and he soon began utilizing self-care tools that became a take-home hit with professional players. Instead of the trainer doing the work, they gave the players the product, who were then empowered to treat a signifi - cant portion of their issues themselves. Soon enough the entire team was using the products, and the word spread to other sports teams. \"A couple of our players are using the products and really like them,\" came a call from the trainer of the NBA's Toronto Raptors. \"We'd love to try them with our team.\" Training the trainers Being invited to train the trainers of professional sports teams is a really great experience as the trainers are excited by the idea that players can release their own tight areas, thus reducing the trainer's physical workload. As manual therapists the trainers are also keenly interested in feeling the effects on their own body aches and pains. The tennis ball was far from the optimum shape. It was a sphere, so you couldn't apply it directly on the spine as the spinous processes had nowhere to go \u2014 it would just hurt, and it would compress and lose shape under load. 46 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMBuy now at 860-623-6314 | designsforhealth.comDID YOU KNOW 1 JAMA, Bon Miller et al., 2017 2 www.designsforhealth.com/hempIntroducing Cannab-FS Available Now!

So simple. In addition, the trainers really liked the small size and portability of the product (they had been used to lugging big foam rollers through airports), which made it perfect for players to use anywhere and anytime on the road. The trainers bought in. The self-care products were made part of each player's personal kit. A second order of the products were requested by the team, with the trainer noting, \"the wives took the first batch when the players brought them home.\" Now teams from the NBA, NHL, MLB and NFL use the self-care tools. Can chiropractic patients train themselves? Chiropractors know the value of giving patients tools they can use between sessions to keep tight muscles and joints open. While books and seminars have been produced regarding patient use of the self-care tools, practitioners themselves have been the real driving force, with the products sold around the world.A physiotherapist in Hong Kong came up with a great technique for releasing psoas musculature. A yoga teacher from Burlington came up with a simple technique to release calf muscles. A protocol was developed for treating low-back pain with the patient lying on their front with the self-care tool under their pubic symphysis to create posterior opening of the L5-S1 joint. Information such as this is now collected in self-care phone apps so patients can lie back and, using their phone screen, click on the body part that hurts, and simply follow the videos. Patients can now train themselves, with technology making it possible so that no doctor need ever spend time training a patient to use self-care tools. Putting it in practice Self-care tools are a key offering for chiropractic clinics to develop patients who return to the clinic looser to make treatments easier. Self-care tools also let patients know you care for their well- being outside the office, which translates to longer-standing relationships and wellness care. MICHAEL A. COHEN, DAC, DC, has been a practicing chiropractor and acupuncturist for 29 years. He believes we have underestimated patients' self-healing abilities, and he encourages patients to responsibly explore their capabilities in this area.

THE TAKEAWAY Sleep is not only essential to each patient's health and wellness, it can impact pain levels, inflammation, and ultimately satisfaction with chiropractic care. Here are tips for patients to improve their sleep and facts on the consequences of improper preparation for bedtime. AS HUMANS, WE SPEND A THIRD OF OUR LIVES SLEEPING. Without adequate sleep, we just don't function \u2014 we begin to catch every cold or flu that goes around, we stop processing glucose normally, and we stop coding short- term memories into long-term storage. Everything goes haywire. This is a problem because 35% of the adult American population suffers from insomnia in one form or another. 1 A chiropractor works with dozens of patients who aren't sleeping enough and are going through life with their tank chronically running on empty. If these patients don't get the help they need, they will be at increased risk for conditions like heart disease, cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. The fact of the matter is that chronic sleep deprivation is a causal factor in a wide variety of chronic health conditions. 2 As such, it is important that chiropractors step in and provide care that gets to the root of the problem and addresses this aspect of patient health and well-being. To get started, here are five strategies to pass on to your patients who are struggling to get a full night's sleep. 1 Develop a routine A lot of the time, patients who aren't sleeping well aren't sleeping on a schedule. If patients find a strategy for getting to sleep at the same time each 50 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COM1911ADCE WORLD'S Perfect for patient rentals. Restrictions apply.

Consult your tax professional.WELLNESS APPROACH night, they will have a much easier time getting the deep and restful sleep the body needs. Going to bed at the same time each night helps the body establish normal circadian rhythms that operate in a predictable way. Basically, the body loves patterns. 3 Advise patients to coordinate their sleep/wake cycles with the times that the sun rises and sets, at least to the extent that they are able. Going to bed around 9-10 p.m. allows a patient to take advantage of the melatonin that the body naturally produces when the sun goes down. 4 Going to bed early also allows the body to take full advantage of important hormones that are released during the first few hours after the onset of sleep. Growth hormone, for example, is typically secreted about three hours after an individual falls asleep, and helps to facilitate the recovery and repair that happens at night. 5 2 Reduce after-dark screen time The brain can't tell the difference between the blue light emitted from TV screens, computers, and phones and regular daytime sunlight. Both send a signal through the body's endocrine system communicating that it's time to be awake. 6 52 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMIf a patient spends a lot of time in front of a screen before bed, their body won't produce all of the melatonin that is normally released when the sun goes down. For a lot of people, this is the fundamental problem behind many sleepless nights. Instead of watching TV, recommend that your patients try reading a book or taking a warm bath. Though this can be a major change for some, it can be the thing that makes an enormous difference in their level of health. 3 Switch to a firm mattress Sleeping on a soft mattress sounds great, but most chiro - practors know that this can cause a lot of pain and discomfort to develop over time. A firm mattress helps to improve sleep posture and prevent the aches and pains that develop when the body sinks into the mattress unevenly. This, in turn, helps improve the duration and restful - ness of sleep. 7 And, while a firm mattress stabilizes the spine and facilitates better-quality sleep, pillows can be used for added comfort. This really provides the best of both worlds. 4 Go to bed on an empty stomach Many people don't realize that sleep is an active process where the body works to \"reset\" a variety of critical bodily systems and mentally code the events of the day into memory. To get this work done, the body needs a break from the task of digestion. If a patient is still digesting a meal when they are trying to sleep, the sympathetic nervous system will still be activated in order to accomplish this task. At night, we really want the opposite to occur. If a patient can manage to eat their last meal by about 6 p.m., they will be ready for a night of sound sleep by 9-10 p.m. Under these circumstances, the parasympathetic nervous system will be able to kick in and perform all of the active recovery that the body needs in order to feel well-rested. 8WELLNESS APPROACH If a patient is still digesting a meal when they are trying to sleep, the sympathetic nervous system will still be activated in order to accomplish this task. At night, we really want the opposite to occur.

If a bedroom is dimly lit by screens, lamps, bright clock interfaces or other sources, this can interfere with a patient's ability to get deep and restful sleep. 9 For this reason patients should eliminate these sources of ambient light and sleep in a room that is fully dark for the entire sleep period. If a patient isn't going to wake up at sunrise, blackout curtains can help to ensure that the body continues to sleep deeply throughout the entire period they are in bed. Encourage sleep Sleep quality should matter to chiro - practors because it is essential to each patient's health and wellness. If a patient isn't sleeping well, nothing else they do will enable them to achieve an optimal level of health. Improve patient outcomes and ensure effective adjustments by getting to the source of the problem. By improving the quality of patients' sleep, an enormous difference can be made in patients' health and satisfaction with chiropractic care. And happy patients make referrals. To improve patient outcomes and serve more members of the community, start by offering more comprehensive care.

MARKETING MATTERS THE TAKEAWAY The law of attraction (LOA) represents the theory of influencing similar energies and powers of the universe to achieve one's goals. LOA manifests through your thoughts \u2014 so if you can inspire patients, you will create a practice featuring loyalty, repeat and additional services, and an eagerness to refer. HOW DO YOU STAND APART IN YOUR CAREER, BUILD PATIENT LOYALTY, and create long and lucrative business streams and relationships? Attracting more patients is comparable to fishing \u2014 if you don't have the proper lure, you won't attract those patients you really want. Notice, I said \"want,\" not just take whatever comes along. Here are vital steps for attracting and keeping devoted and staunch patients: 1. Develop a plan Highly successful people live by a powerful axiom: \"A goal is just a dream if you don't have a plan and see it to fruition.\" To use a sports analogy: It is not enough to merely want to run a marathon. You must formulate and commit to a program of frequent and regular \"road work\" (a.k.a. running), superior nutrition, a disciplined rest schedule, and so on. Discipline and follow-through are essential to converting dreams into reality. Hence, you too must commit to an equivalent regimen to create a prosperous practice. ADVERTISEMENT 56 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMADVERTISEMENTMARKETING MATTERS 2. Develop intentionality Sustained and lasting professional success doesn't happen by accident. Whether you are a top-tier athlete or an exceptional chiropractor striving to shine, you need a workable and robust strategy. The law of attraction (LOA) represents the theory of influencing similar energies and powers of the universe to achieve one's goals. Specifically, LOA manifests through your thoughts, thus drawing the thoughts and ideas of like-minded people who correspond in their situations and circumstances. To illustrate: the comedic actor Jim Carrey recounted writing a $10 million check to himself for \"acting services rendered\" long before he was famous, as a struggling actor. He gave himself five years from that date to \"make it\" in Hollywood. It's no secret he reached his goal. He would go on to star in movies like \"The Mask,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" and many others. Therefore, your energy and your promotional efforts must be laser-focused on your goal. Do not let outside influences distract you; have a clear vision of how \"success\" looks. Chart your progress; and, make adjustments as needed to keep you on course. 3. Inspire Inspiration draws, compels and motivates people to seek you out on a visceral level. Inspiration is literally the glue that brings and holds together people of different backgrounds but similar interests. Political groups, sports teams, fraternities, etc., are all energized by that common bond. Do you want to inspire patients? Then be conscious of what your message \"should look like.\" In other words, if inspiration was a place, how would you know when you have arrived? Additionally, ask yourself, \"Why are you in business?\" And don't say for the money. Deep, rich pools of loyal patients (who continually refer others to your practice) aren't built on financial self-interest. Plus, consumers can see dollar signs in your eyes. In all my years in marketing, I have found one fact, in particular, to be true. If you can inspire patients, you will create a practice featuring loyalty, repeat and additional services, and an eagerness to refer. Strive to instill a sense of instinctual trust and camaraderie. Therefore, your content must deliver a deeply perceptive message; your patients must feel that you're one of them and \"get\" them. Hence, your promotional efforts must aim to allure, motivate and galvanize people to see you as the \"only\" solution. By no means am I suggesting any manner of manipulation; mainly, because it just doesn't work over the long haul. Inspire with 'why' To summarize, think about the many ads you have seen. Very likely, you saw a promotional piece featuring a brief introduc - tion, and an immediate segue into what they do and how they do it. Often, ads are presented in this general format: \"Check out our 2019 sedan; it gets 40 miles per gallon, has a backup camera, and it's priced at $$.\" Do you want to buy it? Or, perhaps a phone dealer: \"Come take advantage of our summer sale; we have a great selection of 512-GB phones, sleek designs, for only $$.\" Will you buy one? Or, \"We've been in business since 2005 \u2014 back pain relief and sports injury treatment, and a free consultation.\" Do you feel inspired? Do you feel that this provider \"gets\" you? Variations of those ads above are presented to consumers numerous times daily; and, the concept works reasonably well on a transactional basis. \"How\" and \"what\" ads depend on time, price and scarcity manipulation to generate sales; alas, you become a commodity. Deep, rich pools of loyal patients (who continually refer others to your practice) aren't built on financial self-interest. Plus, consumers can see dollar signs in your eyes. 58 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMwww.systemicformulas.comSynergistically formulated in a manner that targets a specic physiological system, while supporting the health of the body system as a wholeSYNERGISTICWHY USE THIS?FEEL YOUNG BUILD MUSCLE This revolutionary formulation provides specic muscle and connective tissue collagen peptides rich in BCAA's, cellular energy building blocks, and medium chain fatty acids for energy and immune support during growth.

However, to inspire, you must lead with why you do business \u2014 raving fans are created through \"whys.\" Take Harley-Davidson, for example. The company's \"why\" statement is so compelling (\"We fulfill dreams through the experiences of motorcycling...\"), that their client base is instinctually drawn and loyal to the product. In fact, on any given warm day, you will see people walking around with a Harley-Davidson tattoo on their body \u2014 including some who don't even own the product. 4. Develop your vision As mentioned, your vision (aka your \"why\"), is what inspires people to follow you. Besides your promotional content, add a mission statement that clearly states your \"why.\" For example:\u0084\u0084Google: Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. \u0084\u0084Teach for America: One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education. Learn to identify and articulate your \"why\"; feature that message front and center. Incorporate your alma mater, group alliances, sports affiliations or military background \u2014 remember, concise and stirring is the ideal. 5. Establish yourself as an expert Now, demonstrate why you're the superior option. Take the Disney Corporation; specifically Disneyland, for example.

Well, not if you can deliver. Years before opening, Walt Disney traveled near and far, visiting every available amusement park. He took careful notes and documented everything. Then it hit him; he wasn't going to go into the amusement park industry. He was going to go into the \"magical experience\" industry. He was going to transport and transform adults, bogged down by life's pressures, into happy-go-lucky kids, without a care in the world, via this wondrous experience. Every ride, attraction and shop in Disneyland is designed to deliver adventure, thrills and awe. That is why, in spite of pressures from the economy, travel costs and growing competition, year over year, Disney's attendance figures continue to grow. You must do the same as Disney; prove yourself the undisputed fibromyalgia or sports injury expert, for example. Your entire brand must exude your \"why.\" Media matters Your website, waiting room(s), your blogs, etc., must deliver your vision. Then, provide patients with quantifi - able evidence that you \"get\" them, and that you are the go-to doctor in town, by publishing your knowledge. Create a book, informative pamphlets, case studies and so on. Publishing allows you to spotlight your expertise by elaborating on how and what you will do for your patients in the process of healing them. As your reputation grows, consider launching an online radio program. Share it with your patients and visitors in your waiting room(s), and also make recordings of it available as podcasts.

THE TAKEAWAY Chiropractic assistants (CAs) are often the unsung heroes of a practice, handling or juggling duties smoothly in a sometimes-chaotic office. But have you trained them on the \"why\"? OFTEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CONSTRUCT OF A CHIROPRACTIC PRACTICE, WE GRAVITATE TO THE DOCTOR AS THE HUB, or center of the practice. What if we took a step back and looked at all the members of the team? Even if it's a team of two. Is one member more important than the other? We would argue an emphatic no! The supporting team members are equally important in their roles and without them, chaos would most certainly ensue. To see this in a different light, compare the chiropractic office to any professional sports team where all players have their roles and must execute those roles for the team to be successful. In this view, we could now look at the doctor as the captain of the team. The CA, a most vital part of the team, carries out their assignments and responsibilities at the direction of the captain, and the office flows.PRACTICE CENTRAL 64 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMClear communication Now here's the million-dollar question \u2014 has the captain presented the assign - ments and responsibilities clearly? Or, is there just an expectation of under - standing the role of the CA? In many practices, there oftentimes exists an expectation that the team should know what to do, when to do it and how to do it. We frequently see offices in organizational turmoil simply because these expectations are never really discussed. A question to ask as the doctor, or team captain, is \"Have I clearly defined the role of this team member, and am I providing adequate training?\" A typical day Let's look at a typical day in the life of a front desk manager in a chiropractic office. At any given point the doctor expects them to handle the flow of the office, answer the phone, collect money, verify insurance, enter everything in the computer, hold a baby while the mom gets adjusted, schedule the new patient who's calling, make sure the reception area is in order, pull charts and get the mail out. And that is just the morning shift! Now consider other team members. The billing manager, the new patient advocate, the back office manager, the scribe and all the others. Each and every one provides a vital service to the team's success. They are the unsung heroes! Let's face it: Without the team, life in the office could legitimately fall apart. And without the proper direction and training for the team, the same result would likely occur. Find the 'why' The understanding of each one of these roles must begin with establishing, and owning, the \"why.\" The why of chiro - practic, the why of the practice mission, and the why of the practice vision. These need to be a part of the team members' mindset, because without them, all the training in the world could be rendered fruitless due to a lack of ownership. Take for a moment the titles of the different CA roles that we've mentioned. Would ownership of the role and position be more likely from a \"front desk manager\" or a \"front desk CA\"? A team member can always be taught the necessary steps to accomplish an assigned task, but to assume an The Biggest Money Problem Chiropractors Are Facing ...and what you can do about it. \"Zero\" Taxes...Is it Possible? With the right strategies in place you may be able to eliminate taxes today and retire in the \"0% Tax Bracket\" tomorrow. Did you know?

The supporting team members in a chiropractic practice should start with a strong philosophical foundation \u2014 then we can look to the training it takes to be successful in the role. Successful team training can be broken down into three main requirements: Explain the procedure in detail, support the procedure with the \"why,\" and train with repetition. This simple formula is one that can make the difference between an amazing, low-stress practice and a mediocre one. As the captain of the team, the doctor must first examine and establish the \"why\" to be shared with the team. Once that has been accomplished, a detailed list of procedures should be outlined in order to create organization. Next, dissect the procedures to the smallest detail. Finally, train on them outside of patient hours in order to establish ownership.Although this process may seem like a daunting task, it is completely necessary in order to create a lower- stress environment in the practice. Further, by creating an environment where everyone knows what is expected, a door for massive growth is opened. ROBERT KIPP, DC, is a managing director of Power CA's.

THE TAKEAWAY When working on older athletes it is crucial to spend some time doing some form of myofascial work. Instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) can produce a healing response from the body by breaking up scar tissue or restricted fascial connections. MANY OLDER FOLKS ENVISION THEIR \"GOLDEN\" YEARS AS A CHANCE TO RELAX, pick a retirement community to settle in, and catch up on their TV viewing. However, for many people their activity level actually increases as they age. Over the past three decades, the number of older athletes has grown at an extraordinary rate. And it's not just in the stereotypical retirement sports like golf, tennis and pickleball. It's now commonplace to see older athletes competing in Ironman-length triathlons, long-distance cycling, and even ultra-marathons. In fact, it's not uncommon for \"masters\" athletes (40 years and older) to make up a majority of finishers. For example, at the New York City Marathon, male masters athletes make up approximately 50% of the finishers. At the most recent Ironman World Championship Triathlon in Hawaii, masters athletes accounted for 55% of all finishers. Taking care of the body An active, older population tends to see an increase in musculoskeletal injuries. As anyone over the age of 50 knows, 68 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMyour body doesn't recover as well from hard exercise like it did in your 20s. Your muscles get sore quicker, and your joints stiffen up easier. As these athletes age it is crucial to get regular \"bodywork\" done from a professional. They need someone well-trained to loosen up their joints and relax their overworked muscles. That is where chiropractors become involved. As powerful as a chiropractic manipulation can be, it is equally important to also address your patients' soft-tissue problems. In particular, when you are working on older athletes, it is crucial that you spend some time doing some form of myofascial work. There is a wide variety of myofascial techniques and approaches, and many of them can be effective. IASTM One technique that has been growing rapidly for years is instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM). Traditionally IASTM was primarily known for one thing \u2014 pain and bruising. Even today, many practitioners use these soft-tissue tools extremely aggressively. They think if you aren't bruising your patient, or at least leaving them covered in petechiae, you aren't doing the job correctly \u2014 the \"no pain, no gain\" approach. This aggressive approach can be problematic, particularly when you are working on an older population. They tend to have complicating factors that can make aggressive myofascial work problematic. For example, their skin may be more fragile than someone younger. Or they may be on blood thinners that make them extremely susceptible to severe bruising. Either way, an aggressive approach may not be ideal for this population.The brain and pain Luckily our treatment philosophies are starting to change. We now understand that pain is much more complicated than we previously realized. Pain isn't exclusively due to a tight muscle or inflamed joint. The recent research on pain science has started to cement the concept that the brain probably plays the most important role in experiencing and understanding pain.

They need someone well-trained to loosen up their joints and relax their overworked muscles. CHIROECO.COM NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 69CLINICAL CONCERNS in pain is constantly \"on guard\" and always feeling threatened. Conversely, if we can somehow decrease the level of threat their brain is experiencing, perhaps we can also decrease their pain. So if our goal as a clinician is to \"decrease the threat\" our patient is experiencing, perhaps we shouldn't be causing our patient more pain in the office. Instead, maybe we are better off using a more gentle, \"neurosensory\" approach to treating patients in pain. How can you use a tool to increase the novel sensory input flooding your patient's brain, in hopes of modulating their pain experience and improving their motor output? What can we do for someone in pain to decrease the perception of threat their brain is experiencing? Non-aggressive IASTM IASTM strokes can potentially decrease pain, increase range of motion, and improve stability or motor control. But these strokes do not have to be aggressive or leave patients bruised or sore. Two effective strokes are \"feathering\" and \"down-regulation\": Feathering \u2014 With this stroke you are trying to stimulate the free nerve endings called interoceptors. There are approximately seven times more interoceptors in the body than any other type of mechanoreceptor. These interoceptors are located throughout the body, but we are going to target those in the skin and fascia. When the interoceptors are stimulated, it results in an activation of an area of the brain (insula) associated with pain perception and a sense of well- being. When these interoceptors are stimulated, pain seems to decrease. These receptors respond best to very light touch. If you press too firmly with the tool, the stroke will not be as effective. So the next time you have a patient in pain, try using only a pressure of 1-3 out of 10. Remember, it should be your patient who is \"grading\" the amount of pressure you're using, as some people have a high pain tolerance and others are hypersensitive. Lightly feather the tool back and forth over the painful area for approximately 30 seconds, as the interoceptive nerve endings tend to fatigue after about 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds I usually recommend to \"ripple\" upstream and downstream from the problem spot. It's always a good idea to check the areas above and below the painful area. Down-Regulation \u2014 This stroke can be used on any hypertonic tissue that needs to be relaxed or inhibited. Common areas for this stroke are the upper traps and sub-occipitals, the calves and the pectorals major/minor. With this stroke you are trying to target the Ruffini endings located in the superficial tissues. When Ruffini mechanoreceptors are stimulated, it results in a lowering of sympathetic nervous system activity (Van den Berg & Capri, 1999). 55%Approximate number of masters [senior] athletes finishing at the most recent Ironman World Championship Triathlon in HawaiiIf you can lower sympathetic nervous system activity, it should result in a decrease in fascial tone. This leads to a relaxing of the local tissues in addition to a more global, whole-body relaxation. 70 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS NOVEMBER 11, 2019 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS If you can lower sympathetic nervous system activity, it should result in a decrease in fascial tone. This leads to a relaxing of the local tissues in addition to a more global, whole-body relaxation. Ruffini endings respond best to slow, steady, moderately deep pressure. A patient should grade this pressure as a 4-6 out of 10. Once the hypertonic muscles that need treatment have been identified, take the IASTM tool and start sliding the tool slowly across the tissue. Use lotion if there is trouble keeping the tool movement steady. Again, direction doesn't matter. Start at one end of the muscle(s) and using a pressure depth of 4-6 out of 10, slowly slide the tool across the tissue. Take approximately 30 seconds per stroke. Do 2-3 passes with the tool if needed. As was the case with the first stroke, it's always a good idea to quickly check the tissues above and below the area you're targeting. Less can be more The \"less is more\" approach to IASTM can be challenging for a lot of chiropractors. It's hard to resist the urge to grab a tool and start aggressively digging into the soft tissues. Keep an open mind and try these strokes, and aging athletes will thank you. And they also won't miss being too bruised and sore to train the next day.
