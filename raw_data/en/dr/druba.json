Once you know which oils t use, you need to know how to use them properly so you don't get skin irritation or other side effects. Essential oils may be inhaled in aromatherapy or diluted and applied topically or used in a bath. Apply them topically Essential oils can be used during a massage or rolled directly onto your back, but you must dilute them first. Mix up to 6 drops of your selected oil with 6 teaspoons of a carrier oil, such as jojoba or olive oil. Do a patch test of your diluted oil on a small area of skin. After 24 hours, if no irritation develops, it's likely you can safely use the oil on a larger area of skin. Apply your diluted mixture liberally, massaging in lightly for more absorption. Be sure to wash your hands before touching your face, as you don't want to irritate your eyes. Also, make sure the oil does not enter your mouth. Inhale them throughout the day Inhaling essential oils for pain and inflammation is another method. Add several drops of pure essential oils to water in a diffuser and leave it running in your home or office. You can add more oil or water to the diffuser throughout the day as needed. Take an essential oil-infused bath For a sore back, a warm and relaxing bath can alleviate pain and inflammation. As a bonus, you can add diluted essential oils to your bath water too, adding 10 drops to running water. Take care of getting in and out of the tub in case the oils make surfaces slippery. Essential Oil Side effects and Precautions When used as directed, essential oils shouldn't cause any major side effects. Skin rash and irritation can occur without proper dilution or patch testing ahead of time. Talk to a doctor if you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any underlying medical conditions. Keep in mind that aromatherapy can effects pets, children, and others in the area. Remember that essential oils are extremely potent. Also, don't take them by mouth or use them on or near your eyes.
