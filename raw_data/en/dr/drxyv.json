The University of Washington Institutional Chemical and Physical Safety Committee ( ICAPS ) approved this revision with the expectation that updates will be necessary as changes in regulations, policies and procedures dictate. Implementation of these policies and procedures is the responsibility of the Principal Investiga tor and depends largely on the efforts of laboratory supervisors and employees. It is essential that they seek additional advice and training when needed to conduct research in a manner that is safe to employees, students, and the surrounding community. To assist in this endeavor, the services of the Environmental Health and Safety Department are available at the University of Washington.

PURPOSE The University of Washington (UW) has committed to create, maintain, and enhance a safe and healthful environment for all individuals associated with the institution, including students, faculty, staff, hospital patients, and visitors. This commitment is stated in UW Presidential Executive Order 55, which can be found at www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/PO/EO55.ht ml. A major part of demonstrating this commitment in chemical laboratories is documenting the safety program in the laboratory's chemical hygiene plan. 1. Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) Washington Administrative Code ( WAC) 296 -828 (https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 - 828) requires that laboratories document their safety procedures in a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP). For UW chemical laboratories, the laboratory's chemical hygiene plan is created by combining laboratory -specific information and safety requirements found in the UW Laboratory Safety Manual (LSM). Your lab's CHP can be electronic, paper, or a mix. It must be accessible at all times to all personnel who work in areas containing hazardous chemicals. If the CHP is electronic, personnel must know where the files are located and how to access them. They must have access to the files on a computer tha t is retained in the space while working. For ease of electronic use, the UW Laboratory Safety Manual may be bookmarked in its entirety, or separate sections, templates, etc. can be bookmarked at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/laboratory -safety -manual -510. When providing electronic information it must be obvious which files and documents are current. If an all -paper CHP is to be used, the lab - specific information can be filed in the front of the manual, behind the My Lab tab. The CHP must be accessible to all employees, (i.e., it cannot be lo cked in an office). Laboratory - specific information such as chemical inventories, standard operating procedures (SOPs), or safety data sheets (SDS) and other reference materials may be kept in the lab or elsewhere if necessary. Individuals may keep person al copies of the LSM and the lab's SOPs, but a master index of where the complete CHP is located, identifying the current revision number or date for each part, should be easily available to all personnel at all times Some information not directly associat ed with safety procedures, which might be troublesome to replace if lost, such as certifications that individuals completed safety training, may be kept separately in locked cabinets. That location should be identified in the laboratory -specific informatio n section . 2. Regulations Pertaining to the Chemical Hygiene Plan This generic Laboratory Safety Manual contains information applicable to all University laboratories and explanatory materials to comply with regulations. Pertinent regulations covering laboratories include: a. Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories: WAC (https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 - 828), Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories, is the primary Washington regulation covering laboratories performing chemical manipulations; it may also be referred to as t he Laboratory Safety Standard. A copy of the WAC standard is provided as Appendix A of this manual. In chemical laboratories, this standard supersedes most of the chemical - safety requirements in other regulations. Page 19 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL b. Hazardous Drug Rule Washington State promulgated WAC 296 -62-500 (https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=296 -62), effective in 2014, which impacts the handling and disposal of drugs used for human treatment and veterinary care. The rule details the requirements for safe handling of chemotherapy and other hazardou s drugs. c. International Fire Code The cities of Bothell, Seattle, and Tacoma require compliance with the International Fire Code (IFC) and additional local requirements. For assistance with compliance, contact EH&S at 206 .616.5530. d. Chemical Waste Management The UW Laboratory Safety Manual also includes information on chemical waste management in order to assist laboratories in complying with State of Washington regulatory standard WAC 173 - 303, Dangerous Waste Regulations ( https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=173 -303). Section 3 of the manual outlines the specifics of these requirements and describes safe disposal of hazardous chemicals. e. US Department of Homeland Security Regulations The United States Department of Homela nd Security has developed Chemical Facility Anti -Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to implement the federal regulations in 6 CFR Part 27 . (www.ecfr.gov/current/title -6/chapter -I/part -27?toc=1) These standards require the University to track and control specific chemicals of interest. The University's MyChem chemical inventory system, as described in later sections of this manual, is an important componen t in complying with the regulations. 3. Chemical Hygiene Plan Accessibility The CHP must be accessible to laboratory employees and students at all times the laboratory is occupied. If multiple rooms are included in the laboratory, the plan must be available without having to get a key from another person or leaving the lab space. It must also be available on request to UW Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) staff and Washington State Department of Labor and Industries representatives. 4. Other Plans and References This Chemical Hygiene Plan/Laboratory Safety Manual is a part of a complete safety program. Other University documents impacting laboratory operations may include the UW Radiation Safety Manual, Biosafety Manual, Laser Safety Manual , Field Operations Safety Manual or the Diving Safety Manual. Research conducted in the field should align with requirements and guidance listed in the UW Field Operations Safety Manual. External to the University, agencies providing grants may require additional plans and certifications to be part of the safety program. 5. Applicability to Students It is the policy of the University that students in laboratories, while not legally covered under these procedures, are afforded the same level of protection as University employees. (Students who are not employees are not covered by Workers' Compensation in the event of an injury.) Page 20 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL B. SCOPE AND APPLICATION In general, the policies and procedures in the Laboratory Safety Manual apply at all locations that serve as assigned workplaces and educational settings for University of Washington faculty, staff, and students. This includes the Seattle, Bothell, and Tacoma campuses, and other University -owned property, University -leased space, and temporary field locations that are under the control and supervision of UW personnel. Any laboratory that meets the definition of a chemical laboratory ( refer to B.1), must complete a Chemical Hygiene Plan by adding laboratory -specific information to this manual. Laboratories that do not meet the definition of a chemical laboratory may refer to this manual for general safety information but must comply with industry regulations concerning chemical management. 1. Chemical Laboratory A chemical laboratory is defined as an area (single room, a group of rooms, or a part of a room identified as a particular researcher's laboratory), where chemical manipulations are done for research, educational, or clinical purposes. The manipulations must involve mixing different hazardou s chemicals in a variety of formulations, done on a small scale (one person can easily handle the volume of the chemical in use). According to WAC 296 -828 (https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -828), a chemical laboratory must also utilize safety practices or safety equipment to reduce the risks of the hazardous chemicals. In addition, the chemical laboratory may not be a production -type fa cility where one process is performed repeatedly to produce a product for others. 2. Chemical and Non -Chemical Hazards Hazardous chemicals are considered to be those which either present or could cause a health hazard such as an acute skin burn from a corrosi ve acid or a disease from a chronic, long -term exposure, or a physical hazard from a chemical action such as a fire or explosion. Hazardous chemicals can often be identified from their labels, which could state \"Danger,\" \"Warning,\" \"Caution\" or words to th at effect, or the label could have a symbol which indicates a hazard. The chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) may also indicate that the chemical has dangerous properties, could cause some disease or injury or that personal protective equipment, such as gloves, is recommended when handling the chemical. In addition to chemical hazards, this Laboratory Safety Manual provides information about general hazards (e.g., electrical safety, high noise, etc.) which may be present in the laboratory environment. Append ix B is a glossary of useful terminology, applicable to this manual, related to both chemical and non -chemical hazards. It would be impossible for one manual to provide complete information about all potential hazards and controls, so use of other references is encouraged. For example , refer to Prudent Practices in the Laboratory: Handling and Management of Chemical Hazards (National Research Council Committee on Prudent Practices for Handling, Storage, and Disposal of Chemicals in Laboratories) . This document is accessible with contains information about environmental, health and safety policies and procedures for all UW work areas, not just laboratories. Specific policies and procedures may be found in: Page 21 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Control of biological hazards in the UW Biosafety Manual : www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/uw- biosafety -manual -4 Research diving : www.ehs.washington.edu/resourc e/scientific -diving -safety -manual -160 Laser Manual : www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/laser -safety -manual -74 Control of radioactive haz ards Radiation Safety Manual : www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/radiation -safety -manual -521 Control of field hazards in the O perations Safety Manual : https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/uw -field -operations - safety -manual.pdf C. RESPONSIBILITIES Information about the appropriate actions to support safe laboratory environments, organized by level in the U niversity organization, can be found at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/matrix.pdf. 1. Responsible Party (RP) and Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) Each chemical laboratory must have a single Responsible Party (RP), who is most often the Principal Investigator (PI) or Director . The RP is an individual who is designated the auth ority by a University department, school or administrative unit to direct the research or teaching program or project. The PI has scientific and technical direction for the research or activities in the lab space. The PI has the responsibility and authorit y to enforce safety regulations and policies; this includes ensuring that the facilities are appropriate for the research conducted. Based on State requirements, each chemical laboratory must also have a designated Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) who is kno wledgeable about the laboratory's procedures, is actively involved or observant of those procedures performed, and has the authority to enforce correct procedures. In research and teaching laboratories, the RP is the CHO by default. If the RP has other commitments that prevent knowledge of the laboratory's day -to-day activities, they may delegate that role to a person in their laboratory who is appropriately experienced and trained. This may be a laboratory supervisor, manager, or other senior -level person with authority familiar with activities within the laboratory. The CHO must be identified by name in the laboratory -specific section of the lab's CHP. If the RP assigns another person to be the laboratory's CHO, the RP is still the responsible party for the laboratory. The CHO must ensure that laboratory -specific information is documented in the CHP and that activities conducted within the laboratory are consistent with the CHP. To a id in compiling laboratory -specific information, a template and guides for laboratory -specific information are Page 22 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL available at the beginning and in Appendix C of this manual; an electronic copy is available at This template also makes it easier to identify the CHO by name and to remember when the annual review of the CHP is due. The laboratory's RP must ensure the following is accomplished: a. Develop the CHP A chemical laboratory must have a CHP. It consists of the UW Laboratory Safety Manual plus laboratory -specific information. Major areas of the laboratory -specific information portion include: The safety requirements, either as laboratory rules or standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) which include PPE requirements Laboratory -specific topics covered in the laboratory's training program Additional details specific to the laboratory and generally described on the laboratory -specific information template at the beginning of the Laboratory Safety Manual. b. Create a List of Chemicals Stored in the Laboratory An accurate list of chemicals mus t be entered into the UW MyChem inventory management system and updated annually, at minimum. If they are not already online, attach SDSs to the MyChem Inventory when received in the laboratory. MyChem procedures are described in Section 2.B (www.ehs.washington.edu/system/ files/resources/lsm.pdf#page=18) of the UW Laboratory Safety Manual. Additional information can be found on the EH&S website: www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/chemical -hazard -communication -hazcom c. Identify and Assess Haza rds The laboratory's RP must ensure all laboratory staff understand that new and changed procedures must be assessed for hazards. The laboratory's RP, CHO , or another person familiar with the laboratory's procedures must assess those procedures and determi ne controls to adequately minimize risks. Any laboratory member can identify hazardous conditions that could result in personal injury or property damage. Once identified, the hazardous conditions must be assessed. Steps in the assessment include: 1. Research chemicals and processes to be used 2. Identify and evaluate all types of hazards involved. Some evaluations to consider : what are the hazards? What is the worst that can happen? What can be done to prevent that? What can be done to minimize each risk? What should be done if something goes wrong? 3. Consider if additional hazards may be present, if scaling up 4. Select controls to adequately lower the perceived risks, using the hierarchy of controls (starting with the most effective): Eliminate hazardous substances and hazardous steps in the process (if possible) Substitute with less- hazardous chemicals, smaller quantities, and Page 23 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL safer processes Implement engineering controls, such as local ventilation or remote controls Implement admi nistrative controls, such as an after -hours policy during exceptionally hazardous processes As a last line of defense, assess PPE requirements An assessment tool that can be used for additional guidance is available at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/laboratory -personal - protective -equipment -ppe-hazard -assessment -guide -351. Additional information can be found in the document : Identifying and Evaluating Hazards in Research Laboratories: Guidelines Developed by the Hazards Identification and E valuation Task Force of the American Chemical Society's Committee on Chemical Safety, 2013 . Information can also be found on the EH&S website at: www.ehs.washington.edu/about/latest -news/common -hazardous -waste -mistakes www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/UniversityofWashingtonAPP.pdf 5. Ensure emergency response situations have been addressed: If the assessment results in requirements for controls, the requirements must be documented (as described in the following paragraph). For best practices, it is recommended that the assessment be documented, whether or not controls are required. d. Document and Enforce Appropriate Safety Practice s Safe work practices and rules required within the laboratory must be documented. Requirements can be documented as \"general lab rules\" (Section 2 of this manual) conspicuously posted in the laboratory or included in lab protocols or SOPs ( Section 6 ). If an individual fails to follow the requirements, the laboratory's responsible party RP must initiate enforcement actions and document those actions. Document lab hazard assessments and risk mitigation strategies in place for new or routine work. e. Ensure Signage/Labels in Place Appropriate signage must be posted , and hazardous material containers (including hazardous waste containers) must be labeled. Laboratory signage is described in Sections 2.A.7 and 4.C; labeling is described in Section 2.E of this manual. f. Assess, Provide and Document Training The laboratory's RP must ensure that training requirements for personnel are determined depending on their duties. Employees, volunteers, visiting scientists, and students working in the laboratory must receive general and laboratory -specific training, including the hazards of the chemicals present, and the required safety procedures including proper use of PPE. The department (or others) may provide information about the UW's general requirements such as emergency response procedures. Laboratory staff are responsible for training requirements concerning the materials and the processes conducted within the laboratory; t he assessment and training must be documented. Details are available in Section 7 of this manual. A matrix that provides information about Page 24 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL mandatory and recommended classes is available at: www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/safety - training -laboratory -personnel -lab-safety -training -matrix -165. g. Ensure Staff Have Access to Safety Information All personnel who work in areas with hazardous chemicals must have access to essential safety information while they are at work, including the CHP, SDSs and the regulation WAC 296 -828, Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories ). This information should be available in the laboratory space where work is performed. (Note: The CHP includes the UW Laboratory Safety Manual and laboratory -specific information such as SOPs and the chemical inventory. The regulation is Appendix A of the UW Laboratory Safety Manual.) h. Ensure Visitor Safety 1. Before starting any chemical use, visiting scientists and volunteers performing procedures within the laboratory must receive equivalent training as other employees on the hazards and safety precautions, including requirements for use of PPE. 2. Visitors such as emergency responders, f acilities workers and contractors, must be protected from the hazards within the laboratory ( e.g., surfaces and equipment must be decontaminated and cleaned prior to allowing visitors to contact such surfaces and equipment. Information about preparing equipment for servicing by maintenance personnel is in Section 4.G of this manual and online at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/notice- cleaning - and-decontamination -form- updated -81021 -154; information about decontaminating equipment and facilities for dispos al or lab relocation is in Section 4.H.) i. Enforce Restrictions on Children and Minors In accordance with University of Washington Administrative Policy Statement 10.9 (http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/APS/10.09.html), the laboratory must not be used as a childcare area. Minors (ages 14 -17) working in the laboratory as volunteer workers or as employees must not be exposed t o agents that pose higher health risks as described in WAC 296 -125-030 (apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=296 -125-030) and the U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor Provisions at https:// www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/child -labor. These risks include such mat erials as human body fluids, radioactive and hazardous substances, or jobs requiring PPE other than gloves, boots, eye protection or hard hats. (For more information, visit: www.washington.edu/research/urp/students/pre.html). There are specific student -learner exemptions that apply to minors (ages 16 and 17) if the work or volunteer appointment is part of a vocational education program, or the minor is enrolled in a University of Washington aca demic course for credit. For questions about the regulatory exemption, contact EH&S Research and Occupational Safety at 206 .221.7770 and visit: https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/youth -in-STEM.pdf Page 25 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL j. Enforce Restrictions on Pets WAC 478 -128 prohibits pets in all University facilities. Staff are prohibited from bringing pets into any University facility, including laboratories. ( WAC 478 -128 can be found at apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478 -128.) Information on UW policies regarding service animals can be found here: https:// www.washington.edu/compliance/ada/service- animals/. UW Administrative Policy Statement 46.6 afford s individuals wit h disabilities who require the assistance of a service animal equal opportunity to access University property, courses, programs, and activities. A service animal may be restricted from specific areas of the University when consistent with other University policies, state, and/or federal laws/regulations. Examples of these areas may include: Food preparation areas Animal research facilities and grounds Medically sensitive patient and clinic areas Biologically sensitive or hazardous research sites If a service animal is restricted from certain areas, the designated disability services offices are available to assist in evaluating reasonable accommodations for the owner. If service animals are NOT restricted from a laboratory area, then the RP for that area should manage all safety needs for the animal, including any needed PPE . k. Perform Annual Reviews and Update Documents Annually, someone in the laboratory must check that revised information has been integrated into the CHP and review that cond itions have not altered from a safety perspective by doing the following: Check (December, annually) for revisions to the Laboratory Safety Manual; obtain a current copy of the LSM and make it available to all personnel Check that actual laboratory procedu res and conditions remain consistent with SOPs and other laboratory -specific information Verify your lab's MyChem chemical inventory is current; that a collection of outdated or legacy chemicals does not occur in inventory and SDSs Review internal inspecti on results, routine maintenance records, and the condition of equipment used by laboratory staff to identify possible safety deficiencies, such as dirty, defective, or worn equipment; out -of-date fire extinguisher; emergency shower inspections; etc. It is recommended that laboratory staff make any changes necessary and note the annual review ( refer to the template in www.ehs.washington.edu/resourc e/laboratory - specific -chemical -hygiene -plan -template -597 and maintain documentation in the laboratory -specific information section of the CHP. If there are major changes during the year, it is recommended that laboratory staff update the laboratory -specific information as conditions or procedures change. l. Perform Accident Follow -up All accidents and incidents must be investigated. Any accidents / incidents resulting in injury to personnel to the extent that they need medical attention, and accidents / incidents involving unplanned fires and explosions, must be reported to the laboratory's responsible party and to EH&S. It is recommended that incidents that do not result in significant injury or damage, but do result in near misses, also be reported to the laboratory's responsible party and to EH&S. Page 26 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Details for accident follow -up are provided in Section 9.B of this manual, including reporting requirements . If it is recognized that an SOP could be improved to mitigate risk, update it prior to performing the procedure again m. Perform Lab Safety Inspections and Assist EH&S Inspections It is expected that laboratory staff perform formal self- inspections using a checklist or other form of documentation at least annually. The inspection checklist used by the EH&S laboratory safety team is available at: www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resour ces/prvaslbchklst.pdf, and can be augmented with additional items regarding laboratory -specific conditions. It can also be found on the lab safety dashboard, and it is recommended that the completed self -inspection be st ored on the dashboard. These inspections should be independent of any other inspections \u2014 i.e., they should not be just preparation or response for third- party audits or inspections. If safety deficiencies are identified, they must be addressed. Documentat ion of the inspections and follow -up should be maintained for three years. It is recommended that all inspections have some type of documentation , and that different people perform them to spread knowledge and gain different viewpoints. The frequency of se lf-inspections may vary depending on the number of safety challenges identified, and the schedule may be changed on an annual basis (especially if laboratory personnel and procedures remain constant and few new pieces of equipment are obtained). A minimum of one self-inspection should be performed annually. Additional guidance and tools for self -inspections can be found on -safety -surveys -and-inspections/lab -self- inspections notified of third- party inspections (for example, the EH&S laboratory safety team), the responsible party should be responsive in scheduling and providing laboratory -specific information as requested. Inspection findings should be addressed and corrected in the time specified (typically 30 calendar days). All laboratory staff should support the inspection to ensure lab safety. 2. Dean, Department Chair and Director The Dean, Department Chair and Director are responsible for the fol lowing: a. Ensure Safety of Laboratory Occupants \"Provide a safe and healthy workplace free from recognized hazards\" (WAC 296 -800-110, https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=296 -800-110). This can be accomplished by being aware of the University's Accident Prevention Program (https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/workp lace/accident -prevention -plan), being familiar with Departmental health and safety plans and the activities generally being conducted, being aware of the general requirements in this manual and other safety and health requirements, and taking a reasonable approach in minimizing hazards and risks. Ensure lab space assigned is suitable for the intended work and has been cleaned and/or decontaminated as appropriate if the space supported previous research activities. If vent ilation is needed, a fume hood (or equivalent) is present and in working order. If hazardous chemicals are in use, emergency washing (eyewash and shower) is available. Ensure new lab builds or remodels are designed following the lab design guide (link) Enforce corridor policy as it pertains to lab work and lab supplies. Ensure routine inspections of emergency washing equipment, fire extinguishers, and autoclaves are performed for all labs. Orient new RPs, visiting scientists, and postdoctoral researchers to required lab safety training and safety resources. Provide information on required authorizations as needed. Ensure Page 27 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL lab moves are following clean out guidelines and ensure all surplus of laboratory items follow established established surplus guidelines . b. Enforce Laboratory Control Methods Ensure SOPs concerning use of particularly hazardous substances identify authorization requirements and maintain records of training completion. (For more information, SOP development is described in Section 6 and recommended controls are provided in Section 2.G ). Ensure that safety records are maintained as described in Section 7 : Safety Training and in Section 8 : Record Keeping. c. Review Accidents Have procedures in place to become aware of accidents affecting laboratory operations within your department, and ensure corrective actions are taken, if necessary, to prevent accident recurrence. d. Review and Follow Up on Inspection Findings Ensure that corrective actions are completed for safety inspections. Provide a response within 30 calendar days i ndicating when the findings were addressed. EH&S recognizes that some findings may require longer than 30 days to correct; in these cases, a response indicating the plan for making corrections is requested. e. Ensure Appropriate Laboratory Closures/Moves Ensu re laboratory closures or moves are done responsibly ( Section 10 ). f. Assume RP duties or assure a RP is appointed for a laboratory when there is an extended absence of the PI or RP. This may be due to a RP's sabbatical, extended remote work assignment, retirement, or illness. g. Obtain Hazardous Material Permits Hazardous Material Permits must be obtained from your local fire department (Bothell, Seattle, Tacoma, or other). Departments or building m anagement may obtain permits covering all their laboratories. If they do not, the laboratory's RP must ensure the permit is acquired. This is most frequently a concern when a laboratory relocates , or a new research project involves highly hazardous chemicals. Contact your Departmental Safety Officer, Departmental Administrator, or EH&S at 206 .685.0341 for advice. Permits must be readily available upon request by the fire code authority. EH&S may also need to review these permits to ensure permit conditions are met. 3. Employees/Students Employees and students have a responsibility to: a. Comply with Guidelines and Policies Know and comply with lab safety gui delines and policies required for all assigned tasks. b. Report Unsafe Conditions Report unsafe conditions to your laboratory's Chemical Hygiene Officer, PI, a faculty member, your immediate supervisor, the Departmental Safety Officer, or EH&S (206 .543.7262). If you identify a procedure or assigned task as being exceptionally risky, you can perform it only after you believe the risk has been reduced to an acceptable level. c. Report Accidents Report accidents and incidents to your supervisor, and to the University using the online accident Page 28 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL reporting system (OARS).

BASIC LABORATORY SAFETY PRACTICES 1. Working Alone Working alone is when an individual is working unaccompanied, such that assistance is not readily available should an injury, illness, or emergency arise. Alone is interpreted as being out of direct visual contact or hearing range with another lab worker for more than a few minutes. It can occur during normal working hours as well as during evening, night , or weekend hours and even in the same general area as others. RPs should assess whether certain types of work and procedures conducted in the laboratory are appropriate to be done alone and inform all personnel of policies. Follow the lab -specific policies around working alone. Do not work alone in the laboratory if the procedures conducted involve highly hazardous substances or processes (such as those described in section 2.G ). If you are working alone with lesser hazard chemicals, let personnel in other laboratories know of your presence or develop an accountability system with your supervisor or co - workers. Guidance on working alone safely can be found at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/working -alone -safely -focus -sheet -1053 Exposure Prevent skin contact with chemicals: For example, use appropriate PPE per Lab Safety Manu al, Section 5.B : (e.g., goggles, gloves, and/or lab coat) but consider it as the last line of defense and use other precautions, such as appropriate containment equipment and checking regularly that connections are tight. Clean up spills as soon as possible and minimize clutter at workspaces to avoid inadvertent exposure. Avoid practices that invite chemical contamination of the laboratory work surfaces and result in skin contact with chemicals, such as taping pipets to bottles of hazardous solutions for dedicated dispensing. To avoid inhalation of a chemical: Use a fume hood whenever handling volatile or aerosolized chemicals, even if they are of relatively low toxicity. Cap chemicals as soon as possible. Limit the smelling of chemicals to the minimum amount necessary; only smell a chemical if no other method of identifying a chemical is available and just waft the air at the container opening towards your nose. Investigate the source of unfamiliar odors and eliminate them. To avoid ingestion of a chemical: Do not taste any chemicals. Mouth suction must never be used to pipet chemicals or start a siphon; instead, use a pipet bulb or an aspirator. Avoid touching y our mouth and face with your hands while working with chemicals. Page 34 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL To avoid injection of a chemical: Dispose of needles as soon as any injection is complete. Use needles with inherent safety devices that prevent inadvertent needle sticks. Dispose of sharps into appropriate waste containers and do not overfill sharps containers. If operating a high -pressure system, never check for a pressure leak using your hands. Do not carry any kind of laboratory sharp in your clothing or lab coat pocket. 3. Washing Hands Wash hands well with soap and warm water after removing gloves and before leaving the laboratory area. Never wash with organic solvents. (Refer to s ection 5.B Personal Protective Equipment for more information.) 4. Food and Drink Food and drink consumption in the laboratory increases the chance of exposure to chemicals; consumables are prohibited from being stored, prepared, or c onsumed in University laboratories that use chemicals. a. Glassware/Utensils Glassware or utensils used for laboratory operations must never be used to prepare or consume food or beverages. b. Storage of Food/Beverages Laboratory refrigerators, ice chests and co ld rooms are not allowed for food or beverage storage intended for human consumption. 5. Access to Emergency Exits and Equipment Emergency equipment, such as eyewashes, safety showers, fire extinguishers and fire alarm pull stations must be directly accessible. Storage, even temporary storage, and equipment must not block doorways, corridors, aisles and stairways to assure unobstructed access to exits at all times, including in the event of an emergency. 6. Laboratory Signs Laboratory Caution Signs must be posted (as described in Section 4.C ). These signs provide lab specific information: emergency contact names and numbers, chemical, physical, and biological hazards, and required PPE. Laborat ories are required to post an up- to-date sign at the entrance to all rooms, except offices. The sign is intended to alert emergency responders and visitors of potential hazards and precautions for entry. Additional signage may be posted to alert to specifi c hazards (such as a laser, magnetic fields, or high voltage equipment), prohibit unsafe behavior, describe additional required protective measures or designate locations of various supplies and equipment. Magnetic or framed signs may be used to designate a temporary hazard. Warning signs must be removed when the hazard no longer exists (such as a sign indicating the presence of a chemical that is no longer Page 35 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL kept in a laboratory). Biohazard warning signs must be posted when BSL -2, BSL -2+, or BSL -3 work is performed. For BSL -2 laboratories, the Biohazard Warning Sign must be affixed to entry doors in a way such that it can be easily removed or turned over in circumstances when work is complete and support staff or persons not conducting BSL -2 work may access the room. 7. Housekeeping Laboratory bench tops and other work surfaces must provide enough space to safely execute procedures. Aisles and egress routes must be clear to allow for prompt evacuation in the event of a spill, fire or other emergency. Maintain the following housekeeping expectations in the laboratory at all times: Keep flammable materials away from igni tion sources Separate incompatible materials and chemicals Ensure emergency equipment and supplies (eyewash, shower, spill kit, fire extinguisher) are readily accessible Keep f ume hoods uncluttered and unblocked by furniture or other objects Store chemicals in and orderly and upright manner ; no crowding , precarious balancing , stacking, or open or damaged containers Compl ete chemical labels and make sure they are legible, and visible when stored Avoid trips and falls by limiting floor storage Clean work surfaces, including pads or linings on the surface Keep sinks clear Minimize amounts of garbage/trash; no overflowing containers Protect tubing and power cords from physical damage and ensure they are not a tripping hazard Maintain defrosted freezers so that labels can be read and the condition of the containers can be assessed Minimize associated risk of physical hazards (for example, large glass pieces) by appropriately sorting equipment with physical hazards Clear access to chemical storage areas Do not use broken containers or broken glassware 8. Sharps Safety Sharps are items used to cut or puncture skin or body parts, including needles, scalpels and lancets. Other sharps items can still cause injuries although they do not fit the regulatory definition of sharps, such as broken glass, glass septum vials, glass pipets, razor blades and sharp teeth and nails of res earch animals. Safety precautions are necessary to prevent injury and exposure. Identify sharps devices to be used in laboratory procedures. When possible, substitute a non -sharp alternative such as a blunt needle or plastic pipet, or consider using a safe sharps device. If a sharp must be used, training and practice are essential to prevent injury. Avoid recapping needles; if a needle must be recapped, use a needle holder to do so. Never leave an uncapped needle exposed in the work area. Promptly place all sharps waste into a red sharps container. Store reusable sharps in a labeled storage container such as a bucket or tray. Use a magnet to contain reusable metal sharps like razor blades. Avoid factors and conditions that can lead to a sharps injury, such a s hurrying, or working when you are tired or not feeling well. Keep work area organized and uncrowded so that sharp items are Page 36 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL always visible. More information on sharps safety is available at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/sharps -safety -research -578. B. CHEMICAL INVENTORY AND THE SAFETY DATA SHEET (SDS) Laboratories must maintain chemical inventories in MyChem, the University of Washington's campus -wide chemical tracking system. MyChem is designed to track inventories during emergencies and assist laborat ories in complying with federal, state and local regulations. Chemical inventories, location contacts and chemical -specific hazard summaries must be available to emergency personnel so they know what chemicals may be involved in an accident and whom to contact in the event of an emergency. Laboratories should use MyChem inventories to keep track of chemicals, avoid unnecessary purchases, prevent keeping legacy or unneeded chemicals and submit chemical collection requests. Chemicals that are jointly purchase d or for shared use should be listed in only one chemical inventory, requiring a responsible party to be determined by the purchasers. Laboratory staff are required to maintain up- to-date chemical inventories in MyChem to facilitate compliance with Bothell , Seattle and Tacoma Fire Department Hazardous Material Storage and Use Permits (occupancy permits), EPA Community Right -To-Know reporting and Department of Homeland Security chemical security requirements. MyChem stores approximately 500,000 hazard summar ies in the form of SDSs. As the inventory is entered, the SDS is attached and readily accessible. All employees should be able to readily access an SDS for any chemical they are using. All chemicals purchased for laboratory use are required to be entered into the MyChem inventory. 1. Access to MyChem MyChem is the University of Washington's centralized SDS database for chemicals used by University personnel . EH&S maintains the MyChem SDS database. For access to SDSs https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/safety -data -sheets- sdss using your UW NetID email and password. For access to site- specific chemical inventories and the UW Chemical Exchange, click the 'Person' link in the top menu bar, fill out the form, and ask the PI or inventory manager to add you as a contact.\" If you have questions or desire additional information, contact MyChem support at mychem@uw.edu or 206 .616.4046. 2. Conducting Your Chemical Inventory Personnel must inventory all chemicals found in the laboratory and specify the maximum amount normally found at this location. When adding chemicals to a MyChem invent ory, make sure to search for and select the product with the same supplier and catalog number as the actual product in your lab. If, after reviewing the search results, there is not an exact match in the system, you must add a custom chemical to the system using the 'Chemical Not Found' button. This is the best way to ensure the proper Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is available for emergencies and that the chemicals hazards are accurately represented. Dilutions and reagents prepared in the lab for further work do not need to be included in the inventory, but must have a container label visible, unless the entire preparation is used or disposed of on the same day. Review and update inventories annually when moving a laboratory or starting a new project or wh enever there are significant changes in your chemical inventory. Page 37 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL While conducting your physical inventory, examine containers for deterioration and integrity. Chemicals that are expired, corroded or no longer needed should be managed as hazardous chemical waste. For more information about chemical waste management, refer to Section 3. This inventory must be reviewed and updated at least annually; new chemicals should be entered into MyChem as soon as they are received, and any large changes (like moving the inventory to another room) should be update d when they occur. 3. Safety Data Sheet (SDS) SDSs are documents that describe the physical and health hazards of chemicals. Manufacturers of chemicals must provide SDSs for chemicals they sell. Laboratory staff and students must have access to SDSs or all ch emicals used in the laboratory. The department or laboratory may choose whether to maintain the SDSs in electronic or paper format at https:// recommends laboratories maintain paper copies of SDSs for the hazardous chemicals likely to spill and/or cause injury. Having an SDS immediately available when someone is exposed to a hazardous chemical aids emergency personnel in how to respond and treat that person. Call EH&S at 206 .616.4046 to request assistance locating or accessing SDSs during business hours. If the SDS is online in the MyChem system, EH&S will email a copy within a work shi ft. Chemicals that do not have an SDS in the system will take longer to research and obtain. After business hours, contact the UWPD at 206.685.8973 and UWPD will contact an EH&S representative. If an SDS is received with a chemical shipment, please maintain a copy in the lab and send the original to EH&S (Box 354110, c/o SDS Coordinator) for addition to the MyChem database. You may also attach an updated SDS by selecting the chemical name in your inventory and using \"Send an Updated SDS.\" If synthesi zing a hazardous chemical, the PI or manager must generate a Globally Harmonized System (GHS) compliant label and SDS before shipping or transporting the chemical away from the campus. Use the available template at http://www.chemsafetypro.com/Topics/GHS/GHS_safety_data_sheets.html to make a GHS compliant SDS. Don't forget to add these chemic als to MyChem and attach your SDS. C. CHEMICAL PROCUREMENT Most chemical products can be purchased without restriction from suppliers through eProcurement (on-line ordering system) or through UW Purchasing Services. However, the following rules and guidelines apply to some chemicals: 1. Hazardous Chemicals Order only the amount of chemicals needed. Many manufacturers will supply smaller quantities or containers (if requested by the purchaser). Do not stockpile chemicals. Chemicals that are expired and/or appear to be no longer useful are considered hazardous waste. Purchase hazardous chemicals in plastic -coated bottles (when available) instead of uncoated glass bottles. Hazardous chemicals should be received directly by a laboratory or a chemical stockroom . If the chemicals are received in an office, there should be a safe location such as a designated table with adequate open space reserved for temporary storage of the package. When you open a shipment, you should verify that i t is the correct chemical, that the container is intact, and that the date of receipt and label are legible. Page 38 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 2. Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals not regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ( e.g., antibiotics, heparin, sterile water, and over -the-counter drugs), can be purchased through UW Medicine Drug Services (some restrictions may apply). For more information, and the pharmacy formulary list, go to https://depts.washington.edu/drugsvcs/home/. If you do not know exactly what pharmaceuticals to order, email questions to drugsvcs@uw.edu. 3. DEA Controlled Substances DEA registrant s can procure controlled substances from a drug company, wholesaler, or UW Medicine Drug Services (the preferred vendor). If you wish to order a controlled substance through Drug Services, a current Controlled Substances Registration Certificate must be em ailed or mailed to Drug Services before an order can be filled. New registrants must complete an initial inventory upon obtaining a Controlled Substances Registration Certification prior to procuring controlled substances, and a biennial inventory for all registrants must be completed every two years, at minimum. Controlled substances must be stored in a locked cabinet with limited access. A perpetual inventory must be maintained and the inventory forms must meet DEA and State regulations available at https:// www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/ and https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=69.50. Expired drug(s) and waste must be kept in a secure, locked cabinet, inside a separate container, properly labeled for content and inventoried until disposal. Drug Services wil l provide the contact information for DEA -licensed reverse distributors required for disposal. For more information on procurement or DEA -licensed reverse distributors, contact Drug Services at drugsvcs@uw.edu. 4. Non -Denatured Ethyl Alcohol Instructions for obtaining approval and purchasing non -denatured ethyl alcohol are detailed on the UW Procurement web site at https://finance.uw.edu/ps/how- to-buy/ethyl -alcohol. Instructions for maintaining accountability for tax -free ethyl alcohol are in Administrative Policy Statement (APS) 15.1 at http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/APS/15.01.html. 5. Radioactive Materials The State of Washington Department of Health , Division of Radiation Protection (https:// www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Radiation), licenses radioactive materials use. Using radioacti ve materials requires prior approval from EH&S. Orders for radioactive materials must be placed with the UW Purchasing Department. Additional information is available on the EH&S Radiation Web page at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/radiation/control -radioactive - materials . 6. Highly Dangerous Materials Materials that are extremely hazardous to property, health, or the environment (e.g., explosives pyrophoric materials, highly water -reactive chemicals, and highly toxic gases, etc.) may not be procured until the necessary administrative, engineering and environmental controls are in place. Hazardous materials must be stored and used in accordance with numerous regulations including, but not limited to, the International Fire Code and local amendments. ( Section 2G : Special Chemical Hazards for examples). Contact EH&S at 206.685.0341 for more information. Page 39 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 7. Compressed Gas Cylinder Procurement Gas cylinders should be purchased through the preferred supplier, Praxair, to ensure that the supplier has a cylinder return authorization program. Refer to the UW eProcurement website at https://finance.uw.edu/ps/how -to-buy/gases. Only order the amount of gas that you need. Some gas suppliers will not take returns of partially full or empty cylinders or containers. If a different vendor is necessary to provide a specialty gas, t he purchaser must get a written return agreement from the distributor or manufacturer prior to purchasing the gas. It is important that the return agreement include a statement requiring the manufacturer to take back both the cylinder and any unused gas. The purchaser should retain this agreement until the manufacturer has accepted the returned cylinder. Additional information is available on the EH&S Web page at www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/compressed -gas- cryogenic -fluids. 8. Chemical Exchange The UW Chemical Exchange program facilitates the free exchange of chemicals campus wide via MyChem, the online chemical inventory system. Consider checking the online Chemical Exchange (accessible only to UW employees) for chemicals before you buy new chemicals. For more information about this program, visit the MyChem website at www.ehs.washington.edu/ch emical/mychem. 9. Additional exceptions For a list of additional exceptions , visit https://finance.uw.edu/ps/how -to-buy/exception -items. D. CHEMICAL STORAGE 1. Evaluate Chemical Hazards for Storage Hazards due to the reactions between incompatible chemicals may include: Generation of heat Fire Explosion Toxic gas or vapor production Flammable gas or vapor production Formation of a substance with greater toxicity than the reactants Formation of shock - or friction -sensitive compounds Pressurization of closed vessels Solubilization of toxic substances Dispersal of toxic dusts and mists Violent polymerization The general approach is to separate all chemicals into compatible groups. The specific SDS should always be consulted when evaluating chemical properties and hazards of the materials for storage. Most chemicals have multiple hazards; decisions should be prioritized as follows: a. Flammability/Explosiveness The most important consideration for storage is the flammability characteristic of the material. If the chemical is flammable, it should be stored in a flammable storage cabine t. If the total for flammables exceeds ten gallons, they must be stored in a flammable storage cabinet. If the material Page 40 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL is explosive, refer to the SDS or consult with EH&S to determine appropriate storage. b. Reactivity If the material will contribute significantly to a fire (e.g., oxidizers), it should be isolated from flammables. If the material will contribute significantly to a fire when water is applied (e.g., water - reactive chemicals), it should be stored to ensure it is protected from any contact with water, including water that would be applied while extinguishing a fire in the lab. Isolate materials that can react with themselves (e.g., polymerization). c. Corrosives Corrosive substances are chemicals that cause a reaction that lead s to the damage of a solid structure. A material is considered corrosive if a liquid or solid causes irreversible destruction of human skin at the site of contact within a specified period. Review the corrosivity of the material and store accordi ngly. d. Toxicity The toxicity of the material, with particular attention paid to regulated materials, means that certain chemicals will be isolated within a storage area. For example, an extreme poison that is also flammable should be locked inside the flamm able storage cabinet. 2. Chemical Storage Practices Establish and follow safe chemical storage and segregation procedures for your laboratory: Provide an appropriate storage place (per guidelines in Table 2 -1 or chemical storage pictogram in Appendix G) for each chemical and return the chemical to that location after use. Store in compatible containers. Incompatibles must not be stored together; refer to the Chemical Compatibility Chart at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/incompatible- chemicals -focus - sheet -176. Incompatibles cannot be s tored in the same hazardous materials cabinet, even if they are segregated by secondary containers, when the container exceeds 2 kg (solids) or 500mL (liquids) or any amount of compressed gases. Avoid storing chemicals on bench tops. Avoid storing chemicals in laboratory fume hoods. Store volatile toxics and odoriferous chemicals in a ventilated cabinet (if available ; many fume hoods have ventilated cabinets beneath the workbench ). Do not expose stored chemicals to heat or direct sunlight. Storage s helves should be level, stable, and secured to the wall or stable surface. In case of an earthquake, shelves should have raised edges or rim guards (minimum height: 2 inches) to prevent containers from falling; shelves should be kept free of chemical conta mination and dust sources. Containers should not protrude over shelf edges. Store heavy bottles on lower shelves; store corrosives below eye level; ideally, cabinets and shelves should be sturdy and low to the floor and Page 41 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL constructed of material that is impervious ( i.e., non-reactive) with the corrosive; they should also be ventilated or located near the ventilation system. Containers of chemicals must be capped when not in use; make sure that caps on containers are secure; replace damaged caps. If a chemical does not require a ventilated cabinet, store inside a closable cabinet or on a shelf that is anchored and that has a lip to prevent containers from sliding off. Chemicals should not be stored under, near, or in the sink to minimize the chance of accidents and improper discharges to the sanitary sewer. Any vapors of corrosive materials and bases will cause corrosion of the plumbing fixtures under the sink. Some chemicals, including many corrosives, are water reactive and in the event of a water leak, there can be unanticipated and unfortunate consequences. Do not store chemicals in hallways, corridors or exit ways. If chemicals must be stored adjacent to each other on a benchtop, use secondary containment to prevent incompatible chemicals from mixing and reacting with each other. Use secondary containment or spill control, such as placing the container on an absorbent pad (generally required for containers on the floor). Particularly hazardous substances (highly dange rous or toxic chemicals, select carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens) should be stored together if compatible. Signs should be posted indicating toxic chemical location and unique hazards Maintain the lowest possible quantities of highly toxics Chemicals with a high degree of toxicity (e.g., venoms, mycotoxins, and select agents), should be doubly contained and stored in a locked area accessible only by authorized personnel. Use containers that are chemically resistant and non-breakable Store chemical waste following the same guidelines as above. Waste containers must be labeled with a completed University of Washington hazardous waste label. If reusing a container that previously held another compatible chemical, the original manufacturer's label must be defaced. For more information about chemical waste, go to Section 3 of this manual. Use properly designed refrigerators or freezers for storin g volatile flammables (certified by the manufacturer for flammable materials storage) which require refrigeration. Explosion -proof appliances are usually not required for the typical laboratory setting ( refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/FS -freezers.pdf for additional information) . Page 42 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL If containers are placed in refrigerator/freezer door shelves, use secondary containers, additional barriers, Velcro or other protective measures to keep them from falling out when the door is opened. If chemicals are stored in a shared area or room, the storage space, cabinet or container should be labeled with the responsible party's name so that ownership can easily be identified. Table 2 -1 Chemical Storage Recommendations Chemical Classification Storage Recommendation Flammables Store in approved safety cans or flammables cabinets. Do not store incompatible materials in the same cabinet. Keep away from any source of ignition: heat, sparks, or open flames. Flammable solids must be segregated from flammable liquids ( section 2D.3). Explosives In general, explosives should be stored in a designated magazine. Consult with SDS or EH&S for other substance -specific storage information. Acids Do not store with flammable solvents or combustibles. Ideally, store in a cabinet designed for acids; do not store acids on metal shelving. Segregate inorganic from organic acids. Isolate nitric acid and perchloric acid. Bases Store in corrosives cabinet or on protected shelving away from acids. Segregate inorganic from organic bases if incompatible . Light Sensitive Chemicals Store in amber bottles in a cool, dry, dark place. Nitrated Compounds Nonflammable solvents Nitrated compounds can be considered explosive, special care and handling may be required ( section 2.G.4.a) IdStore in a ventilated, dry, cool area. They may be stored in a flammables cabinet if no incompatibilit y is determined. Oxidizers Store in a cool, dry place away from flammables and reducing agents. Oxidizers must not be stored on wooden shelves or in cardboard boxes. Page 43 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Chemical Classification Storage Recommendation Peroxidizable Chemicals Store in airtight containers in a dark, cool place. Most peroxidizable compounds are flammable and should be stored in a flammable chemical storage cabinet. Label containers with receiving and opening dates. Test for the presence of peroxides at least every six months. Discard before exceeding the expiration date. Inspect peroxide forming chemicals often for evidence of contamination, degradation, or any change from normal physical or chemical characteristics. If you suspect a material may have become explosive, contact EH&S immediately and post a warning sign so others do not handle or disturb the material ( section 4.C). Pyrophoric Substances Store in a cool, dry place, making provisions for an airtight seal. Materials (e.g., tert -butyl lithium) will react with the air to ignite when exposed (section 2.G.d.). Toxic Chemicals Store according to the nature of the chemical, using appropriate security where necessary. Generally, store in a ventilated, dry, cool area in a chemically resistant secondary container ( section 2.D.2). Water - Reactive Chemicals Store in a cool, dry location away from any water source, including sprinkler systems. For water reactive metals have a Class D fire extinguisher available in case of fire ( section G.1.e ). Compressed Gas Containers Store in a cool, dry place, preferably outside of the building and secured with chain or other appropriate strapping material . Due to seismic concerns, full sized cylinders should be restrained at two points --two chains or straps , or one chain or strap and a floor mount. In some cases a single restraint at 2/3 height can provide adequate restraint . Note: t his requirement does not apply to lecture bottles or similar small cylinders (<36\") . Separate flammables and oxidizers by 20 feet or a 1 -hour rated firewall. General Chemicals Store on laboratory benches or shelves with like chemicals. Provide secondary containment on benches for liquids, and earthquake restraints for shelves. 3. Chemical Storage Quantity Limits a. Control Areas Chemical quantities in most University buildings are limited, in accordance with the local fire code (http://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/cod es-we-enforce -(a-z)/fire -code) (https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2021P1 ) adopted by the local jurisdictions. (Note: Bothell, Seattle, and Tacoma Fire Departments have made amendments to IFC.) Limits by hazardous material classification apply to a control area that may include a suite of laboratories, one or more floors in a building, or the entire building. Page 44 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL There are also outdoor control areas for storage of hazardous materials. Quantity limits may be increased if fire sprinklers protect the entire control area or, in some cases, if hazardous materia ls are stored in approved cabinets. Buildings under newer codes have reduced limits in control zones above the second floor . The higher the floor, the greater the reduction. Researchers and other building occupants must cooperate with each other to make su re that hazardous material quantities do not exceed code limits. This process is supported by accurate chemical inventories in MyChem. To ensure compliance with the IFC, contact EH&S at 206 .685.0341. b. Flammable Liquids in Basements Flammable liquids are al so limited in basement rooms, to comply with the International Fire Code. The aggregate storage quantity in basement areas is limited to 75% of the MAQ on the - 1 floor, and 50% on the - 2 level. Chemical use is prohibited below the - 2 level. Some storage is allowed such as for generator tanks. Use MyChem or consult with EH&S to determine if you are exceeding maximum allowable quantities. c. Additional Requirements Whenever possible, all flammable and combustible liquids should be stored within an approved flammable liquid cabinet. Small amounts may be stored outside of a flammable liquid cabinet under certain conditions or in approved containers. Quantities stored outside the flammable liquid cabinet are limited to 10 gallons per control zone. This includes the overall flammable load within the control area. Contact EH&S at 206 .685.0341 for guidance. E. CHEMICAL LABELING Guidance and label templates for chemical containers are available on the EH&S Chemical Container Labels webpage https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/chemical -container -labels 1. Original Container The label on an original chemical container must be legible and written in English. It must include the chemical/product name as shown on the SDS and the manufacturer's name and address. Do not accept materials if the label is illegible or missing required information. ( Refer to Figure 2 -1, Example of Original Label). Labels on chemicals/products shipped fro m the manufacturer must be consistent with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) as required by Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 296 -901-140 (go to https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=296 - 901-140). There are six required WAC elements : 1. Product name 2. Manufacturer's name and contact information 3. Signal word (e.g., \"danger\", \"warning\" or no signal word) 4. Hazard statement(s) (e.g., toxic if inhaled, combustible liquid) 5. Pictogram(s) 6. Precautionary Statements (e.g., keep container tightly closed) Avoid damaging the original container's label, if possible. If a container label becomes illegible, replace the label. The replacement label must include the six required WAC elements to comply with GHS rules. Contact EH&S at 206.543.7388 or ehsdept@uw.edu for assistance in obtaining a replacement label. Page 45 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Figure 2 -1 Example of Original Label 2. Labeling Stock / Working Solutions Containers of preparations, sample aliquots and other working solutions are not required to be labeled if the container is emptied before the end of the work shift and used by only one person. If a preparation or working solution is used by others, or kept longer than the day of use the container must be labeled with the following information: Identity of the contents (spell out chemical names) Signal word, if known or suspected (e.g., \"danger\", \"warning\") Hazards, if known or suspected (e.g., \"flammable\", \"corrosive\", \"irritant\") It is best practice to label the working solution with the initials of the person preparing the solution and the date of preparation. Information about the signal word, hazards , and the precautionary statements from th e label, can be obtained from the SDS, but dilutions and reactions may change the hazards and their severity. Your department may require a specific type of label. If so, describe it in the laboratory -specific inform ation section of your CHP. The method of affixing the label to the container (i.e., glue, tape , or wire) is also at the discretion of the department/laboratory. a. Labeling Specialized Containers Containers that are too small for labels, installed into a process or would become unusable for their intended purpose if labeled must still have their contents identified in some way. Use any labeling method that enables employees and visitors from other agencies, such as the fi re department, to identify the chemicals and their hazards. Examples include a sign identifying the materials and their hazards, color or numeric codes cross -referenced on a chart or room diagrams identifying locations of the chemicals and hazards. Seconda ry chemical labels that can be downloaded from the website and printed onto Avery labels Page 46 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL are available on the EH&S Chemical Container Labels webpage at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/chemical -container -labels . b. Additional Label Required for Peroxide -Forming Chemicals Label chemicals that form peroxides with the date the container was first opened, using the label (UoW 1716) shown below. (General requirements for handling chemicals that form peroxides are described in section G.2.b ). Figure 2 - 1 Peroxide Label (UoW 1716) c. Additional Label Required for CFATS Chemicals Label chemicals listed in the Chemical Facility Anti- Terror ism Standards (CFATS) (https://www.cisa.gov/chemical- facility -anti-terrorism -standards ) with a warning label (as described in Section 2.G.9.b below) to remi nd workers that the substances are regulated and cannot be shipped off campus without prior EH&S notification. (Chemicals requiring this label can be found in Section 2.G.9.a ) d. Labeling Waste Containers Figure 2 -3 Do Not Ship Label Waste containers must be labeled following the guidelines in this manual (Section 3 ), for hazardous chemical waste. If re -using a container to hold waste, the container must be compatible and appropriate for the waste. Completely deface all old labels on containers used for wastes. Affix a new label. For radioactive waste, go to Section 14 of the UW Radiation Safety Manual : www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/RSManualBinder.pdf For biological waste, go to section 4.F of the UW Biosafety Manual : https:// www. ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/uw -biosafety -manual.pdf F. TRANSPORTING CHEMICALS Transporting chemicals information is for moving the chemicals to other research related locations. Page 47 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Chemicals at the University are not permitted to be taken off campus to a private residence or other purposes not related to or approved for institutional use. Chemicals should be transported in a container that prevents leakage. The container should be closed. Avoi d transporting chemical containers which may have contamination on the outside ( i.e., avoid the need to wear gloves or other PPE while transporting chemicals). If the container is breakable, it should be placed in a secondary container. 1. Transporting betwee n Floors and Buildings on Campus This section applies to transportation by hand or by cart. In general, when possible, use freight - only elevators when moving chemicals between floors. a. Moving a Single Chemical 1. The person doing the moving must be trained in the hazards of the chemical and know what to do in the event of a spill of that chemical. 2. The exterior of the container should be clean enough that it may be handled without the need for protective gloves. 3. Chemical bottles must be labeled and sh ould be securely capped and placed in a bottle carrier. 4. Chemical containers that are glass and do not have closing caps or handles should be placed in bottle carriers or larger containers and surrounded by vermiculite or other absorbent material. 5. When moving a lecture bottle, do so in a manner that protects the valve. Larger gas cylinders must be moved using precautions (listed in Section 2.G.9.c below). 6. Whenever possible, use freight eleva tors to transport chemicals. If no freight elevator is provided, passenger elevators may be used, but passengers should be discouraged from travelling with liquid and solid materials. Passengers (other than the material handler) are not allowed in elevator s with compressed gas and cryogen transport. b. Moving Multiple Chemicals 1. The person doing the moving must be trained in the hazards of the chemicals and what to do in the event of a spill of those chemicals. 2. The person must also have a spill kit that can han dle the spill of those chemicals. 3. The exterior of the containers to be moved should be clean enough that they could be handled without the need for protective gloves. 4. Chemical containers must be labeled and securely closed. Lecture bottles should be packed in a manner that protects the valve. 5. Chemicals should be grouped by compatibility and by hazard class (e.g., flammable, toxic, etc.) and each group should be placed in larger containers or tubs while being transported. Page 48 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 6. Containers used to transport multiple chemicals should be lined with an absorbent material such as vermiculite to cushion the load and absorb and contain any spills. Multiple glass bottles in the same tub should be cushioned using the absorbent to prevent the bottles from rattling against each other. 7. Carts used to move chemicals should be stable under the load and have wheels large enough to negotiate uneven surfaces without tipping or stopping suddenly. 8. For laboratory moves across campus, EH&S can arrange for a contractor to pack and move your chemicals for you, at your expense, or you can pack and move them yourself using proper DOT packaging and a UW Motor Pool vehicle. (Refer to Section 10.B.2 of this manual for details). 2. Transporting Chemicals off Campus Transporting chemicals information is for moving the chemicals to other research related locations. Chemicals purchased for laboratory use should not be taken off campus for non -institutional use. EH&S is required to notify the Department of Homeland Security if you ship certain listed substances governed by the Chemical Facility Anti -Terrorism Standards (CFATS). (Go to Section 2G.9 below for a list of the 22 \"do not ship\" chemicals). Refer to the UW Field Operations Safety Manual for guidance on using chemicals for field research. a. Vehicle Use Transport certain hazardous materials in UW -owned and operated Motor Pool vehicles. You cannot transport hazardous chemicals in your personal vehicles without prior authorization by the UW. For more information or for authorization, call 206 .616.5835 or email chmwaste@uw.edu. I f you are transporting chemicals for a lab relocation, please read F.2.d below. b. Shipment by Others If you ship hazardous materials by vehicle or air, you are required by law to be trained and certified (Section 2.F.3.a This includes situations when you use a commercial contractor (FedEx, United Parcel Service, Yellow Freight, etc.) to transport hazardous material for you. You are responsible for complying with all applicable transportation regulations (which ensure the safety of your chemicals as well as those who transpor t them) and providing a Safety Data Sheet for each chemical. 3. Receiving Chemical Shipments Inspect all incoming shipments to ensure proper labels are attached, accurate, and that the containers are intac t and in good condition. Any leaking containers must be placed in an appropriate, secondary container and treated as a chemical spill. Call EH&S for spill procedures at 206.543.0467 (M -F, 8:00 a.m. -5:00 p.m.) Outside of business hours, call UWPD at 206 .685.UWPD and ask for the EH&S staff person on call. If you receive a shipment container that appears to be bulging or pressurized, isolate the package, if possible, and do not open the container. Call 911 immediately. a. Training: Shipping Hazardous Materials Training is required for all people who classify, prepare, package, label, document, or offer a hazardous material for transport. Shippers can receive training by taking the EH&S class Shipping Page 49 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Hazardous Materials. Class times and registration can be found on our website at www.ehs.washington.edu/training. b. Laboratory Moves EH&S will arrange to have a contractor package your chemicals and transport them to your new location if off- campus. The lab is responsible for the expense, and there are some materials the contractor cannot transport (temperature restrict ive materials, DEA regulated materials, and radioactive, infectious , or explosive materials). Go to Section 10.B.2 for details. For more information, call 206 .616.5835 or email chmwaste@uw.edu. G. SPECIAL CHEMICAL HAZARDS 1. Highly Dangerous Chemicals Highly dangerous chemicals present exceptional risks due to flammability or reactivity. At the University of Washington, highly dangerous chemicals are those that are explosive, unstable, self - reactive, self -heating, oxidizers, water -reactive, organic peroxides, and pyrophoric. EH&S evaluated the various GHS categories or Fire Code classes for each of these hazards and set specific criteria for classifying chemicals as a PHS ( refer to the criteria at www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/Criteria -designate- particularly -hazardous.pdf). 2. Particularly Hazardous Substances Personnel need to take special precautions with chemicals that are reactive, explosive, highly toxic, select toxins, carcinogens and reproductiv e hazards, sensitizing or allergenic, synthesized chemicals, in compressed gas cylinders or at high pressure, that present exceptional flammability hazard, or have additional specific requirements due to federal regulations. If the degree of hazard is seri ous enough, the chemical is classified as a particularly hazardous substance. Particularly hazardous substances (PHSs) at the University are those that present extreme hazards to personnel and property and require stringent safeguards. PHS include chemical s considered highly toxic, highly dangerous, a reproductive toxin, a select carcinogen or a select toxin. Work with PHS requires specialized training from your PI or supervisor, and customized standard operating procedures that identify designated work are as, containment devices such as fume hoods and glove boxes, procedures for decontamination protocols and prior approvals before work begins. Particularly hazardous substances are identified with a letter in the REG column of your MyChem inventory. Criteria for particularly hazardous substances are shown on the EH&S Web page at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/particularly -hazardous -substances- 655. EH&S flags PHS in MyChem based on these chemical hazards utilizing the Fire Code and the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for Classification and Labeling (https:// www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/global.html). The speci fic criteria utilized can be found here. EH&S also utilized information found in the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) List of Antineoplastic and Other Hazards Drugs in a Healthcare Setting (https:// www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hazdrug/default.html) and the EH&S Guidance on Workplace Hazards Imp acting Reproduction and Development (https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/reproductive- hazard -guidelines -616). Page 50 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL The number of chemicals flagged in MyChem as PHS will grow as new chemicals are added to UW inventories and the knowledge about chemical hazards continues to evolve. We recommend you review Safety Data Sheets and other sources of hazard information to determine if other chemicals in your work area fall within this criter ia and require these additional safeguards. Expanded precautions for use include: Improve the security and integrity of chemical storage Review proposed procedures by another PI Intensive training on the chemical's hazards and the equipment used Require increased proficiency before any particular individual may perform the procedures be demonstrated and documented Require a second lab worker to be in the lab in case of emergencies Ensure all safety measures are included in the SOPs Check that addi tional measures for shipping such materials have been confirmed 3. Reactive Chemicals A chemical is considered reactive if it has the capability to undergo violent chemical change such as explosions or production of toxic fumes, in certain situations. Purchase and use these chemicals in small quantities or find a suitable alternative. Take extreme care when handling and storing these compounds. Chemicals with an NFPA rating of thre e or four for reactivity are considered particularly hazardous substances, due to being highly dangerous. Extra precautions taken (as described in Section 2.G ) need to be documented in your SOP s. a. Compounds that Generate Toxic Gases Some compounds that contain sulfide or have a cyanide ( -CN) functional group (examples in Table 2 -2) can generate toxic gases in sufficient quantities to present a danger to human health when combined with other compounds, such as hydrochloric acid. Table 2 -2 Toxic Gas Generators Compounds that Generate Toxic Gases Copper (II) cyanide Mercury (II) cyanide Sodium cyanoborohydride 1,4-Dicyanobutane Methyl sulfide cyanide Sodium cyanide b. Oxidizers Oxidizers are chemicals that initiate or promote combustion of other materials. Oxidizing agents include halogenated inorganics, nitrates, chromates, persulfates , and peroxides.Several accidents have occurred at the U niversity due to waste oxidizers being disposed into common waste receptacles under the mistaken belief that the oxidizer would no longer react with the other waste chemicals. Page 51 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Table 2 -3 Oxidizers Oxidizing Chemicals Ammonium dichromate Lithium perchlorate Potassium chlorate Ammonium nitrate Nitric acid Potassium permanganate Chlorine (liquid or gas) Nitric oxide Sodium nitrate Chromic Oxygen nitrate Guanidine acid Sulfuric acid c. Chemicals that may Polymerize Polymerization is a chemical reaction in which small molecules combine to form larger molecules. Polymerization can be hazardous when the reaction releases large amounts of energy or drastically increases the volume of the chemical. Table 2 -4 Chemicals that may polymerize Chemicals that May Polymerize Acrylic acid Acrylonitrile 1,3-Butadi ene Isopropenyl acetate Styrene Vinyl bromide 2-Vinylpyridine d. Pyrophoric Chemicals A chemical that will ignite spontaneously in air at or below 130 \u00b0F (54\u00b0C) is considered pyrophoric. The oxidation of the compound by oxygen in the air proceeds so rapidly that ignition occurs spontaneously. Such chemicals would be considered particularly hazardous substances and the extra precautions taken (as described in Section 2.G above) need to be documented in your SOPs. Table 2 -5 Pyrophoric Chemicals Pyrophoric Chemicals Barium metal sticks Sodium methoxide Trimethylaluminum Page 52 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL e. Water Reactive Chemicals Water reactive chemicals react violently with water to release a gas that is either flammable or presents a health hazard. Alkali metals, many organometallic compounds, and some hydrides react with water to produce heat and flammable hydrogen gas. Some of these reactions proceed so violently that the chemicals are classified by NFPA as Reactive code three or four , and the extra precautions taken (as described in Section 2.G above) need to be documented in your SOPs. Table 2 -6 Water Reactive Chemicals Water Reactive Lithium aluminum hydride Potassium metal 4. Potentially Explosive Chemicals An explosive chemical, when subjected to heat, impact, friction, electric or chemical charges, can produce a sudden, quick release of pressure, gas, and heat. When detonated in an uncontrolled or unexpected circumstance, explosives can result in serious bodil y harm or extensive property damage. Shock sensitive explosives are known to detonate, even when bumped or handled normally. Common potentially explosive chemicals at the UW include: a. Nitrated Compounds Nitrated organics and inorganics constitute the larges t class of compounds that are explosive when dehydrated. When you purchase a nitrated compound, do so in small quantities. Weigh the container and write the weight on the bottle. Do not break the seal on the cap until the chemical is in active use. Prior t o subsequent use, weigh the container again. If the container weighs less, add an appropriate solvent to replace the weight lost. After the reagent is opened and an aliquot is taken note the weight of the container. Visually inspect the container for probl ems prior to each use and wipe down the bottleneck, cap, and threads with a wet cloth before resealing. Additional factors that need to be included in your SOPs are described in Section 2.G (above). Table 2 a nitrated compound usually purchased as a solid wet with 10% water. Extreme heat, Page 53 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL blasting cap, or electric charge can detonate picric acid. It becomes highly unstable if allowed to dehydrate. When wet, picric acid is an orange colored, com pact crystalline solid with the consistency of lumpy sand. When dry, picric acid is a crystalline solid with visible air pockets below the surface. Picric acid will readily form explosive metal picrates, which are extremely shock sensitive and will detonat e with the slightest movement or vibration. Do not allow picric acid to contact metal that is readily oxidized or be stored in a container with a metal cap. Lead, iron and copper metals are particularly dangerous, due to metallic picrate formation. b. Organic Peroxide -Forming Solvents Organic peroxide -forming solvents become shock sensitive when allowed to oxidize and form appreciable quantities of explosive peroxides. Most of these solvents are also flammable. Most peroxide forming solvents are colorle ss, mobile liquids. Oxidation can occur when the solvent is exposed to atmospheric oxygen. This reaction is catalyzed by light as well as by temperature and pressure changes. The additional precautions you take to control peroxide -forming hazards (describe d in Section 2.G above and in this section) need to be documented in your SOPs. For more information, the Peroxide Forming Chemicals Management and Assessment Guidelines are online : www.ehs.washi ngton.edu/system/files/resources/Peroxide_Forming_Chemicals.pdf. Desired Procedures for Peroxides : 1. Highly Concentrated Peroxides - Over a period of time peroxide concentrations can increase to hazardous levels. Solvents with high concentrations of peroxides will appear viscous or contain needle -like crystals. If peroxides are visible, no further handling is recommended. Contact EH&S at 206.616.5835 for assistance with professional testing and stabilizatio n. 2. Explosive Capability - Peroxides formed in organic solvents have caused some laboratory accidents, including unexpected explosions during distillation and use. Such formulations are considered low -powered explosives; they will detonate in moderate conce ntrations by modest shock, friction, or when heated. The biggest dangers of organic peroxides in these solutions are opening the container and distilling. Do not open or move the container if there are crystals on or around the container cap. Call EH&S at 206 .616.5835 for assistance if you are concerned about opening the container. 3. Required Procedures - Purchase peroxide -forming solvents in small quantities that contain an inhibitor, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which will delay the formation of peroxides until the inhibitor is used up. Label the container with the date received and opened. Label the container with the standard peroxide label (UoW 1716; Figure 2- 4). Do not break the seal on the container until the solvent is needed. Once opened, store solvent in an airtight amber glass bottle or metal container, with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, in the headspace. 4. Testing Peroxides - It is best laboratory practice to use test strips to test the solvent for peroxides prior to each use. After each use, wipe down the bottleneck, cap , and threads with a cloth before resealing. Reduce formed peroxides and add an inhibitor (as necessary) to keep the concentration of peroxides below 10 ppm. Extreme caution should be exercised if concentrations of peroxides exceed 30 ppm. Test and treatment methods available at EH&S 206 .616.5835 Page 54 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 5. Distillation and Evaporation Precautions - Always test for peroxides before distillation or evaporation because these procedures will increase the co ncentration of any peroxides present. Do not distill or evaporate solvents containing any amount of peroxides. Use a water bath over a hermetically sealed electrical mantle to safely heat the solvent. Use any distilled solvent immediately or add an inhibit or. Figure 2 -4 Peroxide Label (UoW 1716) 6. Use of Inhibitors - Inhibitors slow the formation of peroxides in the future. They do not reduce or remove peroxides. Organic peroxides should be reduced safely. 7. Monitoring Expiration Date - Use the solvent before the manufacturer's expiration date. Peroxide -forming solvents exceeding their expiration date cannot be discarded through EH&S until the contents have been tested for peroxides. Table 2 -8 Peroxide- Forming Chemicals Severe Hazard High Hazard Moderate Hazard 3 months Once exposed to oxygen rapidly oxidizes, forming explosive peroxides. 6 months Once exposed to oxygen, oxidizes at a moderate rate forming explosive peroxides . 12 months Once exposed to oxygen, slowly oxidizes forming explosive peroxides . Diisopropyl Tetrabutylammonium fluoride Page 55 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL c. Azides Organic and inorganic azides, (R -N3), can explode when heated or exposed to ground glass joints. Some azides are shock sensitive. Metal azides are relatively insensitive to shock but may explode when heated. Sink disposal of azides can be extremely hazardous because they can form metal azides that are shock sensitive, (like iron azide). Azides present a hazard around ground glass joints because they can be shock sensitive. Document additional precautions, (described in Section 2.G above) in your SOPs. d. Fulminates Fulminates are compounds that contain a carbon -nitrogen -oxygen group. Metal fulminates such as mercury, silver, and gold are highly explosive. Explosions are typically initiated by heat. Silver fulminates can form in un-discarded Tollens reagent. Document additional precautions (described in Section 2.G above) in your SOPs. 5. Highly Toxic Substances a. Precautions for Use In laboratories, particularly hazardous substances (identified in MyChem ) include chemicals that are highly toxic. The procedures for using such chemicals re quire additional precautions (as described above in Section 2.G). b. Categories of Highly Toxic Chemicals Various regulatory agencies define highly toxic chemicals differently. The International Fire Code defines \"highly toxic and poisonous materials\" for signage and fire code reasons. Refer to the current IFC C hapter on Highly Toxic and Toxic Materials (https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2018/CHAPTER -60-HIGHLY -TOXIC -AND -TOXIC - MATERIALS?site_type=public) for additional information about these codes and requirements. The EPA a nd Washington State Department of Ecology have other criteria for classifying a chemical as \"extremely hazardous\" or a \"substance with high acute toxicity.\" These definitions affect their reporting requirements and waste accumulation and disposal requireme nts. The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries has adopted the following criteria to identify highly toxic chemicals (Washington Administrative Code ( WAC) 296 -839-20005 , https://app.leg.wa.gov/wAc/default.aspx?dispo=true&cite=296. For reference, LD50 (Lethal Dose - 50%) is a single dose of a material expected to kill 50% of a group of test animals. LC50 (Lethal Concentration - 50%) is a calculated concentration of a material in air or water, exposure to which for a specified length of time is expected to cause death of 50% of a defined experimental animal population. 1. Dermal Route The median lethal dose (LD50) for dermal route is less than or equal to 200 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two to three kilograms each. 2. Oral Route For an oral route, the med ian lethal dose (LD50) is less than or equal to 50 mg/kg of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 to 300 grams each. Page 56 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 3. Inhalation Route The median lethal concentration (LC50) for an inhalation route is less than or equal to 200 parts per million (ppm) for gases and two milligrams per liter of air (mg/l) for vapors, dusts, mists or fumes where time of exposure is any time up to four hours when administered to albino rats weighing between 200 to 300 grams each. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes highly toxic \"select agents and toxins.\" Information and the regulation pertaining to select agents and toxins are available at www.cdc.gov/od/sap/index.htm. Select agents and toxins are only allowed in specific spaces on campus and must only b e used by approved individuals. If you intend to use any of these select agents and toxins, pre -approval is required before obtaining them. Please contact EH&S at 206 .221. 7770 to initiate the approval process. 6. Carcinogens and Reproductive Hazards Additional care must be taken to minimize exposures to known and suspected carcinogens and reproductive hazard chemicals because inadequate information is available in many cases. Ways to minimize exposures include steps such as: substituting for less hazardous ch emicals if possible, using the smallest amounts necessary, and using a fume hood or other control system. Additional information is available on the EH&S Reproductive Hazards webpage at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/guidance- workplace -hazards -impacting -reproduction -and- development -616. a. Select Carcinogens Various peer group agencies have researched data and compiled lists of known, suspected and/or regulated carcinogens. A select carcinogen is any chemical that meets one of the following criteria: The Washington Department of Labor and Industries regulate it as a carcinogen. It is listed as \"known to be human carcinogens\" in the Annual Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology Program (NTP ) (latest edition) (https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/index.html). It is listed as Group 1 (\"carcinogenic to humans\") by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs (latest edition as of June 26th, 2015, IARC monograph volume 113) at https://monographs.i arc.who.int/agents -classified -by-the-iarc/ It listed in carcinogenic to humans\") or 2B (\"Possibly carcinogenic to humans\") by IARC, or in the category of \"Reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens\" by NTP, and it causes s tatistically significant tumor incidence in experimental animals in accordance with any of the following criteria: after inhalation exposure of six - seven hours per day, five days per week, for a significant portion of a lifetime to dosages of less than 10 mg/m3; OR After repeated skin application of less than 300 mg/kg of body weight per week; OR After oral dosages of less than 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. b. Reproductive Toxicants Reproductive toxicants are those known to affect human reproductive capabi lities including chromosomal damage (mutations) and effects on fetuses (teratogenesis). Tables H -1 and H -2 include those human reproductive toxicants listed as \"A+\" through \"A\" in \"Workplace Hazards to Reproduction and Development: A Resource for Workers, Employers, Health Care Providers, and Page 57 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Health & Safety Personnel,\" 1999, by Sharon L. Drozdowsky and Stephen G. Whittaker, Technical Report Number 21-3-1999, Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, Safety and Health Assessment and Research for Prevention (SHARP) Program. Chemicals rated \"A+\" and \"A\" are listed as \"Reproductive Toxicants, and those rated \"A\" are listed as \"Suspected Reproductive Toxicants.\" General information about potential reproductive and developmental h azards, and advi ce on safe work conditions and practices in their work environment is available on the at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/reproductive- hazard -guidelines -616. The guidance addresses both female and male reproductive healt h risks, and contains details on identifying, evaluating, and reducing those workplace risks. c. Select Toxins Some chemicals with high toxicity are managed as potential terrorist weapons. These chemicals are listed in the Code of Federal Regulations at 42 CFR 7 2.6 at the select toxins may be exempted from the regulatory requirements if the LD50 is greater than 100 nanograms per kilogram and the toxin is used for medical purposes or biomedical research. Any select toxin that is not exempted is noted in the tables as a \"Select Toxin.\" If used on the University of Washington campus, additional requirements for registration, handling and disposal are mandatory. If you have additional questions or concerns about select toxins, contact EH&S at 206.221.7770. d. Hazardous Substances Hazardous drugs , as defined and listed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), include those that exhibit one or more of the following six characteristics in humans or animals: Carcinogenicity Teratogenicity or other developmental toxicity Reproductive toxicity Organ toxicity at low doses Genotoxicity Structure and toxicity profiles of new drugs that mimic existing hazardous drugs These include drugs used for chemotherapy (also called antineoplastics), antiviral drugs, hormones, some bioengin eered drugs , and other various drugs. Many of these substances do not have a known safe exposure or \"no effect\" level. Federal and state regulations and guidelines exist for the use, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous drugs in clinical and research settings. Follow safety precautions when working with hazardous drugs. These include use of exhausted enclosures, procedures to avoid personal exposure and contaminating surfaces, personal protective equipment (PPE), and training of personnel in hazard awareness and safe work practices. For more information, go to www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/chemotherapy -hazardous -drugs. 7. Sensitizing or Allergenic Chemicals Potent chemicals, which can cause sensitization or allergy, may affect researchers by changing their style of life and, in some cases, force them to leave their areas of research. This hazard is not limited to traditional laboratory chemicals; researchers handlin g animals can become allergic to animal dander and researchers in forest resources can develop allergies to molds. Additional examples shown in Table 2 -9. Page 58 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Table 2 -9 Sensitizing or (certain types) Once sensitized, a person may react to extremely low amounts of the chemical. Response can range from contact dermatitis to anaphylactic shock. Use caution to minimize exposures. Situations that may lead to acute exposure (e.g., cleaning up a spill) should be carefully assessed to keep the exposure at a safe level. If a person is sensitized or allergic to a similar chemical any control which will prevent exposure to the chemical should be implemented (e.g., improved ventilation, barriers, or improved procedures). If respirators are used, the person must comply with all steps in the UW Respiratory Protection Program: www.ehs.washington.edu/workp lace/respiratory -protection. 8. Synthesized Chemicals Synthesized chemicals may present unexpected hazards. The first step should always be to perform a literature review for information on the expected hazards from the proposed procedures and the known hazards of chemicals with similar structure. Take into account that all these hazards are being assumed for th e new, synthesized chemicals and additional hazards may arise . Pay particular attention to hazards from reactions or during purification or subsequent activities. Generate minimal quantities until the basic hazards of the chemical can be determined. a. Nanoparticles The term \"nanoparticle\" defines particles with at least one dimension less than 100 nanometers. They may be deliberately engineered or develop naturally. Such particles may be more reactive and toxic than bulk -size chemicals. Take special care to prevent them from being released into the environment. If your laboratory intends to create aerosolized nanoparticles, measure the typical nanoparticle levels before the process begins and compare it to subsequent levels. Additional information about nanoparticle safety guidelines is available at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/guidelines- safety -during - nanoparticle -research -534,or by contacting the UW Chemical Hygiene Officer at: ehsdept@uw.edu. b. Providing Synthesized Chemicals to Others If you produce a chemical substance for use by another agency outside the University o f Washington system, the Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratory standard (WAC 296 -828, https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -828) requires that you produce a label and a Safety Data Sheet for that substance in accordance with WAC 296 -839 (https://app.leg.wa.gov/wAc/default.aspx?dispo=t rue&cite=296), SDS and Label Preparation. A laboratory synthesizing chemicals for use by others should consider themselves a resource responsible for providing hazard cautions to those receiving the chemical. Staff synthesizing a hazardous chemical should provide other parties with as much information about the safety precautions when using the chemical as is feasible. For more information, please contact the UW Chemical Hygiene Officer: labcheck@uw.edu.

Compressed Gases, Gas Cylinders and Liquid Cryogen Containers Gas is a generic term describing compressed gases, liquefied compressed gases, refrigerated liquefied gases (cryogenic gases), and dissolved gases. Non -liquefied compressed gases do not become liquid at normal temperature, even at high pressures. Liquefied compressed gases become liquid at normal temperatures when pressurized in a gas cylinder. Refrigerated liquefied gases, also known as cryogens, become liquid at very low temperatures. The cryogenic gases have boiling points below - 150\u00b0C. Dissolved gases are gases dissolved in other substances while stored in gas cylinders. Additional details are available on the EH&S Compressed Gases webpa ge at www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/compressed -gas-cryogenic -fluids. a. Hazards of Compressed Gases 1. Both physical and health h azards are present with the use of compressed gases. The high pressure in cylinders (> 900 PSIG) makes the gas cylinder a potential physical explosive rocket that could punch through walls. 2. Some gases may be corrosive which could result in damage to tissue and/or equipment at the point of contact. 3. Cryogenic gases have dangerously low temperatures, potential frostbite and may expand into large volumes of gas that could displace oxygen and result in suffocation. 4. Inert gases and oxidizing reactions may create oxygen deficiency hazards (ODH) by displacing oxygen and may lead to suffocation. The early symptoms may be dizziness and weakness, which may lead to unconsciousness and death. This is also termed asphyxiation. 5. Flammability of gases, which could res ult in fires, is a concern especially for Acetylene, Hydrogen, and Propane. 6. The permissible exposure limits (PEL) for toxic materials may be very low, so even a small exposure could be poisonous. 7. Oxygen leaks may create oxygen -enriched atmospheres which increase the risk of fire and explosions. 8. Additional hazards may be found on the gases' Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). b. Safe Practices Adhere to the following safe practices when working with compressed gas cylinders and cryogen containers: 1. Make sure cylinders have proper labels including contents, concentrations, hazard classifications, safety precautions, manufacturer or supplier's name, and a tag that indicates whether the cylinder is \"full\", \"in -service\", or \"empty.\" Accept only properly identified cylinders. If the cylinder is not properly labeled, or the label cannot be read, return the cylinder to the supplier. 2. Make sure gas cylinders are not damaged and do not show signs of Page 60 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL corrosion. If you notice they have damaged labels, dents, gouges, burn/heat marks, or show signs of corrosion, then do not accept them, and return them to the supplier. 3. Assume all cylinders contain gas under pressure and treat all gases as hazardous chemicals. 4. Clearly label all gas lines leading fr om gas cylinders. This is especially important if the cylinder cannot be seen from the application point. Markings used for piping systems must include the content's name and direction of flow arrow. Markings are required at each valve, at wall or ceiling penetrations, at each change of direction and at a minimum every 20 feet throughout the piping run. 5. Use, store and transport cylinders in an upright position unless they can be safely stored horizontally ( for more, Storage section on Compressed Gas at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/f iles/resources/Gas- andCryogen -Safety -focus -sheet.pdf Use cylinders in a well -ventilated area. If you need to use a gas cylinder in spaces with inadequate ventilation confer with EH&S at 206 .543.7388 to conduct a hazard assessment. Spaces with poor ventilation may need oxygen alarms or ventilation failure alarms. 7. Secure cylinders properly during storage, transport and use to avoid knocking over cylinders ( read 2.G.9.c below for additional transport requirements). 8. Make sure caps are in place when the cylinder is not in use and during transport. 9. Make sure access to the cylinder valve is unobstructed at all times. 10. Make sure pressure regu lators are equipped with pressure release valves. 11. When turning off the cylinder, turn the gas supply off at the cylinder valve first, de- pressurize the system and then turn off the regulator. If the cylinder will not be used on a consistent basis , remove the regulator and replace the cylinder cap. 12. Keep incompatible gases stored separately. If the cylinder is not in use, separate oxidizing gases from flammable gases by 20 feet or a one -hour firewall. Note: one backup cylinder stored in the area with the one in use may also be considered in use and not subject to incompatibility storage requirements. 13. Store highly toxic gases in exhausted enclosures (gas cabinet or fume hood). 14. Avoid sources of ignition and open flame. 15. Do NOT purchase more or larger cylinders than necessary. 16. Do NOT store or use compressed gas cylinders or -209 17. Do NOT store flammable gases next to an exit or near oxygen cylinders. 18. Do NOT use or permit contact of solvents, oil or grease on cylinders or their valves. 19. Do NOT empty gas cylinders to a pressure lower than 25 psi (172 kPa). At lower pressures, suction and backflow can cause contamination of residual contents with air if the valve is open. Page 61 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Do NOT use Teflon tape on cylinder or tube fitting connections, which have metal - to-metal face seals or gasket seals. c. Moving Compressed Gas Cylinders When moving compressed gas cylinders, they must: Install the metal outlet cap/plug. Install the valve cap if the cylinder has one. Secure in a cart or container designed to prevent the cylinder from falling over while being moved. Whenever possible, use freight elevators to transport full, compressed gases. If no freight elevator is available, passenger elevators may be used. Passengers (other than the material handler) are not allowed in elevators with compressed gas and cryogen tr ansport. d. Leaking Gas Cylinders Do not over -tighten the valve in an attempt to stop the leak. If the valve continues to leak, consider whether room evacuation and building evacuation is necessary. Take the following actions as appropriate: 1. Flammable, oxidiz ing or inert gases - Wear PPE as necessary. If possible, allow the cylinder to exhaust into a well -ventilated area (such as a fume hood) with few or no combustible absorbent materials in the vicinity (such as cardboard). Post a sign warning of the leaking cylinder. Avoid sparks and open flames. 2. Toxic or corrosive gases - Wear PPE as necessary. Exhaust cylinder into an absorbent or neutralizer if possible. If no absorbent or neutralizing system is available, exhaust the cylinder into an operating fume hood. If escaping gas is leaking out of the control device or no control device is available, evacuate the area. Post a sign warning of the leaking cylinder. e. Compressed Gas Piping and Tubing Permanent and Temporary Gas piping systems are used for compressed gase s. Entire buildings may only contain permanent gas piping systems; temporary gas piping systems should be as short as possible in one room. ( For specific information on the Compressed Gas webpage go to www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/compressed -gas-cryogenic -fluids). f. Regulato rs Pressure regulators lower gas pressure to a usable level. There are two different types of regulators and specific precautions must be in place prior to use. g. Compressed Gas Shipments Researchers should purchase compressed gas through the UW preferred supplier, Praxair. ( Section 2.C.7 ). When the gas arrives, inspect the cylinder to make sure it's what you ordered. Never acc ept a cylinder with damaged labels, dents, gouges, or burn/heat marks. h. Returning and Disposing of Gas Cylinders Whenever possible, gas cylinders should be returned to the supplier as described in section 2.C.7 concerning procurement of gas cylinders. (Additional information on cylinder disposal is described Page 62 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL in Section 3.P of this Laboratory Safety Manual). If re turning full or partially full cylinders, review shipping precautions on the Compressed Gas webpage. Flammable and Combustible Liquids Read the SDS for safety precautions before handling flammable and combustible liquids. Know the flash points of the flammable or combustible materials you are using. The flash point is defined as: \"the lowest temperature at which a chemical can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture with air.\" Many common organic solvents and chemicals used in the laboratory have flash points well below room temperature. At or above the flash poin t temperature, there can be sufficient vapor to ignite if an ignition source is present. Flammable liquids are defined as: \"having a flash point less than 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C)\". Combustible liquids have a flash point of 100 \u00b0F or higher but can still produce e nough vapor to burn if heated. Highly flammable chemicals with an NFPA rating of four for flammability are also considered particularly hazardous substances and need additional precautions (as described Section 2.G above). Remember to re- plan for an emergency by adhering to the precautions in Section 9.A.2.c , such as preventing clutter , wearing lab coats that resist burning, and providing clear access to eyewashes, emergency showers, and evacuation routes. The main objectives in working safely with flammable liquids are to avoid accumulation of vapors and to control sources of ignition. a. Vapor Control Use less hazardous chemicals if possible. Use the smallest amount of flammable liquid necessary for your procedure. Use closed systems whenever possible. If you must work with open systems, use a fume hood to prevent accumulation of flammable vapor. Close the fume hood sash when flammabl e chemicals are still present, even when not performing your procedure. Each flammable liquid has two limits: Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) and Upper Flammability Limit (UFL) defining the range of concentrations in mixtures with air that will propagate fl ames or explode. These limits are also sometimes referred to as the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) and the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL). The range that a fire or explosion could occur becomes wider with increasing ambient temperature and in oxygen enriched atm ospheres. In Table 2 -10 (below), Flash Points and Flammability Limits, flash points and the ranges of LFL to UFL are shown for typical laboratory chemicals. Table 2 -10 Flash Points and Flammability Limits of Certain Chemicals Chemical Flash Point \u00b0C / \u00b0F Auto -Ignition Temperature \u00b0C / \u00b0F Flammability Limits (% volume in air) Lower (LFL) Upper (UFL) Acetone -37.8 / -36 465 / 870 4 60 Benzene -11.0 / 12 560 / 1040 1.3 7.1 Carbon disulfide -30.0 / -22 80 / 176 1.3 50 Diethyl ether -45.0 / -49 160 / 320 1.9 36 Ethanol 12.8 / 55 365 / 690 3.3 19 Methanol 11.1 / 52 385 / 725 6.7 36 Methyl ethyl ketone -6.1 / 21 516 / 960 1.8 10 Page 63 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Chemical Flash Point \u00b0C / \u00b0F Auto -Ignition Temperature \u00b0C / \u00b0F Flammability in air) Lower (LFL) Upper (UFL) Pentane -40.0 / -40 260 / 500 1.5 7.8 Toluene 4.4 / 40 480 / 896 1.2 7.1 If you are warming flammable liquids above the auto- ignition temperature, make sure there is no exposure to air or oxygen until the temperature drops below the auto -ignition temperature (such as those shown in the table above). Make sure the ovens are specifically designed for flammable liquids (no internal ignition sources and/or vented mechanically). If you need to heat flammable liq uids, use devices that have good controls, such as steam baths, salt and sand baths, oil baths, heating mantles and hot air baths. Do not use open flames; along with being a potential ignition source, it is harder to maintain exact control of the heat appl ied. Go to Section 4 on heating equipment. You should also minimize the total quantity of flammable materials in the lab and keep them stored in proper containers (plastic or metal containers, or safety cans) as described in Section 2.D.3 (above). Cap containers as soon as you have poured out the amount needed. To prevent the spill and release of vapors while transporting bottles, use bottle carriers. Dispose of unnecessary flammable chemicals to prevent inadvertent spills. Be aware that the vapors of many flammable liquids are heavier than ai r, and can travel considerable distances along a benchtop or the floor and potentially be ignited by a source located in the lab or workspace. These vapors can be generated by a spill or during a simple transfer from one container to another. b. Ignition Source Control Control all ignition sources in areas where flammable liquids are used. Open flames and spark- producing equipment should not be used. Use equipment with spark -free, intrinsically safe induction motors or air motors to avoid producing sparks. These motors must meet National Electric Safety Code (NFPA 70) Class 1, Division 2, Group C-D explosion resistance specifications. Many stirrers, Variacs, outlet strips, ovens, heat tape, hot plates, and heat guns do not conform to these code requirements. Avoid using equipment with series- wound motors, since they are lik ely to produce sparks. Equipment On/Off switches can produce sparks when activated, especially if the equipment uses a lot of power. Place equipment switches as far as possible from any open systems using flammable liquids. c. Grounding Concerns Pouring flamm able liquids can generate static electricity. The development of static electricity is related to the humidity levels in the area. Cold, dry atmospheres are more likely to facilitate static electricity. Bonding or using grounding straps for metallic or non -metallic containers can prevent static generation. Page 64 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL All metal containers larger than one gallon (4 liters) must be grounded to avoid static charge when transferring flammable liquids to another container. Grounding can be direct, (e.g. , a wire attached to both containers) or indirect (e.g., wires connected to a common ground system). When grounding non-metallic containers, contact must be made directly to the liquid rather than to the container. In the rare circumstance that static elec tricity cannot be avoided , and grounding is not possible, such as pouring small volumes of flammable liquids into a graduated cylinder or beaker, proceed slowly to give any static charge time to disperse. Alternatively, conduct the procedure in an inert atmosphere. For more information regarding bonding and grounding can be found in the EH&S focus sheet at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/grounding -bonding -focus - sheet.pdf. 11. Homeland Security Chemicals of Interest Regulations, Title 6 Code of Federal Regulations Part 27, require all chemical facilities (including universities) to comply with the Chemical Facilit y Anti -Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/chemsec_appendixa -chemicalofinterestlist.pdf. The rule requires that a chemical facility that either possesses or later comes into possession of listed chemicals in quantities that meet or exceed threshold quantities, report them to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). U nder this regulation, a University building is deemed a chemical facility and EH&S is charged with reporting building overages to DHS. EH&S relies on the accuracy of your chemical inventories maintained in the MyChem database to determine what is reportabl e. DHS can require a facility to prepare a security vulnerability assessment and implement a site security plan. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines and/or imprisonment. DHS regulates certain chemicals in the rule in any amount if transported (shipped) away from campus. ( Go to Table 2 -11 below for a list of 22 chemicals regulated in any amount if shipped). Do not ship these chemicals without notifying EH&S in advance. EH&S is responsible for reporting all UW shipments of these chem icals to DHS. EH&S has developed a \"do not ship\" warning label which reminds workers that the substance is federally regulated and cannot be shipped without prior EH&S notification (refer to section 2.G.9.b below). Page 65 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL a. Do Not Ship List Do Not Ship List Acetone cyanohydrin, stabilized (75 -11 Reportable if Shipped Chemical List Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identifies 22 chemicals that are reportable in any amount when transported (shipped) away from campus. Table 2 -11 Reportable if Shipped Chemical List, provides these chemicals by nam e and CAS number: b. Do Not Ship Labels If you possess any of the 22 listed chemicals in a purchased formulation, attach a \"warning\" label to the original container to remind workers that the substance is regulated and cannot be shipped away from campus witho ut prior EH&S notification. Notify EH&S before shipments by calling 206 . 616.0585. (Figure 2 -5 Do Not Ship Label for a sample label). Laboratories can print their own labels or obtain printed labels from EH&S by calling 206 .616.0585. Figure 2 -5 \"Do Not Ship\" Label c. Disposing of Chemicals on the Do Not Ship List If you wish to dispose of any of these \"do not ship\" chemicals, you must submit a Chemical Waste Collection Request found at www.ehs.washington.edu/secure/rou tine-chemical -waste- collection- request (as described in Section 3 of this manual). Acetone cyanohydrins (stabilized), aluminum phosphide, and phosphorus penta sulfide must be treated before collection. Contact EH&S for details before filling out the collection request if you DO NOT SHIP. This c hemical is federally regulated and cannot be shipped without prior EH&S notification. Contact EH&S at 206 .616.0585 for details. Page 66 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL wish to dispose of one of these three chemicals. 12. Process Safety for Highly Hazardous Chemicals If there is any chance that the quantities of hazardous chemicals handled at one time may exceed the quantity limits of WAC 296 -67, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals , additional safety precautions must be taken. The regulation is viewable at: https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -67 and a table listing chemical limits in pounds that require implementation of this process is in Appendix A, WAC 296 -67-285. Among the requirements is a formal, documented failure analysis using techniques such as: What If analysis Checklist Fault Tree Analysis Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Other equivalent methodology for assessing hazards Assistance on these techniques is available from EH&S at 206 .543.7388. Other requirements, such as storing highly toxic gases in a gas storage cabinet, may be required as described earlier in this section. 13. Chemotherapy and Hazardous Drugs Drugs are classified as hazardous if they may cause cancer, developmental or reproductive toxicity or harm to organs at low doses. They include drugs used for cancer chemotherapy (also called antineoplastics), antiviral drugs, hormones, some bioengineered drugs , and other various drugs. To determine if a drug is classified as hazardous check the NIOSH List of Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Healthcare Settings (2014) : https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014 -138/ Follow safety precautions when working with hazardous drugs. These include use of exhausted enclosures, procedures to avoid personal exposure and contaminating surfaces, personal protective equipment (PPE) and training of personnel in hazard awareness and safe work practices. Federal and state regulations and guideli nes exist for the use, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous drugs in clinical and research settings. EH&S has developed guidance that includes procedures for safety, compliance and best practices. For research involving hazardous drugs at UW, follow these guidelines : https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/chemotherapy -and-other -hazardous -drugs -safe-use-guidelines -523 More information on use and handling of chemotherapy and hazardous drugs c an be found on the EH&S website here: https://www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/specific -chemical -hazards/chemotherapy -hazardous - HAZARDOUS CH EMICALS LISTED UNDER THE WAC WASHINGTON VERTICAL STANDARD A number of chemicals are listed in the WAC as \"regulated hazardous chemicals\"; Table 2 -12. There are additional requirements for these chemicals; if your research creates exposure potential for one or more of these chemicals, reach out to EH&S for help in achieving compliance with the specific standard. Additional information is available under Specific Chemical Hazards (https:// www.ehs.washington.edu /chemical/specific- chemical -hazards) and Asbestos and (https:// www.ehs.washingto n.edu/workplace/asbestos- and-other - regulated- building -materials) webpages.

HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL WASTE RESPONSIBILITIES Hazardous chemical waste must be managed properly. The responsibilities of the laboratory worker and of EH&S for hazardous waste are as follows: 1. Laboratory Workers If laboratory workers generate chemical waste, they must be able to determine whether their chemical wastes are hazardous by using the guidelines in this chapter or by filling out a Waste Evaluation Request (https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/waste -evaluation -request -88). For hazardous waste, they must identify the hazards of the waste and follow accumulation rules, which include labeling, storage , and handling requirements. They must know how to request collection of hazardous waste by EH&S, as well as the rules for disposal of chemicals and contaminated items to trash and sanitary sewer. They must prevent the accumulation of legacy chemicals and inherently waste -like chemicals (defined in this section) by cleaning out their chemical inventory on a regular basis. Training is required and is available through EH&S in both classroom and online format . Refer t o www.ehs.washington.edu/training for more information. 2. UW EH&S Environmental Programs EH&S Environmental Programs (EP) collects hazardous waste and manages its prop er disposal. EH&S provides guidance and training for laboratory workers on proper hazardous waste management. B. WHAT QUALIFIES AS HAZARDOUS WASTE? A chemical or chemical mixture that exhibits any corrosive, flammable, toxic, reactive and/or persistent in the environment properties is, by legal definition, hazardous. At the UW, some additional chemicals are managed as hazardous waste because they are carcinogenic. To determine if your chemical is hazardous, use your knowledge, the chemical's original label and/or the chemical's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) to determine if the waste is corrosive, flammable, toxic, reactive, persistent in the environment and/or mutagenic or carcinogenic, as defined in the below sub -sections. 1. Flammable/Ignitable A waste chemical is flammable if it is one of the following: A liquid with a flash point less than 140 \u00b0F (e.g., ethanol, xylene , or diethyl ether). The flash point is defined as \"the lowest temper ature at which a chemical can form an ignitable mixture with air\" (by evaporating above an open beaker, for example.) The SDS typically includes information about the flash point if the chemical has one. (Note: the hazardous waste designation of \"Flammable \" includes not only those classified as flammable per NFPA as described in Section 2.D.3 , but also those classified as \"Class II Combustible.\") A solid or gas capable, under standard temperature and pressure, of causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes and burns so vigorously and persistently that it creates a hazard. A solid, liquid, or gas that evolves oxygen at room temperature or under slight heating (e.g ., peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, nitrates, and permanganates.) Page 72 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 2. Corrosive A waste chemical is corrosive if it has a pH of less than 2 or greater than 12.5 (Note: a chemical is not allowed to be poured down the d rain if it has a pH of less than 5.5 or greater than 12 - Refer to B.8 below.) 3. Reactive A waste chemical is reactive if it is one of the following: A normally unstable compound that readily undergoes violent change ( e.g., acrylonitrile, butyl hydroperoxide). When mixed with water, the chemical reacts violently, forms potentially explosive mixtures, or generates toxic gases in sufficient quantities to present a danger to human health (e.g., sodium metal, chloropropionyl chloride). The compound c ontains cyanides or sulfides that, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, could generate toxic gases in sufficient quantities to endanger human health ( e.g., sodium sulfide, arsenic sulfide). 4. Toxic a. Toxicity Categories Toxicity is based upon the LC 50 (concentration of substance required to kill 50% of the tested population) for fish or the LD 50 (dose amount of substance required to kill 50% of the tested population) for rats. This information is usually listed on a chemical's SDS. Table 3-1 lists five categories of toxicity: X, A, B, C, and D; the X category (Tox -X) is the most toxic. If data is available for more than one toxicity test, use the data showing the severest toxicity. Table 3 -1 Chemical Waste Toxicity Categories Toxic Category Fish LC 50 (ppm) Oral (rat) LD 0.02 - <0.2 2 - <20 B 0.1- < 1.0 5 - <50 0.2 - <2 20 - <200 C 1.0- <10.0 50 - <500 - <20 200 - <2,000 D 10.0 - 100.0 500 - 5,000 20 - 200 2,000 - 20,000 Page 73 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Chemical waste that qualifies for any of these categories is hazardous waste. Chemical waste that qualifies for toxic categories X, A, or B is extremely hazardous waste and is subject to additional requirements, such as a maximum waste accumulation volume of one quart ( refer to the below). Chemical waste with toxicity below the D category is not regulated as toxic but may still be managed as hazardous waste if it is carci nogenic/mutagenic. For mixtures, such as diluted wastes and wastes containing more than one constituent, an Equivalent Concentration (EC) for the mixture must be calculated to determine the toxicity level of the mixture. If the EC is greater than or equal to 0.001%, the waste is toxic. The formula for the EC is: For example, a mixture of 0.01% aldrin (toxic category A), 1.0% endrin (toxic category A), 4.0% benzene (toxic category D), 2.0% phenol (toxic category C) and 5% dinoseb (toxic category B) in water (nontoxic) exceeds the toxicity: If you are not confident enough or willing to use the above equation to determine whether your chemical mixture is toxic, please fill out and submit a Waste Evaluation Request found online at www.ehs.washi ngton.edu/resource/waste- evaluation -request -88. EH&S staff will then evaluate your waste and advise you on proper disposal of your chemical (s). b. EPA P -Listed Hazardous Waste EPA P -listed chemicals have especially acute toxicity hazards, and because of this, more stringent requirements when disposed of as hazardous waste. Refer to Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-303 for specific information, such as the P -listed chemicals, at https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.asp x?cite=173 -303. Contact EH&S at 206 .616.5835 for updated information. A waste is regulated under the EPA P -list if the chemical waste is unused (in cluding prepared solutions) and the listed chemical is the sole active ingredient of the product. Active ingredients are those that perform the function of the product, regardless of the concentration of those ingredients. Ingredients used as preservatives, solvents, stabilizers, and adjuncts are not active ingredients unless that is the function of the product. Examples of the criteria in practice are as follows: Sodium azide is the sole active ingredient in some broad -spectrum pesticides; these pesticides would be P -listed acute hazardous wastes if disposed of unused. Some automotive airbag activators contain ferric oxide as an oxidizer, in addition to sodium azide as a propellant - both are active ingredients. These activators would not be P -listed wastes when disposed of because the sodium azide was not the sole active ingredient. Some pregnancy test strips contain sodium azide as a preservative. These strips would not be P -listed wastes when disposed of because sodium azide is not an active ingredient. Page 74 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Requirements for P -listed wastes include: Container size: W hen collecting P -listed chemicals as waste, the volume of the hazardous waste container must not exceed one quart (approximately one liter). Empty containers: Empty containers that held P -listed chemicals must also be disposed of as hazardous waste; they a re not allowed to be washed or re-used. Contaminated materials: Disposable materials that become contaminated with P - listed chemicals ( e.g., gloves, weighing boats, etc.) must be disposed of as hazardous waste; non -disposable materials must be triple - rinsed, or rinsed three times to remove the contamination - this rinsate must be collected as hazardous waste. Materials contaminated with P - listed chemicals may not be washed or re- used until they have been triple - rinsed. For the Federal listing of EPA P- listed chemicals , Persistent chemicals do not biodegrade quickly in the environment. There are two main categories of persistent chemicals, described below: c. Halogenated Organic Compounds A halogenated organic compound (HOC) is a molecule that includes one or more atoms of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. When a waste mixture contains one or more halogenated organic compounds, the total halogenated organic compound concentration is determined by summing the concentration percentages of each halogenated organic compound. If a waste mixture contains more than 0.01% HOC, the waste is persistent and t herefore hazardous. For example, a waste contains 0.009% carbon tetrachloride, 0.012% DDT, and 0.020% 1,1,1 -trichloroethylene. The total halogenated organic compounds concentration calculation indicates the mixture is persistent, as follows: Total HOC Conc entration = a waste contains one or more of these PAHs, determine the total concentration by summing the co ncentration percentages of each regulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If the waste contains more than 1% PAHs, the waste is persistent and therefore hazardous. For example, a waste contains 0.08% chrysene and 1.22% 3,4 - benzo[a]pyrene. The total poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentration calculation demonstrates the mixture is persistent as follows: Total PAH Concentration = 0.08% + 1.22% = 1.30% 5. Carcinogenic The Washington Department of Ecology briefly regulated chemical wastes that are suspected or known to be carcinogenic. However, these rules were challenged and the Department of Ecology Page 75 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL retracted the rules. EH&S nevertheless strongly encourages you to manage chemical waste that is carcinogenic or mutagenic as if it were hazardous waste, even if it is not toxic according to the definition above, which accounts for acute and immediate toxic ity. An example of chemical waste management/disposal of carcinogens/reproductive hazards is at the EH&S web page Chemotherapy and Other Hazardous Drugs : www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical /chemotherapy -hazardous -drugs. 6. Waste Evaluation Request If you are unsure whether your waste is hazardous, please submit a Waste Evaluati on request found online at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/waste- evaluation -request -88. Fill out all information completely and attach the SDS(s) for the chemical(s). EH&S staff will evaluate your waste stream and advise you on proper disposal. C. HAZARDOUS WASTE ACCUMULATION RULES Follow the below rules for hazardous chemical waste accumulation: 1. Approp riate Containers All wastes must be stored at the point of generation. You may not generate your waste in one room and move it to another. In a large , shared space it would be acceptable to have one location for waste storage. Accumulate waste in an approp riate container compatible with the waste. You may reuse containers, even containers that were used for other chemicals, if they have been rinsed and the original labels have been defaced (note that the rinseate may be hazardous waste according to the definitions in Section 3.B, above.) The Empty Chemical Containers Focus Sheet provides guidance to dispose of or reuse chemical containers in accordance with hazardous waste regulations. www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/empty -chemical -containers -122 Containers designed for solid chemicals should not be used for liquids. Use only containers that show no sign of damage or deterioration. You must use containers wi th screw top closures. Waste containers must remain closed, except when you are adding waste. Use spring -loaded funnels for adding waste frequently to waste containers. Syringes, vials, or small items containing chemicals should be placed in secondary cont ainment for collection. Finally, do not fill the containers completely. Each container should not be more than \u00be full to allow for pressure changes due to changes in temperature. Request collection of your waste ahead of time to avoid overfilling your containers. 2. Hazardous Waste Labels Label the container using the Hazardous Waste Label found on our website (Figure 3 -1) at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/UWHazardousWasteLabel -four-same.pdf Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 76 of 261 December 5, 2022 Figure 3 -1 Hazardous Waste Label Fill out the pdf label completely, including percentages of constituents, the hazards of the waste, and contact name. If you do not know the hazards of your chemical, use the MSDS of the chemical to determine what they are. Do not date the container or label. Deface or remove any original labels remaining on the container to avoid confusion about the identity of the waste. Hazardous waste labels are available online at https:// www.ehs.washington.e du/system/files/resources/UWHazardousWasteLabel -four-same.pdf. Waste must be under the control of the individual(s) generating the waste. The waste should be in a physically safe area ( e.g., not on a windowsill.) Waste chemicals may be stored with unused chemicals as long as the containers are properly labeled , and your laboratory personnel know the storage location. Do not accumulate large amounts of waste in the fume hood. Use flammable liquid storag e cabinets for flammable waste over ten gallons in volume. Store waste away from emergency equipment, such as safety showers and emergency access panels; do not block exits. Do not store the waste near or in sinks. If the waste is stored in an area that dr ains to a floor drain, the waste must be in secondary containment. 3. Segregation Segregate regulated chemical waste by chemical compatibility. Refer to the segregation guidelines in Section 2 of this manual. Use secondary containment (tubs, basins , or buckets) for segregation of incompatible wastes accumulated in the same area. 4. Accumulation Volume Limits Accumulate no more than 200 liters (55 gallons) of chemical waste per waste stream or one liter (one quart) of extremely hazardous waste per waste stream. Chemical waste must not be stored for more than one year. Leave some head space (at least one inch) in each container to allow for pressure changes due to changes in tempe rature. Page 77 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Extremely hazardous waste is waste that is highly toxic, and the one- liter limit is designed to limit risk, especially in the event of a spill. Refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/safety -data -sheets- sdss for how to determine whether your waste is extremely hazardous waste. Any type of flammable chemical (including waste) cannot exceed the limits specified by the controlling fire department. For example, in Seattle, for class IA flammables (which include ethers and other very flammable solvents) the total volume of allowed flammables is limited to 60 gallons per control area in a sprinkler building, and 30 gallons in a non -sprinkler building. Contact EH&S at 206.685.0341 with qu estions about control areas and volume limits if you accumulate large amounts of flammable hazardous waste. 5. Large Containers (Drums) If you are accumulating waste in containers greater than five gallons in volume, make sure the drums are in good condition, and are approved by Department of Transportation (DOT) for highway - mode transportation. If the drums were initially shipped to you, they are likely DOT -approved. Drums containing liquids must have ten centimeters of air space between the liquid surface a nd the lid. Collection must be requested before the drum is full, especially in the case of 55 - gallon drums. 6. Inherently Waste -like Chemicals Inherently waste -like chemicals include expired chemicals, chemicals in deteriorating containers and chemicals that appear to be, or are, unusable. State inspectors may issue fines or infractions for inherently waste -like chemicals in your laboratory. Do not keep chemicals past their expiration date and conduct cleanouts when doing your annual chemical inventory updat e. Please also Refer to the section on legacy chemicals in Section 3.G.3 (below). D. HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION REQUESTS 1. Hazardous Waste Collection Overview EH&S collects hazardous chemical waste from all UW campuses and UW owned and operated facilities. This service is covered by overhead on research grants. Properly labeled and identified chemical waste is collected free of charge. There are about 4,000 laboratories on and near the Seattle campus. Therefore, EH&S may only be near your area once every week or every other week. Approximate collection time is two- to-four weeks at UW Seattle and on a set schedule at other locations. To avoid problems, plan ahead and request collection b efore your containers are full. 2. Collection Requests - One -Time Request collection of your waste in one of two ways: Submit a Chemical Waste Collection Request found online at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/hazardous -chemical -waste -disposal. Submit a collection request from your MyChem inventory. 3. Routine Collection Requests Wastes generated on a regular basis may be set up as routine collections. For routine collections, EH&S assigns your chemical waste a routine number. To request pickup, enter your routine number and waste volume in an online form. EH&S tracks what your waste is and where you are located. If you have a routi ne waste number and want to request a pickup, fill out and send the Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 78 of 261 December 5, 2022 Routine Chemical Waste Collection Request at www.ehs.washington.edu/secure/routine- chemical - waste- collection- request. If you have any questions about whether your waste is routine, email chmwaste@uw.edu or call 206.616.5835. 4. Waste Cleanouts If you are moving or cleaning out your workplace and will need EH&S to collect a large volume of chemical waste, here are some guidelines: If you think you have more than 100 containers of waste, call 206.616.0595 to arrange a cleanout appointment at least one month before your deadline. For fewer than 100 containers, fill out and send copies of the Chemical Waste Collection Request found at https:// www. ehs.washington.edu/chemical/hazardous -chemical - waste- disposal. Place completed UW Hazardous Waste Labels on each waste container (not needed for containers with an original label and original contents). Refer to Section 3 .C.2. Consider the MyChem Chemical Exchange for your unwanted but useable chemicals (useable chemicals are unexpired and preferably unopened). Remember to update your chemical inventory in MyChem at www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/mychem 5. What Happens to Hazardous Waste? EH&S has a Waste Minimization Program that reuses, recycles , and treats more than 50% of the total waste generated at the University of Washington. Reuse, recycling, and treatment takes place both in laboratories and at the EH&S hazardous waste facility. Some waste streams, like batteries, paint and oil are sent offsite for recycling by contractors. For more information, Refer to the Waste Minimization subsection below or visit : www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/pollution - prevention. All hazardous waste at the University of Washington that is not reused, recycled, or treated is sent to permitted hazardous waste recycling and disposal facilities. Flammable waste is used as an alternative fuel to incinerate hazardous waste. Most of the o ther waste streams are incinerated at a high temperature. A few waste streams are placed in permitted hazardous waste landfills. E. TRASH DISPOSAL Non -hazardous solid chemicals can go in the trash. Irritants, sensitizers and known, probable, or suspected carcinogens cannot go in the trash. Deface labels, bag , and label non -toxic chemicals as \"non -hazardous.\" Liquids and pressurized containers, like n on-empty aerosol cans, can never go in the trash. Uncontaminated and slightly contaminated items such as gloves, paper towels and empty containers can go in the trash. EH&S recommends double bagging and labeling these items as non - hazardous if there is ev idence of contamination. Manage very contaminated items, such as spill cleanup materials, as hazardous waste. In addition, empty containers for extremely toxic chemical Page 79 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL are hazardous waste unless you triple rinse them and dispose of th e rinseate as hazardous waste. 1. Trash Disposal of Chemicals The following are prohibited in the trash because of their chemical or physical hazards: Hazardous chemical waste as defined earlier in this section Known, probable or suspected carcinogens, irrita nts, and sensitizers (* Refer to current SDS to determine if chemical is any of these) Free liquids of any type Pressurized vessels (including non -empty aerosol cans) Laboratory glass and sharps Radioactive waste Batteries Mercury (including thermometers) Biohazardous waste To throw away chemicals that are not prohibited in the trash, deface any labels, securely double bag it, and label it \"non- hazardous\" so that custodial staff know it is safe for them to handle the trash. 2. Trash Disposal of E mpty Chemical Containers Empty chemical containers may still contain enough chemicals in them to present a hazard to custodial staff. On the other hand, it can be difficult to completely empty a container. The legal interpretation of the word \"empty\" ackno wledges this difficulty. A container is legally empty when both of the following are true: Contents have been removed by normal, such as inverting and draining, shaking, scraping, or scooping. No more than three percent of the contents remain If the chemic al is extremely hazardous waste or a pesticide marked with danger or warning labels, then the container must be triple rinsed before it is legally empty. The rinseate from this process is also considered hazardous waste by law. For the definition of extrem ely hazardous wastes, refer to Appendix B. If your chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen, EH&S strongly recommends that you triple rinse the container. Exceptions : Dispose of P- listed empty chemical containers as hazardous waste. Dispose of chemotherapy/hazardous drug empty chemical containers as trace chemotherapy waste. It is illegal to dispose of hazardous waste by leaving non -empty containers of chemicals in the fume hood, or elsewhere, to evaporate the chemical. If you choose to dispose of the empty container, do the following: 1. Dry the empty container, preferably in a fume hood; ensure that there are no sources of heat or open flame in the fume hood when drying containers that contained flammable chemicals. 2. With a pen or marker, cross out the labels on the container. 3. Leave the container uncapped; throw the cap away separately.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 80 of 261 December 5, 2022 4. If the container fits , place if in the trash can; if it does not fit place it next to the trash. 5. Do not leave empty containers in public areas ( such as hallways or loading docks ) unless you have made an agreement with Custodial Services or EH&S for pickup services. Consider reusing the empty container for accumulation of waste for that same chemical or other compatible chemicals. If you reuse a container, deface , or remove the label on the container and then fill out and affix a hazardous waste label to the container. Defacing and labeling are required by law and help others in your workplace know that the container contains hazardous waste and not the original chemical. Refer to the empty container recycling guidelines on the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/empty - chemical -containers -122. Do not recycle g lass or plastic containers that contained chemicals unless approved by EH&S. (Recycled glass and plastic are used for beverage and food containers, so the recycling industry cannot accept any that held chemicals). 3. Trash Disposal of Contaminated Items Used gloves and other commonly used items (besides empty containers) can be placed in the trash if they are not grossly contaminated with hazardous chemicals. If you have an item that is grossly contaminated, dispose of it as hazardous chemical waste. Examples of grossly contaminated items include used spill clean -up materials, items such as gloves and equipment contaminated from a spill and used equipment that contains hazardous chemical residue. EH&S encourages you to collect items that look like they mig ht be contaminated by chemicals, such as weighing papers and gloves, in bags and then label the bags \"non -hazardous waste\" before you place them in the trash. Custodial staff members are sometimes understandably nervous when handling laboratory trash; a wh ite residue or a few drops of water in the trash could be a dangerous chemical. Taking an extra step to bag these items can be a nice gesture. Custodians may refuse to collect trash that appears to contain hazardous items. If they refuse to collect trash, they will leave a Notice of Improper Waste Disposal Practices form (UoW 1970). Once corrections are made, they will collect the trash. Exceptions: Dispose of P -listed chemically contaminated items as hazardous waste. Dispose of chemotherapy/hazardous drug contaminate items as hazardous waste. F. DISCHARGES TO THE SANITARY SEWER Please complete and submit the Waste Evaluation Request to see if a specific chemical or waste stream is appropriate to sink discharge. If not, that same form can be used to complete a waste determination an d disposal options. King County Industrial Waste establishes rules that determine what can be poured down the sink. These are sometimes more stringent than Hazardous Waste rules. Please also refer to current permits or rules established by King County. All liquid wastes discharged to the sanitary sewer system must be approved under the current UW permit and local Sewer Discharge Limits. These are designed to protect surface waters, utility workers, and maintain the quality of bio- solids from wastewater treatment plants. 1. King County Local Sewer Discharge Limits Certain non -hazardous waste liquids can be discharged to the sanitary sewer. All discharges to the sanitary sewer need to meet site-specific limits and general conditions detailed in the current Page 81 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL permit. If chemically treated before discharge, records of this disposal must be kept as described in Section 3F.3 (below). Waste that qualifies as hazardous (according to the criteria in Section 3.B above) may not be sewer discharged. King County has published local disc harge limits for commonly used chemicals. These limits are on the King County website at https://kingcounty.gov/services/environment/wastewater/industrial -waste/limits -regulations/limits - prohibited.aspx. They apply only to UW Seattle, UW Bothell , and other sites within King County. 2. Outside King County If you are outside King County (Tacoma, Pa ck Forest , and Friday Harbor), local sewer limits have not been formally approved or permitted. Operators of some very small waste treatment plants allow chemical disposal only on a case -by-case basis to protect the treatment plant. You are therefore not allowed to pour any chemicals down the drain without explicit permission at this time. For more information and for assistance with obtaining permission to dispose of non -hazardous chemicals to sanitary sewer, call EH&S at 206 .685.3759 or email chmwaste@uw.edu. 3. Treating Hazardous Wastes Notify EH&S at 206 .616.5835 or chmwaste@uw.edu before treating hazardous waste. Please review the following web page for example treatment methods : www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/environmental -quality. You must keep a log of all hazardous wastes you have treated and provide it to EH&S upon request. An example chemical treatment log is online at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/chemlog.pdf 4. Soaps, Bleach and Acetone When washing glas sware or equipment, you will likely use chemicals such as detergents and standard household bleach, which may go down the sink drain. This is acceptable. Acetone may not go down the sink drain at any concentration. If you use acetone to rinse off items, you must collect any excess acetone in a securely capped, properly labeled waste container and dispose of it as hazardous waste ( refer to the hazardous chemical waste page for more information.) You may not store acetone squeeze bottles near the sink. Do not use chromate -based cleansers. There are many less toxic and non -carcinogenic alternative cleansers that work just as well. 5. Scintillation Fluids There are only three liquid scintillation cocktail products currently approved by the State of Washington Department of Ecology for disposal down the sanitary sewer. Refer to the Liquid Scintillation Focus Sheet for information: https:/ /www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/liquid - scintillation- -focus -sheet -139. They are soluble (or readily dispersible) in water and contain less than 10% no n-ionic surfactants. Other scintillation fluids may claim to be safer, but because they contain high concentrations of flammable surfactants, they are not approved for sewer disposal. 6. Dilution Prohibition It is illegal to dilute your chemical waste solely to meet sewer discharge limits. However, you may sewer waste such as equipment rinse water or any chemical treatment that you do as a normal part of cleaning up after an experiment, if it meets sewer discharge limits.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 82 of 261 December 5, 2022 G. CHEMICAL WASTES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN 1. Unknown Chemicals Without an accurate chemical name and concentration range, unknown or unidentified chemicals cannot be safely handled or disposed of. The best way to prevent unknowns is to label all chemical containers and make sure t hat the labels stay in good condition over time. If you have an unknown chemical, keep it where it is or store it temporarily in the fume hood, whichever you believe to be safer. Find out as much information as you can about the chemical by examining the c ontainer and interviewing anyone you think might know something about it. If that fails, complete an Online Chemical Waste Collection Request at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/hazardous - chemical -waste- disposal. Provide as much information about the w aste as possible, such as the history, physical properties and the results of any analysis performed on the unknown. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the disposal of an unknown chemical, email chmwaste @uw.edu or call 206 .616.5835. Identification analysis performed by the approved waste disposal contractor will cost the chemical user approximately $80 per unknown chemical. 2. Potentially Explosive Wastes Some common chemic als can become highly unstable explosives over time when stored improperly and cannot be collected as hazardous waste unless they have been deactivated and stabilized. The following segments highlight the most common of these troublesome chemicals. 3. Peroxid e-Forming Chemicals Peroxide -forming chemicals that have exceeded the manufacturer's expiration date, such as p - dioxane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and acetaldehyde, will not be collected for disposal until they have been tested for peroxides. These c hemicals must be managed correctly. For more information, refer to section 2.G.2.b and the EH&S Peroxide Forming Chemicals Management and Assessment Guidelines online at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/ehs- guidelines -peroxide - forming - chemicals -168. Chemicals containing more than 10 parts per million (ppm) per oxides must be deactivated before they will be collected by EH&S. Treatment methods are available through EH&S; email chmwaste@uw.edu to obtain more information. 4. Picric Acid and Ot her Polynitroaromatic Compounds Polynitroaromatic compounds are commonly used in laboratories and are safe in the form in which they are sold. They are ordinarily sold with three to 10 percent water added to stabilize them. However, they will become explosive if allowed to dry out. Dry polynitroaromatic compounds must be wet with 10% water before they can be collected by EH&S. a. Sodium Azide Sodium azide, although not inherently unstable, can form highly explosive heavy metal azides if contaminated or u sed improperly. Do not pour sodium azide into the sanitary sewer. Disposal of sodium azide solutions to the sewer can cause the formation of lead or copper azides in plumbing. Routine sewer disposal of sodium azide has caused several serious explosions. Page 83 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL b. Nitrocellulose Several nitrocellulose products, primarily paper and tubes, are used in some laboratories. Nitrocellulose burns vigorously in ambient conditions and may explode when heated under confinement. When completely dehydrated, it is considered a low -level explosive. As a result, these products should never be autoclaved for decontamination. Nitrocellulose products must be soaked in water before disposal through EH&S. 5. Legacy Chemicals Responsible Party's are required to completel y clean out laboratories before they leave, including all hazardous chemicals and waste ( refer to Section 10 , Moving In/Moving Out.) However, sometimes people leave without disposing of chemica ls properly. Legacy chemicals are those that are left behind by laboratory staff when they leave the University or move laboratories. They become the responsibility of the new space occupants. If you move into a laboratory that has legacy chemicals in it, you should tell your department administrator immediately. If your department, for whatever reason, cannot solve the problem, then these legacy chemicals are yours to manage. Unless you think that you will use them, arrange to request their collection as h azardous waste , and follow all waste accumulation rules, including hazard identification, labeling and segregation. H. HAZARDOUS WASTE MINIMIZATION On average, EH&S collects, and processes about 200,000 kg of hazardous chemical waste a year. EH&S has developed several programs to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be incinerated or landfilled. For the last several years, the UW reused, recycled , or treated about 40% of our hazardous chemical waste. This section outlines some of the basic elements of this effort and how you can participate. For an extensive and detailed list of hazardous waste services and resources, visit www.ehs.washington.edu/search?fulltext=hazardous+waste+services. Purchase only what you think you will use, especially if you're purchasing a hazardous chemical. Shop for free chemicals in the MyChem Chemical Exchange . For more information, visit the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.ed u/chemical/chemical -exchange. 1. Treatment and Recycling in the Laboratory You are encouraged to treat or recycle your own waste. EH&S staff are available to help you get started, and in some cases, offer free materials for recycling and treatment. Please visit www.ehs.washington .edu/environmental/pollution -prevention for more details. 2. Hazardous Materials Recycling Both EH&S and UW Recycling manage the recycling of materials that would otherwise be disposed of as hazardous waste. Visit www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/pollution -prevention for all the common (and sometimes uncommon) items recycled at the UW -- from batteries to computer monitors to elemental mercury to scrap metal. I. SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING Guidelines fo r recycling common non -chemical items in laboratories: 1. Paper and CardboardEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 84 of 261 December 5, 2022 EH&S encourages you to recycle boxes and packaging as soon as possible unless you have sufficient storage space. Storing boxes in aisles, in front of emergency equipment or exits, or necessary fire panels is illegal and dangerous. Paper, cardboard , and other common recyclables are managed by UW Recycling. For more information, refer to the UW Recycling's procedures webpage at: www.washington.edu/facilities/transportation/recyclingandsolidwaste/. 2. Plastic and Glass Plastic and glass chemical containers are not recyclable currently . The glass and plastic recycling industry uses recycled material to make food and beverage containers and bans chemical containers, even if rinsed clean, from their recycling streams. UW Recycling and the EH&S Environmental Programs Office are currently pursuing limited recycling for some laboratory plastics. 3. Packaging Materials UW Recycling also coordinates the recycling o f wooden pallets, packaging peanuts, plastic wrap, and other packaging materials. Styrofoam packaging is handled on a case -by-case basis. For more information , visit: https://facilities.uw.edu/catalog/disposal -guide. 4. Printer Cartridges Most types of printer cartridges and components can be recycled. For more information, visit www.washington.edu/facilities/building/recyclingandsolid waste/procedures/cartridges. 5. Batteries Battery collection is a joint effort by UW Recycling and EH&S Environmental Programs. Small amounts of batteries can be recycled through the eMedia system at https://facilities.uw.edu/bsd/procedures/emedia. Large volumes of batteries and large, heavy and/or unusual research or clinical batteries are handled two ways: a. One- Time Battery Collection To request a special collection of more than five pounds of batteries, fill out an online Chemical Waste Collection Request at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/ha zardous -chemical -waste- disposal, listing them as \"Batteries, mixed.\" b. Routine Battery Collection If you have a routine number, request a pickup with the online Routine Chemical Collection Request at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/hazardous- chemical -waste- disposal. 6. Metallic Lead Information for recycling lead can be on our website at https://facilities.uw.edu/bsd/procedures/metal. J. SHARPS, LAB GLASS AND PLASTIC The following are guidelines for the dis posal of sharps and lab glass: 1. Sharps Sharps are a regulated waste classification and must never be disposed of in the regular waste stream. The following are always sharps waste: Needles, including syringes with needles, and IV tubing with needles Page 85 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL attached Lancets Scalpel blades The following are sharps waste only if contaminated with biohazardous material (including recombinant or synthetic DNA/RNA): Broken glass Razor blades Fragile glass tubes, vials, or ampoules (including Pasteur pipettes) Glass slides and cover slips Sharps must be disposed in a red plastic sharps container which is leak proof, rigid and puncture - resistant. It must be labeled with a biohazard symbol and equipped with a tight -fitting lid for use during handling and transport. Various sizes of sharps containers are available from Biochemistry Stores and vendors. It is recommended to use several small containers that are accessible in the work area. Close and prepare a sharps container for decontam ination and disposal when 2/3 full. If a sharps container is punctured or has needles sticking out of it, the entire container must be placed inside a larger sharps container prior to treatment and disposal. Do not attempt to empty a sharps container that has been punctured. Refer to the EH&S web page www.ehs.washington.edu/biological/sharps- and-laboratory -glass for disposal instructions . All sharps containers must be decontaminated prior to disposal. Treatment and disposal options vary depending on your work location (e.g., Harborview, S outh Lake Union, Health Sciences , or other UW Seattle campus building locations). Refer to the information on www.ehs.washington.edu/biological/biohazardous -waste for decontamination of sharps containers . EH&S does not collect sharps containers. Check with your department to find out if a sharps disposal waste stream already exists. 2. Trace Chemo Sharps Sharps and empty containers used with chemotherapy and hazardous drugs must be disposed of as trace chemo sharps waste. \"Trace\" refers to empty containers or containers that have less than three percent of the original quantity of drug remaining, such as sharps, empty syringes, and vials. An empty container is one in which all contents have been removed by normal means such as aspiration, pouring or flushing. To determine if a dru g is classified as hazardous check the NIOSH List of Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Healthcar e Settings (2014) (www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014 -138/). Place sharps contaminated with chemotherapy (chemo) or hazardous drugs in a yellow sharps container with a biohazard symbol. Do not autoclave yellow trace chemo sharps containers. All trace chemo and hazardous drug waste generated at the University of Wash ington is collected and shipped off -site for disposal by incineration at a regulated facility. EH&S training and account set up is required. Mor e information is available on https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/specific - chemical -hazards/chemotherapy -hazardous -drugs.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 86 of 261 December 5, 2022 3. Biohazardous Glass and Plastic Items Biohazardous glass and plastic items include those contaminated with biohazardous material (including recombinant or synthetic DNA/RNA) that could puncture a plastic bag, such as: Syringes without needles Micropipette tips Serological pipettes Test tubes Swabs/sticks Other contaminated items (that do not fall under the sharps definitions and could puncture a biohazard bag) Biohazardous lab glass and plastic must be decontaminated prior to disposal. Contamin ated pipettes can be placed in a pipette box/keeper, while other biohazardous- contaminated glass or plastic items can go into a heavy cardboard box lined with a biohazard bag and labeled with the biohazard symbol. An EH&S poster showing examples of these boxes is at www. ehs.washington.edu/resource/packaging -sharps -and-lab-glass -waste- poster -92. 4. Lab Glass Lab glass waste (including plastic items) is defined as items that could puncture regular waste bags and endanger waste handlers and is not contaminated with a biohazardous material. This category never includes needles, lancets, scalpel blades or any other sharps. Examples of lab glass include: Broken glassware Empty chemical containers (test tubes, pipettes and pipette tips, and centrifuge tubes) Syringes without needles Pointed swabs and sticks Razor blades Fragile glass items (such as glass Pasteur pipettes, glass slides and cover slips). Package such lab glass waste in a sturdy cardboard box lined with plastic . The box should never weigh more than 25 pounds and clearly identify the PI name and room number/building. Seal the box with pre -printed lab glass tape or create your own tape using clear packaging tape over writing indicating \"lab glass.\" Lab glass boxes and tape can be purchased from the Chemistry stockroom or from vendors. Tape can also be purchased from Biochemistry stores. Place the sealed alongside the regular waste container for collection by Custodial Services. Never use a lab glass box for the disposal of chemicals, sharps, biohazardous materials, or liquid waste. K. INFECTIOUS OR BIOLOGICAL WASTE For infectious waste disposal requirements, refer to Section 4.F of the UW Biosafety Manual at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/uw- biosafety -manual For general information about infectious waste visit www.ehs.washington.ed u/biological/biohazardous -waste. Page 87 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL L. RADIOACTIVE WASTE For radioactive waste, refer to the UW Radiation Safety Manual , Section 14: Radioactive Waste, at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/radiation -safety -manual -521. M. MIXED WASTE Most mixed wastes consist of low -level radioactive wastes combined with hazardous materials. University of Washington policy, as w ell as state and federal law, prohibit the disposal of mixed waste. There is no means for disposing of mixed material. If a lab attempts to dispose of mixed waste, as either radioactive waste or chemical waste, the fines and penalties to the University of Washington will be severe and could result in a Cease- and-Desist Order . Fines and fees of up to $250,000 per year may be assessed against the University of Washington by federal and state agencies if mixed wastes were generated and/or stored on campus. Exceptions to the production of mixed waste include liquid scintillation cocktails, which can be legally shipped to a contract waste disposal vendor to be burned, and radioactive materials mixed with a hazardous component that can be neutralized or deactivate d in the laboratory. N. LIQUID SCINTILLATION COCKTAILS Several Liquid Scintillation Cocktail (LSC) manufacturers now produce non -hazardous fluids, some marketed as being sanitary sewer disposable. There are currently only a few LSCs approved for sanitary sewer disposal by the State of Washington. For more information refer to the focus sheet at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/liquid -scintillation -fluid -focus -sheet -139. O. ANIMALS AND ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS Special consideration is needed when disposing of dead animals, animal body parts/tissues, animal bedding or animal waste. 1. Contaminated Animals and Animal By-Products Animals and animal by -products contaminated by infectious agents, radioactive materials, highly toxic chemicals or stored in fixatives require special disposal procedures. Contact EH&S at 206.221.7770 for disposal guidance. 2. Non -Contaminated Animals and Animal By-Products Some non -contaminated animals and animal by -products may be disposed of as municipal waste. Contact the Facility Manager at the UW Department of Comparative Medicine at 206 .543.0641 to receive instruction on correct procedures, and/or make arrangements to deliver the whole carcass to them for disposal. P. GAS CYLINDERS Gas cylinders used on campus must be either rented or purchased from the preferred supplier, Praxair, if possi ble. This ensures the cylinders can be properly disposed of and have a return authorization program for unused gas. As applicable, gas cylinders should be marked FULL / PARTIAL / EMPTY and returned to the supplier. Shipping cylinders that are not empty req uire shipping precautions as described on the compressed gas webpage at www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/compressed -gas-cryogenic -fluids. Any non -returnable cylinder must be disposed of through EH&S. Cost of disposal will be charged to the purchaser. Any abandoned cylinders will be recharged to the associated department. Cylinders or lecture bottles containing an unknown substance must be analyzed prior to disposal. Currently, the cost of analysis on an unknown cylinder is approximately $1,6 00 per cylinder, paid by the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 88 of 261 December 5, 2022 If the cylinder contains an atmospheric gas, then remove the valve. For empty propane cylinders, remove the valve stem with a valve stem removal tool . Refer to the Chem Waste Guide for FS for more information: www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/chemical- waste -guide -facilities -services -566. For assistance with the disposal of gas cylinders, complete and submit a Waste Evaluation Request at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/waste -evaluation -request -88 or email chmwaste@uw.edu.

EMERGENCY EYEWASHES AND SHOWERS Emergency washing equipment is required when using corrosives (acids and caustics), strong irritants (which cause inflammatory effects upon contact) and toxic materials that can be absorbed through the skin. Emergency washing facilities must be accessible (unobstructed) and personnel should be able to reach the equipment within 10 seconds (not more than 50 feet and perhaps closer if access is through a normally closed door). Equipment must be always accessible without requiring a key or overcoming other sec urity safeguards. 1. Eyewash Stations If chemicals can cause eye damage and are used in such a way that they may splash into eyes, an eyewash station is required. Laboratory personnel must be able to reach eyewash stations within ten seconds. The eyewash should be within 50 feet of where chemicals are being used, although this distance should be less if doors interfere with access. Always maintain clear paths to eyewash stations. Chemicals can cause blindness or instant pain which can make it very difficult for someone to find the eyewash on their own in an emergency. Laboratory personnel should know the location and operation of the eyewash stations in their area. It is recommended that personnel practice locating the eyewash station while keeping their eyes closed. If possible , don't work alone when working with these chemicals. Eyewashes must be flushed weekly by laboratory staff to ensure they are operating correctly and the flushing must be documented, in accordance with Washington Administrativ e Code (WAC) 296 - 800-15035 (https://apps.l eg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -800). Weekly flushing checks that eyewashes work and provide a strong enough stream of water to reach the eyes of someone bending over it and help keep the water clean. During the weekly check, the eyewash should be oper ated long enough (30 -60 seconds), so that there is no visible rust or contaminant in the water. If the eyewash is located in a shared area, an individual should be appointed to perform the weekly test. 2. Safety Showers Laboratory personnel should know the lo cation and use of the emergency showers in their area and be able to reach showers in ten seconds. Always keep the area underneath the shower and the path to the emergency shower clear. Safety showers are tested annually by Facilities Services. A tag indic ating the most recent test date should be found on the equipment. Contact Facilities Services (Appendix F) if a test or maintenance is needed. 3. Deluge Hoses Deluge hoses should be replaced with dual eyewash stations. Deluge hoses are not acceptable alternat ives to an eyewash or safety shower. They can be used for washing glassware and other materials. If your lab has a drench hose without a dual eyewash present and an eyewash is needed, submit a UW Facilities work request to have a dual eyewash installed. Co ntact EH&S at 206.543.7388 if you have questions. B. FIRE SAFETY EQUIPMENT 1. Fire ExtinguisherEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 92 of 261 December 5, 2022 a. Proper Use Portable fire extinguishers are provided in University buildings and are available for use by trained personnel. All laboratory personnel should be trained to use the type(s) of fire extinguishers that are present in the laboratory. Training classes are av ailable through EH&S. Register online at www.ehs.washington.edu/training. Individuals who have been trained in the principles of fire extinguisher use and the hazards involved may attempt to extinguish small (trash can or smaller) and early -stage fires if there is an escape route. Individuals not trained in the proper use of extinguishers should not attempt to use one during a fire. Doing so could put them and others in danger. Fire extinguishers should be conspicuously located, wall mounted, and easily accessible. They may not be obstructed or obscured from view by equipment or other items stored in the lab. b. Types of Extinguishers The fire extinguishers available to the laboratory staff should be selected based on the materials inside or outside the lab. (Refer to Table 4 -1 for the list of fire classes). Table 4 -1 Classes of Fir es and Proper Fire Extinguishers Class of Fire Description Proper Extinguisher A Ordinary combustibles such as wood, cloth, and paper Dry Chemical (ABC) or water B Flammable liquids such as gasoline, oil, and oil- based paint Carbon Dioxide (BC) or Dry Chemical (ABC) C Energized electrical equipment including wiring, fuse boxes, circuit breakers, machinery, and appliances Carbon Dioxide (BC) or Dry Chemical (ABC) D Combustible metals (e.g., Na, Mg) Special Extinguisher (D) University laboratories using hazardous chemicals should have an ABC rated dry chemical fire extinguisher located within 50 feet of the hazard, either along the exit path from the laboratory or in the hallway adjacent to the laboratory. Many fire extinguishers on cam pus are ABC, which perform well on most fires with one major exception: combustible metal fires. Combustible metal (Class D) extinguishers are not typically provided for laboratories unless needed. Laboratories also may request a CO 2 extinguisher (Class BC ). It is not as effective as a dry chemical extinguisher but will require less clean up after use. c. Maintenance On the Seattle campus, extinguishers are certified annually by Facilities Services as part of the routine building maintenance. If an extinguishe r needs to be refilled, contact Facilities Services at 206 .685.1900. To request additional or alternative extinguishers, contact EH&S at 206 .685.0341. For repair or replacement of fire extinguishers at Bothell or Tacoma campuses, please refer to Appendix F . Page 93 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Automatic fire suppression systems are found in a decreasing number of fume hoods and are being removed as equipment is replaced. Fire hoses may only be used by fire department personnel. Fire blankets are not recommended for labor atory use because they may trap heat in when a victim has burning clothes and cause more injury than would otherwise occur. 2. Flammable Liquid Storage Cabinets Flammable liquid storage cabinets are required if you are storing over ten gallons of flammable liquids. Flammable liquid storage cabinets are not fireproof. Cabinets are designed to protect the contents from extreme temperatures for a limited time only. Cabinets must not block egress and cannot be located above sinks or drains. They should not be vent ed unless necessary to protect from other hazards such as toxicity. Contact EH&S at 206.685.0341 for further information on flammable liquid storage cabinets. a. UL listed Flammable liquids should be stored in an Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) listed flammable liquid storage cabinet outfitted with approved automatic or self- closing doors. All new cabinets must have UL listing or be constructed per the fire code. (Note: Some existing wooden cabinets not UL listed are still in service and approved for us e.) b. Label Cabinets must be labeled \"Flammable - Keep Fire Away\". c. Capacity Do not overfill cabinets \u2014check manufacturer's recommendations for storage limits. d. Bottles All bottles should be placed on the shelves, never stacked. Keep all containers tightly closed. e. Containers Only containers designed for flammable liquid storage may be used. Never use makeshift containers, such as a plastic cup, even for short -term or temporary storage. f. Incompatible Chemicals Do not store incompatible chemicals in these cabinets. g. cabinet doors Cabinet doors should never be propped open unless the mechanism is a designed part of an approved cabinet. h. Unapproved Storage The tops of cabinets are not storage shelves. Do not store combustible materials on or beside flammable liquid storage cabinets. 3. Flammable Storage Refrigerators Flammable chemicals, or chemical mixtures that need to be stored below room temperature, must be stored in UL listed flammable material storage refrigerators or freezers. These refrigerators and freezers are specifically designed by the manufacturer to have non -sparking interiors. Explosion - proof refrigerators are designed to prevent ig nition of flammable vapors or gases that may beEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 94 of 261 December 5, 2022 present inside but also outside the refrigerator. This type of refrigerator must be used in locations such as solvent dispensing rooms, where a flammable atmosphere may develop at some time in the room. All laboratory refrigerators and freezers must be prominently labeled with a warning sign indicating whether it can be used for flammable or non -flammable storage. For these warning signs or information regarding a flammable storage refrigerator purchase, cont act EH&S at 206.685.0341. For more information on flammable storage refrigerators , refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/lab -refrigerators -and-freezers- 517. C. LABORATORY SIGNS A list of required signs is provided in the following table and explanatory material is described in the following paragraphs. Table 4 -2 Safety Related Signs Safety -Related Required Signs Refer to Paragraph Lab Caution Sign 4.C.1 Emergency/Safety Equipment Location Signs 4.C.4 Hazards Warning Signs 4.C.5 \"Natural Gas Emergency Shut Off Valve\" (*Must be posted if a valve is present.) 4.C.6 \"Laboratory Water - Do Not Drink\" (*Must be posted on non -potable water outlets.) 4.C.7 1. Lab Caution Sign A standard U niversity Lab Caution Sign is required to be posted in a Plexiglas holder above or near the room number placard at each lab entrance that has a door or barrier. The purpose of the sign is to warn emergency responders and visitors of potential hazards in the lab and to meet multiple regulatory requirements. Lab caution sign holders are provided by EH&S. The signs are printed out and updated by lab personnel using a tool in MyChem. It is the responsibility of the lab personnel (PI, Lab Manager, CHO, etc.) to update th e signs if significant changes occur in chemical inventories, entry requirements, hazardous materials authorizations , or lab contacts. The lab caution sign consolidates signage requirements for National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 704 Hazardous Materials (https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/envhs/documents/Lab -Safety/NFPA- Labeling - Information.pdf), biohazardous and radioactive materials authorization, entry requirements, food and drink prohibitions a nd lab contact information. There are two kinds of caution signs - room signs and s uite signs. Post a sign at each entrance to areas or rooms with multiple entrances and show the same information on each sign. Rooms within a room (or rooms accessible only from another room ) are considered part of a suite. Post a s uite sign at each main/primary entrance, and post r oom signs at the entrances of the inner rooms. List all room numbers on the s uite sign. Within a suite, only rooms that have a door and are used as lab spaces need a r oom sign. Alcove spaces, open benches, and corridors within a suite that are identified with a room number do not get their own r oom sign. All labs that have spaces/alcoves/corridors/inner rooms which are part of a suite must identify each space/alcove/corridor/inner room by room number on the s uite sign for that suit e. The inventories Page 95 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL of all the spaces and rooms within the suite are combined and reflected on the s uite sign for the suite they are part of via the Caution Sign Tool in MyChem. Suites within a suite will not be listed on the same caution signs. Any rooms which are not used for chemical or wet lab work but are still lab spaces (procedure room, microscope room, autoclave room, etc) should have a caution sign, even if the chemical diamond shows only zeros and no PPE is required. An example of the sign shown in (Figure 4 -1 below). More information on the contents of the signs is available at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/caution -sign- hazards. Figure 5 -1 Example Laboratory Caution Sign 2. Emergency Procedures for Laboratories Laboratories should post copies of the Emergency Response and the Spill Response poste rs in easily visible locations for reference during an incident, accident, or emergency. Emergency contact numbers for the lab should be posted in the lab in a prominent locatio n. Provide numbers for PI and lab personnel to be called in case of fire, accident, hazardous chemical spill, or another emergency. Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 96 of 261 December 5, 2022 3. Laboratory Floor Plan A floor plan showing evacuation route(s), as well as spill kit, fire extinguisher and other safety equipment locations should be included in the Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) and posted prominently in the laboratory (refer to Appendix C for example laborator y floor plan). If particularly hazardous substances are used in a designated area, the floor plan showing the designated area is mandatory. 4. Emergency/Safety Equipment Location Signs Signs must be posted identifying the location of exits, safety showers, eyewash stations, fire extinguishers, first aid equipment, flammable storage cabinets and other safety equipment. Contact Facilities Services at careteam@uw.edu to post t hese signs. 5. Hazards Warning Signs Warning signs and labels should be posted in areas or on equipment where hazards exist, such as biohazards , lasers, ultraviolet light, radiofrequency, magnetic fields, X -ray radiation, radioactive materials, high voltage, restricted access or particularly hazardous substance control areas when the hazard is present. These signs may be mandatory depending on the degree of hazard (or as listed on local codes). Contact EH&S at 206.543.7262 for information on hazard signs. 6. Natural Gas Emergency Shut Off Valve If the laboratory has an emergency shut -off valve for gas supply systems, post a sign indica ting its presence. 7. Laboratory Water - Do Not Drink If a non -potable water system (lab water) has outlets in the laboratory, such outlets must have signs posted identifying that the \"water is not fit for drinking\". D. LABORATORY VENTILATION Washington State D epartment of Labor and Industries has set full shift (eight hour) and short -term (15 minutes) permissible exposure limits (PELs) for many chemicals to prevent adverse health effects in workers (refer to Section 5.A.1 ). Local exhaust ventilation systems (such as fume hoods) may be needed in order to control airborne contaminants and reduce exposure levels to acceptable limits. For assistance in measuring chemical exposures, contact EH&S at 206 .543.7388. 1. Laboratory Design a. Room Air Pressure Room air pressure should be negative to the hallway so that accidental releases are kept in the lab and not released into the hallway and the building. b. Vents Do not block or cover supply and exhaust vents. Occupant changes to lab ventilation may compromise the safety features of the laboratory and local exhaust systems such as fume hoods, biosafety cabinets, etc. 2. Fume Hoods A fume hood is ventilation equipment that vents separately from t he building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The primary means of controlling airborne chemical exposure is Page 97 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL a fume hood. Fume hoods should be used when working with toxic compounds or compounds with a boiling point below 120\u00b0C. (However, some aqueous solutions may be an exception to this rule.) It may be necessary to use a closed system, such as a glove box or bag, for highly hazardous chemical materials. EH&S maintains a roster of fume hood designs which have been approved for purchase. Refer to Purchasing a Fume Hood at www .ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/fume -hoods -use- inspection- and-maintenance. a. Fume Hood Use Training - Personnel using fume hoods should take the on-line training class : www.ehs.washington.edu/training/fume -hood -training -online. Verify Operation - Make sure the fume hood is operating before starting work. Some new fume hoods have monitoring devices that indicate acceptable working conditions. Otherwise, a strip of Kimwipe taped to the underside of the sash can be used as an indicator of air flow. S ince this strip may flutter, even when the air flow is inadequate, the strip should be placed, and its movement observed when you know that the air flow is proper \u2014such as at the same time that EH&S measures the air velocity . Exhaust Fan Speed - Some older buildings have fume hoods equipped with two -speed exhaust fans with local control at the hood. The low exhaust setting is only appropriate for storage. The high setting provides protection for working with chemicals. Minimize Cross Drafts and Eddy Currents - Air flow into the fume hood is adversely affected by cross drafts and eddy currents. Cross drafts occur when people walk in front of a fume hood or when nearby windows or doors are open. Eddy currents occur around the person using the fume hood and arou nd objects inside it. To limit these effects, fume hoods should not contain unnecessary objects and the slots within the fume hood, which direct air flow, must not be blocked. The slot at the rear of the work surface is essential for proper air movement. I f large pieces of equipment or large numbers of bottles are placed in front of the slot, they should be raised up on blocks or placed on a shelf to allow air to flow into the slot. Equipment should be placed as far to the back of the fume hood as practical , leaving six inches at the rear. Work should be performed at least six inches inside the fume hood opening to prevent cross drafts and eddy currents from pulling contaminated air out of the fume hood and into the room. Sliding Sashes - The sash should be kept as low as possible to improve overall performance of the hood. The more closed the sash is, the better protection from an unexpected chemical reaction. Procedures should be done with the sash at the level of the maximum approved sash height marking or lower. Use a separate safety shield, such as a face shield, when working with an open sash. Chemical Evaporation - It is illegal to evaporate chemicals in the hood to dispose of them. Any open apparatus used in hoods which emit large volumes of volatile chemicals should be fitted with condensers, traps, or scrubbers to contain and collect hazardous vapors or dusts. Storage - Do not store chemicals or supplies in the fume hood. Chemicals and supplies should be stored in approved cabinets. Flammable Liquid Vapor - Laboratory fume hoods are designed to reduce flammable vapors below lower explosive limits when properly operated and maintained. As an added Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 98 of 261 December 5, 2022 precaution, use only non -sparking and explosion proof electrical equi pment (hot plates Page 99 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL stirring plates, and centrifuges) in fume hoods where a large volume of flammable liquid vapor may be generated. Take care with flammable liquids and heat sources. Containers - All containers of chemicals must be securely capped when not in use. A rule is that containers should be open for minutes (at the most) - which is the maximum time it normally takes to pour a small amount of chemical into another container and replace the cap. All containers must be labeled with the chemical ide ntity and appropriate hazard warnings (or the material must be used up during the work period and be under continuous control of the researcher using it). b. Fume Hood Prep for Maintenance Prior to any maintenance of fume hoods the entire interior surfaces must be decontaminated and/or cleaned by the researchers using the hood (as described below in Section 4.G.2 Decontamination of Equipment for Service). Maintenance may require access to storage cabinets below or to the side of the hood. If access is required, the entire cabinet and adjacent area also needs to be emptied, decontaminated, cleaned and rinsed. Lab staff need to iden tify a contact for coordinating with Facilities Services regarding the work to be done. Refer to Section 4.G.2 for details and the required maintenance request form. c. Fume Hood Performance and Testing EH&S performs a functional performance test annually to assure hoods are performing as designed. If a hood fails, it may need to be taken out of service until repaired. EH&S will notify the researchers and post a \"Do Not Use\" sign if repair is required. Fume hoods can be tested using up to five functional performance criteria , depending upon the fume hood design. This includes face velocity, variable air volume (VAV) tracking, sound, and containment to monitor functionality. Specific performance measures for each test are outlined below. For more information, contact EH&S at 206.543.9510. d. Face Velocity Standard Flow Hoods: 80 - 120 Feet Per Minute (FPM) Sash height should not be less than 18 inches High -Performance Hoods: 60 - 84 FPM e. VAV Tracking The sash is lowered about 50% from the target sash height to assure the HVAC system responds appropriately to maintain optimal capture velocity. f. Sound Measure sound using a sound meter on Scale A with the sash optimized and the sound meter located about one foot from the front of the hood at 18 inches above the work surface (roughly ear level of the testing technician). The ambient sound level must be less than 80 dBA. g. Containment Test Use visual powder or dry ice; check for effective containment. h. Monitor Alarm Properly Functioning Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 100 of 261 December 5, 2022 Confirm monitor has power and is properly calibrated Raise sash to reduce face velocity below 80 LFM (60 LFM for low Page 101 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL - flow fume hoods) and to confirm that both visible and audible alarm s ignals function Test monitor's mute function by pressing the mute button Test the reset button Test Failure: Monitor fails to alarm, is more than 10 FPM out of calibration, fails any functional test, or is damaged i. Fume Hood Problems If you are having problems with your fume hood, contact EH&S at 206.685.0341. EH&S will troubleshoot the problem and may refer it to Facilities Services for repair. 7. Perchloric Fume Hoods Procedures using concentrated perchloric acid (>70%) or which heat any amount or concen tration of perchloric acid must be performed in a closed system or within a specially designed perchloric acid fume hood with wash down systems to prevent the accumulation of explosive perchlorates in the hood and ducting. For assistance in locating a perc hloric acid fume hood, call EH&S at 206.221.5549. 8. Glove Boxes Glove boxes generally operate under either positive or negative pressure to the lab, depending on the process or material used. Positive pressure glove boxes are used when you are trying to prot ect your material from contamination. Negative pressure glove boxes are used to provide increased operator protection. Glove boxes should be thoroughly tested before each use and there should be a method of monitoring the integrity of the system (such as a pressure gauge). 9. Biological Safety Cabinets Biological safety cabinets (BSCs) are laboratory hoods designed to protect the worker and the experiment by drawing air across the samples and away from the worker and into a HEPA filter. There are two types of BSCs. Class II type A and Class II type B1 units recirculate filtered air into the laboratory and are not designed for chemical use for this reason. The Class II type B2 unit is designed for use of some chemicals but is not a substitute for a fume hood. The use of chemicals in this type of hood needs to be evaluated carefully so that the protective barrier (HEPA filters) is not destroyed by the chemicals. BSCs are certified annually by EH&S. If a BSC fails the certification, it may not be used unti l repaired, unless specifically authorized by an EH&S biosafety officer. BSCs may not be repaired or moved until decontaminated by EH&S. EH&S does not support the use of UV lights in BSCs. Laboratories are solely responsible for maintaining any UV lights in their cabinets and will need to use outside contractors for servicing. BSCs with UV lamps should be labeled with a UV Light Source Caution sticker. Contact radsaf@uw.edu to get a st icker for your cabinet. Refer to the EH&S Focus Sheet Chemical Use in Biological Safety Cabinets (www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/chemical -use-biological -safety -cabinets -112), for information about using chemicals in a BSC. For additional information on the proper use of BSCs, Class II type B2 design, cabinet certification, troubleshooting problems or decontamination contact EH&S at 206.543.9510. 10. Laminar Flow Hoods Laminar flow hoods are designed to protect th e work surface from contaminants and may blow outEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 102 of 261 December 5, 2022 into the face of the person using the hood. Therefore, any chemical use will cause the person to be exposed to the chemical. Toxic or volatile chemicals may not be used in a laminar flow hood. 11. Ductless Lab oratory Hoods In some cases, installation of a ducted fume hood may be impossible and a request for a ductless hood must be approved by EH&S. This type of device uses special filters or absorbents to clean the contaminated air in the hood prior to recircul ating the air back into the room. Recirculation of potentially contaminated air into the room presents special dangers and special requirements must be met. The requesting department must demonstrate that the following concerns are addressed as long as the hood is in use: a. Chemical Characterization Each of the chemicals to be used in the ductless hood must be completely characterized as to the quantity which may be released within the hood at one time and the frequency of use. The hood manufacturer will need this information for the design of the hood. Once designed, use of other chemicals in the hood must be forbidden unless the hood manufacturer approves the alternate chemical. Records as to the design of the hood and the designated ch emical usage must be maintained in the laboratory. b. Ductless Hood Approval The Responsible Party (RP) must verify that the size, shape, and layout of the proposed hood, as offered by the hood manufacturer, is appropriate for the intended use. The PI must al so develop a management plan for the hood which addresses staff training and procedures for using the hood including emergency procedures, ongoing maintenance, certifications for the hood and recordkeeping. This plan needs to assure continuity if managemen t of the hood is taken over by another individual. A description of the items required in the management plan is available from EH&S at 206.543.7388. Hood approval by EH&S is contingent on submittal of the hood design information from the proposed manufact urer and submittal of the management plan. c. Laboratory Staff Information and Training All personnel in the laboratory must be trained that the ductless hood recirculates air back into the room, that only certain designated chemicals may be used within the hood, and that failure to operate properly and maintain the hood may result in personnel exposures. Also, a sign must be placed on the hood identifying which chemicals may be used and warning that the air is recirculated back into the room from the hood. 12. Cold Rooms, Warm Rooms and Environmental Chambers https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/mold -cold -rooms -focus -sheet -1032 a. Room Design Controlled environmental rooms are generally completely enclosed, with no fresh air, and with heating/cooling and other envi ronmental systems independent of the building. Rooms large enough to enter should be designed or retrofitted with doors that allow anyone trapped inside to get out easily. The electrical system within environmental rooms should be independent of the main power supply so that people are never left in these areas without light. The use and storage of flammable liquids in cold rooms is not allowed except following a review by Page 103 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL EH&S. These rooms are not typically constructed to be fire rated . b. Chemical Use Controlled environment rooms usually recirculate the air using a closed air -circulation system. Hazardous chemicals must not be stored in these rooms because ambient concentrations of volatile chemicals can accumulate to dangerous levels. Flammable solvents should not be used in controlled environment rooms. Ignition sources in these rooms could ignite vapors. Avoid using volatile acids in cold rooms because vapors can corrode the cooling coils, leading to possible refrigerant leaks. If solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is placed into a cold room, its sublimation will raise the carbon dioxide levels within the room, possibly to dangerous levels. Use extra precautions if you must use or store dry ice in these spaces. 13. Other Ventilation Systems A ventilation engineer must design all other local exhaust systems used in the laboratory. Do not attach canopy hoods or snorkel systems to existing fume hood exhaust ducts without consulting a ventilation engineer at Seattle Facilities Services, C ampus Engineering, 206.543.7372 or your local campus engineering design services (if available). All local exhaust systems should have a visual indicator that the system is functioning properly at all times, even if the indicator is just a Kimwipe . a. Discha rge of Hazardous Vapors Laboratory apparatus that may discharge hazardous vapors (vacuum pumps, gas chromatographs, liquid chromatographs, and distillation columns) must be vented to an auxiliary local exhaust system such as a canopy or a snorkel, if not already vented to a fume hood. b. Hazardous Chemicals Hazardous chemicals should be stored in approved cabinets. c. Isolation/Clean Rooms Isolati on rooms typically operate under negative pressure and clean rooms typically operate under positive pressure to the anterooms or hallways. These rooms require considerable engineering. Procedures for entering and exiting these areas should be written out a nd employees should be trained accordingly. 14. Maintenance of Ventilation Systems All ventilation systems need routine maintenance for blocked or plugged air intakes and exhausts, loose belts, bearings in need of lubrication, motors in need of attention, corr oded duct work and minor component failure. Contact Facilities Services ( refer to Appendix F) if a ventilation system has a problem. When maintenance is scheduled for fume hood exhaust systems, warning signs will be posted on the affected fume hoods and re searchers must cease fume hood use during the maintenance procedures in accordance with the requirements listed on the sign. a. Filters Filters should be replaced periodically in certain types of ventilation systems such as electrostatic precipitators, cyclones for dust collection and BSCs. For laboratory -maintained equipment, keep a record of these filter changes in a notebook or file that can be easily located in case a regulatory Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 104 of 261 December 5, 2022 agency requests a copy of this documentation. Page 105 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL b. Monitoring Devices Monitoring devices should be included in new ventilation systems to make the user aware of malfunctions. All personnel within the laboratory need to understand the meaning of associated alarms and readout devices and the actions to take if an alarm or unacceptable reading occurs. E. OTHER FACILITY CONDITIONS 1. General Laboratory Environment a. Building Repairs and Alterations Building occupants are not authorized to repair or alter facilities. Facility problems such as broken flooring and broken electrical cover plates should be corrected by initiating a work request with Facilities Services (refer to Appendix F). b. Floors and Walkways 1. Flooring - Floors should be level, with no protuberances which could cause a tripping hazard. Openings in the floor should be covered, if possible, or else protected or guarded to prevent falls. If impervious mats are present, they should have a non -slip backing or be fastened to prevent moving when someone steps on them. Material spills should be cleaned up as soon as possible. 2. Obstructions - Equipment and supplies should not be placed in corridors and pathways where it would interfere with exiti ng or make exiting hazardous. For more information, refer to the Use of Corridors and Unassigned Space policy (https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/re sources/Corrido r_Policy_Focus_Sheet.pdf). c. Doors Doors to laboratories and chemical use areas should remain closed when not actively in use. Fire rated walls and doors serve to compartmentalize the building into smaller fire zones and provide safe exit passage in the event of a fire. Even in areas without rated construction, lab doors help maintain a properly functioning ventilation system. Labs and chemical use areas are designed to sit at a negative pressure to keep con taminants within the space and protect the surrounding areas. Propping open these doors defeats the ventilation design. Lab doors are also important to provide security for the area and employees. Certain processes and hazardous chemicals require doors not only to be closed but also locked. d. Wall and ceiling penetrations The integri ty of walls and ceilings including suspended ceiling tiles should not be compromised without prior approval. Do not punch holes in ceiling tiles to run piping, electrical lines, or any other reason. Penetrations can affect room ventilation and lessen the effectiveness of sprinkler and fire alarm systems among other impacts. It may also expose occupants to regulated building materials. e. Seismic Bracing and Earthquake Prepa redness Details concerning seismic bracing are noted in Section 9.A.1.f . Facility Services must perform all facility modification, such as installing mounting brackets on the walls. f. Plumbing Syste msEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 106 of 261 December 5, 2022 Place a strainer or mesh pad over all sink drains to prevent objects from falling into the plumbing. Piping systems and plumbing connections in a room should be labeled. Such plumbing systems may includ e sewage lines, p otable water lines, non -potable water systems, cryogenic and pressurized gases, or other systems. All personnel should know what to do in case of a leak in any system. If experimental procedures will require connecting laboratory apparatus to any plumbing, personnel must also know how to avoid improper connections (i.e., avoiding mistakes such as connecting to the wrong system or making an inappropriate cross connection). Public Health regulations require additional safeguards to the plumbing system when co nnecting chemical equipment or experiments to potable water systems. Check with EH&S and Facilities Services prior to any connections to potable water systems. g. Lighting 1. Light Fixtures - Light fixtures should be operational, and diffusers should be installed. If emergency lighting and exit signs are not functional, immediately initiate a work request with Facilities Services ( refer to Appendix F). 2. Lighting Intensities - Light intensities should be adequate for the tasks being performed. If lighting seems inadequate when all fixtures are working, consider obtaining additional fixtures, especially if the laboratory arrangement is temporary. If this will not resolve the problem, call EH&S at 206.543.7388. In a few cases, increase d lighting may be required to reduce potential hazards from activities such as laser use or ultraviolet light applications. In these situations, contact EH&S Radiation Safety at 206.543.0463. h. Noise and Vibration When possible, equipment that produces irrit ating noise and vibration should be replaced with equipment designed to produce less noise and vibration. If equipment in the area is producing noise levels that require people to raise their voices to be heard while standing next to each other, potentiall y hazardous noise levels are being produced. These levels can be evaluated by contacting EH&S at 206.543.7388. Equipment should not be purchased which produces noise levels greater than 80 dBA without specific written approval from EH&S at 206.543.7388. A formal hearing protection program may need to be implemented for the installation and use of such equipment. i. Indoor Air Quality 1. Occupant Activities - Many complaints about odors are due to occupant generated problems. Such sources include dried out drain traps in sinks and floor drains, chemical spills inside a laboratory or adjacent area, rotting food within a room and expected or unexpected chemical reactions creating a stench. The room occupants should check these potenti al problems. If a dry trap is suspected, the trap should be filled with a few hundred milliliters of water at least once a month, or infrequently pour ten or twenty milliliters of a slower evaporating chemical such as glycerin, propylene glycol (not ethylene glycol) or mineral oil into the drain. Additional information about unknown odors is available at www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/indoor -air- quality. Page 107 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 2. 3. Facility Related - Recurring poor indoor air quality may be due to inadequate or malfunctioning general HVAC systems. In some cases, odors may come from a leak in a plumbing system (such as natural gas or sewage), an open drain that was never capped by Facilities Services when a piece of equipment was decommissioned, or a construction project in an adjacent area. If these conditions are suspected, contact Facilities Services ( refer to Appendix F). 4. Unknown Odor - If an unknown odor persists, contact EH&S at 206.543.7388. j. Asbestos, Lead and Other Hazardous Laboratory Components 1. Asbestos - Asbestos may be found in various equipment components (such as fume hood and safety cabinet wallboard and in autoclave and oven gaskets) and various supplies such as heat -resistant gloves and heat -resistant cloth. Non -asbestos materials should be used whenever possible in place of the asbestos materials and all personnel should avoid damaging suspected asbestos- containing material s. Do NOT use an ordinary vacuum cleaner or dry sweep to clean up suspect dust from these materials. Such materials are handled by a contractor via a work order through Facilities Services. Contact EH&S at 206.543.7388 concerning asbestos questions. 2. Lead - Lead may be used in a lab as a barrier when density is needed (such as an x -ray radiation shield) or as a weight when a heavy material is needed (such as an equipment counterbalance). The primary health hazard would come from inhaling or ingesting dusts f rom these materials, but skin contact with these materials should also be minimized. If a laboratory operation routinely creates lead dust or melts lead, the process should be evaluated by EH&S at 206.543.7388. 3. Other Materials - Other laboratory materials that could present a health hazard include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in light fixtures, window caulking/putty and transformers, liquid mercury switches in piped gas systems, mercury in fluorescent and high -pressure light bulbs, flammable or toxic gases in piped gas systems, and potentially hazardous materials in sewage plumbing and ventilation ducts. If any leak of such material is suspected, contact Facilities Services (refer to Appendix F). 2. Electrical Hazards Even small electrical currents passing through the body may cause injury or death. Observe the following precautions to reduce electrical risks. M ore information at www. ehs.washington.edu/fire -life/basic -electrical- safety. a. Circuit Breaker Access 1. Access - Maintain a t least three feet clearance in front of any circuit breaker panels within the laboratory. 2. Utility Access in Other Rooms - If you must enter other rooms to access the circuit breakers, you must be observant of any conditions in that room which may indicate a hazard. Such conditions could include puddles in front of the circuit breaker box or temporary barriers preventing entry to the circuit breaker box. (If a barrier is deliberately placed, such as a sign indicating that Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 108 of 261 December 5, 2022 3. entry is r estricted due to a hazard, obtain permission from the agency placing the barrier before entry.) b. Permanent Wiring and Outlets Request permanent wiring be installed for situations when you would be using extension cords for periods longer than eight hours. A ll building electrical repairs and wiring must be done by Facilities Services. If conduits appear damaged or cover plates over electrical outlet boxes are damaged or missing, please report that information to the Building Coordinator for forwarding to Faci lities Services or directly contact your supporting Facilities Services organization ( refer to Appendix F). c. Equipment Cords and Extension Cords 1. Extension cords should be a minimum 14 -gauge size (heavy duty) and in good condition with no splices, knots, deterioration, taping, damage or sharp, permanent bends. Plugs (110 volt) must have three prongs with a grounding prong longer than the current prongs. 2. Extension cords may never be used in place of permanent wiring. Consider instead power strip outl ets or surge protectors with - built -in circuit breakers. Refer to the focus sheet for guida nce on appropriate use of listed power -strips and -chaining of extension cords and/or power strips is not appropriate in any circumstance. 4. Carpeting, heavy objects, and equipment that may abrade or melt an electrical cord should never be placed on top of electrical cords. Cords should serve only one fixture or piece of equipment. Cords should never be strung t hrough holes in walls or ceilings, or over metal fixtures such as pipes or equipment racks because cord movement may abrade the cord. d. Chemical Splashes into Electrical Equipment Place equipment so as to reduce the chances of a spill of water or chemical on the equipment. If a spill occurs while the equipment is unplugged, the spill should be promptly cleaned, and the equipment must be inspected before power is applied. e. Grounding of electrical systems A facility using water or other liquid conductor that has a likelihood of creating a wet floor or work area should be equipped with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or equivalent protection to help prevent a serious electrical hazard in the event of an uncontained leak or other unexpected condition. Porta ble GFCIs are acceptable. f. Equipment Modifications Any problems with electrically powered equipment should be brought to the attention of the PI or laboratory supervisor. If equipment setup is modified, someone knowledgeable of the apparatus should check th e new setup before power is applied. Equipment operators must understand the hazards of equipment and apparatus in use and be familiar with the correct operation of that equipment. Power line cords should be unplugged before any modifications, maintenance, or repairs are made to equipment. Even though power may need to be applied to equipment while calibrations are performed, the operator must remain wary of the energized state of the equipment Page 109 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL and not adjust the equipment beyond safe operational parameters . If there is a potential for a worker to contact live electrical circuits of 50 volts or greater while performing equipment installation, modification, or maintenance, that person must take electrical safety classes (including lockout/tagout procedures) and wear appropriate arc/flash protective clothing. If at all possible, equipment setup and maintenance must be performed with the equipment in a de -energized condition. 3. Lockout / Tagout Concerns a. Hazardous Situations In addition to common electrical hazards, other energy hazards may exist in the laboratory that require special procedures, called Lockout/Tagout procedures. These situations may include equipment with internal pressurized systems (hydraulic or gas), multiple electrical energy source systems (where electricity is supplied through more than one cord), systems containing batteries or capacitors, and gravity systems (where a weight is held at a height). Such systems must be labeled with a warning sign. Anyone using such systems mus t know of the hazards and that only trained and authorized individuals may repair and modify the equipment. b. Precautions Trained and authorized personnel must perform all repairs, maintenance, and modifications. When repairs, maintenance, and modifications are performed, the energy source must be prevented from being activated using appropriate techniques such as de -energizing the system, inserting blanks into pressure systems, and locking out controls with individualized locks. 4. Equipment Guards and Mounting a. Guards Belts, pulleys, and other exposed moving equipment parts must be guarded. Equipment covers should be in place. b. Mounting Equipment designed to be used in a particular location should be permanently fixed in place to prevent movement from vib ration or earthquake. This is especially important for equipment which may topple (e.g., a drill press) or which needs to be balanced (e.g., a centrifuge). 5. Confined Spaces Laboratories may contain equipment (such as large tanks or ovens) or facility arrangements (such as tunnels, sumps, or pits) that laboratory staff may need to enter. Since potentially hazardous exposures may occur in a confined space, the space will need t o be controlled as a permit -required confined space. Special training and other precautions are required for permit -required confined space entry. Contact EH&S at 206 .543.7262 for space evaluations and to schedule training. F. LABORATORY APPARATUS AND EQUIPME NT To ensure basic safety of new equipment before purchasing or first use, it needs to be determined that the equipment meets accepted safety standards and requirements including, but not limited to: Local fire code requirements for electrical equipment, wiring and hazards (e.g., International Fire Code, 201 8 Chapter Six, Section 60 4 at https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2018/chapter -6-building -services -and- systems#IFC2018_Pt03_Ch06_Sec604)Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 110 of 261 December 5, 2022 Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 61010, Safety Requireme nts for Electrical Equipment for Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use (https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_61010 -1_3). UL labeling indicates products that have been tested by independent laboratories and determined to meet UL safety requirements. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 45 (Chapter 12), Standard on Fire Protection for L aboratories Using Chemicals (https:// www.nfpa.org/codes- and-standards/all -codes Operations and apparatus requirements such as: handling hazardous chemicals, heating operations and refrigeration and cooling equipment used to store flammable and combustible liquids, are covered . Proper use and maintenance of laboratory equipment can protect the health and safety of both the personnel and the equipment in use. Certain equipment found within labs may warrant greater attention than others depending on the specific hazards present a nd operation of the equipment. 1. General Safety Work Practices Operator manuals should be available for all lab equipment and instrumentation. Equipment manuals should be available and accessible to laboratory personnel. Workers using the equipment should know where such manuals can be found and should review the manuals prior to using the equipment. Although each will have its own specific safety requirements, some gener al guidelines for operating any lab equipment and instrumentation include the following: Always wear PPE recommended by the manufacturer when using the equipment and instrument (i.e.: hearing protection, face shield, etc.). Always keep the manufacturer's o perating manual with the instrument. Follow and document recommended maintenance procedures outlined in the manual. New operators should be trained by qualified lab personnel and familiarize themselves with the operating manual, including all pertinent safety information. Never remove hazard -warning labels from an instrument. Ensure that all equipment is grounded. Have a certified technician perform or supervise repairs. Disconnect equipment from the power -source whenever conducting maintenance on the instrument. Also, discharge any stored energy sources. Do not modify any electrical components. Modifications must be certified by a nationally recognized testing laboratory (e.g., UL, CSA, etc.) If the equipment is used near (within six feet) any source of water, ensure that it is plugged into an outlet with a Grounding Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI). Note: do not plug continuous running equipment such as freezers, into GFCI outlets. Be aware of and be trained in the unique hazards of your instrument. (i.e.: lasers, UV light, radiation sources, etc.) Ensure that routine maintenance is conducted and that maintenance records are maintained. 2. Refrigerators and Freezers Refrigeration, whether an appliance or building system, may not be modified, or repaired by laboratory staff. Appropriate Facilities Services personnel or a certified refrigeration mechanic should be contacted to work on these systems. The refrigerant gas must be collec ted and recycled Page 111 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL and must not be released to the environment. a. Labeling Every refrigerator, freezer and cold room must be clearly labeled to indicate whether it is suitable for storage of flammable , biological or radiological materials. Household refrigerators and freezers must be labeled \"Danger -Do not put flammable liquids in this refrigerator/freezer;\" food refrigerators and freezers must be labeled \"Food Only\". b. Flammable Storage Units https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/lab- refrigerators -and-freezers- 517 Household refrigerators and freezers are not equipped with electrical -safe controls and shall not be used to store flammable liquids. A flammable -safe refrigera tor/freezer is constructed with its controls mounted outside the storage compartment. This type of refrigerator is suitable for storing flammable liquids and is labeled by the manufacturer as such. c. Explosion Proof Units An explosion -proof refrigerator/free zer also has its controls mounted on the outside. In addition, the controls are designed to be explosion -proof. This type of refrigerator/freezer is required in rooms or areas where the use and storage of flammable or combustible liquids heated above their flash point are in amounts where the electrical components are required to meet the electrical code requirements for a hazardous electrical classified location per the National Electrical Code (NEC). This is based on the potential for a release of flammab le vapors/gases in a concentration that may result in an explosive atmosphere. 3. Stirring and Mixing Equipment Stirring and mixing devices commonly found in laboratories include stirring motors, magnetic stirrers, shakers, small pumps for fluids, and rotary evaporators for solvent removal. These devices are typically used in laboratory operations performed in a hoo d and need to be operated so that they do not generate electrical sparks. Use only spark -free induction motors in power stirring and mixing devices or any other rotating equipment used for laboratory operations. While the motors in most of the currently ma rketed stirring and mixing devices meet this criterion, their on -off switches and rheostat -type speed controls can produce an electrical spark because they have exposed electrical conductors. Do not control the speed of an induction motor operating under a load with a variable autotransformer. Consider the consequences of stirrer failure, electrical overload, or blockage of the motion of the stirring impeller. Stirring and mixing devices, especially stirring motors and magnetic stirrers, are often operated for long periods without constant attention. 4. Heating Equipment Most labs use at least one type of heating device, such as ovens, hot plates, heating mantles and tapes, oil baths, salt baths, sand baths, air baths, hot- tube furnaces, hot -air guns, and microwave ovens. Steam -heated devices are generally preferred whenev er temperatures of 100o C or less are required because they do not present shock or spark risks and can be left unattended since their temperature will never exceed 100o C. Ensure the supply of water for steam generation is sufficient prior to leaving the equipment for any extended period . When working with heating devices, consider the following general precautions:Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 112 of 261 December 5, 2022 Enclose heating elements in laboratory heating equipment to prevent a laboratory worker or any metallic conductor from accidentally touching elements or wires carrying electric current. Repair or replace worn or damaged heating equipment especially if its heating element is exposed. Use a variable autotransformer on a laboratory heating device to control the input voltage. Locate the external cases of all variable autotransformers where water and other chemicals cannot be spilled onto them and where they will not be exposed to flammable liquids or vapors. Fail-safe devices can prevent fires or explosions tha t may arise if the temperature of a reaction increases significantly because of a change in line voltage, the accidental loss of reaction solvent or loss of cooling. Some devices will turn off the electric power if the temperature of the heating device exceeds some preset limit or if the flow of cooling water through a condenser is stopped because of a loss of water pressure or loosening of a water supply hose to a condenser. a. Ovens Electrically heated ovens are commonly used in the laboratory to remove water or other solvents from chemical samples and to dry laboratory glassware. Never use laboratory ovens for human food preparation. Laboratory ovens are constructed so that their hea ting elements and temperature controls are physically separated from their interior atmospheres. Laboratory ovens rarely provide for preventing the discharge of substances volatilized in them. Connecting the oven vent directly to an exhaust system can reduce the possibility of substances escaping into the lab or an explosive concentration developing within the oven. Do not dry glassware or any chemical sample that contains flammable materials unless the oven is explosion -proof. Do not use ovens to dry a ny chemical sample that might pose a hazard because of acute or chronic toxicity, unless the oven is continuously vented. Do not dry glassware containing organic compounds in an unvented oven. To avoid explosion from residual solvent when drying glassware in an oven, rinse glassware with distilled water before it goes in the oven. Bimetallic strip thermometers are preferred for monitoring oven temperatures. Do not use mercury thermometers. b. Hot Plates Laboratory hot plates are normally used for heating solut ions to 100o C or above when inherently safer steam baths cannot be used. Ensure any newly purchased hot plates are designed to prevent electrical sparks. Older hot plates pose an electrical spark hazard from either the on -off switch located on the hot plate, the bimetallic thermostat used to regulate the temperature or both. In addition to the spark hazard, old and corroded bimetallic thermostats can eventually fuse shut and deliver full, continuous current to a hot plate. Do not store volatile flammabl e materials near a hot plate. Limit use of older hot plates for flammable materials Page 113 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Check for corrosion of thermostats. To avoid a spark hazard, repair or replace corroded bimetallic thermostats. c. Heating Mantles Heating mantles are commonly used for heating round- bottomed flasks, reaction kettles and related reaction vessels. These mantles enclose a heating element in a series of layers of fiberglass cloth. Heating mantles pose no shock hazard as long as the fiberglass covering is no t worn or broken, and as long as no water or other chemicals are spilled into the mantle. Always use a heating mantle with a variable autotransformer to control the input voltage. Never plug them directly into a 110 -volt line. Do not exceed the input volt age recommended by the mantle manufacturer. Higher voltages will cause it to overheat, melt the fiberglass insulation and expose the bare heating element. If the heating mantle has an outer metal case that provides physical protection against damage to the fiberglass, it is good practice to ground the outer metal case to protect against an electric shock if the heating element inside the mantle shorts against the metal case. Older equipment may have asbestos insulation rather than fiberglass. Contact EH& S at 206.543.7388 for proper handling and disposal of the asbestos. d. Oil, Salt and Sand Baths Electrically heated oil baths are often used to heat small or irregularly shaped vessels or when a stable heat source that can be maintained at a constant temperat ure is desired. For temperatures below 200\u00b0C, saturated paraffin oil is often used; for temperatures up to 300\u00b0C, a silicone oil should be used. Molten salt baths, like hot oil baths, offer the advantages of good heat transfer, but have a higher operating range (e.g., 200 to 425oC) and may have high thermal stability. There are several precautions to take when working with these heating devices: Contain heated oil in a sturdy vessel. When using oil, salt, or sand baths, do not spill water or volatile substa nces into the baths. Hot material can splatter over a wide area and cause serious injuries. To avoid generating smoke or oil ignition, do not overheat hot oil baths. Always monitor the oil bath temperature to ensure it does not exceed oil flash point. Fit oil baths left unattended with thermal sensing devices that will turn off the electric power if the bath overheats. Mix oil baths well to ensure there are no hot spots around the elements that heat the surrounding oil to unacceptable temperatures. Mount baths carefully on a stable horizontal support such as a laboratory jack that can be raised or lowered without danger of the bath tipping over. Iron rings are not acceptable support s for hot baths . Clamp equipment high enough above a hot bath so that if the reaction begins to overheat, the bath can be lowered immediately and replaced with a cooling bath without having to readjust the equipment setup. Provide secondary containment in the event of a spill of hot oil. Wear heat -resistant gloves when handling a hot bath. The reaction container used in a molten salt bath must be able to withstand a very rapid heat -up to a temperature above the melting point of salt.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 114 of 261 December 5, 2022 Keep salt baths dry since they are hygroscopic, which can cause hazardous popping and splattering if absorbed water vaporizes during heat -up. e. Hot Air Baths and Tube Furnaces Hot air baths are used in the lab as heating devices. Nitrogen is preferred for reactions involving flammable materials or where combustible materials are heated above their flash point. Electrically heated air baths are frequently used to heat small or irregularly shaped vessels. Due to low heat capacity, these baths normally h ave to be heated to 100oC or more above the target temperature. Tube furnaces are often used for high -temperature reactions under pressure. Consider the following when working with either apparatus: Ensure that the heating element is completely enclosed. For air baths constructed of glass, wrap the vessel with heat resistant tape to contain the glass if it should break. When possible, use sand baths instead of air baths. For tube furnaces, carefully select glassware and metal tubes and joints to ensure they can withstand the pressure. Follow safe practices outlined for both electrical safety and pressure and vacuum systems. f. Heat Guns Laboratory heat guns are constructed with a motor -driven fan that blows air over an electrically heated filament, producing temperatures up to 650oC. Applications include: Drying glassware Heating parts of distillation apparatus Developing thin- layer chromatography (TLC) plates Removing paint Soldering Curing epoxy resins Removing ice accumulation Heat shrink tubing application Removing decals and stickers Softening, molding, and welding plastic materials Accelerate evaporation Do not use an extension cord to power a heat gun since they may overheat and cause a fire or electric shock. Never obstruct or cover the air inlet grills, or operate the heat gun with the outlet nozzle directly against the surface . This will reduce the air flow, causing the heat gun to overheat and possibly catch fire. Other safety considerations include : Do not u se a heat gun near combustible or flammable materials/atmospheres. Keep in mind the presence and direction of the heat produced. Always switch the tool off before putting it down on any surface. Allow the tool to cool before storing it. Never touch the hot metal nozzle with clothing or skin. Never direct the air flow towards one's body. Do not look down the nozzle while the gun is turned on. Do not insert anything down the nozzle of the gun. g. Microwave Ove n Page 115 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Use microwave ovens specifically designed for laboratory use. Domestic microwave ovens are not appropriate. Microwave heating presents several potential hazards not commonly encountered with other heating methods: extremely rapid temperature and pressure rise, liquid superhea ting, arcing, and microwave leakage. Microwave ovens designed for the laboratory have built -in safety features and operation procedures to mitigate or eliminate these hazards. Other potential hazards include: Generating sparks that can ignite flammable vapors. Placing metals inside the oven that may produce an arc and ignite flammable materials. Placing materials inside the oven may overheat and ignite. Sealed containers, even if loosely sealed, can build pressure upon expansion during heating, creating a r isk of container rupture. To minimize the risk of these hazards: To avoid exposure to microwaves, never operate microwave ovens with doors open. Do not place wires and other objects between the sealing surface and the door on the oven. The sealing surfaces must be kept clean. Never use a microwave oven for both laboratory use and food preparation. Electrically ground the microwave. If use of an extension cord is necessary, only a three - wire cord with a rating equal to or greater than that for the oven should be used. Do not microwave flammable or combustible materials. Do not use metal containers and metal -containing objects (e.g., stir bars) in the microwave. They can cause arcing. Do not put heat -sealed containers in the microwave oven. Even heating a container with a loosened cap or lid poses a significant risk since microwave ovens can heat material so quickly that the lid can seat upward against the threads and containers can explode. Remove screw caps from containers being microwaved. If the sterility of the contents must be preserved, use cotton or foam plugs. Otherwise plug the container with lab wipes to reduce splash potential. Do not modify a microwave for experimental use. 5. Ultrasonicators Human exposure to ultrasound with frequencies between 16 and 100 kilohertz (kHz) can be divided into three distinct categories: airborne conduction, direct contact through a liquid coupling medium, and direct contact with a vibrating solid. Ultrasound through airborne conduction does not a ppear to pose a significant health hazard to humans. However, exposure to the associated high volumes of audible sound can produce a variet of effects, including fatigue, headaches, nausea, and tinnitus. When ultrasonic equipment is operated in the laborat ory, the apparatus must be enclosed in a 2 -cm thick wooden box or in a box lined with acoustically absorbing foam or tiles to substantially reduce acoustic emissions (most of which are inaudible). Direct contact of the body with liquids or solids subjected to high -intensity ultrasound of the type used to promote chemical reactions should be avoided. Under sonochemical conditions, cavitation is created in liquids, and it can induce high- energy chemistry in liquids and tissues. Cell death from membrane disruption can occur even at relatively low acoustic intensities. Exposure to ultrasonically vibrating solids, such as an acoustic horn, can lead to rapid frictional Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 116 of 261 December 5, 2022 heating and potentially severe burns. 6. Centrifuges They must be pro perly installed according to manufacturer recommendations. It is important that the load is balanced each time the centrifuge is used and that the lid is closed while the rotor is in motion. The disconnect switch must be working properly to shut off the equipment when the top is opened, and the manufacturer's instructions for safe operating speeds must be followed. For flammable and/or hazardous materials, ensure the centrifuge is under negative pressure and connected to a suitable exhaust system. 7. Rotary Evaporators Glass components of the rotary evaporator should be made of Pyrex or similar glass. Glass vessels should be completely enclosed in a shield (i.e., tape, mesh or plastic coating) to guard against flying glass if the components implode. Increase in rotation speed and application of vacuum to the flask whose solvent is to be evaporated should be gradual. When not located in a fume hood or ventilated enclosure, rotary evaporators must be evaluated by EH&S and may require blast protection, spill control and local exhaust ventilation (per NFPA 45 annex C). Refer to section 9 on Vacuum Systems for requirements on rotary evaporator vapor cold traps. 8. Autoclaves Refer to the Autoclave Safety Focus Sheet on the EH&S website for information. 9. Vacuum Systems Vacuum pumps are used in labs to remove air and other vapors from a vessel or manifold. The most common usages are on rotary evaporators, drying manifolds, centrifugal c oncentrators, acrylamide gel dryers, freeze vacuum ovens, tissue culture filter flasks and aspirators, desiccators, filtration apparatus and filter/degassing apparatus. Weak points in containers or systems under vacuum can create implosion or explosion hazards, and cause injury by violently spraying glass and hazardous materials. Conduct all vacuum operations behind a table shield or in a fume hood. All glass containers must be strong enough to handle the pressure differential without failure. If the apparatus or glass lines are chipped or cracked, the container must be replaced immediately. Wrap glass vessels with tape, mesh or plastic coating and enclose the vacuum trap inside a rigid container. If a stand -alone vacuum pump is used with volati le hazardous materials, it is important to trap the vapors so that they do not degrade the pump oil or pass through the pump and get emitted in the exhaust. The trapping device may be a cold trap cooled with dry ice or liquid nitrogen, but the trap type de pends on the specific chemicals that need to be trapped. Stand -alone vacuum pumps should exhaust to a fume hood or other building exhaust; they should not exhaust into the room. This is essential when the pump is being used to evacuate a system containing a volatile toxic or volatile corrosive substance. Scrubbing or absorbing the gases exiting the pump is also recommended. Other practices to ensure safe conditions when working with vacuum systems include the following: a. Pumps Ensure that mechanical pumps ha ve belt guards in place. Ensure that service cords and switches are free from defects. Always use a trap on vacuum lines to prevent liquids from being drawn into the pump Page 117 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL , house vacuum line, or water drain. Replace and properly dispose of vacuum pump oil that is contaminated with condensate. Used pump oil must be disposed of as hazardous waste. Place a pan under pumps to catch oil drips. Do not operate pumps near containers of flammable chemicals or materials. Do not place pumps in an enclosed, unventilated cabinet. b. Glassware Use only heavy -walled round- bottomed glassware or glassware specifically designed for vacuum systems. Carefully inspect vacuum glassware before and after each use. Discard any glass that is chipped, scratched, broken or otherwise stressed. c. Cold trap Locate the cold trap between the system and vacuum pump. Ensure that the cold trap is of sufficient size and cold enough to condense vapors present in the system. Check frequently for blockages in the cold trap. 10. Equipment maintenance Define and document routine maintenance requirements and frequency for laboratory equipment. G. DECONTAMINATION OF WORK AREAS Laboratory personnel are responsible for providing a clean and unobstructed work a rea for all maintenance and service personnel. Floors should be cleaned regularly and kept free of obstructions. 1. Custodial Services UW Custodial Services will clean floors in laboratories only if requested. Contact Custodial Services at 206 .685.1500 on the Seattle campus; (refer to Appendix F) for contact numbers for Facilities Services at other locations. Custodial floor care equipment should not be used to clean up spills or chemical residue. 2. Servicing of Lab Area or Equipment If facility workers need to service an area or equipment, ensure the area/equipment is unobstructed, emptied of chemicals, decontaminated, washed with warm, soapy water, and rinsed. This requirement applies to fume hoods; in addition to cleaning, the fume hood should be cleared out ofall chemicals, glassware, and equipment prior to servicing. The area or equipment must have a posted Notice of Laboratory Equipment Decontamination Form (UoW 1803) before service will be provided. This form is available online at www.ehs.washington.edu/ resource/uw -form- 1803 -notice - laboratory -equipment -decontamination -154. Facilities Services and maintenance personnel will refuse the work if the area or equipment has not been decontaminated and/or cleaned. Staff look for visible debris, absorbent pads or papers taped to surfaces, and visible or sticky spilled materials when determining if the area or equipment is clean. If laboratory staff may not be present when service personnel are scheduled to arrive, leave a note Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 118 of 261 December 5, 2022 stating a contact name and phone number in case there are questions about the work H. DECONTAMINATION OF EQUIPMENT FOR DISPOSAL All laboratory equipment must be assessed by the user for hazardous materials prior to being surplused. A laboratory employee knowledgeable of the hazardous materials used in the laboratory and/or equipment must prepare the equipment according to the decontamination and cleaning instructions and verify that the equipment is safe to handle by Facilities or contractors without the use of personal protective equipment. The releasing party retains full responsibility for ensuring the item is cleaned and decontaminated prior to pick up or delivery to the UW Surplus Property warehouse. Equipment must be cleaned inside and out of all visible residue and encrusted material. All equipment and furniture must be emptied, and all locks must be unlocked, including cabinets and drawers.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE As a general principle, exposure to hazardous chemicals should be kept as low as possible and avoided when possible through good laboratory procedures. If there is reason to believe that exposure to a chemi cal routinely exceeds an exposure limit for a chemical, then the Responsible Party (RP) or supervisor shall arrange to measure an employee's exposure to that chemical. For assistance in determining if air monitoring should be conducted, contact EH&S at 206 .543.7388. 1. Exposure Limits Exposure limits can be defined by a regulation identified as a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) or by a guideline. PELs are listed in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) at WAC 296 -841-20025 , which can be found at https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -841-20025. Some chemical -specific regulations set a limit called an Action Level (AL) in addition to the PEL. If an AL is exceeded, c ontinuing actions must be taken to make sure the levels do not exceed the PEL. There are approx. 600 chemicals with a regulatory PEL, so it is frequently necessary to refer to a guideline to get an idea of a possible significant exposure. Guideline limits are considered recommendations and exposures should not exceed these levels. These guidelines are typically more up to date than the regulatory limits. Various organizations publish guidelines, as shown in Table 5 -1, Guidelines for Airborne Exposure Levels. Table 5 -1 Guidelines for Airborne Exposure Levels Guideline organization Guideline title National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Workplace Environmental Exposure Limit Guides (WEEL Guides) In addition to the organizations listed above, guidelines may also be produced by other organizations, nations, and chemical manufacturers. The recommended limits can be obtained from the publications of those organizations, found on Web pages, or sometime s listed on safety data sheets. Contact EH&S at 206 .221.7770 concerning exposure limit questions. Due to lack of complete knowledge of the health effects of chemicals and possible chemical synergies, there may be an exposure issue even though levels do not exceed limits. Personnel should take reasonable steps to reduce exposures and keep levels as low as feasible. Page 123 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 2. Special Chemical Air Monitoring Washington State Department of Labor & Industries regulations specifically address the chemicals listed in Table 5 -2, Special Chemical Air Monitoring, and require that air monitoring be done. In most cases, EH&S can perform air monitoring. Contact EH&S at 206.221.7770 for assistance if you routinely use any of these chemicals in Table 5 -2: Table 5 -2 Special Chemical Air Monitoring Chemicals Requiring Air Monitoring Acrylonitrile 1,2-Dibromo -3-chloropropane Methylene Arsenic Vinyl chloride Cadmium Lead 3. Possible Over -Exposure Exposures exceeding recommended limits are considered over -exposures. Such limits apply to airborne levels which may result from operations that generate air contaminants outside of fume hoods, from a spill of a volatile chem ical, or a leak of a gas. Other routes of entry into the body besides inhalation - ingestion, direct skin or eye contact with a chemical, injection under the skin by a sharp object or high - pressure source, or a combination of these routes - may also prese nt a significant exposure. These exposures may occur if safe practices are not followed. In some cases, workers may show signs of exposure such as headaches, rashes, nausea, coughing, tearing, irritation or redness of eyes, irritation of nose or throat, di zziness, and loss of motor dexterity or judgment. Such conditions should be evaluated if there is no pathological cause for such symptoms. Follow -up is especially important if the symptoms disappear when the person leaves the exposure area and then reappea r soon after the employee returns to work, or if two or more people in the same laboratory work area have similar complaints. For specific exposure response procedures, refer to the poster at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/exposure -response -poster.pdf 4. Medical Evaluations Laboratory employees who were monitored and found to exceed recommended limits, or suspect they may have been over -exposed (such as during a spill clean -up), or have been advised by their private practi tioners that they may be impacted by workplace chemical exposures, or are having symptoms consistent with over -exposure to a chemical, should contact the Campus Employee Health Center (206.685.1026 for most work areas; 206.744.3081 for HMC employees; 206.5 98.4848 for UWMC employees). The occupational health nurse will coordinate medical consultation, exams, and surveillance . Staff involved in any emergency situation should go directly to the nearest emergency room or call 911 (on campus) for assistance, depending on the situation. Use this response poster as a guide for responding to a biol ogical, chemical or radiological exposure: https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/exposure- response- poster.pdf .Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 124 of 261 December 5, 2022 B. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) The purpose of PPE is to reduce student, employee, and visitor exposure to laboratory hazards. Examples of PPE include gloves, eye and foot protection, respirators, and protective clothing such as aprons and lab coats. ( Refer to Table 5 -3 for example PPE by hazard type). EH&S recommends that lab coats and eye protection always be worn when working in the laboratory as bes t practice. Responsible Party (RP) or laboratory managers are required to assess the hazards and risks of exposure based on the procedures performed in the laboratory and the controls in use. The PI or manager may consult the laboratory PPE Hazard Assessment Guide : https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/laboratory -personal -protective -equipment -ppe-hazard - assessment -guide -351 as a tool to perform the assessment. Before work is initiated, refer to a cop y of the completed assessment or other documents detailing the lab PPE requirements such as standard operating procedures (SOPs). If PPE is re quired, the University must provide PPE at no cost to an employee (except for prescription safety glasses and closed shoes (http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/APS/10.04.htm l). The PI or lab manager must also instruct employees in how to select, inspect, use, maintain, and store th e PPE. PPE training records should be maintained (as described in Section 8 of this manual). Although students must be protected to the same degree as employees, they may be liable for purchase of their own PPE, such as safety goggles or respirators. Some commonly used PPE, such as aprons, can be purchased and made available for student use by the department. Table 5 -3 Hazards and Example PPE Hazard Personal protective equipment Biohazards Gloves, lab coats, liquid resistant surgical masks, aprons, sleeve covers, face shields, splash goggles Chemicals Gloves, chemical -resistant clothing, aprons, sleeves and shoe covers, vapor -proof or splash goggles; lab coats for general use Cuts/Abrasions Cut-resistant gloves (leather, Kevlar, chainmail ) Dust Dust goggles, respirators Electricity Electrically resistive gloves, mats, hard hats Explosions Protective vests, face shields Falling Objects Hard hats, steel -toe shoes, metatarsal guards Falls Fall harness, strap -on hard hat Fires Fire-resistant lab coat Flying Particles Safety glasses w/ side shields, goggles, face shields Hot Environments Cooling vests, reflective suits Hot or Cold Objects Thermal gloves (Note: Asbestos gloves are prohibited and must be turned in as hazardous waste.)

Eye Protection Appropriate eye protection must be worn when working with chemicals. EH&S recommends that eye protection always be worn when working in the laboratory, as best practice, due to potential accidents affecting individuals away from the scene. Avoid use of con tact lenses in the laboratory. If you wear contact lenses, notify the PI or laboratory supervisor, and always wear chemical splash goggles or a face shield. a. Prescription Safety Glasses Prescription safety glasses are available from optical stores. Do not use regular glasses as safety glasses; they are not strong enough. b. Safety Glasses Safety glasses with side- shields are designed to provide impact protection but provide little protection from chemical splashes, dusts, or hot particles. c. Splash Goggles Wear s plash goggles with splash -proof sides when there is a danger of a chemical splashing. Goggles that have screened sides or other vents are not splash proof, but can be worn when working with apparatus that could produce flying particles ( e.g., glassware und er reduced or elevated pressure). d. Face Shields Face shields, in addition to safety glasses or splash goggles, provide maximum protection to the face and neck from flying particles and harmful liquids. Face shields also may be needed when a vacuum system is used. e. Free -Standing Barrier Shields Free- Standing barrier shields can be used to protect yourself and bystanders from possible explosion. f. Specialized Eye Protection Specialized eye protection is needed when working with lasers, ultraviolet light, infrared light, or intense visible light , such as during glassblowing and welding work. Glasses, goggles, or face shields with adequate filtration are needed. For assistance, contact EH&S Radiation Safety at 206.543.0463. Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 126 of 261 December 5, 2022 2. Personal Apparel a. Appropriate Clothing The clothes you wear in the laboratory are an important consideration for personal safety and can influence the severity of consequences of spills, splashes, and burns. If the lab has any hazardous materials or hazardous procedures performed in the room, the expectation is that lab members wear lab coats for all work. These guidelines should be followed when working in the laboratory: Shoes should fully cover the feet to protect against spills; no open -toed shoes or sandals are permitted, and shoes constructed of mesh (such as athletic shoes) are not recommended. The core body should be covered, so clothing items like crop tops should not be allowed. Clothing should fully cover your legs. Materials you wear in the laboratory can make a difference. Many synthetic fabrics may be dissolved by solvents or may melt into your skin, causing more extensive burns if they catch on fire. Preferred materials are cotton, wool, and resistant polyester. Synthetic materials, such as acrylics, rayon, and polyester are not recommended. Loose, flowing garments and scarves should be avoided; they may easily pick up spills or trail through a burner flame. b. Jewelry and accessories Loose jewelry such as bracelets, watches and necklaces should be avoided since they may catch on equipment. Avoid rings that can damage protective gloves or make removing gloves difficult. Items such as headphones or earbuds that can impede hearing should be avoided since they may reduce awareness of hazards or incidents occuring in the workspace. c. Synthetic nails Synthetic and acrylic nails are not recommended for certain types of laboratory work as they can pose a potential burn hazard depending on the chemicals or equipment being used. Acrylic nails are very flammable and, once ignited, they burn to completion. Also ensure that synthetic nails do not damage protective gloves or make removing gloves difficult. d. Hair Tie back long hair so it does not get caught in equipment, come in contact with chemicals or interfere with your field of view. e. Laboratory Coats Laboratory coats are personal protective equipment (PPE) and protect the skin and clothing from splatter and spills. Laboratory coats are a critical component to worker prote ction in laboratory areas. All students, faculty, staff, and visitors who conduct work activities with hazardous chemicals, biohazards and radiological hazards must be provided with (and wear) a laboratory coat. Laboratory personnel should wear lab coats or aprons and sleeves whenever there is a potential for contaminating skin or clothing. Laboratory coats that extend to the knee are required and should be buttoned completely in order to protect skin and clothing from splat ter and spills. Lab coats are loose - fitting by design so that it is faster and easier to remove a laboratory coat than street clothes, therefore minimizing skin contact with hazardous materials. Page 127 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL There are several types of lab coats which provide varying degrees of protection. A few examples of the different protection available include splash -resistant coats, static -free coats, chemical -resistant coats, and flame -resistant lab coats. Please make sure that the coat you wear provides the type of protection that is appropriate for the task and activities performed. Flame -resistant lab coats are recommended when working with highly flammable, pyrophoric, or potentially explosive chemicals. Lab coats and other protective wear used in a lab should be kept in the work area to minimize the possibility of spreading chemicals to public places (including eating or office areas). Contaminated personal clothing may spread hazards to family and friends, as well as contaminate public areas such as doors, hallways, elevato rs, and food services. f. Laboratory Laundry Requirements : Laboratory coats must be laundered when soiled (or potentially soiled) on a determined schedule to help ensure they are washed regularly. Labs should determine a laundering schedule based on the work activities and frequency of use. Laboratory coats may not be taken home to be cleaned in a domestic washer, nor should they be taken to a laundry service that is not equipped to handle contaminated items. Laboratory coats should be laundered through a University of Washington contracted vendor. If any aspect of your work includes biohazardous agents, you are required to use a laundry vendor that can provide medical laundry service. Medical laundering uses cycles of chemicals, heat, and mechanical agitation to ensure biohazards are adequately removed. Medical laundering removes most vegetative pathogens but does not make the coats sterile. More information on requirements for medical laundry are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3. Gloves a. When to Wear Gloves Wear gloves whenever working with chemicals, biohazards, radioactive materials, rough or sharp- edged objects or very hot or very cold materials. Wear the right size glove. After researching that a glove provides adequate chemical protection, the gloves should be tested while performing the lab procedure to ensure the glove provides enough dexterity to perform the work safely; if a glove is too slippery to allow gripping, a different type of glove can be worn over the chemical protective glove to improve dexterity. b. When to not wear Gloves Do not wear gloves around an unguarded, moving machine as it could snag the glove and pull your hand into it. Do not wear gloves when touching common surfaces such as telephones, computers, doorknobs , elevator buttons or objects that may be tou ched without gloves by others. Do not wear gloves outside the laboratory. c. Selection Select gloves based on the material being handled, the hazard involved, and their suitability for the procedures being conducted (such as whether the gl ove provides appropriate dexterity for theEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 128 of 261 December 5, 2022 procedures). To select the appropriate chemical -protective glove, read the SDS or consult EH&S at 206.543.7388. Thin, disposable gloves should not be expected to provide long -term protection from immersion in a ch emical; use thick gloves if immersing hands in a chemical. Other types of gloves used in a laboratory may be designed to protect from biological hazards, sharp objects, and temperature extremes, among other hazards. Asbestos gloves are prohibited, and any found in a laboratory should be turned in as hazardous waste. d. Inspection Inspect gloves before each use and discard if there is discoloration, punctures, or tears. Do not blow into gloves to check for integrity. If there is no external contamination; the glove can be squeezed to determine if the trapped air is escaping through small holes. e. Removal Take off gloves before leaving the laboratory. If using reusable gloves, wash them with soap and water before removing them to get rid of possible contaminants. Get in the habit of removing gloves without touching the outside of the glove to clothing or skin. Wash hands with soap and warm water after removing gloves. f. Replacement Replace gloves often, depending on their frequency of use and p ermeability of the chemical(s) handled. Do not reuse disposable gloves. g. Contaminated Gloves Dispose of contaminated gloves by carefully removing them and placing them in a plastic bag. If they are grossly contaminated with hazardous chemicals, then manage them as hazardous waste. For more information , refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/hazardous -chemical -waste- disposal. h. Latex Gloves Do not wear latex gloves in the lab for chemical protection. They provide very little protection from chemicals. Latex gloves can be the source of allergic reactions, which can range from powder abrasion dermatitis to a life -threatening hypersensitivity to the latex protein. Latex gloves are not permitted in any lab that is affiliated with clinical services. 4. Respirators Respirators should not be needed in a normal laboratory setting. However, if you suspect laboratory airborne hazardous chemical concentrati on is near the PEL, contact EH&S at 206.543.7388 for a consultation. All use of respirators at the U niversity must comply with the UW Respiratory Protection Program prior to first use. For more information, contact EH&S at 206.543.7388 and refer to the Respiratory Protection Program web page at www.ehs.washing ton.edu/workplace/respiratory -protection. This program includes evaluating hazards and medical fitness of each user, training, selecting equipment and understanding its limits, fit testing, and annual recertification. 5. Hearing Protectors Hearing protectors (earplugs or earmuffs) may be needed for some procedures or in some laboratory settings. Do not use headphones or earbuds underneath hearing protectors. If you suspect the noise levels may be potentia lly harmful, contact EH&S at 206.543.7388 for an evaluation. (As a rule, if you are in a noisy environment where you have to raise your voice to be intelligible to someone standing next to you for most of the day, the noise levels may be potentially hazard ous.) Page 129 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 6. PE: Outside the Laboratory It is standard practice to remove all PPE, including gloves and lab coats, prior to exiting the laboratory. This prevents any possible contamination of clean areas such as restrooms, elevators, offices and cafeterias. When you wear gloves or a lab coat in the hallway, the general public perception is that you have been handling something that is possibly harmful to humans. Furthermore, if you have been working with or handling potentially harmful materials, your gloves or lab coat may be contaminated, and you may not know it. It is also critical to remove all PPE, including gloves and lab coats, when leaving areas where any hazardous materials, which may have contaminated the PPE, are in use. This includes hazardous chemicals, radioactive materials, nanoparticles, or other haza rdous materials. When transporting hazardous materials through common hallways, the outer surface of the container must be free from contamination. This minimizes potential contact with any hazardous material, thus eliminating your need to wear gloves or a lab coat outside of the laboratory.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 130 of 261 December 5, 2022 This page has been intentionally left blank.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPS) Laboratories must provide employees with standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed when laboratory work involves the use of hazardous substances and processes. The SOPs must address all requirements to perform the laboratory procedures safely. Th e requirements may either be given in a cover sheet (described below) attached to the laboratory protocol(s) or be integrated into a protocol. Developing SOPs is also addressed in the EH&S Laboratory Safety Standard Compliance class, which is required for a laboratory's Responsible Party (RP) and laboratory supervisors/managers. Registration for this class is available online: www.ehs.washington.edu/training or call EH&S at 206.543.7201 for more information. For advice in developing SOPs, call EH&S at 206.543.7388 or email ehsdept@uw.edu . SOPs obtained from other organizat ions and SOPs written in the form of step -by-step procedures can be used as long as all the basic components are addressed, and as long as the SOP accurately describes your laboratory's safety requirements. If SOPs are provided by outside sources (such as equipment suppliers or another laboratory) or modified from a template, they must be carefully reviewed to ensure they describe your protective measures accurately, including describing specific types of PPE and control equipment you will use. Feel free to attach additional information, such as Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) to your SOP. Chemical - specific hazard information is available in the appendices of certain regulations (such as for arsenic and lead), the EH&S Web pages, other websites, and reference boo ks. B. SOP COMPONENTS SOP Templates are available in Appendix D. To review all required safety elements for SOPs, refer to https://ehs -web01.s.uw.edu/system/files/resources/soprequiredelementschecklist.pdf Descriptions of the components using a typical SOP design are listed in this section. If a particularly hazardous substance is involved in the process, expanded requirements must be addressed. Particularly hazardous substances include substances that are extremely dangerous or toxic, are recognized carcinogens or reproductive hazards. More information about particularly hazardous substances is available at https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/particularly - hazardous -substances- 655. 1. Process Identification Identify the name of the process. This could include the chemicals or equipment involved to differenti ate the SOP from similar processes. 2. Chemicals and Hazards Identify the stock chemicals, intermediates, final compounds, wastes involved and such factors as use of catalysts or inert compounds. List the hazards, including physical hazards such as heat, cold and varied operating pressures, which are involved in the process. 3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE includes gloves, lab coats, etc., and is the minimal method of protection if alternatives are available. However, when PPE is required, it must be specified completely, such as the type of glove to be used and whether it is necessary for the entire process or at certain steps. A guidance document for PPE is available on the EH&S website at Page 133 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL - assessment -guide is described in this manual, Section 5.b , Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Environmental / Ventilation Controls. 4. Environmental/Ventilation Controls Describe engineering controls to be used to minimize exposures, including fume hood, glove box, snorkel, or local exhaust ventilation systems. Describe ways to verify that the fume hood and other control system(s) are operating correctly before using hazardous chemicals. Provide additional details if particularly hazardous substances (highly toxic or dangerous chemicals, carcinogens, reproductive toxicants or select toxins) are used. For definitions and criteria of particularly hazardous substances , refer to https://www.ehs.washington .edu/resource/particularly - hazardous -substances- 655 . These details should address using specific containment device(s), such as fume hoods or glove boxes. 5. Special Handling Procedures & Storage Requirements Describe administrative controls, such as transpor tation in secondary containment within or outside the laboratory space and purchase of pre -formulated liquids instead of powders to be weighed and prepared. If not specified in general laboratory rules identify procedures, such as keeping the fume hood sas h as low as possible, hygiene practices (such as hand washing), and procedures for removal and disposal of contaminated PPE. Identify best practices that can be used to minimize accidents, such as placing temporary hazard signs, when personnel may be absen t. Specify if there are limits to the amount of reactants during the process. This also provides guidance for chemical purchases (e.g., purchase the smallest quantity necessary whenever possible). Describe storage requirements, such as the use of secondary containment or storage in locked cabinets. 6. Spill and Accident Procedures Describe how spills or accidental releases should be handled and by whom (e.g., a spill of 100 ml in a fume hood may be easily handled by staff, but a spill of 10 ml outside the hood may not be safely handled). 7. Waste Disposal Describe waste disposal procedures for all wastes. Be aware that many laboratory accidents happen from inadvertent disposal of incompatible wastes into the same waste container, so ensure that different waste streams are identified where appropriate. This includes describing procedures to neutralize or treat wastes to make handling safer or to reduce the amount of hazardous waste. EH&S has preferred treatment options on the web page concerning waste minimization www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/environmental -quality. 8. Special Precautions for Animal Use Annotate \"N/A\" if no animal exposure is involved. If chemicals are being administered to animals, describe how employees should protect themselves from contaminated animals and animal waste. Include information about restricted access, administration of th e chemical, aerosol suppression, protective equipment, and waste disposal. 9. Approval Required Describe any requirements for obtaining authorization before the procedure, operation or activity can be performed (e.g., a worker must have tr aining documented before performing a certain procedure for the first time). Other required authorizations could include completing a medicalEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 134 of 261 December 5, 2022 examination before using a respirator when performing procedures involving certain hazardous substances (e.g., lead dust, pathological organisms). Authorizations are required before a person can independently perform a process using a particularly hazardous substance. Maintain written documentation with the SOP. 10. Decontamination Describe decontamination procedures, inc luding chemical decontaminant handling, for equipment meant to be reused. 11. Designated Area Identify where the particularly hazardous chemicals may be used. C. EXAMPLE SOPS Sample SOPs are available at www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical -sops. If used by your laboratory, these examples must be modified and customized to make them specific to your laboratory conditions. If your laboratory generates an SOP and would like to make it available to other labs, please attach an electronic copy to an email addressed to ehsdept@uw.edu. D. STEPS TO DEVELOP YOUR SOPS To develop your laboratory SOPs, EH&S suggests t he following steps: 1. Step 1 - Modify Existing SOPs EH&S recommends you review and modify any generic SOPs that pertain to your laboratory. This allows you to become familiar with the required elements (Figures 6 -1, 6-2). 2. Step 2 - Identify Requirements Ident ify if any particularly hazardous substances (refer to https://www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/particularly -hazardous -substances- 655 ) are in use in your laboratory, and identify which way of writing your SOPs will best cover your laboratory's chemicals or processes. SOPs can be written in one or more of the following ways: a. By Process By process, such as distillation, peptide synthesis or gel electrophoresis. Safety requirements could be noted, either by integrating them into the steps in the process or by using a cover sheet of safety requirements for that specific process. If hazardous intermediates are created, carefully con sider if there are specific precautions which should be noted, such as how to tell if a release or spill occurs, what symptoms may develop if a person is exposed and any special precautions for spill clean -up and waste disposal. b. By Individual Chemical By e ach individual chemical, such as acrylamide, formaldehyde or toluene. This approach may be most useful if a limited number of hazardous substances are used in the laboratory or if using a particularly hazardous substance. c. By Class of Chemical By class of c hemicals, such as mineral acids, organic solvents or peroxidizable chemicals. This approach may be most useful if a number of similar procedures are performed using similar substances. Page 135 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 3. Step 3 - Complete the SOPs After modifying generic SOPs and identifying which ways of writing are most useful in your situation, continue by developing SOPs for processes, chemicals, and chemical classes not previously written. Ensure all components of the SOPs are addressed if the SOP pertains to chemicals considered particularly hazardous (those that have a high degree of acute toxicity, those that are especially dangerous or are select carcinogens or reproductive toxins, such as those listed as particularly hazardous substances and similar substances). The PI/Lab Manager must sign and date to approve the SOP. Electronic signature is acceptable for SOPs sto red electronically. 4. Step 4 - File the SOPs After completing the SOPs, file the master copies in hardcopy or electronically so that everyone can find and access them. If they are not physically filed in the laboratory -specific information section of your CH P, the laboratory -specific information pages should be annotated to identify where the SOPs are physically or electronically located. 5. SOP Training All laboratory personnel/staff must be trained by the PI, laboratory manager, CHO, or supervisor prior to using the process/chemical in the laboratory. Documentation of training must be maintained and available for review. The SOP training form in Appendix B may be used, or the laboratory may choose to create their own form. Documentation may be electronic or hard copy. Provide working copies of your SOPs to your staff, keep track of how many copies you make and distribute 6. Distributing Copies of the SOPs If you provide working copies of your SOPs to your staff, keep track of how many copies you make and distrib ute. If there is a central electronic location, track who has access to the files. When you make changes, you will need to ensure that the up- dated SOPs reach all those who perform the procedures. If you develop an SOP you believe can be used by other depa rtments in the University, please forward a copy electronically to the University's Chemical Hygiene Officer at ehsdept@uw.edu. 7. Update SOPs as Needed If you note changes to your proc ess or chemical use that impact an SOP, or recognize improvements that can be made, update it as soon as it is convenient. Sign and note the revision date on the SOP. Notify all lab personnel of the revised SOP, and document training. R eplace the previous SOP in your files and anywhere else they may have been placed, including those that may be kept at the lab benches or in individual staff members' files.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 136 of 261 December 5, 2022 This page has been intentionally left blank.

SAFETY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS According to state/federal laws and University of Washington policy, PIs and laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all employees receive adequate training in order to understand the hazards prese nt in their work area. Training must occur prior to assignments involving new hazards. Refresher training or retraining may be required by law and for personnel who demonstrate they did not understand the initial training or are not following required procedures. Each laboratory must have a method for tracking the training new employees receive before working with hazardous chemicals and other hazards in the laboratory. All visitors must receive sufficient training to ensure they are also aware of the h azards and how to protect themselves while in the work area. The University of Washington takes the responsibility of employee safety very seriously. Mandatory safety training is a key component of this commitment. Administrative Executive Order No. 55 of the President is available at www.washington.edu/admin/rules/polici es/PO/EO55.html. Additional training may be required for laboratory research that is outside the scope of EH&S, such as research involving animal subjects, clinical research, funded research, etc. UW Research maintains a Required Training web page to help researchers comply with external sponsor and internal training requirements at: www.washington.edu/research /compliance/required- training/. B. EH&S SAFETY TRAINING AND RECORDS EH&S has developed a matrix describing required and recommended training available from EH&S for each laboratory employee. EH&S offers required and reco mmended classes in chemical safety and biological safety, among others. The training matrix is available on the EH&S training page at: maintains training records for all EH&S provided classes. Individuals may look up their training records and print certificates by using the My EHS Train ing tool and logging in with their UWNetID at www.ehs.washington.edu/training. Departments or units may request a copy of staff training records by contacting EH&S Training at 206.543.7201 or ehstrain@uw.edu. C. LABORATORY -SPECIFIC TRAINING AND RECORDS According to state/federal laws and University of Wa shington policy, Responsible Party (RP) are responsible for ensuring that all employees receive adequate training to understand the hazards in their work area. Training must occur prior to assignments involving potential exposure to chemicals. The laboratory policies on hazard review of new work, working alone or after hours, equipment precautions, use of fire extinguishers and other relevant practices should be documented. Laboratory staff must also receive training applicable to all U niversity employees, such as the orientation to the department Health and Safety Plan. The laboratory PI or supervisor must ensure records of all laboratory -specific safety training are maintained either within the laboratory or at a central location if that is required by the department. The location of the training records should be noted in the Laboratory -Specific Information section of the Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP). Page 139 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL The laborat ory PI or supervisor must also keep a copy of safety training content (e.g., a lesson outline and copy of the applicable standard operating procedure) to demonstrate the scope of the training. Such material is useful to provide proof of training during Was hington State Department of Labor and Industries inspections, to help in training new employees and in providing refresher training if needed. Training records should be maintained for as long as the trained employee remains on staff. If there is a chance that an employee who left will be returning soon, it might be a good idea to keep the records longer. Employee training may be documented using forms, such as the examples in Appendix C. Lab specific activities that have any qualification or restrictions s hould be communicated and documented. 1. Undergraduate students in the laboratory Undergraduate students working in the laboratory may need additional training or oversight or may require demonstration of proficiency; this information should be provided a par t of lab specific training. Lab activities that require supervision or and/or additional training are: Use of an open flame Use of hydrogen peroxide at greater than 5% concentration Working with pyrophoric reagents Working with hydrofluoric acid Working with reactions under pressure, using glass or metal reactors, or that may become pressurized Working with radioactive compounds Working in shops Performing any hot work Working with open beam class IIIB or class IV lasers The lab specific training must also identify any hazards of such severity that the risk cannot be justified for an undergraduate researcher. These activities should be prohibited and this restriction should be clearly identified. If the lab has established limitations on the amount of time that undergraduate students should work in the lab, this information should be provided a part of lab specific training. Examples of activities that might be prohibited are: Working with materials understood to be potentially explosive under am bient conditions Working with replication- competent pathogens that require BSL2+ facilitie s Supervising another Undergraduate Researcher Working with neat (pure) chemicals having exceptionally potent health hazards as acute toxins, carcinogens, and reproductive toxinsEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 140 of 261 December 5, 2022 D. UW OFFICE OF RESEARCH - RESEARCH REQUIRED TRAINING The Office of Research offers research -related required training links and transcripts from University departments ( www.washington.edu/research/compliance/required -training/) to help researchers comply with external sponsor and internal requirements, and/or reduce and mitigate risk Page 141 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL SECTION 8 - RECORD KEEPING Contents A.CURRE NT RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE LABORATORY/DEPARTMENT ........................................ 142 1.

CURRENT RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE LABORATORY/DEPARTMENT 1. Chemical Hygiene Plan The Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP), which is comprised of the online UW Laboratory Safety Manual plus the laboratory -specific information (e.g., Standard Operating Procedures, laboratory floor plans, chemical spill kit locations and emergency procedures), must be accessible to all employees in the laboratory any time they are working. The laboratory -specific information may be kept electronically (or on paper) and should be updated annually or whenever there are changes. The entire CHP must be reviewed and updated bi -annually or once a year by the PI or laboratory supervisor, and the review should be recorded in the laboratory -specific information documentation area. 2. Chemical Inventory Current chemical inventories must be maintained on the online UW MyChem system for each laboratory. A copy should be printed annually for easy reference. The current inventory could be filed in the laboratory -specific information area or in another location. All workers must know where the inventory is maintained. EH&S also recommends that the PI or laboratory manager have a current copy available at home (in case of emergencies). 3. Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) Safety Data Sheets must be maintained for hazardous products. Departments are encouraged to maintain accessible copies of SDSs for immediate reference in case of emergencies, and for training purposes. The master file of SDSs for all known chemicals used on campus is maintained by EH&S and electronic copies of individual SDSs are immediately available on MyChem. ( Refer to SDS in Section 2.B.3 of this manual). 4. Incident/Accident Reports Employee incident/accident report records are maintained at EH&S (206.543.7388). Industrial insurance records are maintained in the UW Office of Risk Management (206.543.0183). The Responsible Party (RP) or laboratory supervisor should keep copies of all incident/accident or close - call reports filed Online Accident Reporting System (OARS) at www.ehs.washi ngton.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury -reporting pertaining to the laboratory or involving laboratory staff. 5. Safety Training Records Laboratories must maintain records of all work -related safety and health training for c urrent personnel . It is required that records for a specific person are retained for seven year s after their employment or work has ended. (Refer to Section7.D for information on what to include in your laboratory training documentation.) EH&S maintains electronic records of attendance at their training classes. University personnel can check their records using their UWNetID and this link: www.ehs.washington.edu/training. Copies of training record s are available to departments upon request (call 206.543.7201 or email ehstrain@uw.edu ). 6. Shippi ng Papers (Bills of Lading) If chemical -containing items are mailed or moved on or off campus and require shipping papers, these papers should be kept for one year. 7. Chemical Treatment Log You must keep a log of all hazardous wastes that you have treated and provide it to EH&S upon request. Keep these logs for six years. The logs must be available for review by county or state inspectors. Page 143 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 8. Exposure Monitoring Records Departments frequently maintain copies of employee exposure monitoring to provide immediate information to their workers if questions arise. These records can be kept in the laboratory or in the department. EH&S maintains records for all exposure monitoring conducted by EH&S. In some cases, laboratories conduct their own employee monitoring. If this occurs, please forward a copy of the monitoring results to EH&S, Box 357165. Exposure monitoring records must be maintained for at least 30 years after the exposure. 9. Self-inspections You must conduct at least one self -inspection (www.ehs.washington.edu/research -lab/lab - safety - surveys- and-inspections/lab -self-inspections ) annually. It is recommended that this is done at least several months after the most recent Laboratory Safe ty team inspection of the lab. Labs with higher turnover, such as teaching labs, should consider conducting self -inspections more than once a year. You can use a copy of the Laboratory Safety Checklist or create a custom checklist. A self - inspection tool is offered on the Lab Safety Dashboard and recommended for use, to provide an electronic record easily accessible by the lab and EH&S. Record dates, findings, and follow up activities, and keep records electronically or in paper format. B. OBSOLETE AND SUPERS EDED RECORDS FROM THE LABORATORY Changes in laboratory operations may cause records to become obsolete or superseded. 1. Obsolete Exposure Information Obsolete and superseded information concerning the chemicals in use in a laboratory should be archived and disposed after 30 years when no longer current. These documents include chemical inventories, SOPs, records of spills and accidents and exposure monitoring records. 2. Other Obsolete Documents Records not directly pertaining to potential chemical exposures can be discarded a year after they are no longer current. These records typically include shipping/receiving documents , eyewash flushing logs, and inventory records, . 3. Records from Decommissioned Laboratories The department should archive any rec ords pertaining to possible employee exposures for 30 years after decommissioning a laboratory. C.

BEFORE AN EMERGENCY This section describes emergency guidelines and requirements for laboratory operations. It supplements emergency procedures described in other documents, including your Departmental H ealth and Safety Plan, building Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEOP or FSEP) and the UW Emergency Response Management Plan. General information regarding building emergencies can be found on the EH&S Building Safety Resources page (https ://www.ehs.washington.edu/fire -life/building -emergency -procedures -and- resources) or the University's Safety Portal. Responsible Party must prepare laboratory personnel for emergencies, such as injuries, fires or explosions, chemical spills, floods, power failures and earthquakes. To prepare for an e mergency, laboratory personnel should plan, obtain response kits and materials and practice responses. New employee laboratory emergency procedures need to be included as part of new employee orientation. All staff should participate in periodic drills and exercises, including discussion s, to keep knowledge current and safety first. 1. Planning and Prevention The University of Washington Police Department (UWPD) and Seattle Fire Department (SFD) provide emergency response on the Seattle campus. Local fire and police departments respond at Bothell, Tacoma, and off- site locations. EH&S will liaise with these organizations and provide advice, but each laboratory is responsible for accident preventio n and preparing for laboratory emergencies. a. Continuity Planning A business continuity plan (BCP) should be in place to help1) minimize the impact on lab activities during any incident and 2) facilitate a return to normal operations. The department may have a broader Business, Academic and Research Continuity (BARC) Plan through the Husky Ready system with some of these details already established; the BCP is meant to supplement and support that system. The template for the BCP is found at: https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/UWLabContinuityPlan.pdf b. Accident Prevention Prevent emergencies in laboratories and minimize the effects of an emergency by doing the following: 1. Post emergency phone numbers, the Exposure Response Poster, and the Spill Response Poster. 2. Identify the locations of emergency equipmen t on a floor plan; make sure all staff know the locations of the equipment, such as a spill kit. A template to help create a single lab floorplan is available at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/lab -floorplan -template -169); https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/multi -room- lab-floorplan - template -170. 3. Know locations of shutoffs for equipment including electrical, gas and water. 4. Train personnel to retrieve SDSs for laboratory chemicals using MyChem (refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/mychem for information). 5. Separate incompatible chemicals \u2014a chemical incompatibility chart is available at www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/Incompatible_Chemicals_ Focus_Sheet.pdf . Page 147 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 6. Frequently dispose of chemical wastes and clean out unneeded chemicals and surplus; dispose of unneeded items. 7. Ensure electrical wires and equipment are in good condition. 8. Discuss accidents and near misses to prevent future accidents. 9. Periodically complete the laboratory inspection checklists found at https:// www.e hs.washington.edu/research -lab/laboratory -safety/lab - self-inspections. 10. Discuss safety topics periodically in staff meetings. c. Hazards Assessment/Risk Minimization When a new experiment or process is in development, assess possible hazards and identify ways to reduce risks. This is the responsibility of the Responsible Party (as described in Section 1.c .) Information about hazards and controls is available in the product SDS and from EH&S at 206.543.7388 or ehsdept@uw.edu . d. Fire and Explosion Prevention To prevent and minimize the effects of fires and explosions, do the following when using flammable, reactive or explosive materials: 1. Determine if a non -flammable substitute for your material is available. 2. Use a minimum amount of the material at any one time. 3. Maintain proper clearances for aisles, eyewashes, emergency showers and underneath and around sprinkler heads. 4. Close fume hood sashes when they are not in use. 5. Keep containers securely closed . 6. Practice good housekeeping, such as recycling cardboard boxes and properly disposing of unnecessary or outdated chemicals. 7. Have the appropriate fire extinguisher available for the materials in use. 8. Wear fire -resistant lab coats instead of plastic. 9. If using chemicals in a closed system, frequently check that connections are tight. 10. Use chemicals and reaction systems in a ventilated enclosure, such as a fume hood. 11. Reduce or eliminate open flames and spark -producing equipment. 12. Use a refrigerato r/freezer designed to store flammable materials. 13. Use barriers that provide adequate protection from an explosion. 14. Consider if utility outages would increase risks while using the material. 15. Anticipate that intermediates and wastes can be flammable or explosive. 16. Use appropriate containers and locations to accumulate wastes. 17. Train staff on chemicals hazards and precautions; document the training; exercise responses periodically. Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 148 of 261 December 5, 2022 e. Spill Prevention Laboratory supervisors should identif y chemicals likely to spill during common laboratory procedures, as well as during emergency events, such as earthquakes and fires. The procedures for cleaning spills in a laboratory should be included in the SOPs developed for each of the lab's processes (refer to Section 6 of this manual). Pay special attention to additional precautions for pyrophoric, water reactive, oxidizing chemicals and those that may generate toxic gases if a reaction were to occur. Use chemicals in small quantities to limit the amount spilled if a container ruptures. Chemicals should be transported between rooms in a tub or bottle carriers designed to prevent breakage and to hold the contents in case of breakage. All laboratories should have a chemical spill cleanup kit appropriate for the chemicals in the lab. f. Earthquake Laboratory personnel should be familiar with actions to take during an earthquake. In addition to general procedures such as DROP, COVER and HOLD ON, personnel should know the proper procedures for laboratory evacuation, chemical spills cleanup, and accessing SDSs for emergency response personnel. Securely fasten heavy or hazardous items that could topple over or block access to emergency exits to the walls or floor. These items include shelving units, equipment racks, file cabinets (taller than 4 feet), distillation units, gas cylinders and cryogenic Dewars; Facilities Services must provide anchors for these items and secure them to the walls or floor. Straps or chains placed at 1/3 an d 2/3 of the cylinder height above the floor are recommended. Use two straps for items such as compressed gas cylinders, due to the likelihood that they will fall over during an earthquake if only one strap is used. Shelves holding chemical containers must have a lip or protective restraint devices to prevent them from falling off the shelf. Cabinets used to store chemical containers should have a closure device to prevent the door from being shaken open. g. Gas Leaks and Unknown Odors All staff need to know which gases and volatile chemicals in their laboratory may produce an odor. Identify contents of pipes, hoses or gas lines with labels. Staff should know the location of control valves used to shut off gas flow. Discuss incidents with odors, as well as odor s from adjacent laboratories, during staff meetings if they are issues. h. Utility Outages: Pre -planning and Mitigation 1. To pre -plan for utility failure, consider the utilities laboratory operations depend on, and then determine if interruptions are unacceptable. Utility outages that can affect laboratory operations include: Electrical power systems Backup power system or switching systems Compressed air systems Ventilation systems (fume hoods, biological safety cabinets, etc.) Natural gas system Supplied gas systems (medical air, O2, N2O, N2, EtO, etc.) Vacuum system Page 149 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Potable water systems (loss or contamination) Non -potable water systems (loss or contamination) Sewage systems Heating systems Fire protection systems Refrigeration systems (refrigerators, cold rooms, walk- in freezers, etc.) Elevators Telephone systems Detection and alarm systems (fire alarms, low airflow alarms, etc.) 2. Actions that can mitigate the effects of shutdowns on laboratory operations include: Backup (split) samples at another location Records backed up at another location Emergency power circuits (if available) for equipment Devices such as water filters for potable water and surge protectors or Uninterruptible Power Systems for electrical power Plan steps to safely shut the process down and resume again Plan actions to prevent uncontrolled reactions Contract for emergency supplies and services If using refrigerators or freezers to store specimens, locate a source vendor for dry ice and liquid nitrogen freezers in case of electrical failure. Connect incubators, refrigerators, and freezers to battery - powered automatic phone dialing systems or alarm monitoring services to detect power interruptions and alert the designated person Develop procedures for card reader doors and other security systems that typically have a four -hour battery backup; communicate changes to normal access routes Flashlights in areas that do not have emergency lighting; periodically check batteries Alarm systems and appropriate responses (including fire alarms, ventilation system alarms, fume hood low -flow alarms, gas leak detection systems) Create staff communication channels for disaster situations (adverse weather, long -term power outages) Safe Ch emical Use: such as keeping containers closed Conduct periodic safety trainings, drills, or exercises i. Unattended Operations and Floods Avoid leaving operations or experiments unattended. Post the name and phone number of the person resp onsible for the operation on the door to the room in case of emergency. In addition, identify the chemicals in use and post clear directions for shutdown so that an untrained person could shut down the operation during an emergency.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 150 of 261 December 5, 2022 In general, to avoid failures in equipment while no one is in the lab, maintain and operate equipment properly. Replace damaged equipment and electrical cords. Do not use extension cords for hooking up to electrical power; use strip outlets if your cord does not reach the outle t. Check equipment periodically. Discard and replace damaged batteries. Water: If it is necessary to have running water unattended, install a commercial water flow device that sets off an alarm if a leak occurs or use a shutoff valve that kicks in if the water level rises too high. Use copper tubing with proper fittings or Tygon tubing, which is less likely than rubber tubing to become brittle. If using tubing, make sure the ends are tightly connected. Anchor outlet hoses into sinks or drains. Flame: Do not leave open flames unattended. j. Security Issues Plan for ways to avoid and respond to violence, vandalism, suspicious people, and suspicious packages. Laboratories can be targets for such activities. Related information is available on the Office of Emergency Management website at www.washington.edu/uwem/. In general, laboratory security requires students and staff: 1. Know all entry points. 2. Keep doors closed and locked when the lab is unoccupied. 3. Wear identification badges. 4. Never allow a stranger to enter the lab. 5. Do not leave materials and supplies (avoid theft, tampering). 6. Properly dispose of hazardous agents no longer needed. Depending on the materials in use in the laboratory, higher levels of controls may need to be implemented. These controls may include using codes to identify certain materials and securing them inside the laboratory with access by designated personnel only. The PI, with the assistance of the department, should determine policies to increase security. All staff must be reminded of these policies. k. Field Operations Plan for emergencies that may occur during field laboratory operations. Prepare a written safety plan that takes into account the remoteness of the operation and the risks associated with the activities. Minimum considerations include: 1. Become knowledgeable about potential threats in the area 2. Determine first aid, CPR and medical response; make first aid kit readily available 3. Determine \"In Case Of Emergency\" communications plan 4. Devise alternative plans for inclement weather 5. Checklists: ensure necessary supplies, equipment, SDSs and SOPs 6. Insurance: confirm student coverage prior to participating in field activities Follow the requirements and recommendations listed in the UW Field Operations Safety Manual.

Biological Spill Kits Information on biological spill kits is located on the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/biohazard -spill- kit.pdf. d. First Aid Kits A fully stocked first aid kit should be always readily available and easily accessible to lab staff . You must make sure that the first aid supplies are stored in a container that protects them from damage, deterioration, or con tamination. Containers must be clearly marked, readily accessible and easily moved to the location of the injured or ill worker. A list of items that should be included in your first aid kit is available on the Labor and Industries website at https:// www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/o wadisp.show_document?p_id=9863&p_table=standards. At a minimum, supplies should include absorbent compresses, adhesive bandages, adhesive tape, antiseptic wipes, burn ointment, exam gloves, sterile pads, and triangular bandages. Check regularly for items that need to be replenished, and check expiration dates of items at least on an annual basis. First aid kits can be purchased through UW's E -Procurement Ariba system at http://depts.washington.edu/rubelab/Lab_Information/Ordering%20Information/Procurement%20S ervices%20_.html. Laboratories using hydrofluoric acid must stock calcium gluconate gel in case of skin contact with the hydrofluoric acid. The gel should be kept in the first aid kit (but may be kept in a spill kit or location close to the work area known by all personnel). The gel has a relatively short shelf life of six months, so the PI/laboratory supervisor must replace it periodically. Refer to www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/hydrofluoric -hf-acid-focus -sheet -152 for additional details about procuring the gel from a local vendor.) e. Disaster Kits Disaster kit information is on the UW Emergency Management website: www.washington.edu/emergency/prepare/disaster_kit.php. B. RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC INCIDENTS / ACCIDENTS Emergencies occur in a range of severity. Minor incidents such as an insignificant spill, or a scratch treated by applyin g a Band Aid, do not need a major response. All personnel need to know what to do in case of a major emergency. Additional information on specific emergen cies is available at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/fire- life/building -emergency -procedures -and-resources. 1. Accidents Causing Serious Personal Injury or Exposure For an accident -causing serious personal injury, call 911 for emergency response as soon as Page 153 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL possible while conducting the following first aid responses as app ropriate. Do not remove equipment involved in the accident and do not move it unless necessary to provide aid to the victim(s) or to prevent further damage or injury. Depending on the seriousness of the injuries, a formal accident investigation may be requ ired in compliance with Washington State Department of Labor and Industries regulations (Washington Administrative Code, WAC 296 -800-801-320, https://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=296 -800). 2. Chemical Exposure If a hazardous chemical gets in someone's eyes, flush eyes for at least 15 minutes in the eyewash while holding the eyelids open. Call 911 as soon as possible. If a toxic or corrosive chemical is on someone's skin, flush the area affected for at least 15 minutes with tepid water. If necessary, use the safety shower and remove contaminated apparel. (For hydrofluoric acid, when calcium gluconate treatment is available , flush skin for five minutes and immediately apply the calcium gluconate. For more details, refer to the HF example Standard Operating Procedure at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/hydrofluoric -hf-acid-sop-541.) Call 911 as soon as possible. If a person is exposed to a toxic material in the air, remove the person to fresh air and call 911 as soon as possible. Do not re -enter an area that may still be contaminated. All personnel in the laboratory should be able to retrieve an SDS for any hazardo us chemical in the laboratory so they can bring it to the emergency room. Transporting the victim by ambulance is recommended. Contact the Occupational Health Nurse at UW Campus Health Services (206.685.1026) if there is a concern about possible long -term health effects from a workplace exposure. a. Reporting After immediate emergency actions have been taken, report the accident or incident to the work area supervisor, department administrator or other designated department contact as soon as possible. If the accident results in a fatality or hospitalization, also report the accident immediately to EH&S at 206.543.7262. After routine office hours, EH&S can be contacted via the UW Police Department at 206.685.UWPD (8973). If the accident involved a University vehicle, it must be reported immediately to the UW Police Department at 911 or 206.685.UWPD (8973), and to UW Fleet Services using the procedures found in the vehicle's glove compartment. All faculty, staff, students, and visitors are required to report an accident or incident using the online accident reporting system (OARS) within 24 hours of the incident or accident if a person was injured or property damage occurred. Report any on -the-job incident that nearly misse d causing an injury or illness or property damage. The online OARS system is available at www.ehs.washington.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury -reporting. b. Medical Treatment Reports An employee who seeks medical treatment for a work- related injury or illness must subm it a State of Washington Accident Report Form (which is initiated by the health care provider) and notify UW Risk Services at 206.543.0183. More information is available at https://r isk.uw.edu/. 3. Fires and Explosions In the event of a fire or explosion, call 911 . If you are uncertain about calling 911, the best course of Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 154 of 261 December 5, 2022 action is to call 911 and let the dispatch operator assist in deciding a proper response. Activ ate the alarm system and evacuate as soon as possible. If your building does not have a fire alarm system, shout \"fire\" while moving toward the exits. If your department allows use an appropriate fire extinguisher to fight the fire if it is easily extinguished (i.e., smaller than a trash can), you have been trained within the last year on how to use a fire extinguisher and you have a clear exit. Report all fires and explosions immediately. Even if the fire was small, contained and readily extinguished by la boratory personnel, immediately report the incident to the University Police on the Seattle campus at 206.685.UWPD (8973). For UW Bothell, call the UW Bothell Public Safety Department at 425.352.5359. For UW Tacoma, call Campus Safety Services at 253.692.44 25. Regardless of location report to EH&S by calling 206.685.0341. Submit an accident report on the online accident reporting system (OARS) on the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.edu/workplace/ accident -and-injury -reporting. Additional information on emergency procedures is availabl e at www.ehs.washington.edu/resource/emergency -procedures - fireexplosion -181. 4. Spills Your response to a spill depends on the danger it poses. Immediately assess the situation and call 9-11 for any life -threatening emergency. If anyone has been exposed, refer to section 9.B.1. Accidents Causing Serious Injury or Exposure . If the spill is within the laboratory staffs' capabilities to cleanup, follow S.W.I.M.: S: STOP THE SPILL. COVER WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL. W: Warn others. Alert people in the immediate area of the spill. I: Isolate the spill and secure the area. Close doors if possible. M: Minimize your exposure by wearing PPE and avoiding contact, inhalation or ingestion. Vacate the area if necessary. Wash hands after handling spill materials. a. For additional information refer to the Spill Response Poster. Documentation, and Process Improvement After the incident, fill out an accident report with your supervisor on the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury -reporting. Replace used clean -up materials. Determine if additional or other types of cleanup materials would be desirable. Also, discuss, as a group, what could have b een done differently. Document any changes by updating the applicable Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). b. Mercury Spills Mercury spills are one of the most common spill calls received by EH&S. All departments using mercury should replace their mercury devi ces if at all feasible. If a mercury spill occurs, prevent entry to the area. Refer to the EH&S webpage at www.ehs.washington.edu/chemical/mercury for guidance. 5. Earthquake Response Take shelter under a workbench or other protective cover until the earth movement stops. Afterwards, if safe to do so, shut down any procedures that may be underway and cap any open Page 155 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL containers: you may not be allowed to re -enter until the building has been assessed for hazards. Determine if you need to evacuate the work area. Assemble at the Evacuation Assembly Point and await further instructions. Do not re -enter the building until after it has been assessed for structural damage by trained personnel; re -entry is only authorized by University officials. For further information about earthquake safety , refer to guidelines at www.ehs.washington.edu/ resour ce/emergency -procedures -earthquakes and the UW Emergency Management Web page : www.washington.edu/emergency. For free informational handouts on earthquake preparedness (including for home/family), call EH&S Tr aining at 206.543.7201. Visit the Office of Emergency Management webpage for more earthquake preparedness information at www.washington.edu/uwem/preparedness/know- your -hazards/earthquake/. 6. Gas Leaks or Other Odors a. Natural Gas Leaks 1. Natural gas leaks are a pot ential cause of explosions. Natural gas contains an odorant that enables recognition even at low concentrations. If you smell natural gas in the laboratory, do the following: Turn off all sources of ignition (open flames, electrical equipment). Check labor atory gas outlets for open valves. Call Facilities Services ( refer to phone numbers in Appendix F) to have the location of the gas leak identified. 2. For strong, widespread and/or quickly worsening odor: Pull the emergency alarm at a pull station. Turn off all sources of ignition (open flames, electrical equipment). Close the emergency gas valve for your floor or area if one exists. Evacuate the building immediately and go to your assembly area. If your assembly area is downwind of the building, move to an alternate assembly area up wind at least 300 feet from the building. Do not return to an evacuated building unless told to do so by the on -scene authority (fire department, police department or other personnel). Submit an accident report on the online accident reporting system (OARS) at www.ehs.washington.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury -reporting. b. Unusual Odors Check with co -workers to determine if they are doing something to produce an odor. If a leaking gas cylinder is su spected, handle it as described in Section 2.G. 9.d. If an immediate source cannot be determined in the laboratory, check the hallway and adjacent laboratories to determine if the odor is widespread or if the source is obvious. Try to relate the odor to possible causes: Dried sink drain or floor drain (sewer -like or chemical -like odorEnvironmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 156 of 261 December 5, 2022 kChemical process gone wrong (if a rotting or unknown chemical odor) Overheating electronics (if devices are over -heating or smell hot) Chemical spill or a leaking process (if a distinct chemical) If the source is obvious, take action (if possible) to eliminate the cause or control the odor, such as taking a chemical reaction off the b enchtop and putting it into a working fume hood. There are an unlimited number of potential sources, but familiarity with the lab's activities should help narrow the possibilities. Additional information about indoor air quality is available on the EH&S website at https:// www.ehs.washington.edu/environmental/indoor -air-quality. 7. Utility Outage Your safety and the safety of those around you is the first consideration dur ing a utility outage. Remain calm. Assess the situation; if conditions seem dangerous, evacuate the area while assisting others to evacuate. Do not re -enter the building until a competent authority has determined it is safe to do so. If the situation does not seem dangerous, notify your supervisor or the building coordinator of the failure, shut off work in progress that could cause hazards, close containers and fume hood/biosafety cabinet sashes and return hazardous material containers to their proper stor age locations. Some utility failures may have insignificant impact on your operations, and you can safely continue work as determined by you and your department/supervisor. Note: emergency lighting systems are meant to provide light for exciting , not routi ne, work. If the failure appears likely to last for a long period, follow your health and safety plan and directions from your department/supervisor. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed and implement backup procedures as necessary, such as obtaining dry ice to keep specimen refrigerators cold. When systems return to normal operation, immediately assess the work area (even on weekends, if that is when service is restored) for any hazards that may be present, such as electric devices (heaters, ovens, c entrifuges, etc.) left on when the outage occurred. General information is available on the EH&S website at www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/power.pdf. a. Electrical F ailure Procedures 1. Secure current experimental work, and then move it to a safe location. 2. Close open containers of hazardous materials. 3. Close sashes on fume hoods and biological safety cabinets. 4. When transporting chemicals on carts between floors, get assistance; hazardous spills are a significant risk during transport. 5. Keep lab refrigerators or freezers closed throughout the outage. 6. Unplug personal computers, non -essential electrical equipment and appliances. 7. If asked to evacuate, secure hazardous materials work, and leave the building. 8. Once power is restored, assess the affected area for potentially hazardous situations, such as devices left on; assessment required when power is restored when the facility is closed or unoccupied. b. HVAC/Fume Hood Failure Procedures Page 157 of 261 December 5, 202 2 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL 1. Notify other occupants of the situation 2. Evacuate: (e.g., smoke is coming into the room); pull fire alarm if warranted 3. Notify your supervisor or building coordinator of the situation 4. Shut down work in progress (if safe to do so): Shut off equipment and supplied gases and liquids Close open containers Close sashes on fume hoods, biological safety cabinets Note the step in your process when work was stopped Return specimens to the freezer, storage containers, etc. 5. Open windows if staff are to remain in the workplace 6. If staff remain in the workplace, periodically check their wellbeing and evacuate if anyone is adversely affected 7. Prior to re -starting work in the area, review work to identify possible hazards 8. Damage: submit an accident report on the online accident reporting system at www.ehs.washington.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury - reporting. 8. Laboratory Floods If your laboratory is flooded, find the source of the water and shut the water off. If safe, also shut down any equipment that could cause a dangerous electrical situation during a flood. Cover equipment and desks if water is dripping onto them and get help quickly. During work hours, contact your building coordinator. After hours, call UW Police at 911 if on the UW Seattle Campus or Facilities Services emergency numbers ( refer to Appendix F) if at other locations. Notify the supervisor, Responsible Party or department administrator in charge of the flooding laboratory as soon as possible. If the water is contaminated by chemicals, call EH&S at 206 .543. 0467. For additional information , visit https:/ /ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/floods.pdf. The best method to clean up uncontaminated water is by using one water vacuum on the scene of the flood and another on the affected area below. Saturated materials (e.g., fabrics and cardboard) need to be dried within 48 hours or will need to be discarded to prevent mold growth. After the cleanup, submit an accident report on the online accident reporting system at www.ehs.washi ngton.edu/workplace/accident -and-injury -reporting. 9. Inclement Weather During thunderstorms, shut off electrical equipment that may be sensitive to voltage fluctuations.

Prior to vacating a laboratory, you must remove all chemicals, biological materials, radiological materials and any other hazardous materials and decontaminate all work surfaces. You must also remove all equipment and instrumentation (unless arrangements have been made otherwise) and any garbage or other it ems that will not be wanted by the new occupants. All work surfaces, the fume hood, and any equipment or instrumentation left in the lab must have a Cleaning and Decontamination form completed by the lab and attached to the surfaces. EH&S is available to assist with the clearance of your laboratory. It is helpful to contact EH&S a month or two before you move. Use Moving Out Checklist in Appendix E as a tool for making sure all requirements associated with moving out are completed. EH&S recommends that each laboratory or department develop a list of all the tasks and people assigned to each task. The responsibilities of the Responsible Party, Department, Project Manager (if there is one), and EH&S are listed below: 1. Responsibilities a. Responsible Party The Resp onsible Party (RP) is responsible for managing the safe removal of hazardous materials and decontamination of the laboratory and equipment when leaving, moving, or closing a laboratory. The RP is required to remove the hazards associated with their work an d to provide information about potential hazards (or lack thereof) remaining in the space. The RP is responsible for ensuring the removal of all chemical, biological , and radioactive materials , and their residue from the labs where work was conducted. The RP may delegate tasks to lab staff and colleagues as appropriate to their level of training, knowledge, and ability; however, in all cases, it remains the RP's responsibility to assure tasks are completed according to the guidelines and specified protocols. b. Project Manager The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring all steps of a construction or remodeling project are completed. For department -managed projects this person may be a department employee; for Facilities Services projects this person may be a Facilities Services employee. Whichever party contracts for project management services, the contracted individual assumes responsibility for assuring project tasks are completed according to UW policy, project plan and schedule. If the project is sending supplies, equipment, or instrumentation to Surplus, refer to Surplus guidelines : https://facilities.uw.edu/catalog/surplus/prepare.Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 162 of 261 December 5, 2022 c. Department The department is responsible for ensuring that Responsible Parties and designated Project Managers manage laboratory closures or moves responsibly. In the event a RP is no longer available to fulfill their duties, the Departmen t must ensure the completion of tasks ordinarily assigned to the RP. If hazardous materials are not responsibly managed and require removal by EH&S or by an outside contractor, the department will be responsible for incurred costs. Any regulatory action or fines resulting from improper management or disposal of chemical waste will be the responsibility of the department. If the department is sending supplies, equipment, or instrumentation to Surplus, refer to Surplus guidelines : https://facilities.uw.edu/catalog/surplus/prepare. Departments also retain records about chemical exposure and other chemical safety issues. (Refer to Section 8 - Record Keeping). d.

CAS stands for Chemical Abstracts Service, a Columbus, Ohio organization that indexes information published in Chemical Abstracts by the American Chemical Society and provides index guides by which information about particular subs tances may be located in the Abstracts when needed. CAS numbers identify specific chemicals and are assigned sequentially. ( Chemical Abstracts Service, Division of American Chemical Society, Box 3012, Columbus, OH 43210, 614 -447-3600, www.cas.org). Fun Fact: The CAS number takes the form of xxxxxx -yy-z, where the \"x\" series can be any number of 50 or greater up to 6 digits long, and \"z\" is a digital check derived by multiplying each \"y\" and \"x\" digit by a factor (the number of places away from the \"z\"), and summing these results. Then \"z\" should be the units digit in the sum. For example, CAS number 591 -78-7 is incorrect, because (8 x 1) + (7 x 2) + (1 x 3) + (9 x 4) + (5 x 5) equals 8 + 14 + 3 + 36 + 25 which equals 86. So the \"z\" should have been \"6.\" The number \"591 -78-6\" is a correct CAS is methyl -n- butyl ketone. (Note: Perhaps the \"z\" number was actually \"7,\" and a mistake was made at a different part of the n umber? Perhaps \"591 -79-7\" or \"591 -87-7\" was the number they meant to write down.) caustic See \"alkali\" central nervous system The brain and spinal cord.

An oxidizer or oxidizing material is a substance that yields oxygen readily to stimulate the combustion of organic matter such as ozone or chlorinated trisodium phosphate. oxidizers Chemicals, other than a blasting agents or explosives, th at initiate or promote combustion in other materials, thereby causing fire either of itself or through the release of oxygen or other gases (e.g. chlorate, permanganate, and nitrate compounds). palpitation Irregular rapid heartbeat. particularly -hazardous - substances -655 PEL Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The exposure limit established in accordance with the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA). The PEL may be a time -weighted average (TWA) limit of average exposures throughout the work day, or an exposure l imit for a shorter period of time. Additional information about Washington State's PELs is provided in the Employee Health Section of this manual. percent volatile by volume The percentage of a liquid or solid (by volume) that will evaporate at an ambient temperature of 70 \u00b0F (unless some other temperature is stated). Examples: butane, gasoline, and paint thinner (mineral spirits) are 100% volatile; their individual evaporation rates vary, but over a period of time each will evaporate completely. peroxidi zable chemicals Chemicals that may become shock sensitive or explosive when they oxidize to form an appreciable concentration of peroxides. Also referred to as \"peroxide -forming\" chemicals. pH The value that represents the acidity or alkalinity of an aque ous solution. The number is the logarithm, to the base 10, of the reciprocal of the hydrogen -ion concentration of a solution. Pure water has a pH of 7. The substance in an aqueous solution will ionize to various extents giving different concentrations of H+ and OH - ions. For example, the strongest acids have an excess of H+ ions and a pH of 1 to 3 (HCl, pH=1). The strongest bases have an excess of OH - ions and a pH of 11 to 13 (NaOH, pH = 12). The pH scale is logarithmic and the intervals are exponential, s o the progression of values represents far greater concentrations than one would suspect (i.e., pH of 3=10,000 to 1 ratio of H+ ions, while a pH of 4=1000 to 1, pH of 5=100 to 1).

Ratio of the mass of a body to the mass of an equal volume of water at 4 \u00b0C or othe specified temperature. If a volume of a material weighs 8 pounds, and a equal volume of water weighs 10 pounds, the material is said to have a specific gravity of 0.8 (8 divided by 10 = 0.8). Insoluble materials with specific gravity of less than 1.0 will float in ( or on) water. Insoluble materials with specific gravity greater than 1.0 will sink (or go to the bottom) in water. Most (but not all) flammable liquids have specific grav less than 1.0 and, if not soluble, will float on water - an important consideration f or fire suppression and spill cleanup. stability An expression of the ability of a material to remain unchanged.

The method of averaging exposures to airborne concentrations of a material when levels vary, based on duration of exposures to those levels. For example, an exposure of some chemical at 100 parts per million for 2 hours and 0 parts per million for 6 hours for an 8 -hour work day would be the first level times duration plus the second level times duration , divided by total work shift, i.e., (100x2+0x6) divided by 8 hours, or 25 parts per million. This is normally for an 8 hour work day, but other durations may apply as necessary. Used in conjunction with \"PEL\" and \"TLV.\" UEL or UFL Upper Explosive Limit o r Upper Flammable Limit. The highest concentration of a material in air that will produce an explosion or fire when it contacts an ignition source (high heat, electric arc, spark, or flame). A higher concentration of the material with a smaller percentage of oxygen or air may be too rich to be ignited. Care must be taken if using air or oxygen to dilute a high concentration too rich to burn, since at some point the mixture will fall within the explosive or flammable range and may be very hazardous.

Materials lighter than air have vapor densities less than 1.0. Materials heavier than air have vapor densities greater than 1.0. All vapors and gases will mix with air, but the lighter materials will tend to rise and dissi pate (unless confined). Heavier vapors and gases are likely to concentrate in low places (along or under floors; in dumps, sewers, and manholes; in trenches and ditches), where they may create fire, explosion, or health hazards. vapor pressure The pressur e exerted by a saturated vapor above its own liquid in a closed container. Vapor pressures reported on SDSs are in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) at 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C), unless stated otherwise. (Typically, chemicals with lower boiling points will have higher va por pressures; e.g., hexane with a boiling point of 69 \u00b0C has a vapor pressure of 100 mm Hg, while 1,3 -xylene with a boiling point of 139 \u00b0C has a vapor pressure of 10 mm Hg ventilation Circulation of air. vertigo A feeling of revolving in space; dizzine ss, giddiness. viscosity Measurement of the flow properties of material.

EARTHQUAKE PREPARATION CHECKLIST FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL The following checklist is designed to assist University Department Chairs, Responsible Parties and laboratory supervisors and personnel perform earthquake self -assessments. Use this list of questions to identify situations that may pose a problem in the event of an earthquake . 1. Preparing for a Major Earthquake If an earthquake occurred right now, where would you go for protection? Locate safe and danger spots in your area. Decide if you would go under a desk or table, in a safe corner, or out of the lab against a corridor wall. Consider flying glass hazards from windows and glass and falling hazard s from light fixtures, books, pictures, and equipment when selecting safe spots. Do you know the evacuation routes from your building? If you are unfamiliar with your evacuation route(s), refer to your department's Fire Safety Evacuation Plan (FSEP) or if still in use the Emergency Evacuation and Operations Plan (EEOP) or contact your evacuation warden or evacuation director. For further information on evacuation routes from your building, contact EH&S at 206 .685. 0341. Post a lab floor plan near laborat ory exits that shows exit routes. Do not leave the building until the tremors have stoppe d. Where is the primary evacuation assembly point (EAP) for your building, department, or work unit? Where is an alternate EAP in case your primary EAP happens to be d ownwind of a chemical or gas release or otherwise unusable ? Check your departmental health and safety plan or FSEP/EEOP for location(s) of EAPs. Are gas cylinders properly secured in an upright position? Are pressure regulators removed and cylinder caps in place on cylinders not in use? Are two cylinder straps or chains securely fastened to the lab wall for each cylinder ? Are chemicals stored properly? Are chemicals recapped and returned to their storage cabinets immediately after use? Are chemical storage cabinets closed and latched? Are chemical storage cabinets secured to prevent tipping or movement?Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Page 237 of 261 December 5, 2022 Are storage shelves equipped with lips or restraints to keep chemicals and glassware in place? Are waste and unwanted chemicals removed in a timely fashion? Are chemicals stored in secondary containment trays or tubs? Are non -compatible chemicals stored separately? Are fume hood sashes closed as far as possible to contain spills while still maintaining adequate ventilation rates? Are heavy pieces of equipment and furniture that might block exit routes secured? If your lab has only one exit, UW policy requires items be secure. Are exits and aisle ways maintained, and free and clear of obstructions? Avoid storing anything, even temporarily, that could impede a quick exit or cause injury. Do you have equipment and/or processes that could be damaged or pose a fire or health hazard if the power goes out? What contingency plans have been made to provide backup or emergency power to maintain critical systems? Are safety systems (e.g., fire extinguishers, safety showers, eyewashes) accessible and in proper operating condition? Does everyone in the lab know where they are and how to operate them? Are chemica l and biological spill kits available? Are food, water, flashlight, first- aid kit, radios and batteries available? 2. Operations after a Major Earthquake After the shaking stops: Assist injured or mobility impaired people in evacuating the building Turn off gas burners and the main gas supply valve to the lab Check quickly for fires, fire hazards, or spilled chemicals Close the lab door as you leave Bring emergency supplies (first -aid kit, flashlights, etc.) to the evacuation assembly point Report crucial items or hazards to the appropriate official at the evacuation assembly point Do not re -enter the building until the building has been declared safe for entry by the University's Applied Technology Council (ATC) -20 assessment teams or other trained professionals. Page 240 of 261 December 5, 2022 Environmental Health & Safety Department | www.ehs.washington.edu | LABORATORY SAFETY MANUAL Depending on the circumstances of the earthquake, you may be asked to stay out of the building for a few minutes to a few days -- or indefinitely. Develop long -term plans in case you cannot re -enter your laboratory. C ontact UW Office of Emergency Management at 206.765.7192 for assistance in developing Business Continuity Plans. Here are some items to consider: Which experiments and data are your first priorities? Do you have plans for routine tasks, such as taking care of lab animals or making certain you have enough liquid nitrogen for freezers? (Remember that normal distribution systems may not work, so you should have your own supply.) Do you have backup copies of important data? For free informational handouts on earthquake preparedness (including for home/family), call EH&S Training at 206.543.7201.
