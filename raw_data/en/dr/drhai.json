Kirat Samra from Mohali, Chandigarh asks... Dear Ma'am, I have been following your articles regularly with deep interest in everything about the facets of spirituality, especially the Healing Modalities section. Even if it sounds repetitive, I would like you to tell me why it is that energy healing works in cases where medical science gives up, and then miracles take place. After all, all the doctors of the world cannot be inadequate to mete out any kind of treatment, with all their specialised knowledge, and all their experience in their work and healings. What is it that is so special, or shall I say so specialised about alternative healing that the doctor has perhaps not yet understood? I must add, that I have always been interested in Healing people, and would like to take it up as a part of my mission in life, so please answer me through your esteemed column. Thank you very much, your advice will be valuable to help me move forward with my passion in life. Veena Minocha answers... Dear Kirat, it is indeed commendable that your passion is your mission, that is to heal people. Let me first begin by telling you that if this is the way you feel then you are truly one of God's chosen people, who is helping him to bring about peace on earth. For it is only when peace and perfection, in body and soul, is brought about in every human being, that the divine plan for ascension of all humans into the light can be fulfilled. And there is a sense of urgency about this healing, as this is to be accomplished in the shortest time possible, to move forward into the golden age. Medical science has addressed itself to healing the symptoms of most diseases, but has not yet realised that it is the holistic approach of healing body, mind and emotions, that is the most important object of being a healer. Mainstream medical doctors are now moving towards this holistic approach, and are realising that most problems are psychosomatic, that is the relation between these three aspects of the human existence is a reality, that they cannot get away from. In spiritual healing, or healing with alternative methods, the methodology is that all healing takes place when the three parts of human existence balance each other, and co-exist in a peaceful vibration. This is the basis of what we can call perfect health, or peaceful well-being. When a human being is in the state of peaceful well being, then even germs and bacteria cannot affect his health, for his immune system is strong enough to resist all disease. When a person is in this state of harmony, then all tension related problems, like heart attacks, cancers, blood pressure, cannot prevail. When a person is in a state of balance, then he does not get into accidents and hurt himself, as he is in total control over his bodily movements. Medical science has a long way to go before it realises that stuffing the human body with strong chemicals may suppress diseases for a while, but it requires an energetic balance of mind, body and emotions to sustain peaceful health and well being. The spiritual healer brings all these three aspects into a perfectly harmonious, and balanced state, so that the miracles, that you speak of, can occur in the normal way.
