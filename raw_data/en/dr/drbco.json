Meet our team of compassionate and open-minded health care providers. Our extended appointment times allow us the opportunity to get to know you and to address your health concerns with an integrative and personalized approach. Our goal is to support you in getting well and maintaining health. Mindful Pediatrics For 15 years, Mindful Pediatrics has transformed the way that pediatric care is offered. Mindful Pediatrics promotes the highest quality of care in a supportive and nurturing environment. We use our knowledge of general pediatrics, nutrition, mindfulness, and holistic medicine to guide our patients and their families in both preventative care and illness. Our providers select the most appropriate and supportive combination of conventional and alternative treatments to achieve the best outcome. Because getting to know you is the key to an accurate diagnosis and treatment, we spend a full hour with new patients. Follow-up appointments generally last between 20 and 40 minutes. Treatment plans will be guided by a comprehensive history and the evaluation of blood, urine, stool, or other testing. Recommendations will include the most appropriate evidence-based conventional and holistic treatment modalities, including dietary and lifestyle suggestions, nutritional supplements, and pharmaceutical medications, as needed.

Our passion is in working with individuals with challenging and chronic health conditions. Having navigated that road personally, we understand the importance of being supported along your journey. We have both the knowledge and compassion that is necessary to help you take an active role in your own healing process. Although nutrition is the major component of our work, we believe that your health is about more than what you eat. To achieve and sustain wellness, you must also look at those things that \"feed\" your physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

Dr. Roy, Don't worry, I won't write a letter after every appointment, but I wanted to write today and thank you since it was our first appointment. Lila hadn't been to another Pediatrician because we just couldn't find what we wanted: a Doctor who'd take time to understand our child and our family's needs, a comfortable atmosphere (where you don't worry your child will get sick just by going for a check-up), and solid guidance while still respecting our parental wishes. I knew when we read your brochure that your practice was something we wanted to be part of, and upon meeting you and having our appointment I know that you are the kind of doctor most people can only dream of for their child. To me, Debbie is a saving grace. I feel so partnered with in my goal to be well and thriving. Debbie is an amazing listener and provider of wisdom, knowledge, research and options. Not only is she masterful at what she does, she invites me into my own mastery and self-empowerment for my health and my life. I've lost track of how many people I've sent to her, she's THAT good! Dr. Roy, I've been meaning for a while now to write you and thank you for all you do. Finding your practice has completely changed our doctor experience for myself and for our children. I'm sure you hear this often, (my hope is that you do), your passion and skill for your craft are unbelievable and are a gift to the community you share it with. Your guidance to better health - and not just maintenance of symptoms- is something we were long searching for. I am continually amazed and impressed by what you offer and feel so lucky to have found you. With the deepest gratitude, Thank You. I have suffered from symptoms of IBS for years. I am so thrilled to have found Debbie. I have been symptom free since working with Debbie and know I will remain so with all the great information, ideas, recipes and wisdom I have received. It was a refreshing experience to work with someone with personal experience who had treated herself and then used the information to assist others. I highly recommend that everyone with any health issues to talk to Debbie. I no longer have the digestive problems associated with IBS or the stress of worrying about not feeling well while away from home. My daughter has stopped asking me why I never feel good. What a great result! Here's What's New...
