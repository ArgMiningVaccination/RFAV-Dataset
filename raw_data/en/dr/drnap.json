Humans have been keenly interested in the movement of individual animals and populations for millennia. Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle wrote about the motion of animals, and the associated philosophical and mathematical concepts, in his book, De Motu Animal- ium(Nussbaum 1978). Historically, it was critical to understand how and where wild food sources could be obtained. Thus, early humans were natural animal movementmodelers. In modern times, we are interested in the movement of animals for scien- tific reasons and for making decisions regarding the management and conservationof natural resources (Cagnacci et al. 2010). The study of wild animals can be challenging. Animals are often elusive and reside in remote or challenging terrain. Many animals have learned to minimize exposure toperceived threats, which, unfortunately for us, include the well-intentioned biologist approaching them with binoculars or a capture net. Therefore, it is no surprise that the development of animal-borne telemetry devices has revolutionized our ability tostudy animals in the wild (Cagnacci et al. 2010; Kays et al. 2015). Animal telemetry has helped us overcome many of the practical, logistical, and financial challenges ofdirect field observation. Telemetry data have opened windows that allow us to addresssome of the most fundamental ecological hypotheses about space use (\"Where is the animal?\"), movement (\"How did the animal get there?,\" \"Where could it go?\"), resource selection (\"Where does the animal like to be?\"), and behavior (\"What is the animal doing?\") (Figure 1.1). 1.1 BACKGROUND ON ANIMAL MOVEMENT Animal movement plays important roles in the fitness and evolution of species (e.g.,Nathan et al. 2008 ), the structuring of populations and communities (e.g., Turchin 1998), ecosystem function ( Lundberg and Moberg 2003), and responses to environ- mental change (e.g., Thomas et al. 2004; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2005 ;J\u00f8nsson et al. 2016). The scientific study of animal movement has a deep history, and we are unable to explore all of the ecological implications and methodological developmentsin a single volume. Instead, we focus on several specific inferential methods that can provide valuable ecological insights about animal movement and behavior from telemetry data. The importance of animal movement in larger-scale ecosystem function proba- bly inspired the Craighead brothers to develop and deploy the first radio collars ongrizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from Yellowstone National Park in the 1960s (Craig- head and Craighead 1972). Satellite tracking devices are now capable of pinpointing animal locations at any moment, remote sensing provides ever refined environmental 12 Animal Movement Environmental data Location data Auxiliary dataWhere was it? Discrete-time models (Chapters 5, 7) Spatial point processes (Chapters 4, 7) Continuous- time models (Chapters 6, 7)How did it get there? Where could it go? Where did it prefer to go? What was it doing? Data Question Chapter FIGURE 1.1 Relationships among data types, analytical methods, and some fundamental questions of movement ecology. Location data are the cornerstone of all of the analysis meth- ods described in this book. Environmental data, such as those acquired from remote sensing, areuseful in drawing connections between animals and their surroundings. Auxiliary bioteleme- try data, such as accelerometer or dive profile data, can help address questions about animal behavior. Dashed lines indicate where data can be helpful for addressing particular questions,but are not essential. data, and biotelemetry tags allow for the simultaneous collection of important physio- logical and behavioral information from wild animals. These technological advances will lead to a better understanding of how individual decisions affect demographicparameters and ultimately translate into population dynamics. In this sense, animal movement can provide the long-sought bridge between behavior, landscape ecology, and population dynamics (Lima and Zollner 1996; Wiens 1997; Morales et al. 2010 ; Kays et al. 2015). In what follows, we provide a brief summary of research findings, existing knowl- edge, and analytic approaches for important aspects of animal movement ecology. We organized these topics into 10 sections: 1. Population dynamics2. Spatial redistribution 3. Home ranges, territories, and groups 4. Group movement and dynamics 5. Informed dispersal and prospectingIntroduction 3 6. Memory 7. Individual condition 8. Energy balance 9. Food provision 10. Encounter rates and patterns 1.1.1 P OPULATION DYNAMICS In classical models of population dynamics, predators and prey encounter each otherin proportion to their overall abundance over space and reproductive rates decrease as the global population density increases. This is because traditional models of popula- tion and community dynamics assume we are dealing with many individuals that arewell mixed (Turchin 2003). Such \"mean field\" representations of population dynam- ics can provide good approximations when the physical environment is relatively homogeneous and organisms are highly mobile, or when organisms interact overlarge distances. However, when the external environment or the limited mobility of organisms results in lack of mixing, the conditions experienced by a particular mem- ber of a population or community can be quite different from the mean (Lloyd 1967;Ovaskainen et al. 2014; Matthiopoulos et al. 2015). That is, when per capita vital rates are affected by varying local conditions, the observed population and communitydynamics can differ markedly from mean field predictions. Population dynamics involve births, deaths, immigration, and emigration; mod- ern tracking technology, together with new statistical models, can greatly improveour understanding of these processes. The individuals that comprise a populationcan vary in several traits and individual behavior can change in response to inter- nal and external stimuli. Individual traits and behavior determine the way they interact with the environment and other organisms while the conditions that indi- viduals experience ultimately translate to their performance (i.e., growth, survival, and reproduction). Survival analysis can be used to model changes in hazard with time and in rela- tion to covariates such as location, age, body condition, and habitat type. Detailedtracking through satellite telemetry enables spatial information and survival datato be combined at small temporal scales, leading to an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the determinants of survival (Murray 2006; Haydon et al. 2008; Schick et al. 2013 ). Likewise, changes in movement behavior can be used to infer reproductive events in some species ( Long et al. 2009). However, to take full advan- tage of these data, new analytic techniques should take into account the sequential nature of individual survival and reproduction. For example, the chance of an animaldying of starvation depends on its history of encounters with food items and foraging decisions. Coupling demographic data with movement models is an area of active research, but is still somewhat nascent. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide a wayto formally connect animal encounter data with movement processes; we refer the interested reader to Royle et al. (2013) and references therein for additional details. The methods presented in this book will be critical for formally integrating locationdata and demographic data in future SCR modeling efforts.4 Animal Movement 1.1.2 S PATIAL REDISTRIBUTION Classical reaction-diffusion models, such as those used by Fisher (1937) to describe the spread of an advantageous mutation within a population assume that mortality and recruitment rates depend linearly on local population density and that individu-als move at random over a large and homogeneous area. Early implementations of these models were also used to describe the dynamics of population invasion and range expansion (e.g., Skellam 1951; Andow et al. 1990; Shigesada and Kawasaki 1997), and later, were embedded in a hierarchical statistical modeling framework (e.g., Wikle 2003; Hooten and Wikle 2008; Hooten et provide inference about spreading populations. Diffusion equations have been justified as a good approximation to the displace- ment of individuals performing a \"random walk.\" *Although we know that animals do not move at random, the diffusion approximation can still be sufficient at certain(usually large) scales and also serves as a null model to compare with more complex models (Turchin 1998). More general forms of movement can be taken into account by formulating spatial population models as integral equations. These have commonly been formulated indiscrete time, yielding integro-difference equations where local population growth iscombined with a \"redistribution kernel\" that describes the probability that an individ- ual moves from its current location to another one in a given time-step. The temporal scale of these models is usually set to match reproductive events so that the redistri- bution kernel represents successful dispersal rather than regular movement. A great deal of theoretical and empirical work has explored the consequences of kernel shape, particularly in the tail of the distribution, on invasion speed (Kot et al. 1996; Powell and Zimmermann 2004). There are many ways to make spatial population models more realistic and appro- priate for particular species, places, and scales of interest. A good starting point is to consider the spatial structure of the population, which is generally accepted as an important prerequisite for more accurate ecological predictions ( Durrett and Levin 1994; Hanski and Gaggiotti 2004 ).The spatial structure of populations can range from classical closed populations to a set of subpopulations with different degreesof interaction ( Thomas and Kunin 1999). As different degrees of connectivity among subpopulations can have important dynamical consequences, researchers are increas- ingly interested in understanding how connectivity arises from the interaction among individual phenotypes, behaviors, and the structure of landscapes. One particular feature of the models described thus far is that every individual is assumed to move according to the same kernel (whether Gaussian or otherwise).However, detailed tracking of individual movements consistently reveals differencesamong individuals. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown how the char- acteristics of redistribution kernels can depend on differences among individuals (Skalski and Gilliam 2000 ; Fraser et al. 2001; Morales and Ellner 2002 ;Delgado *We describe random walks in discrete and continuous time in Chapters 5 and 6. We describe redistribution kernels and integral equation models for movement in Chapters 4 and 6. See Chapter 2 for a brief primer on spatial statistics.Introduction 5 and Penteriani 2008), and on the interplay between individual behavior and features of the underlying landscape (Johnson et al. 1992; McIntyre and Wiens 1999 ;Fahrig reac- tions produces leptokurtic (i.e., heavy tailed) redistribution kernels when asubset of individuals consistently moves longer distances than others (Skalski and Gilliam 2000; Fraser et al. 2001). Several factors can explain why two individuals belonging to the same population move differently. They may be experiencing different environments of heteroge-neous landscapes; they can also have different phenotypes or condition, different past experiences (e.g., Frair et al. 2007), or even different \"personalities\" ( Fraser et al. 2001; Dall et al. 2004). In a theoretical study, Skalski and Gilliam (2003) modeled animals switching between fast and slow random walk movement states and foundthat the resulting redistribution kernel depended on the total time spent in each of thestates and not on the particular sequence of changes. This theoretical result highlights the importance of animals' time budgets for scaling movement processes (Figure 1.2). It is common to consider that individuals have a small set of movement strategies (Blackwell 1997; Nathan et al. 2008), and the time allocation to these different behav-iors (or \"activity budgets\") can depend on the interaction between their motivation and the structure of the landscape they occupy ( Morales et al. 2004 ,2005). The results EnvironmentAllospecifics ConspecificsInternal stateBehavioral time allocation SurvivalRedistribution ReproductionPast experiences FIGURE 1.2 Mechanistic links between animal movement and population dynamics adapted from Morales et al. (2010). We consider an unobserved individual internal state that inte- grates body condition (e.g., energy reserves, reproductive status). Several factors affect the dynamics of this internal state, including social interactions with conspecifics, trophic or other interaction with allospecifics (other species), and abiotic environmental effects and dynamics.Internal state dynamics determine the organism's time allocation to different behaviors (e.g., food acquisition, predator avoidance, homing, and landscape exploration) but is also modu- lated by past experiences and phenotypic trails such as behavioral predispositions. As different behaviors imply different movement strategies, the time budget determines the properties of the spatial redistribution that describes space use. Time allocation to different behaviors alsoaffects individual survival and reproduction, and hence, overall population dynamics.6 Animal Movement ofSkalski and Gilliam (2003) imply that knowing the fraction of time allocated to each behavior makes it possible to derive suitable redistribution kernels. A common reaction in the visual inspection of movement data is to intuit that individuals are moving differently at different times. As a result, several techniques (including many ad hoc procedures) have been developed to identify and model changes in movement behavior from trajectory data (reviewed in Patterson et al. 2008; Schick et al. 2008; Gurarie et al. 2016 ). Clustering models, such as those we describe in Chapter 5, can be difficult to reliably implement because biologicallydifferent movement behaviors can lead to very similar trajectories. For example, itmay be difficult to distinguish relative inactivity (e.g., resting) from intense foraging, within a small patch, based on horizontal trajectory alone. However, as physiological and other information becomes available through biotelemetry devices, we may gaingreater insight into how animals allocate time to different tasks and how this allo- cation changes in different environments (McClintock et al. 2013), thus providing a mechanistic way to model redistribution kernels conditional on individual state. Another result from Skalski and Gilliam (2003) is that a mixture of movement states converges to simple diffusion if given enough time. The sum of nindependent and identically distributed random variables with finite variance will be Gaussiandistributed as nincreases. Thus, if all individuals in a population move according to the same stochastic process, we would expect that, at some time after the initi-ation of movement, the distribution of distance moved becomes Gaussian becausethe distance traveled is the sum of movement vectors. However, this depends on the rate of convergence and independence assumption. Still, similar results may relate to the interaction between individual behavior and landscape structure ( Morales 2002; Levey et al. 2005) and are the focus of ongoing research. We return to redistribution kernels for animal movement in Chapters 4 through 6. In particular, we consider spatial redistribution from three different perspectives (i.e., point processes, discrete-time processes, and continuous-time processes) and high- light the relevant literature associated with each. We also show how to scale up fromLagrangian to Eulerian models for movement in Chapter 6. 1.1.3 H OMERANGES ,TERRITORIES, AND GROUPS Many animals have clearly defined home ranges or territories (Borger et al. 2008).If not, they usually exhibit some form of site fidelity and revisitation patterns thatare not captured by simple random walks. Most likely, these animals will spend their reproductive life in a region that is small compared to their movement capa- bilities. Substantial progress has been made in developing mechanistic models ofanimal movement with territorial behavior (e.g., Moorcroft et al. 1999; Smouse et al. 2010; Kenkre 2014). However, territoria- lity models typically describe the space use by particular individuals (or members ofa wolf pack, for example) rather than an entire population. As a result, they have not yet been linked to models of population demography. For territorial animals, the carrying capacity of a particular region or landscape can be determined by competition for space. When the environment provides a limitednumber of essential items, such as nest cavities, the maximum number of breedersIntroduction 7 is bounded and surplus individuals form a population of nonbreeders referred to as \"floaters\" (Brown 1969; ). When dispersal morta- lity create vacancies in previously occupied territories, floaters may become a crucialpopulation reserve for filling these empty territories. Floaters can also have a negativeeffect on population growth through interference, conflict, or disturbance. Further- more, the aggressive behavior of breeders can also decrease the carrying capacity of the population. We describe basic methods for estimating home ranges and core areas in Chapter 4, and discuss methods for modeling interactions among individuals at the end of Chap-ter 5. However, the formal statistical modeling of floaters, together with individual- level behavior and territoriality is still developing and an open area of research. 1.1.4 G ROUP MOVEMENT AND DYNAMICS Understanding the distribution of social animals over landscapes requires scaling up from individual movement patterns to groups of individuals and populations ( Okubo et al. 2001). Most models of group dynamics focus on relatively short temporal scales(Couzin et al. 2005; Eftimie et al. 2007; Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015). However, the interaction between the group structure of a population and the movement of individuals is also relevant at longer time scales (e.g., Fryxell et al. 2007). Long time scales in group dynamics are particularly relevant for reintroduced species, where a balance of spread and coalescence processes will determine how individuals distribute themselves over the landscape. Often, individual survival and fecundity are higher in groups, so that the successful persistence of the introduced popula-tion may depend on coalescence dominating and limiting the spreading process, thereby enabling the establishment of a natural group structure within the release area. Haydon et al. (2008) developed movement models for North American elk ( Cervus canadensis), reintroduced to Ontario, where, as in Morales et al. (2004), animals canswitch between exploratory (large daily displacements and small turning angles) andencamped behavior (small daily displacements and frequent reversals in direction). The rate of switching among these movement modes depended on whether individu- als were part of a group or not. Haydon et al. (2008) combined their movement models with analysis of mortality and fecundity to build a spatially explicit, individual-based model for the dynamics of the reintroduced elk population. Their analysis showed that elk moved farther when they were solitary than when they were in a group, andthat mortality risk increased for individuals that moved progressively away from the release location. The simulation model showed how the population rate of increase and the spatial distribution of individuals depended on the balance of fission andfusion processes governing group structure. New approaches for studying the interaction among individuals in groups are appearing regularly in the literature. For example, Scharf et al. (In Press) developed a discrete-time model that captures the alignment and attraction of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in Antarctica, and Russell et al. (2016b) used point processes to model interactions among individual guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Using high tem-poral resolution telemetry data from a group of baboons (Papio anubis )i nK e n y a , Strandburg-Peshkin et al. (2015) analyzed individual movement in relation to one8 Animal Movement another. They found that, rather than following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow others when multiple initiators of movement agree, suggesting a democratic collective action emerging from simple rules. In a study of fission- fusion dynamics of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), Ramos-Fern \u00b4andez and Morales (2014) found that group composition and cohesion affected the chance that a partic- ular individual will leave or join a group. As another example, Delgado et al. (2014) found that dispersing juveniles of eagle owl (Bubo bubo) were generally attracted toconspecifics, but the strength of attraction decreased with decreasing proximity to other individuals. However, despite this progress, models for animals that decide toleave their territory or abandon a group, and how they explore and choose where to establish new territories or home ranges, have yet to appear in the literature. 1.1.5 I NFORMED DISPERSAL AND PROSPECTING Dispersal involves the attempt to move from a natal or breeding site to another breed-ing site (Clobert 2000), and is essential for species to persist in changing environments (Ronce 2007). The redistribution modeling ideas we introduced in the previous sec-tions represent dispersal as a random process that may be sensitive to the spatial structure of the landscape or the presence of conspecifics. However, there is a great deal of evidence indicating that individuals are capable of sophisticated and informeddecision-making when choosing a new place to live (Bowler and Benton 2005; Stamps et al. 2005, 2009). Clobert et al. (2009) proposed the concept of \"informed dispersal\" to convey the idea that individuals gather and exchange information at all three stages of dispersal (i.e., departure, transience, and settlement). Thus, movement involves not only the exchange of individuals among habitat patches but also informa- tion transfer across the landscape. Animals can acquire information about the environ- ment by \"looking\" at others' morphology, behavior, or reproductive success ( Danchin et al. 2004; Dall et al. 2005). For example, in an experiment with the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara ),Cote and Clobert (2007) quantified emigration rate from artificial enclosures that received immigrants. They found that when local populations received immigrants that were reared under low population density, the emigration rate of thelocal population increased, providing evidence that immigrants supplied information about the density of surrounding populations, probably via their phenotype. We only have a rudimentary understanding of how individuals integrate different sources of information to make movement and dispersal decisions. Long-term track-ing is needed to study how animals adjust to the changing characteristics of their home ranges or territories, and under what conditions they are likely to search for anew home. Detailed tracking of juveniles may shed light on the processes of explo- ration (i.e., transience) and settlement. In particular, movement data can be used to test ideas about search strategies, landscape exploration, and the importance of pastexperience in biasing where animals decide to attempt breeding. 1.1.6 M EMORY The importance of previous experiences and memory is increasingly being recognized and explicitly considered in the analysis of telemetry data (e.g., Dalziel et al. 2008; McClintock et 2013; Merkle et al.Introduction 9 2014). Smouse et al. (2010) provide a summary of the approaches used to include memory in movement models. Formulating memory models has largely been a the- oretical exercise but the formal connection with data is possible. For example, the approach used to model the effect of scent marking in mechanistic home range mod-els (Moorcroft and Lewis 2013) could be easily adapted to model memory processes. Avgar et al. (2015) fit a movement model that included perceived quality of visited areas and memory decays to telemetry data from migrating Caribou. It is less clearwhat role memory plays in population dynamics. Forester et al. (2007) describe how certain discrete-time movement models can be reformulated to provide inference about memory. We explain these ideas in Chapter 5.In continuous-time models, Hooten and Johnson (2016) show how to utilize basis function specifications for smooth stochastic processes to represent different types of memory and perception processes. We discuss these functional movement modeling approaches in Chapter 6. 1.1.7 I NDIVIDUAL CONDITION Recognizing that the contribution of a particular individual to the population is afunction of its fitness has historically promoted the development of physiological-, age-, and Diekmann 2014). Body condition integrates nutritional intake and demands, affecting both survival and reproduction. For example, studies of ungulates liv- ing in seasonal environments have found that percent body fat in early winter isa very good predictor for whether animals die, live without reproducing, or live and reproduce (Coulson et al. 2001; Parker et al. 2009 ). Also, many populations show \"carryover effects\" where conditions experienced during a time period influ-ence vital rates in future periods, which has the potential to generate many different population responses (Ratikainena et al. 2008; Harrison et al. 2011). Movement decisions and habitat use affect energy balance and body condition in animals. Linking individual condition to movement and space use is challenging because we usually need to recapture individuals to assess percent body fat, for exam-ple. However, some marine mammals perform \"drift dives,\" using their buoyancy to change depth without active propulsion and with their rate of drift determined largely by their lipid-to-lean-mass ratio Biuw et al. (2003). Working with South-ern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina ),Schick et al. (2013) modeled changes in individual condition as a function of travel distance and foraging events. Theyalso linked changes in behavior due to human disturbances to population-leveleffects. The animal movement models we describe in Chapters 4 through 6 are mostly focused on modeling individuals. However, when scaling up inference to the pop-ulation level (using random effects for parameters or other hierarchical modeling approaches), it may be important to account for variation in body condition among individuals to help describe differences in movement parameters. See Sections 4.5 and 5.2 for examples of accounting for individual-level differences when obtaining inference at the population level.10 Animal Movement 1.1.8 E NERGY BALANCE Many aspects of life history evolution, behavioral ecology, and population dynamics depend on how individuals consume resources and on how they allocate energy togrowth and reproduction. Food acquisition is an important driver of animal movement to the point that relationships between scaling of space use and daily distance traveled in relation to body mass and trophic requirements has been hypothesized ( Jetz et al. 2004; Carbone et al. 2005). Technological developments in biotelemetry allows the possibility of observing a suite of relevant physiological data such as heart rate and core temperature, in addi-tion to individual location (Cooke et al. 2004; Rutz and Hays 2009). Furthermore, accelerometers can be used for detailed movement path reconstruction and for record-ing energy expenditure, activity budgets (i.e., ethograms), and rare behavioral eventssuch as prey captures (Wilson et al. 2007, 2008; Williams et al. 2014; Bidder et al. 2015). Combined with detailed environmental maps, these data could lead to empiri-cally based models of animal performance in the wild, linking behavioral decisionswith space use, survival, and reproduction (Figure 1.2). The formal integration of energy balance information into dynamic statistical ani- mal movement models is still in early development stages (Shepard et al. 2013). However, many approaches we describe in Chapters 4 through 6 allow for the use of auxiliary data pertaining to energy-intensive behavior. For example, Sec-tion 5.2.5 describes how to integrate dive data for marine mammals into discrete-time movement models. 1.1.9 F OODPROVISION Food acquisition in poor habitats (or in good habitats that have been depleted) demands more searching time and energy, which is reflected in their movement pat- terns (e.g., Powell 1994). These effects are best documented in central place foragers such as nesting birds or pinnipeds that forage at sea but breed on land. Many of these animals forage at particular oceanographic features (Boersma and Rebstock 2009) that change in location and quality from year to year. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding at Punta Tombo, Argentina showed a decreasein reproductive success with increasing average foraging trip duration ( Boersma and Rebstock 2009). Also, penguins stayed longer at feeding sites in more distant foragingareas, presumably to feed themselves and recover from the increased cost of swim-ming (Boersma and Rebstock 2009 ). Thus, satellite telemetry technology has allowed a better understanding of the interplay between landscape or seascape variability andbreeding success. In Chapter 5, we show how to use discrete-time movement models to cluster ani- mal paths into different behavioral types, which can help identify food acquisitionmodes based on telemetry data. We also demonstrate how to account for food-relatedaspects of movement in the continuous-time setting discussed in Chapter 6. 1.1.10 E NCOUNTER RATES AND PATTERNS The \"functional response\" is a key component of population models that includetrophic interactions; it describes the rate of prey consumption by individual predatorsIntroduction 11 as a function of prey density ( Holling 1959a ,b). The dynamics and persistence of interacting populations usually depend on the shape and dimensionality of func- tional responses ( Turchin 2003). Mechanistically, the functional response depends on encounter rates. Thus, a useful null model for encounter rates is one where indi- viduals move randomly and independently of each other. More than 150 years ago, Maxwell (1860) calculated the expected rates of molecular collisions of an ideal gas as a function of density, particle size, and speed.*The ideal gas model has been used and rediscovered in many ways, including Lotka's justification of predator-prey encounters being proportional to predator speed and size and to predator and prey densities. As a recent example, the scaling of home ranges with body size derived byJetz et al. (2004) assumes that the proportion of resources lost to neighbors is related to encounter rates as calculated from the ideal gas model for known scaling relationships of speed, population density, and detection distance. The thorough review by Hutchinson and Waser (2007) shows many more examples of the application of Maxwell's model plus several refinements, including differentassumptions about detection, speed, and density. Recently, Gurarie and Ovaskainen (2013) presented analytical results and a taxonomy for a broad class of encounterprocesses in ecology. The movement of animals almost certainly deviates from theassumptions of Maxwell's model and we can use information about the characteristics of movement paths from real animals to derive better predictions of encounter rates, or in the case of carnivores, kill rates (e.g., Merrill et al. 2010). Environmental heterogeneity can also be an important determinant in encounter rates and group dynamics. For example, Flierl et al. (1999) used individual-based models of fish groups to study the interplay among the forces acting on the indi-viduals and the transport induced by water motion. They found that flows often enhanced grouping by increasing the encounter rate among groups and thereby pro- moting merger into larger groups. In general, habitat structure will affect encounter rates among individuals of the same species but also among predators and prey. Encounter rates and population dynamics are also altered when predators or prey form social groups. F r y x e l le ta l .(2007) developed simple models of group-dependent functional responses and applied them to the Serengeti ecosystem. They found thatgrouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest, suggestingthat social groups, rather than individuals, were the basic building blocks for these predator-prey systems. As satellite tracking devices become more affordable, and larger numbers of individuals can be tracked in the same study areas, we can expect to learn moreabout interactions among individuals. Furthermore, the use of additional telemetry technologies can make this more feasible. For example, Prange et al. (2006)u s e dproximity detectors in collars fitted to free-living raccoons and were able to obtain accurate information in terms of detection range, and duration of contact. Animal- borne video systems also may help identify social interactions and foraging eventsfor a focal individual (Hooker et al. 2008; Moll et al. 2009). Hence, the study of encounters offers great opportunities for marrying theory with data and to greatlyimprove our understanding of spatial dynamics. *Assuming independent movements in any direction and with normally distributed velocities. Although the grouping effect breaks down for strong flows.12 Animal Movement As animals face similar constraints and environmental heterogeneity, it is expected that they will exhibit similar movement rules and patterns. Early enthusiasm sur- rounding Levy flights and walks is now being taken with a bit more caution (e.g., Pyke 2015), but it is valuable to identify common movement rules based on indi-vidual animal's morphology, physiology, and cognitive capacity. There is also much theoretical and empirical work needed to better understand the costs and benefits of different movement strategies. Scharf et al. (In Press) described a method for infer- ring time-varying social networks in animals based on telemetry data. Using datafrom killer whales, Scharf et al. (In Press) developed a model that was motivated by encounter rate approaches that clustered similarities in movement patterns to learn about underlying binary networks that identified groups of individuals and how they change over time. We discuss these ideas more at the end of Chapter 5. 1.2 TELEMETRY DATA Animal telemetry data are varied. This variation is an advantage because different field studies often have very different objectives and logistical (or financial) con- straints. At a minimum, most animal-borne telemetry devices provide informationabout animal location. The earliest devices were very high frequency (VHF) radio tags designed for large carnivores and ungulates. *VHF tags emit a regular radio wave signal (or pulse) at a specific frequency. A beeping sound (or ping) is heardwhenever the signal is picked up by a nearby receiver that is tuned to this frequency, and the pings get louder as the receiver approaches the tag. As one hones in on thepings, the location of an animal with a VHF tag can be either closely approximated or confirmed by visual sighting. Accurate radio telemetry data acquisition requires practice and, often, triangulation. Radio tracking can sometimes be very challeng-ing from the ground; thus, radio relocation surveys are often performed from small aircraft. Many VHF tags include a sensor that triggers a faster pulse rate after a pre- specified length of inactivity that is believed to be indicative of mortality or otherevents (e.g., hibernation). The analysis of radio telemetry data has historically been limited to descriptive statistical models of space use, home range delineation, sur- vival, and abundance (e.g., White and Garrott 1990 ;Millspaugh and Marzluff 2001 ; Manly et al. 2007), but more sophisticated movement models have also been applied to radio telemetry data (e.g., Dunn and Gipson 1977; Moorcroft et al. 1999). Early VHF tags were too large for many smaller species, but improvements in battery tech- nology now permit tags that are small enough for birds and even insects. The primary limitations of VHF tags are the limited range of radio signals and the cost and effort required to reliably locate animals via radio tracking. Radio tracking technology may seem archaic in the age of smart phones, but it still offers a relatively inexpensive and long battery-lived alternative to modern telemetry devices. Since the mid-1990s, modern telemetry devices have been capable of storing and transmitting information about an individual animal's location as well as internal and *We refer to \"tags\" generically here; for most terrestrial mammals, the telemetry devices are attached to neck collars and fitted to the individual animals. Telemetry devices have been fitted to animals in avariety of other ways.Introduction 13 external characteristics (e.g., heart rate, temperature, depth/altitude). Because modern telemetry devices can include additional sensors unrelated to location acquisition, the terms \"biotelemetry\" and \"biologging\" are increasingly used for describing modern animal telemetry techniques and devices (e.g., Cooke et al. 2004). There are two main types of modern (non-VHF) animal telemetry tags. These are often called storing (or \"archival\") and sending (or \"transmitting\") tags. Archival tags can be smaller than transmitting tags and store vast amounts of biotelemetry information, such as high- resolution accelerometer data, but they possess no mechanism for data transmission. Therefore, archival tags must be recovered from the animal before any data can beaccessed. Transmitting tags send data in the form of electromagnetic waves to nearby receivers (similar to VHF tags) or to orbiting communications satellites. Satellite transmitting tags allow researchers to retrieve biotelemetry data without needing torecover or be close to the tag. Similar to archival tags, transmitting tags can store vast amounts of data. However, satellite tags require line of sight for transmission, and this limitation often necessitates careful consideration when designing and programmingsatellite tags. For example, marine animals do not surface long or frequently enough to transmit large quantities of biotelemetry data, so researchers must often make dif- ficult trade-offs between data quality and quantity based on the specific objectives oftheir study (e.g., Breed et al. 2011). Whether of the archival or transmitting type, most modern biotelemetry tags rely on satellites for determining an animal's location. Tags that are equipped with aninternal global positioning system (GPS) usually provide the most accurate locations currently available. GPS location errors (i.e., the distance between the observed and true location of the individual) tend to be less than 50 m, but GPS tags need to transmit larger data payloads and tend to be larger in size. Therefore, GPS tags are ideal for larger, terrestrial species in open habitat, but they are typically unsuitable for aquaticspecies such as marine mammals and fish. Although not as accurate as GPS, Argos tags are a popular option for marine and small terrestrial species. Argos tags rely on a system of polar-orbiting satellites todecode the animal's location from a relatively tiny packet of transmitted information. Argos tags can quickly transmit data to satellites within the brief intervals that marine mammals surface to breathe because the transmission packets are small. The maindrawback of Argos tags is the limited size and duration of transmissions; this limits the quantity and quality of onboard biotelemetry data that can be recovered. Argos tags tend to perform best at higher latitudes (due to the polar orbits of the satellites),but location errors can typically range from hundreds to thousands of meters (e.g., Costa et al. 2010; Brost et al. 2015). * As a compromise between GPS and Argos, Fastloc-GPS (Wildtrack Telemetry System Limited, Leeds, UK) tags compress a snapshot of GPS data and quicklytransmit via the Argos satellite system. With location errors typically between 50 and 1000 m, Fastloc-GPS is considerably more accurate than Argos overall. Biotelemetry technology is rapidly improving, and there are many tag designs and data collection capabilities that we have not covered in this brief introduction. These *We describe specific aspects of Argos data and potential remedies in Chapters 4 and 5. See Kays et al. (2015) for a recent overview of tag technology.14 Animal Movement include light-sensing \"geologgers\" for smaller species (e.g., Bridge et al. 2011), archival \"pop-up\" tags popular in fisheries (e.g., Patterson et al. 2008), proximity detectors (e.g., Ji et al. 2005), acoustic tags (e.g., McMichael et al. 2010), \"life his- tory\" tags (Horning and Hill 2005), accelerometer tags (e.g., Lapanche et al. 2015), and automatic trajectory representation from video recordings (P \u00b4erez-Escudero et al. 2014). In what follows, we primarily focus on the analysis of location data such as those obtained from VHF, GPS, and Argos tags. However, many of the meth- ods we present can utilize location information arising from other sources, as well as incorporate auxiliary information about the individual animal's internal and exter-nal environment that is now regularly being collected from modern biotelemetry tags. Winship et al. (2012) provide a comparison of the fitted movement of several different marine animals when using GPS, Argos, and light-based geolocation tags. 1.3 NOTATION A wide variety of notation has been used in the literature on animal movement data and modeling. This variation in statistical notation used makes it challenging to main-tain consistency in a comprehensive text on the subject. We provided this section, along with Table 1.1, in an attempt to keep expressions as straightforward as possi- ble. We recommend bookmarking this section on your first reading so that you mayreturn to it quickly if the notation becomes confusing. Conventional telemetry data consist of a finite set of spatially graphic locations ( S{s 1,...,si,...,sn}) representing the individual's observed location at a set of times spanning some temporal extent of interest (e.g., a season or year). We use the notation, {1,...,n}to represent the corresponding true posi- tions of the animal. Sometimes, the observed telemetry data are assumed to be the true positions (i.e., no observation error); however, in most situations, they will be dif- ferent. The times at which locations are observed can be thought of as fixed and partof the \"design,\" or as observed random variables. In either case, a statistical notation with proper time indexing becomes somewhat tricky. To remain consistent with the broader literature on point processes (and with Chapter 2), we assume that there arentelemetry observations collected at times t(t 1,...,ti,...,tn)/primesuch that tiT andtT. The seemingly redundant time indexing accounts for the possibility of irregularly spaced data in time. If the differences (/Delta1 i=titi1) between two time points at which we have telemetry observations are all equal, we could just as easily use the direct time indexing where the data are stfort=1,...,T. In that case, we have T=n. From a model-building perspective, it is sometimes less cumbersome to index telemetry observations in time (i.e., st) and deal with temporal irregularity dur- ing the implementation. However, there are some situations, for example, when the points are serially dependent, where we need the /Delta1inotation. A further perspective on notation arises when considering that the true animal location process is a continu-ous process in time. To formally recognize this, we often index the observed locationvectors as s(t i)(or(ti), in the case of the true positions). The parenthetical notation at least admits that we are often modeling animal locations as a continuous function.Thus, prepare yourself to see all types of indexing, both in this text and in the vastanimal movement literature.Introduction 15 TABLE 1.1 Statistical Notation Notation Definition i Observation index for i=1,...,ntotal observations. t Time point at which the data or process occurs (in the units of interest).

Often used to say that one probability distribution is proportional to another (i.e., only differs by a scalar multiplier). 1.4 STATISTICAL CONCEPTS We focus mostly on parametric statistical models*in this book; thus, we rely on both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models using maximum likelihood. Occasionally, for example, in Chapters 2 through 4, we present statistical methods that are nonpara-metric or involve implementation methods that do not involve Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches. A generic data model statement will appear as y i[yi|], *Parametric statistical models involve the specification of known probability distributions with parameters that are unknown but estimated in the model fitting procedure.16 Animal Movement where yiare the observations (we use sifor telemetry observations instead of yi)f o r i=1,...,n,are the data model parameters, and the bracket notation \" [\u00b7]\" repre- sents a probability distribution. The data model is often referred to as the \"likelihood\" by Bayesians, but the likelihood used in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)is proportional to the joint distribution of the data conditioned on the parameters. When the observations are conditionally independent, the likelihood is often writ- ten as [y|]=/producttext n i=1[yi|], where individual data distributions can be multiplied to obtain the joint distribution because of independence. To fit the model using MLE, the likelihood is usually maximized numerically to find the optimal parameter values . The Bayesian approach involves the specification of a probability model for the parameters, [], that depend on fixed hyperparameters assumed to be known. The prior probability distribution should contain information about the parameters that is known before the data are collected, except for cases where regularization-basedmodel selection is desired ( Hooten and Hobbs 2015), in which case, the prior can be tuned based on a cross-validation procedure. Rather than maximizing the likelihood,the Bayesian approach seeks to find the conditional distribution of the parametersgiven the data (i.e., the posterior distribution) [|y]=[y|][] /integraltext [y|][]d, (1.1) where yis a vector notation for all the observations and the denominator in Equa- tion1.1equates to a scalar constant after the data have been observed. For complicated models, the multidimensional integral in the denominator of Equation 1.1cannot be obtained analytically (i.e., exactly by pencil and paper) and must be either numer-ically calculated or avoided using a stochastic simulation procedure. Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC; Gelfand and Smith 1990) allows us to obtain samples from the posterior distribution while avoiding the calculation of the normalizing constant in the denominator of Equation 1.1. MCMC algorithms have many advantages (e.g., easy to develop), but also limitations (e.g., can be time consuming to run). Hierarchical models are composed of a sequence of nested probability distribu- tions for the data, the process, and the parameters (Berliner 1996). For example, abasic Bayesian hierarchical model is y i,j[yi,j|zi,], (1.2) zi[zi|], (1.3) [], (1.4) [], (1.5) where ziis an underlying process for individual iandyi,jare repeated measurements for each individual (j =1,...,J). Notice that the process model parameters also require a prior distribution if the model is Bayesian. The posterior for this model is aIntroduction 17 generalized version of Equation 1.1such that [z,,|y]=[y|z,][z|][][]/integraltext/integraltext/integraltext [y|z,][z|][][]dzdd. (1.6) Throughout the remainder of this book, we use both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models for statistical inference in the settings where they are appropriate. Many com- plicated hierarchical models are easier to implement from a Bayesian perspective,but may not always be necessary. Hobbs and Hooten (2015) provide an accessible description of both Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods and model-building strate-gies as well as an overview of basic probability and fundamental approaches for fittingmodels. Hereafter, we remind the reader of changes in notation and modeling strate- gies as necessary without dwelling on the details of a full implementation because those can be found in the referenced literature. 1.5 ADDITIONAL READING The timeless reference describing the mathematics of animal movement processes is Turchin (1998), and while newer references exist, Turchin (1998) is still the default for many scientists. For a newer synthesis, the special issue in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B provided a cross section of contempo- rary ideas for modeling animal movement and analyzing telemetry data (see Cagnacci et al. 2010 for an overview). Schick et al. (2008) proposed a general hierarchical modeling structure to modeling telemetry data that many contemporary efforts now follow. Historical, but still very relevant, references describing approaches for collecting and analyzing telemetry data include White and Garrott (1990), Kenward (2000), Millspaugh and Marzluff (2001), and Manly et al. (2007), although they focused more on vital rates (e.g., survival), resource selection, and home range estimation from radio telemetry data because that technology preceded current satellite telemetry devices. Connecting telemetry data with population demographic data is still nascent. How- ever, the field of SCR models is advancing rapidly and a few developments of SCRmodels have formally incorporated telemetry data to better characterize space use andresource selection. Also, individual-based movement models, in general, provide us with a better understanding about how animals are interacting with each other and their environment and the learning that is gained from fitting them can be used to develop smart demographic models that best account for features of population and community dynamics that depend on movement.SEAL AND SEAL LION MEDICINE # This chapter is excerpted from CRC Handbook of Marine Mammal Medicine, Third Edition by Frances M.D. Gulland, Leslie A.

GULLAND, SHAWN P. JOHNSON, CLAIRE A. SIMEONE, AND SOPHIE T. WHORISKEY Introduction Seals and sea lions are commonly managed in display facili- ties and rehabilitated after stranding, with much of the medi-cine presented here learned from care of the California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ), northern fur Mirounga angustirostris ). While disease prevalences vary widely across species and environment, much of the knowledge gained from care of these more com - mon species may be applied to lesser known species. Husbandry Pools, Haul-Out Areas, and Enclosures All pinnipeds require both water and haul-out space. Although seals and sea lions can survive without access to water for weeks at a time, they appear more content when given free access to water. Most pinnipeds will eat more readily when offered food in water, particularly in a rehabilitation situation. Fur seals will defecate and groom when given access to a pool; if left in a dry haul-out area, they may appear clinically depressed and fur quality may be compromised by contact with urine and feces. Pool design should aim at accommodat - ing the behavioral and physical needs of the animals housed, as well as maintaining water quality (see Chapter 31 ). For otariids, the pool may be sunken below ground or raised, with access by ramps. As phocids do not have the climbing abilities of otariids, a sunken pool with the water level close to the edge to allow easy exit from the pool is preferred. Debilitated pinnipeds may have difficulty exiting pools, regardless of design, though gently sloping sides or ledges Contents Introduction .......................................................................... 893 902 System ............................................................ 903 System ............................................................ Nervous System ................................................................ 904 Surgery 9:10:32 PM894 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine just below the surface of the water both facilitate the egress of any species and allow seals to rest in shallow water. Pinnipeds should be housed in salt water; however, they are often housed in freshwater systems due to economic or logistical constraints. Ophthalmic problems are more com - mon in freshwater than in salt water, and in pools without shade (Dunn et al. 1996; Colitz 2010b; see section below enti-tled Eyes; see Chapter 23 ). Fur seals in particular should be housed in salt water, as they may not groom properly in freshwater, resulting in loss of fur integrity and poor thermo - regulation. While freshwater is generally not available to wild pinnipeds, provision of freshwater (low-lying bucket or pan) to pinnipeds in salt water systems may help them maintain hydration, particularly during rehabilitation and when housed in particularly warm environments. When housed in freshwa - ter, oral salt supplementation should be provided to prevent hyponatremia (Geraci 1972a; Lair et al. 2002). Lighting should mimic the natural photoperiod for the species as closely as possible. Harbor seals maintained in continuous light conditions have had disrupted molt cycles that reverted to normal when a natural photoperiod was rein - stated (Mo, Gili, and Ferrando 2000). Extremes of both heat and cold should be prevented, although in general most spe - cies are better able to tolerate cold than heat. Geraci (1986) states that healthy, robust harbor, gray, harp can tolerate water at freezing temperatures, and air temperature below 20\u00b0C (4 \u00b0F), although a northern elephant seal died after being exposed suddenly to an outdoor temperature of 15 \u00b0C (5\u00b0F) for 30 minutes. Hyperthermia can be avoided by pro - viding access to shade, pools, or sprinklers, when ambient temperatures rise above 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). Hypothermia is rare, but can be a significant problem in thin, malnourished animals in rehabilitation. Provision of waterproof heating pads, plastic pads, platforms off concrete floors, or kennel areas with heat lamps, as well as permanent structures that provide protec - tion from wind and rain, can help prevent hypothermia. Feeding Although wild pinnipeds feed on a variety of prey, managed animals are usually maintained on a diet of herring be taken if feeding mackerel and other scombroid fish to ensure it has been appropriately stored to avoid scombroid toxicity. As herring is a relatively fatty fish, it is commonly fed to produce rapid weight gain. Details of the nutritional content of different diets and the methods to calculate cal - orific requirements of marine mammals are provided (see Chapter 29 ), while hand-rearing techniques are given in Chapter 30 . As a rough guideline, young growing pinnipeds are fed 8-15% of their body weight of food per day, and older animals 4-8% per day. Thiamine at 25 to 35 mg/kg fish and vitamin E at 100 IU/kg fish are recommended to prevent nutritional disorders associated with a frozen fish diet. When supplementing an animal's diet, it is advisable to feed a fish containing the supplements prior to the main feed to ensure the animal receives all of its medications. Restraint The methods commonly used to restrain pinnipeds may be classified into behavioral, physical, mechanical, and chemical, with choice depending upon the objective. For example, if the desired objective is to perform an abdominal ultrasound, a mechanical squeeze may be safest for handlers and the ani-mal, but may be suboptimal for effective ultrasound position - ing. Different types of restraint are often used in combination. For example, a chemical sedative such as a benzodiazepine may be given to an animal to augment physical restraint. Many of these techniques are depicted well in Geraci and Lounsbury (1993). Behavioral Restraint Behavioral restraint is an extremely effective technique for most captive pinniped species and can be either free- or protected-contact. The participa - tion of an animal in its own health evaluations can be far less stressful and time-consuming than other restraint techniques, though the lack of a barrier in a free-contact situation may also be dangerous to people or animals (see Chapter 39 ). Physical Restraint Physical restraint is limited by size and species, the animal's level of aggression and alertness, and the experience and physical ability of the restrainers. It is usually very safe for the animal, but human safety is a con - cern with larger animals. Physical restraint requires a thor - ough knowledge of the behavior and anatomy of the species being restrained. For example, larger otariids have tremen - dously strong forelimbs in comparison with phocids. The fore flippers may have to be secured by additional personnel to prevent the animal from gaining leverage and rising up (Gentry and Holt 1982). Creative use of towels, blankets, bags, and nets will aid physical restraint and increase the safety of personnel. A common method of restraint of a smaller pinniped (phocids under approximately 60 kg and otariids under approximately 30-40 kg) is to place a hoop net or wrap large towel over the animal's head to restrict vision and mobility prior to restraining. The primary restrainer can then control the head by holding the base of the skull with both hands and pushing the head toward the ground. The pri-mary restrainer should straddle the animal by resting their knees on the ground and controlling the side-to-side and upward motion. It is critically important that the restrainer rest their body weight on their own knees and not on the animal, as the pressure can severely restrict the animal's respirations. Care must also be taken to ensure that the ani-mal's nares and mouth are clear of netting or towels to allow full respirations. 9781498796873_C041.indd 894 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PMSeal and Sea Lion Medicine 895 Mechanical Restraint Mechanical restraint is limited by the availability of adequate equipment, the cost of which varies considerably. Many types of mechanical restraint devices have been used with pinnipeds, including chutes, herding boards, restraint boards, stretchers with straps, restraint boxes, squeeze cages, and slings (Cornell 1986; Gentry and Casanas 1997). As some mechanical restraint equipment can be very large and heavy, it may be difficult to use in field situations. In general, mechanical restraint devices are designed to maximize safety to human opera - tors, but may pose some risk to the animal. Some restraint boards require a padded, hinged guillotine to secure the neck, and could obstruct the airway. Mechanical squeeze cages should be used with caution, and only by experienced personnel, since it is possible to use excessive pressure and cause trauma or interfere with adequate ventilation. Be aware that some of the mechanical restraint devices limit full access to the animal. Chemical Restraint The ability to use chemical restraint relies on the expertise of the operators, and often requires the presence of a specially trained veterinarian (see Chapter 26 ). Some commonly used agents for sedation of phocids include or midazolam +/ butorphanol intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM; though diazepam has relatively poor IM absorption), and for anesthesia are IV propofol, alfaxa - lone, or tiletamine/zolazepam. Induction agents are likely to induce apnea; thus, the clinician should be prepared to intubate. Masking with isoflurane or sevoflurane is possi-ble, but may prove difficult due to breath-holding; however, both are commonly used for anesthetic maintenance. Some common agents used in otariids include midazolam with medetomidine and butorphanol IM, which can be reversed with flumazenil, atipamezole, and naltrexone, respectively. Alternatively, midazolam with either alfaxalone or ketamine IM can be used effectively, although the ketamine dose is generally lower than that used in terrestrial mammals. Isoflurane and sevoflurane are also commonly used safely in conjunction with injectable agents, and smaller otariids can be readily masked to an anesthetic plane (with either inhalant) while manually restrained. Additional information on sedative and anesthetic drugs and dosages is given in Chapters 26 and 27. Diseases Details of viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, parasitic, and noninfectious diseases of pinnipeds are provided in Chapters 14 and 17 through 21, respectively. To avoid repetition, this chapter focuses on the clinical signs of these diseases, describes these by affected organ system for ease of differential diagnosis, and then discusses treatment. Drug dosages for recommended therapeutic agents are given in Chapter 27 .Integumentary System Multiple viruses cause dermal lesions in pinnipeds, with seal - pox and calicivirus among the most common. Documented sealpox viral infections are generally of the Parapoxvirus family (Becher et al. 2002; Nollens et al. 2006), though an Orthopoxvirus has been identified in two wild Steller sea lion pups in Alaska (Burek et al. 2005). Poxvirus infections typically occur in animals that have been recently weaned or are in a rehabilitation setting; then these infections spread rapidly among a susceptible population (Hastings et al. 1989; M\u00fcller et al. 2003; Nollens et al. 2005). These viruses cause pathognomonic lesions, which consist of round, raised, firm skin nodules 0.5 to 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter that gradually increase in size over the first week, and may ulcerate or suppurate (see Chapter 17 ). Lesions commonly occur over the head and neck, but may also arise over the thorax and abdomen, perineal regions, or in the oral cavity (M\u00fcller et al. 2003; Nollens et al. 2005). Satellite lesions appear in the second week and may spread rapidly. Lesions are usually self-limiting and regress after 4-6 weeks, although some have persisted for months. Animals usually remain active when affected, although lesions around the lips and eyes may cause sufficient discomfort to reduce appetite. Marked neutrophilia and hyperglobulinemia may occur in association with nodule development. Diagnosis can be made through skin biopsy (see Chapter 17 ). Treatment is usually unnecessary, although broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed to control second - ary bacterial infections, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to reduce discomfort associated with the lesions. In vitro studies suggest that cidofovir could be an effective antiviral in treating sealpox (Nollens et al. 2008). Sealpox is zoonotic and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn when handling affected individuals (see Chapter 4 ). San Miguel sea lion virus is a calicivirus that in California sea lions causes vesicles on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of the flippers, occasionally around the lips, on the dorsum of the tongue, and on the hard palate (Gage et al. 1990; Smith and Boyt 1990; Van Bonn et al. 2000; see Chapter 17 ). The vesicles usually erode, leaving rapidly healing ulcers, but may become secondarily infected by bacteria, especially in malnourished and debilitated animals. Calicivirus has also been shown to cause gastroenteritis on the onset of infec - tion, with signs of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Sea lions will respond to supportive care of fluid therapy and antibiotic coverage. Hematologic changes can include neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The dis - ease can progress to vesicles following the enteritis phase (Schmitt 2009). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR or isolation of the virus from aspirated vesicular fluid or feces, but is often presumptive based on clinical appearance. Treatment is sup - portive, aimed at preventing secondary infection and enhanc - ing nutritional status of the animal. Occasionally, stranded sea lions are observed with severe gangrenous necrosis of 9781498796873_C041.indd 895 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM896 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine the phalanges. Although development of these lesions has not been observed, it is suspected that they may result from vesicles that became secondarily infected with bacteria. These lesions are treated with debridement, topical wound care, and systemic antibiotic therapy based on culture and antibiotic sen - sitivity results. NSAIDs can also be used to reduce discomfort. A novel papillomavirus was identified in two California sea lions with proliferative and focally extensive skin lesions. PCR was used to characterize the virus and the lesions regressed, without treatment, after several months (Rivera et al. 2012). Herpesviruses have been isolated from harbor and gray seals with small erosive skin lesions, and observed in epithe - lial plaques in harbor seals and California sea lions. Although infrequent, herpesviruses should be considered in the differ - ential diagnosis of skin lesions, and skin biopsies should be examined for inclusions. Morbillivirus dermatitis has been diagnosed in both a hooded seal ( Cystophora cristata ) and a harp seal. Skin lesions consisted of epithelial hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, degeneration, and necrosis, and the systemic infection was fatal in both cases. Diagnosis of morbillivirus is described in Chapter 17 . Bacterial infections are common in pinnipeds, especially in dermal abscesses in stranded animals, though are rarely reported in the literature as the primary cause of dermal disease (see Chapter 18 ). Multifocal circular ulcers 1-2 cm (0.4-0.8 cm) in diameter have been observed in California sea lions and northern elephant seals. Histologically, these appear to be the consequence of vasculitis and thrombosis. Microabscesses are also common on the ventral abdomen of sea lions following septicemia. Diagnosis is based on the his - tological appearance of biopsies, and treatment with systemic antibiotics is recommended. Secondary bacterial infections are common with traumatic injuries and bite wounds. Antibiotic therapy should be selected based on culture and sensitiv - ity when possible. Bite wound infections can lead to severe systemic disease, as in the case of one California sea lion, which developed a focal bacterial meningitis and paraparesis from a chronic molytica and Clostridium perfringens were identified as the primary underlying agents (Braun et al. 2015). Subcutaneous abscesses due to infection with Mycobacterium chelonii in a captive gray seal (Stoskopf et al. 1987) and M. smegmatis in a captive California sea lion (Gutter, Wells, and Spraker 1987) were diagnosed after culturing the organisms from aspirated fluid. The gray seal was treated successfully with minocy - cline, while the sea lion died with concurrent pulmonary abscesses. Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) has been documented in a stranded harbor seal. Treatment was successful and based on culture and sensitivity (Fravel et al. 2011). A number of fungal diseases of the skin have been described. Fungal acanthosis and alopecia associated with Candida albicans and Fusarium spp. infections typically occur at mucocutaneous junctions, around nail beds, and in the axillae. Lesions are most often observed in managed ani-mals maintained in freshwater. Diagnosis is based on skin scrapings and fungal culture, PCR, and/or histological exami-nation of biopsies. Topical treatment is difficult without lim - iting access to water, but systemic treatment of an elephant seal with fluconazole at 0.5 mg/kg was effective in clearing clinical signs (Gulland, unpubl. data) rubrum infection caused nonpruritic lesions over the lumbar region in a Patagonian sea lion. Oral terbinafine at approx - imately 2.3 mg/kg per os (PO) SID and a topical dilution of enilconazole over a period of 75 days were successful in clearing the infection (Quintard, Lohmann, and Lefaux 2015). Similar treatment was employed for two California sea lions with Microsporum gypseum dermatomycosis with complete resolution of lesions after 65 days of therapy. Lesions were well demarcated, depigmented, were covered in crusts, and were most extensive over the flippers (S\u00f3s isolated in a group of captive harbor seals and gray seals that presented with erythema - tous, thickened, alopecic skin lesions. Lesions were primar - ily found over the face and flippers, particularly around the nail bed. Various treatments were initiated including topical treatment with miconazole and chlorhexidine, and systemic treatment with oral itraconazole at 5 mg/kg PO BID with vari-able responses. Environmental factors, including overchlori-nation of water and warm water temperatures, contributed to occurrence of disease (Pollock, Rohrbach, and Ramsay 2000). Cystofilobasidiales infection caused systemic mycoses in a California sea lion. This animal presented with ring lesions over the flippers, which progressed to dermal nodules over the flippers, abdomen, and muzzle. Itraconazole (2.5 mg/kg PO BID), and later voriconazole (4 mg/kg PO BID), failed to resolve the infection. Acute liver failure was noted, likely due to voriconazole toxicity, and thus caution is recommended in using voriconazole to treat fungal infections (Field et al. 2012). Alopecia, broken hair shafts, and pruritus are common in debilitated seals and sea lions associated with lice infestation. Most infections are species specific; the California sea lion louse is Antarctophthirius microchi , and the harbor seal louse is Echinophthirius horridis . Lice may be observed with the naked eye and are readily treated with ivermectin, dichlorvos, or disophenol systemically, or with topical rotenone louse powder. Demodicosis, also characterized by alopecia and pruritus, has been observed in California sea lions, northern fur seals (Spraker, pers. comm.), and harbor seals (Kim, Lee, and Kwak 2015). Diagnosis based on histological detection in biopsies and treatment with Amitraz (0.01% once weekly) and ampicillin (10 mg/kg PO SID) has been effective in clear - ing clinical symptoms of demodectic mange (Sweeney 1986b; Kim, Lee, and Kwak 2015). Peladora strongyloides parasites have caused mild superficial dermatitis and perifolliculitis in Pacific harbor seals. Diagnosis was made by biopsy and his - tology (McHuron et al. 2013). 9781498796873_C041.indd 896 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PMSeal and Sea Lion Medicine 897 Traumatic skin wounds are common in stranded animals. Net entanglements, fishhooks, and gunshot injuries are espe - cially common in California sea lions (Goldstein et al. 1999). Diagnosis of gunshot injuries is dependent upon radiographic detection of lead fragments or pellets, or recovery of the pro - jectile, although many wounds suggestive of exit wounds are observed in pinnipeds from which no evidence of gunshot can be detected. Differential diagnoses include bite wounds (usually paired holes of similar size) and bird damage. The characteristics of shark bite wounds vary with species of shark. Management of traumatic skin wounds is based on removal of foreign bodies and debris, debridement of devital - ized tissue, control of infection, and promotion of healing, as in domestic animals. Many topical therapies have been employed including Betadine ointment, chlorhexidine scrubs, silver alginate dressings, platelet-rich plasma, Granulex sprays, honey, laser therapy, and many more. Choice of topical agents should be made on a case-by-case basis. Placing an animal in salt water rather than freshwater may enhance wound cleans - ing. Tetracycline and penicillin have been used to treat shark wounds, as Vibrio spp. and Clostridium spp. are frequently isolated from these wounds (Pavia et al. 1989; Klontz et al. 1993). Severe tissue avulsion from traumatic injury is man - aged best with debridement of necrotic tissue and topical treatment to encourage granulation and healing by secondary intention rather than surgical closure. Rare neoplastic diseases of the skin have been diagnosed in pinnipeds. A cervical dermal melanoma was described in a 7-month-old stranded harbor seal. Diagnosis was made by fine needle aspirate and subsequent biopsy and histopathol - ogy, though the animal died during surgery to remove the mass. The melanoma was described as low grade, and no evidence of metastasis was found on histopathology (Morick et al. 2010). Pleomorphic liposarcoma was described in a captive South African fur seal that presented with a large, progressive, ulcerated mass over the right shoulder. The ani-mal died, and pulmonary, hepatic, splenic, and lymph node metastases were noted on necropsy (Pervin et al. 2016). A cutaneous mast cell tumor was identified in an adult captive California sea lion. Biopsy was needed for diagnosis, and sur - gical excision was successful in removing the tumor (Staggs, Henderson, and Labelle 2016). An invasive cutaneous squa - mous cell carcinoma was documented in a Hawaiian monk seal, and surgical excision was elected (Doescher et al. 2010). Benign mammary hyperplasia resulting in a mammary mass development was identified in a managed subadult female sea lion and surgically excised with no recurrence (Schmitt, unpubl. data). Alopecia and acanthosis have occurred in captive harbor seals that failed to molt when maintained in constant photo - period (Mo, Gili, and Ferrando 2000). Diagnosis was based upon clinical history, and restoration of a natural photoperiod resulted in new hair growth. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus was diagnosed in a captive gray seal that for 9 years had con - tinuous ulcerative nasal dermatitis and intermittent ulcerative dermatitis of the nail beds and dorsum of the body (Burns 1993). Treatments with systemic prednisone, antibiotics, and antifungals, and with topical steroids, and protection from ultraviolet radiation, were unsuccessful, and the seal died dur - ing the second week of treatment. A pruritic allergic derma - titis, with loss of guard hairs over the dorsum, was described in a captive sub-Antarctic fur seal ( Arctocephalus tropicalis ; Bodley, Monaghan, and Mueller 1999). Diagnosis was based on positive reactions to allergens prepared from weed, grass, tree pollens, and some insects. Symptomatic treatment with oral antihistamines was only partially successful, but specific allergen immunotherapy using 10 allergens was effective, despite side effects. Alopecia of an unknown cause is well documented in juvenile Australian fur seals. Affected individuals are gener - ally in poorer body condition than healthy conspecifics and have higher circulating T4 levels, possibly due to increased thermoregulatory demands. Higher levels of PCBs in associa - tion with thyroid disruption have been documented in this population, though thyroid disturbance does not appear to be the cause of the alopecia (Lynch, Keeley, and Kirkwood 2014). Guard hair alopecia of unknown cause has also been observed in stranded northern fur seals and Guadalupe fur seals (Field, unpubl. data). A skin condition characterized by hyperkeratosis, alo - pecia, and ulceration has been well described in northern elephant seals, but its etiology remains obscure (Beckmen et al. 1997). This disease has been associated with decreased levels of circulating thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3); however, thyroid function testing was normal in affected indi-viduals (Yochem et al. 2008). Another ulcerative skin disease of obscure etiology has been described by Anderson et al. (1974) in gray seals. In 2011, a new ulcerative dermatitis dis - ease syndrome was described in a number of Arctic pinni-ped species, including Phoca largha ). This unusual mortality event (UME) was characterized by generalized ulcers/erosions in Pacific wal - ruses, and similar lesions with alopecia over the eyes, muzzle, hind flippers, tail, and trunk of ice seals. Affected individuals were more approachable and lethargic, with a tendency to haul out more frequently. Some mortality has been associated with the syndrome, and histopathology indicates significant involvement of the liver, lung, immune system, and the skin's vascular bed. To date, no associated bacterial, viral, or fun - gal agent has been identified, and no toxin or pollutant has been implicated in causing this disease (Burgess et al. 2013; Stimmelmayr et al. 2013). Musculoskeletal System Diseases involving the pinniped musculoskeletal system include infectious causes, trauma, and congenital abnormali-ties. Numerous bacteria can cause deep abscesses, myositis, 9781498796873_C041.indd 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM898 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine osteomyelitis, and arthritis (Thornton, Nolan, and Gulland 1998). Most of these bacteria are opportunistic, occurring fol - lowing trauma, introduction through contaminated hypoder - mic needles or surgical instruments, or hematogenous spread, as a result of generalized sepsis (see Chapter 18 ). Clostridium perfringens has been isolated from cases of severe myositis following poor injection technique (Greenwood and Taylor 1978), and Otariodibacter oris was isolated from seals and sea lions with abscesses or osteomyelitis, as well as a variety other bacteria (Hansen et al. 2013). Sarcocystis infection causes myositis, as well as neuro - logic and generalized disease in pinnipeds (see Chapter 20 ). Antemortem diagnosis may be based on clinical presentation, as well as antibody levels, with confirmation by histology and PCR of muscle biopsies. Treatment with oral ponazuril at 10 mg/kg for at least 4 weeks, along with supportive care (flu - ids and anti-inflammatory medication to reduce inflammation secondary to parasite die-off), has been clinically effective in some cases (Carlson-Bremer et al. 2012; Alexander et al. 2015), although optimal treatment duration is still unclear, and up to 3 months of treatment may be required to clear an infection (Mylniczenko, Kearns, and Melli 2008). Parasites, tive Uncinaria spp. larvae, may be found in muscles and fas - cia, but do not usually cause clinical signs of disease. Trauma is especially common in free-ranging, stranded pinnipeds. Osteomyelitis affecting the extremities, in particu - lar, is a common occurrence secondary to trauma (Thurman, Downes, and Barrow 1982), or superficial infections such as calicivirus (see Integumentary System above). Antimicrobial treatment is generally utilized in these cases. Fractures may require surgical repair or amputation, particularly with open, chronic, fractures and osteomyelitis (Bennett, Dunker, and Gage 1994; Lucas, Barnett, and Reiley Lewer et et et al. 2013; Garcia et al. 2015; see Surgery below). Rhabdomyolysis secondary to general anesthesia and surgery are described (Bailey et al. 2012), and patient positioning and support, as well as close peri-operative and postoperative monitoring, is recommended for longer surgical procedures, particularly involving larger ani-mals. Monofilament line entanglement or fishhooks in the skin often require general anesthesia to cut material free and clean wounds. Intervertebral disc protrusion, collapsed tho - racic disc spaces, or spondylitis has been observed in wild animals, secondary to blunt force trauma, or managed ani-mals performing repetitive behaviors, such as standing ver - tical against a wall (Schmitt, pers. comm.). The spinal cord in pinnipeds terminates between the 8th and 12th thoracic vertebrae, so any trauma to the cranial spine or collapsed thoracic disc space can result in paresis or paralysis of hind flippers. Some neoplastic diseases can manifest clinical signs in the musculoskeletal system. Carcinomas may erode the lumbar spine, affecting neurological function, as well as potentially resulting in pathological fractures. Animals may exhibit hind-end paresis or paralysis (Gulland et al. 1996a). Lymphosarcoma has affected the bone marrow in a harbor seal (Stroud and Stevens 1980), and a rhabdomyosarcoma was noted in a free-ranging Steller sea lion (Zabka et al. 2004). High levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlo - rodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) have been associated with pathological bone lesions and reproductive failure in seals in the Baltic Sea, likely due to alterations in bone and thy - roid homeostasis; however, the effects of these compounds remain to be fully characterized (Routti et al. 2008). A vari-ety of congenital bone malformations and abnormalities have been reported in pinnipeds, including occipital bone dys - plasia, plate aplasia (Dennison et al. 2009; Maclean et al. 2008). Physical examination, fine-needle aspiration with cytol - ogy and culture of the aspirate, muscle biopsy, radiographs, computerized tomography, and ultrasound (see Chapters 24 and 25) will all facilitate diagnosis of musculoskeletal prob - lems. Treatment is dictated by the diagnosis, though certain techniques commonly used in other species may be difficult in pinnipeds, such as splinting. Initial wound care is similar to other species, and fracture repair of extremities has been performed using both internal and external fixator systems (see Surgery below). Bandaging is particularly difficult in these species due to their fusiform body shape, flipper shape, and aquatic environment. Wounds are often left open for sec - ond intention healing while allowing animals access to water where they appear to be more comfortable. Digestive System Otariids will show behavioral signs of discomfort with abdom - inal pain, such as fore flippers extended down over the ven - tral abdomen, or logging at the surface or clutching to the edge of a pool edge on their side with fore and hind flippers with a hunched abdomen. Dental disease in pinnipeds can be ascertained by animals showing complete inappetence, dropping fish, dysphagia (playing with food), or prehending food on one side and not the other. Oral lesions are often viral or traumatic in origin. Herpesvirus, morbillivirus, and poxviruses can cause ulcer - ative oral lesions in pinniped species. Treatment is largely supportive, and targeted at controlling secondary bacterial infections and reducing discomfort. Trauma secondary to for - eign bodies such as fishhooks or entanglements is also rela - tively common. Partial glossectomy was effective in removing necrotic lingual tissue secondary to fishhook entanglement in a Hawaiian monk seal (Barbieri et al. 2013). Megaesophagus and concurrent intestinal volvulus have been described in har - bor seals in two separate cases. Clinical symptoms included aerophagia, regurgitation, vomiting, diarrhea, bloat, abdomi-nal pain, and occasional inappetence. Megaesophagus was diagnosed using contrast radiography. Both were medically managed using gastric support medications, but eventually died from complications (Tuomi et al. 2011). Ingested foreign 9781498796873_C041.indd 898 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PMSeal and Sea Lion Medicine 899 bodies are not uncommon in dehydrated and malnourished seals and sea lions. On the East coast, rescued \"ice seals,\" such as harp and hooded seals, have been diagnosed with gastric impaction secondary to ingestion of rocks. Gastrotomy has been performed to remove rocks, with successful recov - ery and return to the wild (Schmitt, pers. comm.). Wild sea lions are diagnosed with monofilament line and fishhook ingestion commonly, and successful treatment is based on the degree of tissue damage, and if the hook can be removed with endoscopy or gastrotomy (Schmitt, pers. comm.) Gastritis and gastric ulcers are common in pinnipeds. Stress and high burdens of gastric nematodes can cause gas - tric ulceration and chronic emesis. Gastric nematodes have also caused duodenal perforations leading to peritonitis and death in stranded California sea lions (Fletcher et al. 1998). Gastroprotectants and anthelmintics can be used to manage animals with suspected ulcers (see end of this section for details). Several novel Helicobacter spp. have been associ- ated with gastritis in an Australian sea lion and in harp seals (Harper et al. 2003; Oxley, Powell, and McKay 2004). In the sea lion, recurrent episodes of anorexia and abdominal dis - comfort prompted endoscopy and subsequent biopsy of gas - tric and intestinal Helicobacter spp. Wolinella spp. by PCR. included amoxicillin at 10 mg/kg PO BID and metronidazole at 10 mg/kg PO BID. Initially the animal's condition improved with therapy, but repeated flare-ups occurred over several years. Primary neoplasias of the oral and gastrointestinal tracts have been documented in pinnipeds. Lingual squamous cell carcinoma has been described in a California sea lion (Sato et al. 2002), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has occurred in several aged captive harbor seals (Flower et al. 2014). Clinical symptoms included intermittent dysphagia, inappetence, regurgitation, and abnormal posturing. The tumors were often ulcerated and occurred near the gastro - esophageal junction. Bloodwork abnormalities in these cases included azotemia, hyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, and leukocytosis. Gastric carcinoma developed in a cap - tive, aged South American sea lion. Vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss occurred, with hematemesis and melena in end stage disease (Yamazaki, Koutaka, and Une 2016). Enteritis in pinnipeds can be caused by a variety of infectious agents. Viral causes of enteritis include morbil - livirus, which has caused chronic ulcerative stomatitis and acute hemorrhagic enteritis in wild harbor seals in Europe (Jauniaux et al. 2001). In an outbreak of herpesvirus in juve - nile harbor seals, early clinical symptoms included vomit - ing, diarrhea, and fever. Severe hepatic necrosis was found postmortem (Borst et al. 1986). Enteritis has been linked to bacteria, including Clostridium spp. and Salmonella spp. in different pinniped species. The interpretation of culture of these organisms from fecal samples is difficult, as they have been cultured from both clinically normal animals and those with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. Disseminated blastomy - cosis was identified in two California sea lions in different captive facilities. Blastomyces dermatitidis was the suspected primary pathogen, and postmortem findings included enteri-tis with subsequent rupture and peritonitis, infiltration of the spleen and liver, severe pyogranulomatous pneumonia, and ulcerative skin lesions (Zwick et al. 2000). Most gastrointestinal parasites are part of the normal flora of free-ranging pinnipeds and do not significantly affect the host; however, they can be responsible for clinical disease. Nematodes may potentiate malnutrition in already compro - mised animals, especially young animals, and high parasite burdens have the potential to obstruct the intestinal lumen (Banish and Gilmartin 1992). Juvenile Hawaiian monk seals with cestode infections, primarily Diphyllobothrium spp., tend to be in poorer body condition than those without infections (Reif et al. 2006; Gobush, Baker, and Gulland 2011). Treatment with praziquantel at 5 mg/kg IM for 2 days in Hawaiian monk seals has shown some seasonal promise in improving body mass and survivorship (Gobush, Baker, and Gulland 2011), although higher doses have been used to clear cestode infec - tion in rehabilitated monk seals. Acanthocephalans have caused gastrointestinal perforation and peritonitis in gray and harbor seals. Hookworm infections causing enteritis and bac - teremia have been associated with increased wild California sea lion pup mortalities on San Miguel Island (Spraker et al. 2007). California sea lions appear to be the definitive host for enteric coccidian parasites, with only mild associated enteri-tis. This parasite, however, was implicated in causing proto - zoal lymphadenitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, and encephalitis in a neonatal harbor seal (Colegrove et al. 2011), suggesting varying interspecies pathogenicity (see Chapter 20 ). Hepatitis has been associated with adenovirus infection in otariid species (Dierauf, Lowenstine, and Jerome 1981; Goldstein et al. 2011; Inoshima et al. 2013). Clinical signs of affected animals included diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, posterior paresis, polydipsia, and photophobia. Bloodwork abnormalities include markedly elevated AST and ALT. Adenoviral infection can be fulminant and fatal (Inoshima et al. 2013). Hepatic necrosis and intranuclear inclusions are typical postmortem findings. To date, at least one novel adenovirus has been described in association with hepati-tis, Otarine Adenovirus 1 (OtAdV-1; Goldstein et al. 2011). Several types of bacteria associated with hepatitis have been isolated from the livers of pinnipeds (Thornton, Nolan, and Gulland 1998). Mycotic agents including Coccidioides immitis have also affected the liver of California sea lions (Fauquier et al. 1996), and neoplastic diseases may manifest themselves in the liver of pinnipeds (see Chapter 14 , Table 14.1 ) Hemochromatosis has been observed in managed California sea lions and northern fur seals, but the etiology is obscure (Garcia et al. 2000; Clauss and Paglia 2012). Primary pancreatic disease has been rarely reported, though may be underreported due to nonspecific clinical signs and lack of species-specific tests. Chronic pancreati-tis has been reported in an adult captive California sea lion, with no identifiable underlying cause. The animal developed 9781498796873_C041.indd 899 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM900 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine secondary diabetes mellitus and was managed with glargine insulin injections, gastric protectants, and a high-protein, low-fat diet (Meegan et al. 2008). Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been described in an adult captive Steller sea lion. Postmortem secondary lesions included pancreatitis, bile duct obstruction, hepatitis, and hepatic encephalopathy (Goertz et al. 2011). Small amounts of rectal bleeding, irregular in frequency and of varying duration, in harbor seals and California sea lions have been associated with a postmortem finding of ileocecocolic intussusception (Lair and Lamberski, case of antemortem diagnosis of ileocecocolic intussusception occurred in a captive harbor seal that initially presented for anorexia and a leukopenia with degenerative left shift. Malodorous diarrhea developed, with concurrent tenesmus and regurgitation. Abdominal radiographs revealed gas dilated loops of intestine, and an exploratory laparotomy revealed significant ischemic compromise leading to eutha - nasia (Heym et al. 2011). Congenital abnormalities, including cleft palate (Suzuki et al. 1992) and hiatal herniation, have been seen in stranded pinnipeds (Beekman 2008; Biancani et al. 2012). Laparoscopic gastropexy was successfully used to repair a hiatal hernia in a stranded weanling elephant seal (Greene et al. 2015). Iatrogenic causes of gastrointestinal disease include feeding inappropriate formulas or spoiled fish, using poorly designed feeding tubes, or feeding at an inappropriate rate or volume. Young animals, especially when debilitated, often go through a period of regurgitation and malabsorption if formula is introduced too quickly. Adequate rehydration and a gradual reintroduction to complex diets may aid in decreas - ing the frequency of emesis and diarrhea (see Chapter 30 ). Impactions caused by solidifying formula in neonates have been seen and may also be prevented by feeding appropriate formulas, monitoring hydration, and a gradual introduction to complex diets. Clinical symptoms associated with diseases of the diges - tive tract Abdominal pain or discomfort is often mani-fested as inappetence, lethargy, or depression. Otariids with abdominal discomfort will often tuck their flippers to their abdomen. In the water, they may float with tucked flippers and a hunched back. Diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease often requires a series of diagnostic techniques beginning with physical examination. Physical examination helps detect broken, miss - ing, or worn teeth, oral ulcers, oral foreign bodies such as fish spines and fishhooks, abdominal distension, abdominal masses, a palpable fluid wave, perineal swelling, or prolapsed rectum. A complete blood count may help identify an infec - tious cause. Clinical chemistry findings may indicate specific organ involvement, hypoproteinemia, gastrointestinal hemor - rhaging, and electrolyte imbalances associated with or diarrhea Appendix 1 , Tables A1.2 [Phocids] and A1.3 [Otariids], Clinical Laboratory Values). Ultrasound may be used to identify a variety of abnormalities within the abdomen, including ascites, ileus, foreign bodies, and organ abnormalities. Abdominocentesis of a distended abdomen can differentiate peritonitis and hemoperitoneum. Culture and cytology of aspirated fluid may help further define dis - ease. As many pinnipeds have large intra-abdominal vessels and large spleens, aspiration of frank blood does not neces - sarily indicate hemoperitoneum, and ultrasound-guided aspi - ration will help guide sample collection. Further diagnostics may include radiographs to detect gastric foreign bodies, gas - tric impaction, or constipation. Although it is often difficult to achieve good contrast in pinniped abdominal radiographs due to the relative lack of visceral fat, in young and thin ani-mals, it is possible to achieve some indication of organ size, displacement, and intra-abdominal masses. Endoscopy can be used to diagnose gastric ulcers, gastritis, colitis, and gastric foreign bodies, as well as obtain gastric and colonic biopsies. Laparoscopic examination can enable direct visualization of the gastrointestinal serosa, as well as liver, pancreas, and associated structures. Biopsies of the liver and other tissues may be obtained either laparoscopically or by ultrasound-guided biopsy (see Chapter 24 ). Supportive therapy for gastrointestinal disease is critical, as fluid, electrolyte, and protein abnormalities can quickly result in mortality if they are not resolved. Since many ani-mals with gastrointestinal disease vomit or regurgitate, par - enteral administration of fluids, medications, and potentially even nutrition should be provided (see above). GI protectants such as sucralfate, prokinetics, such as metoclopramide, can all be used in treating gastrointestinal disease. Attempts to induce eme - sis with apomorphine, xylazine, or hydrogen peroxide have been unsuccessful. Simethicone has been used to reduce bloating. Mirtazapine, orally and rectally, has been used to promote appetite with variable effects. Probiotics have been used in animals on chronic antibiotics or with chronic gastro - intestinal disease, but little is known about their efficacy in pinniped species (see Chapter 27 ). Parenteral nutrition (PN) was administered to six severely malnourished (third-stage starvation) northern elephant seal pups or weanlings, using AminosynTM amino acid solution and - sion. A 19-gauge spring-reinforced was placed into the epidural sinus, and PN was administered with either a portable syringe pump housed in a water-resistant case secured to the patient by a harness, or by \"bolusing\" the solutions over a 1- to 2-hour time period three times daily while the seal was confined in a smaller area (approx. 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 m [5 \u00d7 5 ft.] 2014). CBC, serum chemistry, and electrolyte values were monitored regularly, and antibiotics and fluids were administered concurrently. Serum glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels indicated likely appropriate metabolic responses. Reintroduction of tube-fed oral electrolytes was initiated within 3-5 days, followed by a semielemental diet (Emeraid Piscivore several days and 9781498796873_C041.indd 900 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PMSeal and Sea Lion Medicine 901 gradual incorporation of ground fish slurries. Although only one out of the six seals ultimately survived to be released, PN appeared to be safe and well tolerated by these gravely ill animals, and may be of great benefit to severely nutritionally compromised animals. Respiratory System Respiratory disease is common in pinnipeds, and these spe - cies are capable of masking severe disease. Canine distemper virus (CDV) has caused epizootics of pneumonia and death in Baikal virus fre - quently been associated with epizootics in harbor seals with occasional smaller mortality events in gray, harp, and hooded seals (Duignan et al. 2014). Ocular and nasal dis - charges, cough, cyanosis of mucous membranes, dyspnea, diarrhea, fever, and central nervous signs, such as depres - sion or seizures, are observed in affected seals. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and thorax may occur as a sequel to pulmonary damage, and seals may have difficulty swimming and diving (Siebert et al. 2010). Antemortem diagnosis may be detected by rising serum antibody titers, though animals may succumb to disease prior to developing a strong sero - logic response. Virus isolation is difficult, yet necessary to confirm identification of the virus. Treatment consists of sup - portive care, and controlling secondary bacterial infections that commonly cause death in infected seals (Baker and Ross 1992). Antibiotics effective against Bordatella bronchiseptica Although clinical recovery is documented, CDV has been isolated from asymptomatic carriers (Lyons et al. 1993). No commercially available vaccine for PDV currently exists, but commercially available attenuated CDV vaccine has been used to immunize stranded gray and harbor seals (Carter et al. 1992). Experimental inoculation of harbor seals with inactivated and subunit CDV vaccines have provided some protection from clinical disease (Visser et al. 1989, 1992; Van Bressem et al. 1991; Quinley et al. 2013). Most recently, vaccination of the wild population of Hawaiian monk seals (Neomonachus schauinslandii ) was undertaken, because of the animals' low abundance, the fact that the population is naive to PDV, and that they have potential for exposure to a devastating PDV or CDV epizootic (Aguirre et al. 2007). Influenza virus has also caused epizootics in harbor seals, with clinical signs similar to those in seals with PDV and CDV (Geraci et al. 1982; Anthony et al. 2012). These included dyspnea, lethargy, blood-stained nasal discharge, and sub - cutaneous emphysema, with pneumonia as the predomi-nant postmortem lesion. There is evidence for interspecies transmission between birds, seals, and humans, suggesting that seals can both become infected and transmit influenza viruses to other species (Webster 1981; Goldstein et al. 2013). Phocine herpesvirus-1 (PhHV-1) has caused pneumonia in neonatal harbor seals in rehabilitation (Borst et al. 1986), while another herpesvirus was isolated from a California sea lion with acute hemorrhagic pneumonia (Kennedy-Stoskopf et al. 1986). Diagnosis of both infections is based on viral iso - lation, and treatment is supportive. Harbor seals with pneu - monia associated with influenza virus were also infected with a mycoplasma, so therapy with antibiotics such as tetracy - clines may be beneficial (Geraci et al. 1984). Bacterial pneumonias are common in seals and sea lions, both as primary infections and secondary to viral and lung - worm infections. A variety of organisms may be involved, although Gram-negative organisms are most common (Keyes, Crews, and Ross 1968; Sweeney 1986a; Spraker et al. 1998; Haulena et al. 2006; Jang et al. 2010). Clinical signs include tachypnea, dyspnea, lethargy, and cough. Diagnosis is based upon auscultation of the chest, radiography of the lung fields, and bronchos - copy. Treatment with the appropriate systemic antibiotic may be based upon prediction of the likely organism, or cul - ture and sensitivity of organisms from tracheal or bronchial washes (Johnson, Nolan, and Gulland 1998). Mucolytics such as acetylcysteine, and bronchodilators such as albuterol and aminophylline, have been used regularly on stranded harbor seals and California sea lions in rehabilitation. Pneumonia in otariids may occur with heavy infesta - , although bronchitis and bronchiolitis in harbor, harp, and ringed seals, and yearling northern elephant seals (see Chapter 21 ). The degree of inflammatory response to Parafilaroides infections varies from none to marked suppu - rative and granulomatous pneumonia. Reaction may be more severe to dead and degenerate worms. Diagnosis depends upon detection of larvae in feces or sputum. Treatment with fenbendazole or ivermectin removes infection, but in severe cases, simultaneous treatment with antibiotics and either corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories is strongly recommended to control secondary bacterial infec - tions and reduce the inflammatory response to dying para - sites. Interestingly, a Brucella spp. isolate was obtained from the lung of a harbor seal with Parafilaroides spp. infestation (Garner et al. 1997). Histological examination revealed most of the inflammation and Brucella spp. to be around the dead parasites. A more recent study confirmed these findings in stranded harbor seals (Lambourn et al. 2013); however, the role of Parafilaroides spp. in the epidemiology of Brucella infections remains unclear. Pulmonary granulomas due to infection with Mycobacterium pinnipedii have been reported in captive and wild pinnipeds (Forshaw and Phelps 1991; Bastida et al. 1999; Cousins 2003; Jurczynski et al. 2011). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (Cousins 1987) and intradermal tuberculin tests have been used for diagnosis of infection in live pinni-peds, although interpretation of results is difficult (Needham and Phelps 1990; Jurczynski et al. 2012), and successful treatment of 9781498796873_C041.indd 901 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM902 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine clinical cases has not been documented. Similar lesions may also result from fungal infections. Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii infections are not uncommon in pinnipeds through - out California (Fauquier et al. 1996, Huckabone et al. 2015), and Cryptococcus spp. (Mcleland et al. 2012) and Blastomyces dermatitidis (Zwick et al. 2000) infections have also been diag - nosed. Diagnosis is usually made postmortem based on histo - logical detection of organisms and culture as disease is generally advanced. Treatment has rarely been described, but a walrus with coccidioidomycosis was treated successfully with voricon - azole for years (Schmitt and Procter 2014). Cardiovascular System Anemia is common in young otariids as a consequence of hookworm ( Uncinaria spp.) infestation, or secondary to malnutrition, and has also been reported in Mediterranean monk seals (A. Komnenou, pers. comm.). Affected animals are weak, are occasionally dyspneic, and have pale mucous membranes. Diagnosis of hookworm infestation is based on detection of ova in feces (see Chapter 21 ), although animals may remain anemic for weeks after patent infection ceases. Treatment with anthelmintics and supplementation with iron and vitamin B12 is usually effective. Nonregenerative anemia is seen in California sea lions as a consequence of chronic renal damage, usually as a result of leptospirosis (see below). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), characterized by bleeding from the nares, hematoma formation, throm - bocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and extended clotting times, is relatively common in stranded northern elephant seals (Gulland et al. 1996b). It may occur with septicemia or vasculitis associated with migrating Otostrongylus larvae of - tion in live seals during the prepatent period is not currently possible, although clinical signs and season of occurrence are highly suggestive of infection. Clinicopathologic changes include elevated white blood count greater than 40,000 with a left shift, reduced platelet count, and increased aminotrans - aminases (ALT and GGT). Serum amyloid A, an acute phase protein, has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool in prepatent Otostrongylus infections in elephant seals prior to the development of clinical signs (Sheldon et al. 2015). Otostrongylus worms have also been found in the right ven - tricle and pulmonary arteries in California sea lions causing similar clinical signs as seen in elephant seals (Kelly et al. 2005). Elephant seals with signs of DIC are treated with anti-biotics, corticosteroids, and supportive care, but therapy is rarely successful. A lysine analogue antifibrinolytic drug, -aminocaproic acid (EACA), shows promise in treating the bleeding associated with prepatent Otostrongylus arteritis in northern elephant seals (Kaye et al. 2016). Other cases of anemia have included hyperestrogenism-induced medullar aplasia in a gray seal (Lacave, pers. comm.) and hemolytic anemia of unknown origin in a northern fur seal (Chelysheva and Romanov 2008).Cardiac insufficiency in pinnipeds can be caused by cardiomyopathy related to toxin or capture stress, bacte - rial endocarditis, and heartworm infestation. In California sea lions, domoic acid (DA) toxicosis can cause a degen - erative cardiomyopathy associated with decreased cardiac contractility and cardiac output (Zabka et al. 2009; Barbosa et al. 2015). Serum troponin-I and EKG tracings not predictive of the of DA-associated cardiomyopathy. Electrocardiograms described in otariids and phocids are consistent with other animals, and the ventricular activation (QRS complex orientation) falls into category B with swine, horses, and cetaceans (Hamlin, Ridgway, and Gilmartin 1972; ventricles depolarize simulta - neously in bursts of canceling activity, leading to potential limitations of using ECGs in pinnipeds for diagnosing car - diac pathology. Echocardiography is currently the only tool for diagnosis of cardiac insufficiency in sea lions affected by domoic acid. In South American fur seal pups, capture stress has also induced cardiomyopathy, characterized by myocardial contraction band necrosis and endothelial dis - ruption (Seg uel et al. 2013). Bacterial endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli has been documented as a cause of mortality in seals and sea lions and should be ruled out for cardiac insufficiency in pinni-peds (Kim et al. 2002, Chinnadurai et al. 2009). A variety of microfilarid species have been docu - mented in pinnipeds (see Chapter 21 ). Infection by either the canine heartworm Dirofilaria immitis or phocid parasite Acanthocheilonema spirocauda may cause dila - tation of the pulmonary artery and right ventricle, and can be detected radiographically. Microfilaria observed in blood smears must be distinguished from those of the noncardiopathogenic fascial worm, A. odenhali . The vast majority of microfilaria noted in wild California sea lions are A. odenhali . Commercially available canine heartworm antigen tests cross-react with A. odendhali in California sea lions, and results from these tests should be inter - preted with caution when diagnosing heartworm in sea lions (Krucik, Van Bonn, and Johnson 2016). Successful treatment of documented heartworm cases has not been described. Preventive treatment of captive animals in D. immitis endemic regions with ivermectin at 0.6 mg/kg every month during the mosquito season is recommended, as well as removal of lice from stranded animals, as the seal louse Echinophthirius horridus has been shown to transmit A. spirocauda (Geraci et al. 1981). In (f.o.) and ductus arteriosus (d.a.) occurs longer after birth than is described in terrestrial mammals. The f.o. may be patent up to 7 weeks of age, and the d.a. may be patent up to 6 weeks of age with - out evidence of clinical consequence (Dennison et al. 2011). Patency should only be considered abnormal if there is evi-dence of cardiac enlargement or hemodynamic derangement, and care should be taken not to fluid-overload the pups dur - ing initial days of treatment.Q1 Q2 9781498796873_C041.indd 902 9/13/2017 903 Urogenital System Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic spirochetes within the genus Leptospira , is well recognized in free-ranging California sea lions stranded in northern California. Although rarer, infection has also been reported in Steller sea lions, north - ern fur seals, Pacific harbor seals, and northern elephant seals (Smith et al. 1977; Stamper, Cameron et al. 2008). Antibodies, pro - viding evidence of prior exposure, have been detected in Hawaiian monk seals, New Zealand fur seals, and a bearded seal (MacKereth et al. 2005; Aguirre et al. 2007; Calle et al. 2008). Clinical signs are best documented in California sea lions, and include depression, anorexia, polydipsia, dehydra - tion, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, oral ulcers, abdominal pain, and muscular tremors. Hematological changes include eleva - tions in blood urea nitrogen, phosphorus, sodium, creatinine, and neutrophil count. However, asymptomatic chronic infec - tion and leptospire shedding also occur (Prager et al. 2013, 2015). Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and serum chemistry abnormalities consistent with leptospirosis, in addition to the absence of clinical signs suggestive of the other causes of azo - temia, (i.e., amyloidosis, urogenital carcinoma, pyelonephritis, or severe dehydration). Infection can be confirmed through PCR detection of Leptospira DNA, or culture and isolation from urine or kidney tissue (Ahmed et al. 2012). To date, the only serovar isolated from free-ranging California sea lions and northern fur seals is L. interrogans serovar pomona , while both L. interrogans serovar pomona and L. kirschneri have been isolated from northern elephant seals (Smith et al. 1977; Cameron et al. 2008; Zuerner and Alt 2009; Delaney et al. 2014). Several other L. interrogans serovars have caused renal disease in both managed and free-ranging pinnipeds (Calle et al. 2003; Kik et al. 2006; Patchett et al. 2009). Sea lions with single microscopic agglutination test (MAT) titers over 1:100 are considered exposed, but clinically active cases of L. interrogans serovar pomona in sea lions usually have titers greater than 1:3200 (Colagross-Schouten et al. 2002). Cross-reaction with other Leptospira serovars with the MAT is common, and therefore a positive MAT titer against a par - ticular serovar does not confirm infection with that serovar. Treatment consists primarily of supportive care directed toward the clinical manifestations of the individual animal, such as fluids, gastric protectants, and analgesics. In vitro, Leptospira are susceptible to many antibiotics, including those in the penicillin and tetracycline families, and a 10- to 14-day course is recommended. In California sea lions, there is cur - rently no evidence that penicillin-based antibiotics alone are effective in clearing an infection in vivo (Prager et al. 2015); however, a longer duration treatment course with tetracycline antibiotics may be effective in elimination of leptospiruria. Clinical signs and blood values can resolve with treatment, but, due to the severity of renal disease, roughly two-thirds of California sea lions presenting with clinical leptospirosis die despite treatment (Gulland et al. 1996). Renal disease may also occur as a consequence of renal calculi, congenital renal aplasia, and amyloidosis (see Chapter 14 ). California sea lions diagnosed with amyloido - sis exhibited signs of renal disease, with elevated BUN, creat - inine, and phosphorus, plus hypoalbuminemia (Chinnadurai et Colegrove et al. 2009). Premortem diagnosis of amyloidosis requires a renal biopsy, and diagnoses of con - genital renal aplasia and renal calculi require radiography and ultrasound. Treatment of these rare conditions has not been reported. Urogenital tumors are common in free-ranging California sea lions (see Chapter 14 ). Clinical signs in these animals usually result from pressure on ureters and invasion of local organs. Initial presentation is often nonspecific with signs of malnutrition, and signs suggestive of metastatic cancer include posterior paresis, often hydroureter and hydronephrosis caused by ureter obstruc - tion. abdominocentesis and cytology, radiology, and laparoscopic biopsy techniques. Treatment has not been attempted. Other tumors of urogeni-tal origin include renal cell carcinoma in a Steller sea lion (Romanov et al. 2015), choriocarcinoma in a California sea lion (Fravel et al. 2013), and an ovarian interstitial cell tumor in a South American sea lion (Biancani et al. 2010). Abortions and stillborn pups are frequently observed on pinniped rookeries. Leptospires (Gilmartin et al. 1976), herpes - Boyt 1990), burnetii (Lapointe et al. 1999), high levels of DDTs (Gilmartin et al. 1976), and domoic acid (Goldstein et al. 2009) have all been reported in aborting pinnipeds. Unlike cetaceans, Brucella spp. have not been found to be the causative agent of abortion in pinnipeds despite some investigation. An aborted California sea lion fetus had positive immunostaining for Brucella spp. in the respiratory and repro - ductive tissue, and the placenta was culture positive; however, the dam suffered from concurrent DA toxicity, and thus the primary cause of the abortion remains unknown (Sidor et al. 2008). Vaginal prolapse has been observed in California sea lions and Australian sea lions ( Neophoca cinerea ; Read et al. 1982). Treatment of the latter by ovariohysterectomy was suc - cessful. Uterine torsions and ruptures have been observed in California sea lions with DA intoxication, and were believed to be consequences of severe convulsions (Gulland et al. 2000). In pregnant California sea lions intoxicated with DA, fetal and amniotic fluid may act as a reservoir of DA initially ingested by pregnant females. Clinical improvement is often observed in the adults after abortion of the pup. To induce abortion, dexa - methasone given at 0.25 mg/kg IM SID for 3-5 days is usually successful. If there is no response to dexamethasone, prosta - glandin F2 alpha (i.e., dinoprost tromethamine; Lutalyse \u00ae) at 250 g/kg IM SID for 3 days can be attempted, though a lower dose may also be successful.Q3 9781498796873_C041.indd 903 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM904 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine Endocrine System Few primary endocrine disorders have been documented in pinnipeds. Both hyper- and hyponatremia are common in stranded animals (see Chapters 8 and 29), and may be con - sequences of inappropriate stress responses. Adrenal necrosis resulting from infection by a herpesvirus, PhHV-1, has been associated with severe electrolyte and glucose abnormalities in stranded neonatal harbor seals undergoing rehabilitation (Gulland et al. 1997b). Hypothyroidism has been suspected as attributing to obe - sity in captive California sea lions, and seems to be respon - sive to treatment with exogenous thyroid hormone. One adult, captive, California sea lion developed diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic pancreatitis. The animal was managed with glargine insulin injections, gastric protectants, and a high-protein, low-fat diet (Meegan et al. 2008). Environmental exposure of ringed seals to persistent organic pollutants in the Baltic Sea appears to affect endocrine homeostasis in these animals, though long-term health effects have yet to be described (Routti et al. 2010). Severely malnourished animals are frequently hypogly - cemic, and intravascular access in hypovolemic, minimally responsive, otariids can be challenging in an emergency sit - uation. Fravel et al. (2016) showed that intraperitoneal (IP) administration of a dextrose bolus (500 mg/kg) will increase blood glucose levels to the same degree as an IV bolus, and thus can be administered during a hypoglycemic crisis. In the authors' experience, this technique has resulted in the suc - cessful revival of numerous hypoglycemic California sea lion and northern fur seal pups. Eyes Pinniped eyes are characterized by a large globe, prominent tapetum lucidum, rounded lens, and a narrow, tear-shaped pupil (Miller, Colitz, and Dubielzig 2010). The visual system of pinnipeds is adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and most pinnipeds have good vision below the surface of the water in low light and above the surface in bright light (Wartzok and Ketten 1999). Pinnipeds have very active lacri-mal glands producing constant tears that protect the cornea. Lack of tearing is often used as an indication of dehydration. Eye lesions are common in both free-ranging and captive pinnipeds (see Chapter 23 ; al. 2010a,b). There may be an increased frequency of eye lesions in animals that are maintained in freshwater environ - ments (Sweeney 1986b; Dunn et al. 1996), but water quality, oxidation by-products, UV light exposure, viral infections, underlying uveitis, and trauma all contribute to the multifac - torial etiology of eye lesions in captive pinnipeds. Corneal lesions are most frequently encountered, followed by cata - racts, traumatic injuries, infectious processes, and neoplasia (Miller et al. 2013). Captive otariids are frequently affected by a form of progressive keratitis, characterized by corneal opacities, edema, recurrent ulceration, and blepharospasm (Colitz et al. 2010a). Chronic exposure to sunlight appears to be an important risk factor (see Chapter 31 ), and progres - sion of the disease is associated with secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help to control pain and uveitis, and topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus appears to diminish recurrence of active dis - ease. Treatment of active infection is imperative, and topical (triple antibiotic suspensions, serum, or platelet-rich plasma) and oral medications typically include doxycycline to stabi-lize the corneal stroma and speed re-epithelialization, and for its ability to be secreted in the tear film (Solomon et al. 2000; Freeman et al. 2013). Various bacteria have been cul - tured from traumatic lesions, conjunctivitis, and keratitis in pinnipeds (Thornton, Nolan, and Gulland 1998), and targeted therapy following culture and sensitivity is advised. Visually impaired pinnipeds will thrust their vibrissae forward if investigating noises or new surroundings. Although normal pinnipeds will also do this, visually impaired ani-mals tend to exaggerate the action and extend their vibrissae for prolonged periods of time. The menace response may be difficult to evaluate, since the vibrissae are very sensitive to air movement. Visually impaired animals, if placed into new surroundings, may not avoid obstacles well, but can accom - modate very quickly using tactile and acoustic cues, mak - ing diagnosis of blindness difficult. Ophthalmic examination is difficult in pinnipeds because of a prominent nictitating membrane, strong eyelids, and the ability to retract the globe into the ocular cavity. Very narrow pupils limit visualization of internal eye structures such as the lens and retina, and pinni-peds do not tend to dilate their pupils very well when topical mydriatic agents are applied to the cornea. Retrobulbar block has been utilized to revert the ventral rotation that frequently follows anesthesia, and this produces excellent mydriasis to examine the interior of the globe (Gutierrez et al. 2016). Cataracts are common in otariids, and frequently lead to synechiae formation, anterior prolapse, and rupture of the globe (see Chapter 23 ). The lenses of young animals may be removed by phacoemulsification (Colitz et al. 2011; Esson et al. 2015), but lenses in older animals are harder than in many ter - restrial species, and lensectomy is required in the majority of cases (Colitz et al. 2011). Lensectomy has also been performed following globe perforation in phocids (Colitz et al. 2013). Treatment of ocular lesions of pinnipeds is similar to that of domestic animals (see Chapter 23 ). However, the use of saline washes, most readily given as saltwater baths, appears to help decrease corneal edema. Both oral and topical anti-inflammatories and analgesics are helpful to treat pain associ-ated with uveitis and corneal ulcers. Nervous System Numerous infectious agents have been identified as the cause of neurologic disease in pinnipeds. Viral encephalitis 9781498796873_C041.indd 904 9/13/2017 9:10:32 and Sea Lion Medicine 905 secondary to morbillivirus, herpesvirus, and influenza are commonly reported, with small to very large-scale outbreaks in wild populations (Geraci 1982; Phillippa et al. 2009; Philip Earle et al. 2011; Duignan et al. 2014; also see Respiratory section above and Chapter 17 ). Several cases of West Nile Virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine encephalitis (EEE) virus have also been described in (Stremme 2003; Dalton, Dickerson, and Wigdahl 2004; Gentz and Richard 2004; McBride et al. 2008). A single case of rabies has been described in a ringed seal (Odegaard and Krogsrud 1981), and a novel parvovirus was detected in the brain of a harbor seal with meningoencephalitis (Bodewes et al. 2013). Clinical signs of these diseases are similar and may include depres - sion, lethargy, ataxia, coma, recumbency, tremors, seizures, and coma. Other body systems, particularly the respiratory system, may also be affected. Some viral infections may be diagnosed on the basis of rising antibody titers, although confirmation is often made postmortem on histological examination of brain tissue, using immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent techniques. Treatment is supportive and may include fluids, anticonvulsants, anti-inflammatory medi-cation, and antibiotics for secondary infection. L-lysine sup - plementation did not alter the course of herpesvirus infection of harbor seal pups in a rehabilitation facility (Guarasci et al. 2010), and the efficacy of antiviral medications in these spe - cies is unknown. Vaccination is recommended against WNV using a recombinant canarypox vaccine, because it induced presumptively protective antibody levels in Steller sea lions (Tuomi et al. 2014). Harbor seals (Schmitt, pers. comm.) and several phocid species, including endangered Hawaiian monk seals, have been safely vaccinated with a recombinant DNA vaccine against canine distemper virus (see Respiratory sec - tion above). Protozoal, bacterial, and fungal infections can cause simi- lar neurologic signs. Any number of bacteria may infiltrate the nervous system through hematogenous spread. Various fungi including zygomycetes (Sosa et al. 2013; Barnett et al. 2014), Coccidioides spp. (Huckabone et al. 2015), Cryptococcus spp. (Rosenberg et al. 2016), and Scedosporium apiospermum (Haulena et al. 2002) have been detected in nervous and other tissues (see Chapter 19 ). Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis spp. infections have been found in numerous wild pinniped species and some captive individuals (see Chapter 20 ). Biotoxin exposure can also cause severe central nervous disease in pinnipeds. Neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus of California sea lions is caused by domoic acid (DA) exposure (Scholin et al. 2000; see Chapter 16 ). Common neurological signs include seizures, tremors, and ataxia. Repeated expo - sure to DA results in permanent hippocampal damage with memory loss and often a chronic epileptic state (Goldstein et al. 2008; Buckmaster et al. 2014; Cook et al. 2016). Treatment for biotoxin exposure is supportive and includes anticon - vulsants, fluid therapy, and anti-inflammatory medication. Control of seizures with lorazepam (longer antiseizure effect than other benzodiazepines), midazolam, diazepam, or other benzodiazepines, and phenobarbital is beneficial. Current treatment for DA toxicosis at The Marine Mammal Center includes phenobarbital (4 mg/kg IM twice daily for 2 days, then 2 mg/kg IM or PO twice daily for 5 days) and lorazepam (0.2 mg/kg IM twice daily for the first 1-2 days, or longer as needed to control seizures). Subcutaneous (SC) fluids and dexamethasone (in the absence of ocular ulcer) are also gener - ally administered for the first few days. An additional 0.2 mg/kg lorazepam is given IM if seizures do not stop 10-15 minutes after the first dose, and a third dose may also be given. If sei-zure activity does not stop after three doses of at least 0.2 mg/kg lorazepam (over approximately 45 minutes), euthanasia is recommended due to poor prognosis. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a powerful antioxidant that crosses the blood-brain barrier, is also currently being administered to sea lions that strand at TMMC with DA toxicosis (10 mg/kg SC once daily), in an effort to reduce oxidative damage secondary to neuronal dam - age and necrosis. Successful control of idiopathic seizures in a captive adult California sea lion has been achieved with 1 mg/kg SID oral phenobarbital (Gage, pers. comm.), and a young California sea lion with intracranial structural anomalies using oral phenobarbital 4 mg/kg once daily (Dold et al. 2005). Various anomalous and developmental brain lesions have been identified in pinnipeds. Pneumocerebellum, attributed to gas bubble formation, was noted in two stranded California sea lions (Van Bonn et al. 2011, 2013). Intracranial space-occupying lesions, usually tumors, have caused seizures in cap - tive sea lions. Although hydrocephalus occurs in young stranded elephant seals (Trupkiewicz, Gulland, and Lowenstine 1997), sudden death, rather than neurological signs, usually occurs. Other reported congenital and anomalous neurologic abnor - malities in various pinnipeds include hemicerebral anomalies (McKnight et al. 2005), bilateral caudate nucleus inflammation (Dennison et al. 2011b), cerebral infarction (Stevens et al. 2010), and discospondylitis (Tuomi et al. 2004); and multicentric neu - rofibromatosis was diagnosed in a geriatric California sea lion (Rush, Ogburn, and Garner 2012). Thiamine deficiency is common in pinnipeds fed with frozen fish, particularly fish with high thiaminase content, and can result in polioencephalomalacia with acute neuro - logical signs. Antemortem diagnosis is based on clinical signs and lack of supplementation, coupled with diet evaluation and response to supplementation, as clinicopathologic find - ings are generally nonspecific (Croft et al. 2013). Thiamine-dependent enzyme activity (transketolase) in blood and tissue samples can also be measured. Hyponatremia presents with similar clinical signs, and is also diagnosed by a combina - tion of history of lack of supplementation (particularly in freshwater), plasma biochemistry, and response to treatment with sodium chloride (Geraci 1972b). Electrolyte imbalances associated with renal disease and/or nutritional deficiencies may also cause neurological signs (see Chapters 8 and 29). Selenium toxicosis was reported for several captive California sea lions that were fed with a diet later found to be high in selenium (Edwards et al. 1989).Q4 9781498796873_C041.indd 905 9/13/2017 9:10:32 PM906 Seal and Sea Lion Medicine Surgery Surgical procedures for pinnipeds are generally comparable to those of canids with some species-specific adjustments. Commonly performed procedures are described below, and many are summarized in Higgins and Hendrickson (2013). Ocular surgery is discussed in Chapter 23 . Surgical procedures of the integument generally include mass removal, biopsy collection, and wound debridement and care. Standard sterile and surgical technique should be followed, including clipping hair from the affected site, sterile preparation of the incision site, and sterile procedure. Care should be taken with fur seals to minimize clipping, due to these species' reliance on fur for thermoregulation. An alter - native to clipping in fur seals is to part the hair down the inci-sion line using a tight comb, such as a flea comb, and apply betadine gel to prepare the skin, a technique used in sea otter surgical procedures (gel prepared by combining 12 ml beta - dine solution with 4.5-ounce sterile, water-based, lubricant; Murray, pers. comm.). As pinnipeds generally recline on, and often ambulate on their ventral surface, surgical approach should be dor - solateral when possible to avoid contact of the incision site (postoperatively) with the ground. The thick hypodermis (blubber layer) often necessitates good retraction for proper exposure. Closure of skin and deeper layers should include tension relieving suture patterns in most areas, due to high tension and pressure on tissues. The hypodermis has poor holding capacity, and in healthy individuals is at least several centimeters thick, and even thicker in more robust animals. Tension-relieving suture patterns in this location are particu - larly important, as this layer must be closed to reduce dead space. Incisions that are full thickness (into the abdomen), or deep tissues, should be closed with four or five layers to help prevent dehiscence. Staples and sutures are both effective in closing the skin. Pain control with opioids and/or NSAIDS is strongly recommended perioperatively and postoperatively for most invasive procedures (see Chapter 27 for drugs and dosages). The duration of time to return an animal to water postop - eratively varies greatly, though is only occasionally reported. Return to water may depend largely on the procedure, spe - cies, status (free-ranging vs. captive), and incision location. Free-ranging California and Steller sea lions with satellite tag transmitters implanted into the abdomen were returned to enclosures with access to water within hours postsurgery (Horning et al. 2008). None of the animals experienced dehiscence or infection of the surgical site. In the authors' experience, contamination of surgical sites with urine and feces, especially over the abdomen and extremities, can lead to infection and dehiscence; thus, most animals are allowed full-time access to water within a matter of days to a week. Alternatively, animals may be given access to water daily for restricted periods of time for hygiene, feeding, and comfort. Contamination of a surgical site by waterborne pathogens is also possible; thus, regular monitoring of incision sites is required. If not allowed access to water, animals should be kept in a clean, dry area with a smooth surface, particularly if surgery was performed on the ventrum or extremities. Surgery of the musculoskeletal system frequently involves long bone or phalanx repair or amputation, and skull trauma including dental surgery. Fracture repair of long bones is rarely reported in the literature. One report describes the placement of a string-of-pearls locking plate, impregnated with antibiot - ics, to repair a closed, complete transverse diaphyseal fracture of the tibia of a 2-week-old gray seal (Hespel et al. 2013). A yearling California sea lion that presented with osteomy - elitis of the left carpus was successfully released following fusion of the joint, using external fixation (Field, unpubl. data; Figure 41.1 ). Initial systemic antibiotic treatment of the infection with multiple different antibiotics was unsuccessful; thus, poly - methylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads impregnated with ami - kacin were placed around the joint, two rows of pins were placed in the radius and metacarpals, and PMMA bars made of thermoplastic polymeric material were placed to stabilize the joint ( Figure 41.2a and b ). The fixator was removed 6 weeks later, following suc - cessful joint fusion. Amputation of phalanges, digits, or limbs is not uncom - mon when bone is exposed or infection cannot be controlled with antimicrobial drugs. A nerve block using a local anes - thetic, such as lidocaine or bupivacaine, is strongly recom - mended for both pain control and to help reduce minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) for general anesthesia. Phalanx amputation is common and similar to other species. It is of particular importance to preserve as much of the surround - ing tissue as possible by undermining around the affected bone(s) to allow adequate subcutaneous tissue and skin Figure 41.1 External fixation device on the dorsal surface a California sea lion yearling front flipper. 9781498796873_C041.indd 906 9/13/2017 9:10:33 PMSeal and Sea Lion Medicine 907 closure. A dorsal approach is recommended, since these dis - tal sites are in regular contact with the ground, and the dorsal surface is easily visualized for recheck examination. If insuf - ficient tissue is present to entirely close the end of a joint or limb, mid-diaphyseal amputation of the next proximal bone is recommended to prevent high tension and dehiscence of the incision site. Partial or complete front or hind flipper amputations have also been performed with return to normal, or near normal, locomotion. The impact of amputation surgery on the ability of free-ranging animals to successfully forage for live prey and have adequate mobility on land should be strongly con - sidered prior to the procedure, and must be assessed prior to releasing the animal. Figure 41.3 depicts the successful amputation of the right hind flipper of a yearling California sea lion at the level of the coxofemoral joint subsequent to severe limb damage ( Figure 41.4 ). The joint was approached from the lateral aspect and care was taken to isolate and ligate the blood vessels around the joint (Da Costa Gomez, pers. comm.). Soft tissue over the tarsus/tibiotarsus is particularly limited and difficult to close; thus, mid-diaphyseal amputation of the tibia and fibula with Patient ID: C SL 12895 Patient name: L Extremity lateralVet Rocket X1 Wireless /T_he Center Sausalit o 6/13/2016 9:29:18 A REX: 65 7 (a)L ID: SL 12895 Patient L AUS Rocket X1 ireless S Marine Center o 6/13/20169:29:35 A MREX: 77 9 (b)L Figure 41.2 (a, b) Dorsoventral and lateral radiographs of the exter - nal fixation device of California sea lion yearling with osteomyelitis incorporating the left carpus.

This technique is described by Garcia et al. (2015) for harbor seal weanlings suffering from necrotizing infections of the tarsus or tibiotarsal joint. Bandage maintenance is challenging in these species, even when maintained out of water, given their fusiform body shape and their aquatic environment. Surgeries involving the pinniped skull are generally con - fined to dental surgery and mandibular repair secondary to trauma. Fractured and loose teeth should be extracted (see Chapter 22 ). Lewer et al. (2007) described a case of closed left mandibular fracture in a geriatric harbor seal, which healed successfully after 12 months with the use of an oral dental acrylic splint and cerclage wire. A bilateral mandibular fracture in a 12-year-old South African fur seal was reduced and plated using two 3.5 mm positioning and compression device (PCD) plates and autotype screws (Flanagan et al. 2009). Both fractures resolved within 2 months. A harbor seal pup that stranded with a closed, complete fracture of the right caudal mandible developed a bony sequestrum at the fracture site. A ventral approach was used to debride the lesion and place an intraosseous wire. Canine trabecular bone powder and equine lamellar cortical bone matrix were used, along with platelet-rich plasma as a graft. The seal did well postop - eratively (Rosenberg et al. 2015).Surgery of the respiratory tract of pinnipeds has not been reported in the literature, despite common occurrence of severe respiratory disease. Tracheal perforation secondary to entanglement in monofilament fishing line occurs occasion - ally in free-ranging pinnipeds. Successful repair of tracheal perforation in California sea lions has been accomplished by initial debridement to freshen wound edges, and release incisions of existing scar tissue, to decrease tension. Mucosal margins of the trachea are closed with simple interrupted sutures, if possible. Overlying muscle layers are closed with interrupted horizontal mattress and cruciate sutures followed by standard closure of subcutaneous and skin layers with tension-relieving sutures (Da Costa Gomez, pers. comm.) Abdominal surgery is performed most commonly for gastrotomy, or for procedures involving the reproductive tract. Esophageal surgery for fishhook removal has been per - formed in Hawaiian monk seals, as well as partial glossec - tomy of necrotic lingual tissue for the same reason (Barbieri et al. 2013; Levine, pers. comm.). Gastric foreign bodies are not uncommon in pinnipeds and are often found incidentally on necropsy of free-ranging pinnipeds with no evidence of associated pathology. Many animals will regurgitate or vomit foreign objects, or objects may be retrieved using gastros - copy. Surgery is indicated for gastric impaction, gastric perfo - ration, fishhooks embedded in tissue, or other severe disease. The pinniped stomach is strongly u-shaped, but is otherwise similar to the canine. Gastrotomy for fishhook removal has been performed in numerous Hawaiian monk seals (Levine and Barbieri, pers. comm.). Gastric impaction by rocks, sand, or other abnormal ingesta is frequently noted in juvenile harp and hooded seals that strand on the east coast of the United States (Helmick, Dunn, and St. Aubin 1995) and west - ern European coast (Alonso-Farre et al. 2011). The reason for foreign material ingestion is unknown, and seals are often critically dehydrated with severe gastric disease on presenta - tion. Rehydration and administration of mineral oil and small amounts of water through an orogastric tube may allow sand and smaller rocks to pass, or in some cases rocks can be removed through endoscopy or laparoscopically. Gastrotomy was successful in treating rock impaction in a stranded juve - nile harp seal with concurrent severe pneumonia ( Figure 41.5). This harp seal was maintained on IV fluids and antibiot - ics, IM famotidine, and oral fluids and mineral oil for nearly 3 weeks until the pneumonia had resolved sufficiently to allow surgery (Field, Schuh, and Tuttle 2009). Intestinal surgery has also not been reported in the lit - erature, though a variety of intestinal diseases, including gastric torsion, gastric or mesenteric volvulus, intussuscep - tion, obstruction, and other surgical conditions have been found on necropsy. Laparotomy on a severely debilitated free- ranging Hawaiian monk seal with a jejunal intussuscep - tion was initially successful; however, the animal died sev - eral days later secondary to mesenteric torsion (Levine and Barbieri, pers. comm.). Though these severe intestinal diseases Figure 41.4 Dorsoventral radiograph of hind limbs of a California sea lion yearling prior to leg amputation.

Surgery of the reproductive tract has been reported for both male and female pinnipeds. Ovariohysterectomy was performed in a South Australian fur seal with a vaginal pro - lapse; the procedure was performed similar to that of a dog, with a ventral midline incision, exteriorization of the uterus, ligation of the ovarian, broad ligament and uterine vessels, and ligation of the uterine body at the cervix, using overlap - ping horizontal mattress sutures followed by oversewing of the uterine stump (Read et al. 1982). Caesarian section has been performed in California sea lions (Schmitt, pers. comm.) and in an 8-year-old harbor seal with uterine torsion. In this case, the dam became acutely lethargic and anorexic, and the fetal heart rate and movement were reduced. The uterine tor - sion prevented cervical dilation and pup expulsion, and the pup was successfully resuscitated following surgical interven - tion. The uterus was closed in two layers, the abdomen in four layers, and the skin effectively sealed with Dermabond (Gili, pers. comm.). Most other reported gastropexy for a hiatal hernia, ovariectomy, and tissue biopsies, have been performed laparoscopically (see Chapter 25 ). In male pinnipeds, orchiectomy has been performed in a of otariids (scrotal testes); however, this proce - dure phocids because their testes are para-abdominal. Otariid testes can retract strongly, so cas - tration of mature males during breeding season when the testes have descended may be advantageous. If out of sea - son or if animals are immature, testes can be pushed into the scrotum with rectal manipulation. A prescrotal incision is generally recommended, and the procedure can be done closed or open. Open is recommended for mature animals to ensure adequate ligation of larger vessels. Two cases of partial penis amputation subsequent to persistent paraphi-mosis were reported in South African fur seals (Lacave, Guglielmi, and Mantratz 2008). One animal required partial os penis amputation and urethral reconstruction; the other required amputation of the tip of the penis; both recovered well.

Marine herbivores affect seaweed biomass and community structure in marine habitats across the globe. Consequently, herbivore-seaweed interactions are expected to be important for the establishment and invasion success of non-native seaweeds. To synthesize current knowledge of consumer effects on non-native seaweeds, we performed a meta-analysis on feeding preferences of native herbivores for non-native versus native seaweeds. Data were included from 35 studies, pub - lished from 1992-2015 and comprising 18 non-native seaweeds. Results showed that overall, native herbivores tended to prefer to feed on native rather than non-native seaweeds. Preferences were, however, variable across studies with significant differences between taxonomic and functional groups of seaweeds. In particular, filamentous red non-native seaweeds were of low palatability to native herbivores. No general feeding preferences were apparent between natives and non-natives for brown and green seaweeds, or for leathery and corticated seaweeds. In addition, we reviewed the existing studies on the effects of consumers on the performance of native and non-native seaweeds in invaded communities. This indicated that non-native seaweeds performed better than their native competitors in the presence of grazers, but in many cases had superior competitive abilities also in the absence of herbivory. To achieve a comprehensive evaluation of consumers' role in seaweed invasion success, future research should have a larger focus on manipulative community experi - ments, ideally on time scales that include seasonal changes and complete life cycles of the seaweeds. Introduction At any time, several thousand marine species are shuffled between biogeographical regions of the world's oceans (Johnson & Chapman 2007). Some of these species establish in their new commu - nities and become widespread and abundant, being deemed invasive, with significant impacts on community composition and ecosystem properties (Williamson & Fitter 1996). The global number of non-indigenous seaweeds has reached more than 270 species (Williams & Smith 2007), many of them reported to negatively affect native seaweed communities in terms of cover, density and bio - diversity (Schaffelke & Hewitt 2007, Engelen et al. 2015, Maggi et al. 2015). Identification of the 422SWANTJE ENGE, JOSEFIN SAGERMAN, SOFIA A. WIKSTR\u00d6M & HENRIK PAVIA factors that control establishment and invasion success of non-native species is a key challenge in invasion ecology and important for risk assessment and management of non-indigenous seaweeds. Herbivores have large influence on the abundance and community structure of both terrestrial and marine primary producers across ecosystems (e.g. Lubchenco & Gaines 1981, Hawkins & Hartnoll 1983, Hawkins et al. 1992, Hay & Steinberg 1992, Burkepile & Hay 2008, Poore et al. 2012). Consequently, herbivore-plant interactions have long been suggested to be crucial also for the outcome of plant invasions. On the one hand, herbivores are recognized to contribute to biotic resistance against the establishment and proliferation of non-native plants (Elton 1958, Maron & Vila 2001). On the other hand, herbivore for - aging has been suggested to drive invasions, when native herbivores preferably consume native over the non-native plant species. The latter argument forms the basis for the enemy release hypothesis (ERH), which states that non-native species become invasive since they escape the regulation of their co-evolved enemies in their native range and are less affected by enemies compared to the native competitors in their new range (Darwin 1859, Elton 1958, Keane & Crawley 2002). The reduced negative impact of herbivores is expected to give the non-native species a competitive advantage over the native plants in the community, leading to dominance and a biological invasion (Keane & Crawley 2002). The concepts of biotic resistance and enemy release originate from terrestrial plant systems; the findings from these systems have been summarized in several reviews and meta-analyses (Colautti et al. 2004, Levine et al. 2004, Liu & Stiling 2006, Parker et al. 2006, Chun et al. 2010). Recently, Kimbro et al. (2013) published a meta-analysis on biotic resistance in marine environments, indi - cating negative effects of consumers on non-native marine primary producers. Seaweeds were only represented by seven studies in their analysis and seaweed data were analyzed together with data on a non-native salt marsh grass. Thus, a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of research on herbivore effects on non-native seaweeds is still lacking. Seaweed communities are strongly dominated by generalist herbivores (Hawkins & Hartnoll 1983, Hawkins et al. 1992, Hay & Fenical 1992), which are more likely than specialists to include newly encountered species into their diet. Accordingly, generalist consumers have been suggested to counteract invasions by providing biotic resistance instead of facilitating invasions through enemy release (Parker & Hay 2005, Parker et al. 2006). There are, however, mechanisms by which non-native plants can escape generalist herbivores in their new range, especially by means of chemical defences (Wikstr\u00f6m et al. 2006, Verhoeven et al. 2009, Forslund et al. 2010, Schaffner et al. 2011, Enge et al. 2012, Nylund et al. 2012). Seaweeds are known to be rich in secondary metabolites (Hay & Fenical 1992) and there is an increasing number of examples where potent chemical defences against native herbivores have been demonstrated in non-native seaweeds (Lemee et al. 1996, Lyons et al. 2007, Nylund et al. 2011, Enge et al. 2012). It is not known, however, if low palatability to generalist herbivores is a common trait of non-native seaweeds or if this trait is important for invasion success in seaweed communities. The aim of this study was to review and synthesize current findings of consumer effects on non- native seaweeds. As part of the predictions of the ERH, we specifically explored via a meta-analysis whether non-native seaweeds are less palatable than native species, and thus generally experience a reduced impact by herbivores compared to native competitors. We further examined if there are differences among 1) seaweed taxonomic groups, 2) seaweed functional groups, 3) herbivore groups or 4) regions. Furthermore, we reviewed and summarized the literature that assessed the effects of herbivory on the competitive outcome between non-native and native seaweeds in a community. Material and methods Literature search and data extraction Relevant studies for the meta-analysis were identified in the online database ISI Web of Science in August 2015, with no restrictions on publication year, using the following combination of search terms: ((introduced OR invasive OR non-native OR exotic OR alien OR non-indigenous) AND 423A REVIEW OF HERBIVORE EFFECTS *graz* OR enem* OR prefer*)). In order to retrieve studies that tested non-native seaweeds but without specifying the species as non-native in the title or abstract, we performed an additional search for all non-native seaweeds listed in Williamson & Smith (2007) using the search terms: (('algal species name') AND (enem* OR herbivor* OR consum* OR graz*)). To determine if the seaweeds in these stud - ies were non-native, we compared the study region with the reported natural distribution of the species. We further included three as yet non-peer-reviewed datasets (S.A. Wikstr\u00f6m unpublished, K. Hill unpublished, S. Jakobsson unpublished). All titles and abstracts of the search results were screened for studies assessing feeding preferences or herbivore damage on non-native compared to native seaweeds, as well as for studies examining seaweed performances and competitive relation - ships between the non-native and native seaweeds in the presence and absence of herbivory. To be included in the final dataset, the studies had to meet the following criteria: 1) the investigated sea - weed was non-native to the study region while the seaweeds used for comparison and the herbivores were native to the study region; 2) the study assessed herbivore preference, damage or their effects on both non-native and native seaweed performance under laboratory or field conditions in two- or multiple-species experiments using living algal material; 3) the experimental design included proper controls and presented all necessary measures for calculating the effect size. We excluded data of epifaunal abundances on non-native compared to native seaweeds because abundance may reflect habitat choice rather than food preference (e.g. work on refuges from predation: Duffy & Hay 1991, Enge et al. 2013). We also excluded data from no-choice feeding experiments since consumption in a no-choice situation can be confounded by compensatory feeding (Cruz-Rivera & Hay 2000). Furthermore, studies using gut content analysis of herbivores collected in the field were excluded because it was not possible to relate gut content to the availability of seaweeds in the field. Finally, studies where herbivores were preconditioned on one of the experimental seaweeds by either being specifically collected from or fed with only that seaweed prior to the experiments were also excluded. For the retained studies the following data were compiled (see Table 1 ): seaweed species name, taxonomic and functional group, the study region and its corresponding climate region, the origin of the non-native seaweeds, herbivore species identity and phylum, as well as the experiment type (i.e. two- or multiple-choice). Mean values and measures of dispersion were extracted from figures using the WebPlotDigitizer software (Rohatgi 2015) or directly from text, tables or original datasets. All retrieved studies on herbivore feeding preference reported consumption or relative growth of the seaweeds as the response variable, which were either presented already corrected for autogenic changes of the seaweeds or together with the means of controls for autogenic changes. In the latter case, the consumption or rela - tive growth data were corrected for the autogenic changes before values were entered into the database. To obtain a reference value for the native seaweeds in multiple-choice experiments, we calculated the average consumption of all native seaweeds and used their pooled variance as a measure of variability, which assumes the means of the populations to differ but their variances to be the same. Meta-analysis Hedges' d standardized mean difference (Hedges & Olkin 1985) was used as the effect size measure and was calculated as the difference between non-native and native seaweeds: d = [(XNN - XN)/s], where XNN corresponds to the mean consumption of the non-native seaweed and XN to the mean consumption of the native species, s designates their pooled standard deviations and J is the small- sample-size bias correction factor. Positive Hedges' d values thereby reflect herbivore preference for the non-native seaweeds, while negative values reflect herbivore preference for the native seaweeds. Many publications reported data of several independently performed two- or multiple-choice experiments using different native seaweed species and/or different herbivores, which resulted in up to 16 data entries from one study and for one non-native seaweed. To balance the influence of studies in the analyses and to decrease possible non-independence of these multiple entries, we 424SWANTJE ENGE, JOSEFIN SAGERMAN, SOFIA A.

In this way, we kept the resolution between the non-native seaweed and herbivore species, but reduced the problem of overweighing and consequent false precision estimates (Rothstein et al. 2013). We also calculated a study-specific mean effect size when experiments were repeatedly performed at different times during the year. In both cases, the study-specific mean effects were estimated using a fixed-effects model, which assumes the results of the different experiments in one study to vary only because of random sampling error. This procedure reduced the number of entries in the dataset with a factor of up to five for some publications and in total from 145 to 74 entries. The meta-analysis on consumer preference for non-native versus native seaweeds was con - ducted using the metafor-package in R (Viechtbauer 2010) and the OpenMee software (Dietz et al. 2016). The weighted overall mean effect of herbivore preference for non-native or native seaweeds was calculated by a random-effects model using the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for residual heterogeneity. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the overall mean effect size generated from 4999 iterations. To check the robustness of the meta-analysis outcome, we calculated the fail-safe number with the weighted method of Rosenberg (2005), which represents the number of additional studies with no effect needed to change the result of the meta-analysis from significant to non-significant. Publication bias was further examined with a funnel-plot and the rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry (Begg & Mazumdar 1994). The influence of outli - ers on the overall mean effects size was tested by evaluating the change of the overall effect when one study at a time was left out of the analysis. Since hypothesis-driven research tends to favour large effect sizes in support of the hypothesis in earlier publications, we examined temporal trends in the data with a cumulative meta-analysis sorted by publication year (Jennions & M\u00f8ller 2002). We used meta-regression with mixed-effects models and with a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for residual heterogeneity to assess if the predefined covariables explained any of the observed heterogeneity and to explore their influence on consumer preference as well as differences between subgroups. Specifically, we tested how much of the observed heterogeneity the non-native seaweed itself accounted for, if there were differences in consumer preferences among phyla or func-tional groups of the non-native species, and if the climate region of the study site, herbivore phylum and experiment type influenced the study outcome. Origin and study region as covariables were omit - ted from these analyses since subgroups were often only represented by one or two species and few data entries in some of the subgroups, which were considered insufficient for a valid interpretation. Only five studies that tested for consumer effects on the performance of non-native and native seaweeds on a community scale were identified, too few to perform a formal meta-analysis. However, findings of the few existing studies were summarized and discussed. Results The literature search identified 35 studies published from 1992-2015 that examined feeding prefer - ences of native herbivores for non-native compared to native seaweeds. These studies addressed in total 18 non-native seaweed taxa: four green algae (Chlorophyta), four brown algae (Phaeophyceae) and ten red algae (Rhodophyta) (Table 1). This is comparable with the taxonomic composition of all registered non-native seaweeds reported by Williams & Smith (2007): of 276 taxa, 45 were green algae, 66 brown algae and 165 red algae. Accordingly, between 6-9% of all non-native seaweeds in each of the taxonomic groups were covered by our meta-analysis. All comparisons were made between non-native seaweeds and native seaweeds with the exception of one study with five data entries where the palatability of non-native seaweeds was compared to a seagrass species. By far the most intensively studied seaweeds in the context of feeding preference of herbivores were Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides (currently ) and Sargassum muticum , which also resulted in the highest number of entries for these species in the meta-analysis 429A REVIEW OF HERBIVORE EFFECTS ON SEAWEED INVASIONS (Table 1 ). More than two thirds of the non-native seaweeds included in the meta-analysis have their original distribution in the north-west Pacific and Indo-Pacific, whereas the most intensively studied region of introduction was the north-east Atlantic ( Table constituted the majority of the tested herbivores in the studies ( Table 1 ). Meta-analysis of consumer preference The weighted overall mean effect was estimated to be -0.528 with a bootstrapped 95% CI = (-0.872, -0.187). This effect was significantly different from zero (p = 0.002, Figure 1 ) and showed Overall (A) Forest plot of the estimated effect sizes (Hedges' d standardized mean difference) grouped by each non-native species (open squares) and by the phylum of the non-native species (grey squares).

The results of the different studies were, however, highly heterogeneous (residual hetero - geneity among studies: Q1,74 = 93.8%). Including the predefined covariables in the model showed that the identity of the non-native seaweed, taxonomic and functional groups as well as the experiment type explained significant amounts of the observed heterogeneity ( Figures 1 and 2). Residual heterogeneity was always high indicating that there may be other moderators not embraced by our analysis that influenced the outcome. Grouping the non-native species by their taxonomic group revealed that only non-native red sea - weeds were of low palatability to native herbivores, while the non-native green and brown seaweeds did not differ significantly in palatability compared to native seaweeds ( Figure 1 ). Grouping accord - ing to functional groups suggested that only non-native filamentous seaweeds were less preferred, whereas the palatability of corticated or leathery non-native seaweeds did not differ from native counterparts ( Figure 2 ). Due to the dataset structure, functional and taxonomic group were highly confounded: all green algae were corticated, all brown algae were leathery macrophytes and all filamentous algae were red seaweeds ( Table 1 ).

Analysis of the herbivore grouping revealed that arthropods and echinoderms found non-native seaweeds less palatable than native seaweeds, whereas molluscs and fish did not show any prefer - ence ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, herbivores from temperate to subpolar regions significantly preferred native seaweeds to non-native seaweeds, but herbivores from tropical or subtropical regions did not show a preference ( Figure 2 ). The experiment type had a significant influence on the effect size. In contrast to the two-choice experiments, the multiple-choice experiments, in which consumption of the non-native seaweed was compared to the averaged consumption of all native seaweeds, did not detect an overall significant feeding preference for native or non-native seaweeds ( Figure 2 ). Sensitivity analysis, publication bias and temporal trends There was no indication that the results obtained from the meta-analysis lacked robustness. Exclusion of any data entry in the meta-analysis always resulted in similar overall mean effect size and confi - dence intervals (results not shown), which indicated that there were no serious outliers present. The cumulative meta-analysis by publication year showed that from the eighth data entry (2001), the overall mean effect size was constantly negative, oscillating between -0.628 and -0.302, though the 95% confidence interval included zero over some periods ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, Rosenberg's fail-safe number was sufficiently large (4219) to conclude that the observed outcome was a reliable estimate of the overall effect size. Additionally, the funnel plot and rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry gave no indication that publication bias affected the observed outcome (rank cor - relation test, Kendall's = 0.098, p = 0.2196, Figure 4 ). Review of community studies Our literature search identified nine studies that examined adult performance of non-native sea - weeds in the presence and absence of consumers. Only five reported effects on cover or biomass for both the non-native species and native seaweeds. These studies included one green, two brown and two red algal taxa and are summarized in Table 2 . All taxa were also covered by the meta-analysis of feeding preference. In the presence of herbivores, the filamentous red alga Bonnemaisonia hamifera reached higher cover and its biomass increased in short-term community experiments under laboratory conditions. In the absence of herbivores, B. hamifera was an inferior competitor compared to the native red seaweeds in the community and decreased in abundance (Enge et al. 2013, Sagerman et al. 2014). In contrast, the filamentous red alga Heterosiphonia japonica (currently accepted name Dasysiphonia japonica ) dominated the community independent of herbivore presence due to its extreme growth rate (Sagerman et al. 2014). Compared to six native species, the leathery brown alga Sargassum muticum was the only seaweed that could maintain clear positive growth in the presence of herbi - vores in a short-term laboratory community experiment, but was also a superior competitor in the absence of herbivores (Engelen et al. 2011). Grazing had no effect on the cover of the corticated green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides (currently fragile ) in a 13-week field experiment , while the native competitor Laminaria longicruris (currently accepted name Saccharina longicruris ) could not persist and cover of turf algae strongly decreased under natural sea urchin densities. But again, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides had superior competitive abilities compared to Laminaria longicruris even in the absence of herbivores (Sumi & Scheibling 2005). On sea urchin barrens, grazing could not prevent canopy development of the leathery brown Undaria pinnatifida over a 30-month period , while the native canopy species did not exceed more than 0.7% cover (Valentine & Johnson 2005). In addition, the native canopy species showed inferior 432SWANTJE ENGE, JOSEFIN SAGERMAN, SOFIA A. WIKSTR\u00d6M & HENRIK PAVIA competitive abilities compared to U. pinnatifida in the absence of herbivores (Valentine & Johnson 2005). Discussion Our meta-analysis showed that overall, non-native seaweeds tend to be less palatable than native seaweeds to herbivores in the new community. However, the meta-analysis also revealed consider - able variability among the results of different studies. This variability could largely be explained by the identity of the seaweed taxon, indicating that the relative palatability of native compared 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.019921995 19992001 2002 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 201520122011 Hedges' d standardized mean dierence Figure 3 Forest plot of the cumulative meta-analysis of herbivore feeding preference between native and non-native seaweeds, ordered by publication year.

It was only for reds, but not for the brown and green seaweeds, that the meta-analysis demonstrated an overall difference in herbivore preference between native and non-native species. Furthermore, the meta- analysis revealed that filamentous non-native species, which were all red seaweeds in our analysis, tended to be of low palatability to native herbivores. Feeding preference of herbivores is positively correlated to the nutritional quality and the shel - ter provided by the seaweed, and seaweeds can in turn deter herbivores by structural and chemical defences (Lubchenco & Gaines 1981, Hay & Fenical 1992). The low herbivore preference for non- native filamentous algae is an unexpected result because filamentous algae are commonly regarded to be palatable and highly susceptible to most consumers (Littler & Littler 1980, Steneck & Watling Table 2 Summary of community studies on herbivore effects on non-indigenous seaweeds SpeciesTaxonomic Filamentous Enge japonica2Rhodophyta Filamentous Sagerman et al. 2014 Laboratory experiment Note: Functional group classification follows Littler & Littler (1984): filamentous = delicately coarsely branched, corticated; leathery = thick branched, heavily corticated or thick walled. 1 currently accepted name Codium fragile ssp. fragile 2 currently accepted name Dasysiphonia japonicaHedges' d standardized mean dierenceInverse standard error 0.4891.6852.8804.0755.270 5.0 0.0 5.0 10.0 Figure 4 Funnel plot for the meta-analysis of feeding preferences using a random-effects model. Each data entry is represented by a circle showing the relation of the effect size (Hedges' d standardized mean difference) to its inversed standard error. The black line indicates the estimated overall mean effect and the white region represents the region in which 95% of the studies are expected to lie in the absence of biases and heterogeneity.434SWANTJE ENGE, JOSEFIN SAGERMAN, SOFIA A. WIKSTR\u00d6M & HENRIK PAVIA 1982, Littler et al. 1983). Consequently, this group could be expected to face a higher degree of con - sumptive biotic resistance in new regions, compared to non-native seaweeds from other functional groups. Our result matches recent findings suggesting that leathery and foliose algae are more sus - ceptible to herbivores than filamentous or corticated algae (Poore et al. 2012), which indicates that structural traits, such as tissue toughness, is far from always a determining factor for food choice of herbivores and that feeding preferences are driven by other seaweed traits. The presence of chemical defences can explain low palatability of certain seaweeds to marine herbivores (Hay & Fenical 1992, Pavia et al. 2012). Accordingly, it has been postulated that chemi - cal defences can protect non-native seaweeds, as well as vascular plants, from being attacked by native herbivores in a new region, either by comparatively high defence concentrations or by molec - ular structures that are evolutionarily novel to the native herbivores (Cappuccino & Arnason 2006, Wikstr\u00f6m et al. 2006, Verhoeven et al. 2009, Enge et al. 2012). Red seaweeds in particular produce an immense diversity and high quantities of often halogenated secondary metabolites, which have been frequently demonstrated to possess effective antimicrobial (Persson et al. 2011, Nylund et al. 2013), antifouling (Dworjanyn et al. 2006), allelopathic (Svensson et al. 2013) and antiherbivore activities (Kladi et al. 2005, Cabrita et al. 2010, Enge et al. 2012). The diversity of chemical defence compounds in red algae may explain why non-native red seaweeds showed especially low palat - ability in our meta-analysis. The establishment of a specific chemical basis for a low preference of potential native consum - ers for an introduced organism is, however, a demanding task and marine examples are still rare. Evidence for chemical defences against native herbivores has so far only been provided for a few non-native seaweed species. The green algae, Caulerpa taxifolia and C. racemosa , produce caul on sea (Amade & Lem\u00e9e 1998, Dumay et which deters native sea urchins (Lyons et al. 2007). The arc - tic brown alga, Fucus evanescens*, contains significantly higher concentrations of phlorotannins (polyphenolic defence compounds) than native fucoids in its new range, deterring native isopods and molluscs (Wikstr\u00f6m et al. 2006, Forslund et al. 2010). The red alga, provides resistance against native isopods and molluscs (Nylund et al. 2011, Hammann et al. 2016). Another red seaweed, the filamentous Bonnemaisonia hamifera, produces volatile brominated compounds that defence against native isopods, gammarids and ophistobranch consumers (Enge et al. 2012). These examples show that chemical defence can explain the low palatability of some non-native seaweeds, but further studies are needed before it can be concluded that chemical defence is a common trait of low-preferred non-native seaweeds (especially of the filamentous red algae). Notably, two of the species for which chemical defences have been characterized ( Caulerpa rac - emosa and Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides ) were not consistently of low preference to native her - bivores in our meta-analysis. In both cases, the chemical defence compound was only documented to be active against one herbivore species, while multiple herbivores were tested in the feeding pref - erence experiments. A specific chemical defence is usually not effective against all herbivore spe - cies, since herbivores can adapt to and/or circumvent the effects of secondary metabolites (Sotka, 2005). Furthermore, concentrations and the effectiveness of the chemical defence compounds can vary between seaweed and herbivore populations (Pavia et al. 2003, Sotka 2005), which makes it * Fucus evanescens may have expanded its range naturally, but available evidence suggests that the spread of this species to southern Scandinavia and the British Isles was aided by human transport. It exhibits a disjunct distribution with new occurrences that were discovered in harbours in the beginning of the 20th century, making introduction from shipping plausible. Thus, we chose to include Fucus evanescens in the definition of a non-native species that we used in the litera - ture search, i.e. a species that has been translocated to a new range by humans. 435A REVIEW OF HERBIVORE EFFECTS ON SEAWEED INVASIONS important that the palatability of non-native species introduced into several regions are tested with a set of the native herbivores that are relevant in the new regions. Herbivore preference can be a first indicator for plant performance and competitive ability, but cannot be directly translated into community composition and population dynamics under natural conditions. We found that studies using long-term community experiments assessing the effects of consumers on non-native seaweeds in interaction with native seaweeds are essentially lack - ing. The few existing studies included in our review showed that performance of non-native sea - weeds can be increased, equal or reduced in the presence of herbivores. To date, the most rigorous example of a successful seaweed invasion based on chemical defence concerns the filamentous red alga Bonnemaisonia hamifera (Figure 5 ). The documented chemical defence (1,1,3,3-tetrabromo- 2-heptanone) provides this relatively poor competitor (in the absence of native herbivores), with a strong competitive advantage in its new range in the presence of native herbivores (Enge et al. 2013, Sagerman et al. 2014). In addition, the same brominated compound inhibits the recruitment of native algal competitors (Svensson et al. 2013) and reduces bacterial load (Nylund et al. 2008). Thus, the multiple ecological benefits of this compound outweigh the cost of its production for the invader in the new range (Nylund et al. 2013). In some of the other studies the non-native seaweeds often performed better than their native competitors in the presence of herbivores, but the non-native species were superior competitors also in the absence of herbivores. Thus, the extent to which low herbivore preference contributes to invasion success of non-native seaweeds remains elusive. There is a need for more studies on the effects of herbivores on non-native seaweed populations, ideally experiments that include seasonal changes and complete life cycles of the seaweed and grazers. This is a challenging task in marine environments with species with complex life cycles. In conclusion, the results of our meta-analysis show that low palatability does not seem to be a universal trait among non-native seaweeds and only certain seaweeds escape native herbivores in AB C Figure 5 The invasive filamentous red seaweed Bonnemaisonia hamifera , which produces a potent chemi - cal defence (1,1,3,3-tetrabromo-2-heptanone) that makes it unpalatable to native herbivores in the north Atlantic, thereby providing it with a strong competitive advantage over native seaweeds in its new range.

Filaments are one cell-layer thick and have numerous gland cells, containing chemical defences, located between the vegetative cells (C). (From Nylund et al. 2008.)436SWANTJE ENGE, JOSEFIN SAGERMAN, SOFIA A. WIKSTR\u00d6M & HENRIK PAVIA their new range. Accordingly, the prediction of the enemy release hypothesis that introduced species are less attacked by herbivores than their native counterparts in the new range (Keane & Crawley 2002), does not hold for all non-native seaweeds. Interestingly, we found that non-native filamen - tous red seaweeds tend to be especially less palatable to herbivores. This is an important finding considering the majority of seaweed introductions are filamentous or corticated red algae (Williams & Smith 2007). Due to their morphology, these species can often be cryptic or less apparent com - pared to larger brown and green seaweeds. Probably, therefore, they are less frequently studied and often overlooked in their community impacts, even though effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes have been proven (Schaffelke & Hewitt 2007, Sagerman et al. 2014). The low preference for many non-native filamentous red algae indicates that low impact of herbivores may contribute to invasion success in this group. However, to assess if consumers play a crucial role in seaweed invasions, future research should focus on examining consumer impacts on competitive interactions between non-native and native seaweeds.

Mitchell, Jason D. Toft, and Megan K. La Peyre 1.1 the C haLLeNGe: a h IStOrY OF S hOreLINe ar MOrING For centuries, estuarine and coastal shorelines have been dramatically modified by humans for far-ranging and, at times, conflicting purposes, such as water access, commerce, aquaculture, and property protection. Legal principles governing these uses often tend to favor the interests of coastal property owners or societal rights to access and exploit natural resources. For example, in most coastal communities, shoreline armoring is allowed and accepted if property is deemed to be at risk. As a result, shorelines have been extensively armored globally and ecosystem function has diminished. The amount of shoreline armoring along a given coast varies depending on surround-ing land use, with major coastal cities often having more than 50% of their shores hardened (e.g., Chapman and Bulleri 2003). However, shoreline armoring is not restricted to dense urban areas, as coastal areas in the process of change (e.g., agriculture to suburban) may experience the fast - est rates of shoreline hardening (Isdell 2014). In sum, the United States has roughly 14% (22,000 km) of its extensive coastline armored (Gittman et al. 2015). In Europe, more than half of the >15,000 km of coastline that is eroding is artificially stabilized (EC 2004). Likewise, more than half of Mediterranean coastlines are armored and developed (EEA 1999). In Japan, approximately half of its coastline is reportedly eroding (15,900 km of the 34,500 km of total coast) and approximately 27% of that coastline has been hardened (Koike 1993). In Australia, the densely populated coastal cities typically have more than 50% of their coastlines armored (Chapman 2003). Pressures to abate erosion and secure shorelines in place will only continue, and likely increase, as the proportion of the global population living within 100 km of the coasts grows from one-third to an expected one-half by 2030 (Small and Nicholls 2003) and sea level continues to rise. This may be particularly problematic in areas where heavily urbanized landscapes intersect with higher-than-average rates of sea level rise; for example, the North American Gulf and mid-Atlantic coasts have the highest CONte NtS 1.1 The Challenge: A History of Shoreline Armoring ................................................................... 3 1.2 What's in a Name? .................................................................................................................... 4 1.3 Role for Living Shorelines in Conservation and Climate Adaptation Strategies ..................... 7 1.4 Purpose and Book Organization ............................................................................................... 7 References .......................................................................................................................................... 84 Living ShoreL ineS rates of rise in the United States (Boon and Mitchell 2015) and respectively have the third and fifth fastest-growing coastal populations in the continental United States (Crossett et al. 2004). Closely associated with shoreline modification is the loss or alteration of intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats (e.g., wetlands, seagrasses) and ecosystem function (e.g., Bilkovic and Roggero 2016; Dugan et al. 2011; Peterson and Lowe 2009 and references within). This has implications for ecosystem service provision to coastal communi - ties including shore protection, fisheries production, and water quality benefits (e.g., Arkema et al. 2013; Bilkovic et al. 2016; Gedan et al. 2011; Scyphers et al. 2015). Growing concern about the cumulative effects of piecemeal alterations to the coastlines has reinforced the need for alternative shoreline management strategies. While wetlands have been long recognized as providing some level of protection to coastal communities from wave-induced erosion, the intentional use of natural habitat elements to reduce shoreline erosion was first reported in the early 1970s (Garbisch and Garbisch 1994). Since that time, the understanding and practical application of nature-based techniques have grown tremen - dously. In recent years, nature-based approaches are being extensively promoted and practiced glob - ally primarily because of (1) growing acknowledgment of the value of ecosystem services provided by coastal habitats (Barbier et al. 2011; Costanza et al. 1997) and the adverse effects of traditional armoring to coastal systems, (2) the extensive ongoing loss of many threatened coastal habitats (marsh, seagrasses) (Duarte 2009; Halpern et al. 2008; Waycott et al. 2009), and (3) the realiza-tion that dynamic erosion protection approaches that incorporate natural ecosystem elements (e.g., marsh, beach) may be more responsive and resilient in some settings to storm events than traditional armoring (Gedan et al. 2011; Gittman et al. 2014). However, the field of shoreline restoration in human systems is in its nascent stages. In particular, challenges remain to reconcile conflicting uses and establish a path-forward to effectively manage shorelines for both ecological and human protec-tions, leading to our topic of living shorelines. 1.2 What'S IN a N aMe? With any new discipline, there tends to be a growing period when terminology has not been formally defined and accepted by all participants, which can lead to a certain amount of confu - sion, setbacks, and misinformation. This is especially true for shoreline management when goals can be at cross-purposes and depend on the viewpoint. The countless terms that exist to describe shoreline protection approaches that integrate nature elements illustrate the difficulties that remain for the field. These terms include living shorelines, nature-based shoreline protection, green shore - lines, geomorphic engineering, soft stabilization, building with nature, and variances thereof. For simplicity, we will refer to these shoreline approaches as Living Shorelines henceforth. A near con - sensus among practitioners is that these approaches are intended to not only protect shorelines and infrastructure but also conserve, create, or restore natural shoreline functions in estuarine, marine, and aquatic systems. In practice, living shorelines should predominantly consist of organic tech-niques and materials that are characteristic of the local system, such as wetland, riparian, and dune plantings; beach nourishment; shellfish reefs; and emplaced large woody debris. The connection between aquatic and terrestrial habitats should be maintained, and dynamic movement of habitat features should be allowed in response to storm events and to promote sediment capture. Last, in higher-energy sites that require hybrid approaches with engineered structures to provide the req - uisite wave attenuation to sustain planted vegetation and habitats, engineered structures should be minimized to not overwhelm the living habitat features they are supporting (Figure 1.1). Public policy actions to promote the use of living shorelines have been implemented by regional and national governmental entities in the United States and Europe. In the United States, many coastal states have opted for either legislative requirements or the more popular option of 5 A Primer to Living ShoreL ineS employing incentives (expedited permit process, fee waivers) or fiscal aid (e.g., low interest loans) for the implementation of living shorelines as a preferred shoreline management approach (Bilkovic and Mitchell, Chapter 15, this book). Likewise, federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Environmental Protection Agency, and United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have developed funding and planning initia-tives to support living shoreline implementation. Moreover, the USACE and NOAA helped initiate a Community of Practice to enhance collaboration among academic institutes, nongovernmental organizations, and state and federal agencies called Systems Approach to Geomorphic Engineering (SAGE) to use living shorelines as a tool to achieve larger-scale community resilience (Bilkovic et al. 2016). In Europe (e.g., United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France), \"building with nature\" initiatives that involve the implementation of nature-based solutions as flood risk reduction measures are often driven by national and European legislation and are a growing trend (Borsje et al., Chapter 8, this book; Esteves et al., Chapter 9, this book). These efforts are not without criticism. Many of the criticisms voiced are related to the (often unintentional) misidentification of a practice that does not meet standard criteria as a living shore - line (e.g., Pilkney et al. 2012). There are many practices, particularly in urban settings, designed to enhance or mitigate adverse effects of engineered shorelines (e.g., seawalls) in high-energy or high-risk settings where living shorelines are not suitable. For instance, a common practice in Europe is the inland realignment of a coastal protection line (seawall). Elsewhere, armored shorelines are (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1.1 Living shorelines: (a) planted marsh with supporting stone sill (from Bilkovic and m itchell, Chapter 15, this book); (b) bio-engineered oyster reef (gabion mats) with marsh (From La Peyre et al., Chapter 18, this book); (c) oyster reef bases designed to encourage oyster recruitment (From hall et al., Chapter 13, this book); (d) created pocket beach habitat for juvenile salmon excavated from a stretch of riprap-armored shoreline (From Cordell et al., Chapter 21, this book).6 Living ShoreL ineS being reengineered to increase their habitat value, such as adding complexity to the surface of a seawall to encourage invertebrate recruitment (Browne and Chapman, Chapter 22, this book) or incorporating beach and cobble areas along coastlines where seawalls maintain coastal integrity of highly urbanized areas (Cordell et al., Chapter 21, this book) (Figure 1.2). However, care should be taken to ensure that these efforts are termed living shorelines only if they fully meet the defini - tion requirements in that the connection between aquatic and terrestrial habitats is maintained and engineered structures do not dominate. When engineered structures dominate the landscape, and shoreline protection is dependent solely on the maintenance of these engineered structures, the litmus test for a living shoreline has failed. For example, in some oyster reef restoration projects, a failure to recruit oysters that survive, grow, and build a reef over time may result in some level of shoreline protection, but this fails to be a living shoreline. In a final summary chapter of this book, we draw from the contributed works of the edited volume to more fully discuss the terminology of shoreline restoration and engineering and place living shorelines into a better context. Our hope is that this book will serve to better define living shorelines in a manner that can help refine the use of the term living shorelines as well as identify common concerns and the means to remedy or lessen some of these concerns.

Because of this, there is often a risk that ecological goals may be sacrificed for perceived shoreline or infrastructure protection. Therefore, living shorelines deviate from the traditional perspective of restoration or conservation, but these efforts can be complementary. The advantage that living shorelines confer is new feasible opportunities, particularly in urban or ex-urban settings, to offset previous or inevitable coastal habitat losses. The added benefit of protecting a shoreline can help overcome a \"restoration\" hurdle by providing an economically attractive rationale for the individual or community shouldering the cost. Further, the use of a living shoreline in place of armoring will act to curb additional loss to globally threatened habitats. These shoreline management approaches represent a paradigm shift as they work with rather than against natural nearshore processes. Such \"process-based\" planning and design is a worthy goal that can be difficult to achieve, but not impossible. The potential added value of a dynamic living shoreline serving as a climate adaptation strategy to conserve coastal resilience makes that goal particularly meaningful. While in many settings where landward migration is restricted there may be a foreseeable end date for a living shoreline, the benefits of maximizing ecosystem service provision in the near term may still be substantial. Moreover, there are techniques and certain natu - ral elements that may be incorporated to allow living shorelines to keep pace with sea level rise and extend their lifespan. For example, in the right location, an oyster reef used for shoreline protec-tion can respond to changing conditions including subsidence and sea level rise (Casas et al. 2015; La Peyre et al., Chapter 18, this book; Mann and Powell 2007; Walles et al. 2015) and structural support can be designed to encourage the capture of sediment so that accretion rates are sufficient for the persistence of created marshes in place (Currin et al., Chapter 11, this book). 1.4 p UrpOSe aND BOOK O rGaNIZatION To help guide future shoreline management and restoration, this edited volume assembles, syn - thesizes, and interprets the current state of the knowledge on the science and practice of living shorelines, as well as some outside the realm of living shorelines that still attempt to incorporate nature-based approaches, in order to provide context. Researchers, managers, and practitioners have gained valuable knowledge to inform the science of living shorelines, but that information has not been summarized in a single source, nor is it readily accessible to the broad spectrum of users in different disciplines (e.g., engineering, ecology, geology, and social sciences) that shoreline man - agement and restoration require. To cover the spectrum of topics, the book is divided into five major sections: (1) Background: History and Evolution; (2) Management, Policy, and Design; (3, 4) Synthesis of Living Shoreline Science: Physical and Biological Aspects; and (5) Summary and Future Guidance. After this intro - ductory chapter, Arkema and others adeptly detail how ecosystem service concepts can inform living shoreline science and implementation. The second section of the book provides insights on significant management, policy, and other social factors that influence the success of living shoreline projects, as well as effective living shoreline designs. The third and fourth section of the book synthesizes the literature that is available with data from new studies on the physical aspects of living shorelines including information on trajectories of living shoreline ecosystem development. The fifth section of the book summarizes information presented throughout the book to help guide future research and management strategies. The first summary chapter details the gaps in our understanding of living shorelines. In the second summary chapter, the editors synthesize author perspectives on three focal 8 Living ShoreL ineS areas to examine commonalities and differences among the contributed works. The three focal areas are as follows: 1. Lessons learned from the practice of shoreline restoration/conservation 2. Longevity and stability of projects in the near and long term with considerations for climate change and human development 3. What is the path forward? Research needs, strategies for working across different disciplines, train - ing options, and future opportunities This book will serve as a valuable reference to guide scientists, students, managers, planners, regulators, environmental and engineering consultants, and others engaged in the design and imple - mentation of living shorelines. Our intent is to provide a background and history of living shore - lines; understandings on management, policy, and project designs; technical synthesis of the science related to living shorelines including insights from new studies; and the identification of research needs, lessons learned, and perspectives on future guidance. To capture international efforts, the book includes perspectives from leading researchers and managers in Europe; the East, West, and Gulf coasts of the United States; and Australia who are working on natural approaches to shoreline management. The broad geographic scope and interdisciplinary nature of contributing authors will help facilitate dialogue and transfer of knowledge among different disciplines and across different regions. It is our hope that this book will provide coastal communities with the scientific founda-tion and practical guidance necessary to implement effective shoreline management that enhances ecosystem services and coastal resilience now and into the future. reFereNCe S Arkema, K.K., G.

Telemetry (acoustic and satellite), sensor, video, and data logger technology have all provided new insights into how sharks move, select habitat, and interact with other species; however, data collection can be arduous, expensive, time consuming, and spatially and temporally limiting. Satellite telemetry can provide valuable data on the water temperature and depths that wide-ranging elasmobranchs move through, but this technology does not provide much in the way of fine-scale geospatial positions or behavioral state. Alternatively, acoustic telemetry (see Chapter 8 in this volume) can provide either short-term, high-resolution position information and corresponding environmental data (e.g., water temperature, depth, activ - ity rate) via active tracking or longer term, lower resolution position information for many animals simultaneously, but over a much more limited spatial scale via passive tracking. Active tracking, in particular, is typically labor intensive and allows for tracking of one individual at a time, whereas pas-sive tracking is much less labor intensive but spatially lim - ited by the size of a stationary array. Advances in underwater robotics, inertial measurement unit (IMU), global positioning system (GPS), and autono - mous control systems have greatly enhanced our ability to measure a wide array of oceanographic parameters via auton - omous mobile underwater or surface vehicles and simulta-neously provide high positional accuracy. Commercially available autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have been developed and used primarily for oceanographic purposes; however, recent attempts have been made to incorporate acoustic telemetry hydrophones and receivers into these robots for fully autonomous active tracking of elasmobranchs tagged with acoustic transmitters. The primary benefits of these coupled technologies are they allow for accurate, fine-scale positioning of tagged elasmobranchs but can also simulta-neously record environmental conditions, map the benthos, and record biota surrounding focal individuals. The infor - mation discussed in this chapter covers the types of autono - mous vehicles, previous uses for surveying and tracking of elasmobranchs, and the future of this technology. 6.2 USe OF a UtONOMOUS UND erWater VehICLe S IN OC eaNOG raph Y aND M arINe SCI eNCe In 1957, the first autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was developed at the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory. The vehicle, named SPURV (Special Purpose Underwater Research Vehicle), had the ability to dive down to 3000 m and measure water temperature and conductiv - ity. Figure 6.1A shows the SPURV being deployed. Its form, consistent with early torpedo designs, was long and thin with a motor-driven propeller located at the rear of the vehicle for propulsion. Four control surfaces at the rear enabled steer - ing for direction control (yaw, pitch, and roll). This general design is still predominant in the AUV industry. 6.2.1 t ypes of a UVs and Capabilities Since SPURV was introduced to the research community, a large number of other underwater vehicles with different form factors have been designed, constructed, and deployed (Figure 6.1B,C). Unlike AUVs, which are typically untethered, fully autonomous, and designed to cover longer distances, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are tethered to a pilot's control con - sole located above the surface. Figure 6.1B shows an example of a micro-class ROV obtaining samples with a manipulator arm. Different again are autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), which are restricted to motion on the surface (Figure 6.1C). These vehicles are generally compared based on their depth rating, speed, level of autonomy (e.g., how much pilot interac-tion is required during a mission), endurance, sensor payload capacity, maneuverability, and data availability (e.g., whether or not data can be transmitted to the pilot in real time). 6.2.1.1 Remotely Operated Vehicles Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are differentiated from other vehicles by the fact that there is a tether that connects the vehicle to a control station typically located on a dock or boat. Pilots manually control the ROV via a joystick, allow - ing the pilot to send control signals to the vehicle's actua-tors (e.g., motors) through a wire bundle inside the tether. Similarly, vehicle sensor data are relayed from the vehicle back to the control station through the tether. These data can take on the form of video, depth, sonar, temperature, etc. and are typically necessary for pilot navigation. Power is also provided through the tether, removing the need for an onboard power supply. The presence of this tether offers several advantages when conducting fish or shark surveys. It provides real-time feedback to a pilot, thus allowing adap - tion to changing fish behaviors. The video also provides a means for characterizing habitat, prey abundance, etc.; for example, one can survey the bottom to determine if the sea-floor would facilitate egg laying for skates and catsharks. The tether, unfortunately, also restricts motion of the vehicle by limiting its range to the length of the tether. Monitoring fish with longer ranges using an ROV is simply not feasible. Because the vehicle is not traveling long distances and power is provided, ROVs are designed not so much for endurance as they are for maneuverability (e.g., their thruster configu - ration allows motion in all directions). They can be used for situations requiring up-close, interactive navigation.3 US E OF AU TONOMOUS VEH ICLES FOR TR ACKING AND SU RVEYING OUSTICALLY TA GGED E LASMOBRANCHS 6.2.1.2 B uoyancy-Driven Gliders Unlike typical AUVs, which are motor or propeller driven, buoyancy-driven gliders provide forward motion by modify - ing their applied buoyancy force in flight. The gliders are equipped with bladders (often located in the vehicle nose) that can be filled or emptied with water from the surround-ing environment. When ballasted correctly, the vehicle will change between being positively and negatively buoyant as the bladder is emptied or filled. Wings affixed to the sides of the vehicle transform these vertical forces into horizon - tal forces, enabling forward motion. Although this type of motion is slower (e.g., 0.35 m/sec) than propeller-driven AUVs (e.g., <2 m/sec), it requires less energy and hence provides longer endurance; for example, the Slocum Glider (Figure 6.2A) can travel a distance of 13,000 km with a maximum deployment time of 18 months. For this reason, the application of such vehicles to fish tracking is limited to conducting more long-range passive surveys than active tracking which requires greater speeds and maneuverability. 6.2.1.3 W ave-Driven Surface Gliders Similar to buoyancy-driven gliders, wave gliders harness naturally occurring vertical motion and transform it to hori - zontal motion. As waves carry the vehicle up and down, a (A) (B) (C) Figure 6.1 E xamples of underwater robots: (A) Deployment of SPURV, the first autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) (photograph cour - tesy of the Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle).

(C) This robot is a ClearPath Robotics Kingfisher ASV.4 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY wing system that sits underwater (see Figure 6.2B) provides a force in the forward direction. Also similar to buoyancy-driven gliders, wave gliders have longer endurance but lower maneuverability and speed, making them applicable to long-range passive tracking as opposed to active track - ing. Because their primary hull is surface oriented, these vehicles can offer real-time radio connectivity and the use of solar panels to provide the power required to support lon - ger missions.6.2.1.4 Propeller-Driven AUVs Propeller-driven AUVs are common, and most take on a form factor similar to the SPURV, in which the body is a long cylinder with a cone-shaped nose and actuation at the tail (e.g., the REMUS vehicles shown in Figure 6.2C-E). The motor-driven propellers located at the AUV tail provide for - ward and reverse locomotion, and a range of steerable control surfaces act as rudders to set the yaw, pitch, and roll angles (A)( B) (C) (D) (E) Figure 6.2 Autonomous underwater vehicles: (A) Slocum Glider; (B) underside of Liquid Robotics' Wave Glider (photograph courtesy of Liquid Robotics, Sunnyvale, CA); OceanServer Iver2 AUV; UTONOMOUS V EHICLES FOR T RACKING AND S URVEYING OF A COUSTICALLY T AGGED ELASMOBRANCHS of the vehicle. Several propeller-driven AUVs also have con - figurations with thrusters facing in multiple directions for increased maneuverability. Note that several hybrid buoy - ancy/propeller-driven AUVs are under development that aim to obtain the advantages of both approaches to locomotion. Examples of off-the-shelf, propeller-driven (Figure 6.2D,E). Notably, the REMUS 600 (Figure 6.2E) is larger, has a greater depth rating (up to 1500 m), and has greater endurance (24 hr) than the more typical REMUS 100 (Figure 6.2D), which has a 100-m depth rat - ing and 12-hr battery life at 1.5 knots. In research projects, both the Iver and REMUS vehicles have been outfitted with hydrophone-receiver systems that allow not only passive tracking of tagged fish but also active tracking. 6.2.1.5 Navigation Autonomous underwater vehicles come equipped with path- following capabilities such that users can simply upload to the vehicle a series of longitude, latitude, and depth points that the vehicle can be deployed to follow autonomously. Such path following requires a navigation system that itera-tively (1) estimates the vehicle's state (three-dimensional position and orientation) in georeferenced coordinates, (2) determines actuator signals, and (3) sends the signals to the actuators to realize path following. A key to this iterative process, which can run at rates of 10 Hz to several 100 Hz, is providing the state estimation step with accurate sensor data. The sensor payload of an AUV used for navigation typ - ically includes a GPS receiver (that only provides data when the vehicle is surfaced), a compass with three degrees of freedom (3DOF), a pressure sensor for depth, and an altim - eter that measures the distance from the seafloor. When the vehicle is underwater (and GPS denied), state estimators will often predict position states using additional sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), which measure accelerations and rotation rates, or Doppler velocity log - gers (DVLs), which measure the velocity of the vehicle with respect to the seafloor. Unfortunately, state estimates can \"drift\" using such techniques, resulting in positioning error (see Figure 6.3A). However, when the AUV has surfaced and reacquired a GPS location, the course can be corrected and the preplanned mission path resumed.

An example of several \"jumps\" in state estimates can be observed in (A). Consider the AUV's path in yellow at location (200, 100). A jump in the state estimate occurred because the vehicle was drifting off course without realizing it. When the vehicle surfaced at approximately (200, 100), the vehicle obtained a GPS measurement to enable a more accurate position state estimate, thereby allowing the vehicle to make a course correction, turn back to the desired path, and correct the path tracking error.6 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY positioning systems may also be used for absolute, drift-free underwater position measurements but with additional cost and infrastructure. Improving a vehicle's state estimation improves the ability of the vehicle not only to track paths but also to geolocalize sensor measurements. This is especially challenging when localizing tagged fish relative to a mov - ing AUV. The relative localization problem is difficult due to inaccurate time-of-flight measurements in the variable underwater environment, such as changing water density and sound reflections, and such issues will be compounded by inaccurate AUV state estimation. 6.2.1.6 Sensor Payloads and Applications Sensors are important for navigation, but most AUVs also have a sensor payload dedicated to sampling the underwater environment. Sensors in this payload section allow for mea-surements of oceanographic variables including salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen (DO 2) at dif - ferent depths during a mission (Figure 6.3). Sonar and video camera systems are other typical sensors found on AUVs, and they can be used in downward- and forward-facing ori - entations. They are often used for characterizing seafloor parameters, such as constructing bathymetry maps, terrain classification (Figure 6.4), or fish school quantification. It is important to note that, although video systems may have higher resolution when compared to sonar systems, they are typically shorter range and require sufficient lighting and water clarity. Although sonar and video data can be used for research data collection purposes, these data streams can also be used for navigation and obstacle avoidance. A major advantage of taking environmental sensor measure - ments when tracking fish is that the fish's behaviors can be tracked while simultaneously characterizing the fish's habi - tat, providing context for possible state changes in behav - ior. With the ability to obtain environmental measurements at sampling rates on the order of 1 Hz and geolocalized to within a few meters, AUVs have changed the way pas-sive sampling of the underwater environment is conducted. However, there is potential for AUVs to have even greater impact on the scientific community through active sam - pling, where the AUVs adapt their trajectories in real time to optimize information gain. For example, some AUVs have been programmed to track steep thermal gradients (Zhang et al., 2010). As described below, this ability of an AUV to modify its behavior in response to live measurements of oceanographic or biological information can be invaluable when tracking marine life that is highly dynamic and can travel long distances. 6.3 USe OF a UtONOMOUS UND erWater VehICLe S FO r StUDYING e LaSMOB raNChS 6.3.1 p assive t racking and Surveying with a UVs and a SVs A variety of commercially available autonomous under - water and surface vehicles (e.g., Slocum Gliders, Wave Gliders, REMUS AUVs, Iver AUVs) have been used to survey oceanographic parameters and map the seafloor of coastal and open-ocean environments over the last 20 years. However, more recently researchers have been equip - ping these autonomous mobile platforms with a variety of acoustic telemetry receivers to survey for marine animals instrumented with acoustic transmitters (Grothues, 2009; Grothues and Dobarro, 2010; et al., survey applications, AUVs and ASVs are primarily tasked to listen for fish tagged with coded transmitters typically used for passive tracking via stationary receivers, while following a programmed mission path. Because most elas-mobranchs are highly mobile, passive tracking methods are constrained by the size of stationary receiver arrays. Mobile acoustic receiver platforms such as AUVs and ASVs provide the ability to autonomously survey a wider range of habitats and areas beyond stationary arrays, and they can simultane - ously provide measures of environmental conditions and the benthos in the vicinity (\u00b1250 m) where tagged individuals are detected. Because the cost of maintaining large-scale acoustic receiver arrays can be considerable, augmenting area coverage with autonomous mobile acoustic receiver platforms can potentially reduce long-term monitoring costs and provide greater area coverage than expanded stationary receiver arrays. Because of their diving capability, AUVs Figure 6.4 Example of side-scan sonar data illustrating a poten - tial shipwreck site (C.M. Clark, unpublished data).7 USE OF A UTONOMOUS V EHICLES FOR T RACKING AND S URVEYING OF A COUSTICALLY T AGGED ELASMOBRANCHS can provide greater vertical detection capabilities and cover - age, as well as oceanographic measurements of the water column, and they achieve better transmitter detection effi - ciency than Dobarro, Grothues et al., 2010). Autonomous surface vehicles (e.g., wave-driven gliders), however, can provide real-time data via cellular or satel - lite communication, but they are more limited in terms of their water column characterization and detection efficiency due to sea surface conditions and surface shadows (e.g., acoustic dead spots created when the transmitter and hydro - phone are at the surface during rough seascape conditions). Performance of these systems will vary depending on the telemetry system used, habitats and regions surveyed, and duration of deployment. 6.3.1.1 Acoustic Detection Systems Early attempts to integrate telemetry receiver systems into autonomous mobile platforms varied depending on the acoustic telemetry passive tracking system being used in certain areas and on particular species. In addition, dif - ferent acoustic telemetry systems may provide different encoding strategies for ID and sensor data. Different trans-mitter coding schemes have different costs and benefits, often trading off battery life against the number of indi - viduals that can be identified simultaneously. For example, VEMCO coded transmitter systems use a pulse interval coding (PIC) scheme, whereby all transmitters operate at the same frequency, but the code ID is conveyed in a unique pulse train output of varying intervals. This coding scheme only allows a single transmitter to be detected at one time, but it consumes less power than alternative schemes, allow - ing for longer lived transmitters. The Lotek WHS 3000 series uses a code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme that conveys unique ID and sensor information via fre - quency spreading and allows for multiple transmitters to be detected simultaneously (Grothues, 2009). This coding scheme is more power consumptive, resulting in a decrease in the battery life of the transmitters. Typically, coded transmitters have been designed for passive, coarse, spatial-scale tracking or fine-scale tracking using gridded stationary acoustic receiver arrays. Most pas-sive acoustic tracking uses omnidirectional receivers orga-nized in grids and lines (gates) and provides measures of presence/absence within the detection radius of the receiver (Heupel et al., 2006; see also Chapter 8 in this volume). If receiver arrays are organized in a grid formation and close enough that three or more receivers can detect a transmit - ter as it moves through the array, then a trilaterated posi - tion can be obtained by measuring time of arrival to each receiver (Espinoza et al., 2011). These systems include the VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) and Radio-Linked Acoustic Positioning (VRAP) system, Lotek MAP 600 and WHS, and HTI Model 290 + 291 systems, which have been deployed to provide fine-scale movements of fishes, some over larger areas (e.g., up to 10 km2) (Baktoft et al., 2017; Wolfe and Lowe, 2015). Early integration and comparison of telemetry sys- tems on AUVs were trialed and described by et al. (2010), who integrated a Lotek WHS 3050 system onto a REMUS sturgeon (Acipenser ) fitted with CDMA-type transmitters in riverine habitat. They also equipped a REMUS 100 AUV with a VEMCO VR2 receiver Acipenser VEMCO coded transmitters. Several other project-specific missions were run to survey for and position other fish species using similar systems or setups. Although many of these were proof-of-concept tri - als, they helped establish the efficacy of using AUV technol - ogy coupled with acoustic telemetry systems in quantifying fish movements. One of the first published studies using an AUV to sur - vey for acoustically tagged elasmobranchs was done by Haulsee et al. (2015), who integrated two VEMCO VR2C acoustic receivers into a Slocum Glider. The glider was pro - grammed to survey along the Delaware coastline and listen for migrating sand tiger sharks ( Carcharias taurus ) pre - viously implanted with VEMCO V16 coded transmitters. Stationary acoustic receiver gate arrays deployed across the study area provided additional coverage of this migration route. Using detection data from the AUV, questions about habitat selection could be addressed because the AUV was also programmed to measure water depth, temperature, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and chloro - phyll a as it moved through the water column. Because the AUV could provide an estimated position of a tagged shark within \u00b1250 m of the AUV at the time of detection, meso - scale habitat characteristics could be measured at those times and compared with locally available conditions to determine habitat selection. The 19-day mission allowed the AUV to cover 337 km, covering depths from 7 to 22 m (Figure 6.5). Using this methodology, Haulsee et al. (2015) concluded that southward migrating sand tiger sharks are likely selecting habitat features that are influenced by dis-tance from shore (water depth), salinity, and CDOM. There are clearly other environmental and biological factors influ - encing migratory path, but this study demonstrated the effi - cacy of this technology for offshore research. Although none is currently published, studies are under way using Wave Glider platforms to autonomously survey for tagged elasmobranch over larger spatial scales. For example, VEMCO VR2C-equipped Wave Gliders are currently being deployed off central California to survey acoustically tagged adult white sharks while simultaneously gathering oceanographic information along programmed survey paths. Similar missions are being conducted off more 8 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY coastal waters along southern California to survey for acous- tically tagged elasmobranchs and food fishes (M. Cimeno, pers. commun.). Because of the greater endurance of Wave Gliders, fewer navigational hazards, and considerable wave energy found in open ocean habitats, these glider missions can run for months and provide periodic or real-time data. 6.3.1.2 Survey Path Planning As autonomous mobile tracking platform technology becomes more common, developing appropriate surveying methods will be essential for searching for highly mobile or migratory elasmobranchs that have been tagged. For long-endurance gliders (buoyancy-driven or wave-driven), survey paths could be designed for systematic or random surveying across habitats. In Haulsee et al. (2015), the Slocum Glider was programmed to move in a sawtooth pattern surveying across depth and habitat contours; however, it was also mis-sioned to return to an area where a tagged shark had been previously detected. This survey plan was necessary to address their particular question, but it might not be the most effective way to survey a large area. Similar paths are often planned for Wave Glider missions, where these platforms are missioned to survey across depth contours and may yield the best opportunity to encounter and detect migrat - ing elasmobranchs that move along coastal shelves. Other considerations for survey path planning vary depending on knowledge of the species tagged, the platform being used, and degree of boat activity in the areas to be surveyed. For example, buoyancy-driven and wave-driven gliders require a depth of at least 6 m to operate effectively and avoid \"dredg - ing,\" or grounding (Haldeman et al., 2014). In addition, these vehicles are less maneuverable and more likely to be struck by passing vessels operating at high speeds in survey areas. Propeller-driven vehicles can operate in much shallower water (~1 m) and are far more maneuverable if adequately equipped and programmed for obstacle avoidance. 6.3.1.3 Habitats and Species Surveyed Autonomous survey vehicles may not be appropriate for cer - tain habitats, conditions, or species. Navigational hazards, rapidly changing bathymetry, and strong tides found in estu - arine, coastal river, or lagoon habitats would preclude the use of most commercially available buoyancy- and wave-driven gliders for surveying tagged elasmobranchs due to the minimum depth requirements and relatively poor maneuver - ability in restricted habitats. Smaller propeller-driven AUVs (e.g., Iver2 and Iver3, REMUS 100) or ASVs may offer the best options for surveying in these types of habitats; how - ever, they are much more limited in endurance. Nonetheless, surveying in complex shallow habitats still poses consider - able challenges for path planning and successful navigation. Robust obstacle avoidance systems must be implemented to avoid grounding and entanglements with moorings, fishing gear, and kelp/seagrass, as well as negotiating channels with high vessel activity and strong tidal currents. Autonomous vehicle acoustic surveys for tagged elasmobranchs are less problematic for coastal or offshore habitats than inshore waters or embayments due to deeper waters and fewer navi - gational obstructions. There are also opportunities for much longer missions using less power consumptive buoyancy- and wave-driven vehicles. 6.3.2 a ctive t racking e lasmobranchs with a UVs Acoustic detection data from passive stationary acoustic receiver arrays (see Chapter 8 in this volume) and autono - mous mobile acoustic receiver platforms (Section 6.2.1) can be effective in quantifying movements of individuals over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet, these methods often lack sufficient positional accuracy and localization frequency of the same individual to adequately characterize how animals respond to microscale or mesoscale environ - mental conditions. Thus, limited information on their move - ments is obtained for animals that move at scales smaller than the typical passive omnidirectional receiver detection ranges (<500 m). Positioning systems such as VEMCO VRAP or VPS, Lotek MAP 600 or WHS, or HTI 3D track - ing systems can provide high-resolution estimates of loca-tion, but these systems are constrained by the size and location of the stationary arrays of receivers (Hedger et al., 2008; Heupel et al., 2006).

To study aquatic animal movements at higher frequen - cies and finer spatial scales, researchers have traditionally turned to active tracking. This practice consists of a human tracker in a small vessel using a directional hydrophone to estimate the location of an acoustically tagged animal and following it for 24 to 96 hr (Holland et al., 1992). The ampli - tude of the signal received by the hydrophone is a function of the direction of the hydrophone relative to the direction and distance to the transmitter; that is, amplitude increases as this relative angle decreases and proximity increases. By rotating the directional hydrophone, the tracker can deter - mine the direction in which the signal is strongest and thus the direction to the animal. The tracker can then navigate the vessel toward the signal source (transmitter), using the position of the vessel as a proxy for the position of the ani - mal (Bass and Rascovich, 1965; Nelson, 1978). However, to obtain high positional accuracy, the tracker must be posi - tioned directly over top of the transmitter (tagged individ-ual), which can affect the animal's behavior. Active tracking is labor intensive and reliant on the pro - ficiency of the tracker, and it provides variable spatial accu - racies (<50 m) (White et al., 2016). Hence, the development of AUV technology has led many researchers to envision AUVs as replacing humans as active trackers. This idea was first conceptualized over 20 years ago with a kayak outfit - ted with an electric trolling motor and a VEMCO VR60 (Goudey et al., 1998). To replace human trackers, AUVs must be equipped with two key abilities: (1) accurately esti - mate the location of a tagged animal in real time while at a distance, and (2) incorporate this location state estimate into the AUV's control system and thus realize autono - mous tracking and following of the animal, which includes attempting to relocate a transmitter signal temporally lost. 6.3.2.1 Acoustic Positioning System The acoustic positioning system is the hardware (hydro - phone/receiver) and software combination required to pro - vide an estimate of the location of an acoustic transmitter with respect to a georeferenced Cartesian coordinate system (e.g., x, y, z space). A location can be determined when two or more hydrophone/receiver systems are able to derive a distance and bearing to a transmitter, with the tag transmit - ting information on its depth ( z-dimension). This informa- tion, when combined with the current position and heading of the AUV, allows for an estimate of the geolocation of the transmitter. Acoustic position systems rely on the fact that sound travels at predictable speeds based on the water den - sity (e.g., temperature and salinity). Thus, accurate measure - ments of time (microsecond), water density, and temperature allow for precise estimates of location of a transmitter. Two main strategies have been used for acoustic position systems for the active tracking of animals: short baseline (SBL) and ultrashort baseline (USBL). Short baseline systems can derive a distance and bear - ing estimate if at least two hydrophones are fix-mounted at least 2 m apart (Clark et al., 2013; Forney et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013). When both hydrophones detect a tag transmis-sion, the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the hydrophones is converted to an angle measurement. The TDOA is multiplied by the speed of sound in water, given current environmental conditions, to form one side of a tri - angle, and the distance between the hydrophones represents the hypotenuse of the triangle. By taking the arc-cosine of the difference in time of arrival over the distance between the hydrophones, the bearing to the transmitter is calculated. When using transmitters that transmit at fixed intervals, this system can be expanded to incorporate a range measurement by estimating the time of flight (how long it would take the acoustic signal to travel a particular distance through water of known density) (Lin et al., 2013). The AUV can keep track of the estimated time the transmitter should transmit, then, by subtracting the time when the AUV detected the transmission, the time of flight (TOF) can be estimated. The time of flight is multiplied by the speed of sound in seawater based on water density at that location to produce a range measurement. The transmitted depth, estimated bearing, and range can be used to estimate a position of a moving transmitter while the AUV is moving. For such two-hydrophone configurations, there is a sign ambiguity, and the AUV cannot determine if the tag is on its left or right side from a single detection (Figure 6.6); however, the AUV can be programmed to move in a circular or sigmoi - dal path until several detections are made, which enables the AUV to differentiate a sign (or side) the transmitter is on rela-tive to its path. To further refine accuracy and sign of position estimates using this TOA and TOF approach, a particle filter state estimation algorithm can be applied, which over several successive detections can improve positional accuracy to \u00b13 XXsharkX\u00b4shark XAUVh1 h2AUV - Y Figure 6.6 Schematic of how a SBL-enabled AUV determines location of a tagged shark.

Field Robot. , 30(3), 309-322, 2013.)10 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY m while both transmitter and AUV are moving simultane - ously (Clark et al., 2013; Forney et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; Xydes et al., 2013) (Figure 6.7). The second type of acoustic positioning system used onboard an AUV for active tracking is the ultrashort base - line system (USBL) (Kukulya et al., 2015, 2016; Packard et al., 2013). In this system, the AUV is equipped with a trans-ceiver with a small array of omnidirectional hydrophones, and the animal is tagged with a transponder that can also transmit depth information. The transceiver onboard the AUV sends an acoustic transmission that is received by the animal-borne transponder, which then sends a reply that is received by the AUV. By measuring the time between when the AUV queried the animal's transponder and when it received the transmission in response, the total time of flight to the animal and back to the AUV is calculated. By dividing this by two and multiplying by the speed of sound, a range estimate can be calculated. The AUV is additionally able to compare the received signal phase difference across the multiple hydrophones within the transceiver to generate a bearing estimate.

(From Forney, C. et al., in Proceedings\u2014IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation , Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Piscataway, NJ, 2012, pp. 5315-5321.)11 USE OF A UTONOMOUS V EHICLES FOR T RACKING AND S URVEYING OF A COUSTICALLY T AGGED ELASMOBRANCHS require two-way acoustic communication, the transponder tags are large and subsequently powerful, and they also have significantly better range and bearing estimates than the SBL system, which is limited by the accuracy of time recording across the hydrophones as well as the consistency of tag transmissions over time (Kukulya et al., 2015; White et al., 2016). However, USBL system transponder tags are significantly larger (7.6 \u00d7 38 cm) and more expensive and power consumptive, thus limiting their application to large sharks (>3 m) capable of carrying larger tag packages. The SBL system, however, was designed to use existing ani - mal acoustic telemetry infrastructure and standard acous-tic transmitters from other acoustic biotelemetry systems (i.e., VEMCO, Lotek, Sonotronics), and it allows for much smaller individuals to be tagged (White et al., 2016). 6.3.2.2 AUV Control System For fully autonomous active tracking, estimating the loca- tion of the tagged animal resolves only half of the problem. The AUV must also incorporate the tagged animal's posi - tion estimate into the AUV's control system to enable auton - omous following of the animal. The AUV control system can be programmed to incorporate a variety of abilities nec-essary to track a moving animal, which may stop moving, move in a very small discrete space, or travel in nonlinear paths. So, the AUV must be programmed to adapt its move - ment path to that of the tagged animal while simultaneously avoiding static obstacles, such as docks and pinnacles, and avoiding grounding or colliding with the shoreline or sea-floor. In addition, the AUV must be programmed to deter - mine position from a suitable distance to reduce behavioral interference with the tagged individual but be close enough to maintain continuous detection range (Clark et al., 2013; Forney et al., 2012; White et al., 2016). The simplest control system might be to just have the AUV drive directly toward the position of the shark. Packard et al. (2013) programmed a REMUS AUV with a USBL sys-tem to film sharks under water, which required the AUVs to be very close to the tagged animal (<10 m). The shark's path was interpolated 15 sec into the future, and the AUV was pro - grammed to drive directly at that point and pass to the left, right, above, or below the tagged shark (Figure 6.8). After the AUV passed the shark, it was programmed to turn around and perform this \"fly by\" again. By repeatedly updating the shark's location relative to the AUV, the AUV could continu - ously update its path to a new location. This control system was refined by Kukulya et al. (2015), who modulated the speed of the AUV proportional to the distance between the AUV and the shark, so that the AUV would travel faster when it was farther away from the tagged individual and match the animal's speed when it was close to the tagged animal. Such a control system, however, could cause the AUV to influence the tagged animal's behavior by being too close or even colliding with the tagged animal. Because AUVs use propeller-driven propulsion, the vehicles produce low-frequency sounds detectable to the sharks. Sharks have been found to approach or even attack AUVs, following them or staying in close proximity (Skomal et al., 2015; Stanway et al., 2015). A second approach is to have the AUV position itself close enough to the tagged animal to continuously receive acoustic detections but remain far enough away to reduce the likelihood of behavioral interference (>30 m). In this programmed control feature, documented by Lin et al. (2013), an AUV had two different behaviors, depending on the distance to the tagged animal. When the AUV was within detection range, but farther away from the animal, the AUV was programmed to drive directly at the tagged animal. When the AUV was within a user-defined thresh-old distance of the animal, it switched to nearby circling behavior, such that the AUV circled at a point just outside of the user-defined minimum threshold distance to the tagged animal. Circling allows the AUV to constantly propel itself, which is necessary for stability and to increase the quantity of sensor vantage points, determine bearing and distance to the transmitter, and prevent it from colliding into the tagged animal (Figure 6.9). In addition, if the shark moves toward the AUV and comes within the user-defined minimum threshold distance, the AUV is programmed to move away from the tagged shark. By switching back and forth between point tracking and nearby circle tracking, the AUV can 41.83Shark and vehicle - 27 July estimated position of a tagged white shark (red asterisk) off Cape Cod using the USBL-enabled system on a REMUS AUV and the path of the AUV (blue line). When frequent detections were obtained, the AUV could accurately predict the shark's path to increase the likelihood of the AUV being close enough to capture video data.

Using this system, the path of the AUV does not closely reflect the path of the tagged individual. It is also worth mentioning that quantifying shark behavior response to AUVs vs. active tracking surface vessels may be useful for determining minimum threshold distances for AUV tracking. In addition, control systems for active tracking have been modified and adapted to use multiple AUVs for track - ing a tagged shark (Kukulya et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2014, 2017). Having both AUVs simultaneously tracking while in communication with each other allows for incorporation of range and bearing measurements from multiple angles, thereby providing further refined position estimates and reducing the likelihood of losing the animal. These systems are programmed to have one leader and could be expanded to incorporate multiple followers. Future swarm program - ming of smaller, single-hydrophone AUVs could allow for trilateration (position estimates) of multiple cooperative AUVs surrounding a tagged individual, as long as the AUVs were far enough away from the tagged individual to mini - mize behavioral disturbance. 6.3.2.3 Environmental and Situational Monitoring. Traditional uses of AUVs have been in sampling oceano - graphic conditions. Enabling these duties can provide environmental context for the focal animal being tracked. Most commercially available AUVs can be equipped with a wide variety of sensors (e.g., temperature, salinity, DO2, CDOM, pH, photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], side-scan sonar, image sonar) that can simultaneously sample the environment during tracks within a geospatial context. Measuring these conditions during a track can provide unprecedented resolution of the environment surrounding the animal. This fine-scale environmental information can provide context and insight as to how tracked individuals respond to changing conditions and use gradients as navi - gational cues. Environmental sensors can provide valuable information on how tagged individuals respond to changing environ - mental conditions, but video and sonar imaging can provide insight into how tagged individuals respond when they are in close proximity to other conspecifics, predators, and prey. By outfitting the AUVs with downward- and forward-facing video cameras, or even virtual reality (360\u00b0 view) video cameras (Figure 6.10), spatially explicit prey and conspe - cific abundance can be estimated and correlated to chang - ing movement behaviors observed from tracked individuals. Traditional active and passive tracking methods often lack these abilities or require separate teams of researchers to simultaneously collect these data using typical sensor suites, such as sondes; conductivity, temperature and depth record-ers (CTDs); or video camera sleds. Although it is a valu - able activity, collecting video data is power consumptive and data intensive and often results in a data processing bottle - neck, requiring considerable labor-intensive postprocessing. In addition, underwater video data can be hampered by poor visibility or low light conditions (e.g., nighttime periods), and coastal habitats (e.g., lagoons, bays, estuaries) can often have poor visibility conditions, further limiting the use of video in those ecosystems. Sonar technology has greatly improved and reduced in size and can now provide low-resolution video image qual - ity at distances of less than 50 m (e.g., DIDSON, BlueView). AUVs can be equipped with forward- and downward-facing image sonar, which is capable of recording and identifying unique targets based on their densities and reflective acous-tic properties. These systems can operate in poor visibility and zero light conditions, in addition to providing estimates of distances between objects and the AUV and the size of the targets. Digital target recognition and autonomous track - ing of sonar-identified objects has allowed short-term track - ing of untagged sharks and schools of fishes (McCauley et al., 2016) and holds great promise for augmenting video for identifying conspecifics and prey items surrounding the tagged animal. However, sonar is much more power con - sumptive in comparison to video, so its application and dura-tion of use would have to be more conservatively applied in comparison to video.

Future AUV control algorithms can incorporate where the AUV has previously sampled and direct the AUV to alternative locations around the moving animals for a more comprehen - sive characterization of environmental conditions available to the focal animal. This would maximize environmental information gain and provide a more holistic picture of the behavior of the animal. 6.3.2.4 Habitats and Species Tracked Most of the studies published to date using autonomous active tracking systems have been largely methodological and have focused on the development of the technology and its efficacy. These tracks have taken place on a range of species, including non-obligate ram ventilating species such as leopard sharks ( Triakis semifasciata ) and obligate ram and basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus ), in shallow coastal areas as well as deeper habitats. Using a modified Iver2 AUV, Clarke et al. (2013) developed an SBL system (Lotek MAP 600) designed for tracking leopard sharks in southern California. Leopard sharks, which are known to aggregate in shallow habitats for thermoregulatory benefits (Hight and Lowe, 2007; Nosal et al., 2014) and exhibit restricted space use during the day, were tracked in embayments ranging from inter - tidal to 25 m in depth. Tagged leopard sharks were simul - taneously actively tracked by a human in a surface vessel and by an SBL-equipped AUV for comparison of positional accuracy and frequency of data acquisition. Comparative tracks (AUV and a human active tracker) indicated that this autonomous system provided similar or better spatial accuracy than a human active tracker, yet provided signifi - cantly more accurate locations than a human (White et al., 2016) (Figure 6.11).

Ecol. , 485, 112-118, 2016.)14 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY Individual tracks have lasted longer than 4 hr, and either single or a pair of cooperative AUVs were tested and com - pared for their accuracy and ability to maintain contact with a tagged leopard shark. These high-resolution spatiotempo - ral movement data overlaid on high-resolution temperature maps showed leopard sharks spending most of their time in a small temperature range (Bernal and Lowe, 2016). Yet, because the leopard sharks were in shallow (<2 m), rocky, and often narrow habitats, the AUVs would occasionally have to position themselves at a distance (>100 m) from the tagged animal, so detection efficiency and subsequently positional accuracy suffered. A REMUS 100 outfitted with a USBL system has been used to track basking sharks and white sharks off Cape Cod, Massachusetts (Packard et al., 2013). This study was largely methodological, but the authors were able to show that the tracked white sharks remained closely associated to the ben - thos while swimming outside seal colonies. Because white sharks were using shallow habitats close to shore, the AUV had difficulties tracking tagged individuals due to periodic loss of transponder detection. White sharks have addition - ally been tracked off Guadalupe Island, Mexico (Kukulya et al., 2015). Six video cameras mounted to the AUV (forward and reverse) were used to document shark behavior, such as attack events on the AUV (Figure 6.12), as well as shark depth and association with conspecifics (Skomal et al., 2015). White sharks globally are thought to mainly capture prey near the surface by ambushing them, yet the location and the frequency at which these tracking AUVs were attacked by white sharks lead to suggestions that sharks at Guadalupe might be capturing prey at depth (Skomal et al., 2015). Deeper coastal water around Guadalupe Island allowed the AUVs to encounter few obstacles with less ambient noise, so AUVs were more successful in tracking tagged sharks; how - ever, sharks were able to dive deeper than the depth rating of the AUVs (>100 m). The researchers had a second track - ing AUV (REMUS 600) that was capable of diving deeper; however, deploying the AUV in a timely manner before the shark was lost was problematic, as well. 6.4 eXpeCtatIONS a ND D ata Like most emerging technologies, autonomous tracking sys-tems have the capability of generating considerably larger and more complex datasets than conventional active and passive tracking due to their ability to gather environmen - tal data while tracking; therefore, there may be considerable need for data postprocessing, synthesis, and error check - ing. Because these data are spatially explicit and often three dimensional, more sophisticated data visualization methods are needed (Martin et al., 2006; Viswanathan et al., 2017). Not only are these accompanying tools necessary for data visualization and display, but they also will be integral in development of new analytical methods for identifying and quantifying behavioral patterns and changes in behavioral state with changing social and environmental conditions. 6.4.1 Post Hoc analysis of a UV t racks and Movement p redictions As demonstrated by Haulsee et al. (2015), using autonomous vehicles to survey for tagged sharks can greatly enhance passive tracking arrays by providing greater area coverage 0 20 4030 25 2015 Temperature (\u00b0C) 10 560(A) (B) (hours)1100 1200 1230 Figure 6.12 The top figure shows the depth of the AUV (green line), and the depth of the shark (black line) recorded onboard a REMUS 100 using an ultra-short base line (USBL) acoustic receiver system. During this span, the shark approached the AUV several times, ultimately biting the AUV twice, while the multiple cameras video recorded the approaches and bites. (From Skomal, G. et al., J. Fish Biol. , 87(6), 1293-1312, 2015.)15 USE OF A UTONOMOUS V FOR T RACKING AND S URVEYING OF A COUSTICALLY T AGGED ELASMOBRANCHS and simultaneous measurements of environmental con - ditions. These datasets are quite different from those of conventional stationary acoustic receiver arrays but when analyzed together can provide a much richer understand-ing of movement and habitat selection than can often be inferred from passive tracking alone. For example, with sufficient sampling and adequate environmental monitor - ing, habitat suitability models can be developed and used to predict changes in distributions, migrations, and migration routes. Furthermore, these migration routes can potentially be determined from these types of datasets (White, 2016). One advantage of autonomous vehicle platform active tracking of elasmobranchs is that these systems can pro - vide comparable positional accuracy as human-based active tracking, but at a much higher frequency and while main - taining a distance away from the tagged shark. Using these telemetry systems also provides error measures for each position that can be appropriately filtered to provide more accurate information for assessing habitat association, rate of movement, and fine-scale behaviors. In addition to obtaining high-resolution position data from autonomous tracking platforms, the ability to overlay these movements over high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) environmental data (often interpolated from stationary sensors) provides the opportunity to quantify habitat selec-tion and potentially preference. This can allow for develop - ment of 3D habitat suitability models, which can be used to make predictions of under what conditions individuals should initiate seasonal migrations, select new habitats, and shift distributions under changing climate and rising ocean temperatures. Coupling these high-resolution movement data with spatially explicit baited remote underwater video (BRUV; see Chapter 7 in this volume) and autonomous cam - era and image sonar surveys provides the ability to quanti - tatively evaluate influences such as prey density, intra- and interspecific competition, and presence of mates to predict degree of site fidelity and cues influencing potential emigra-tion. Of course, the utility of autonomous tracking vehicles is still valuable but more limited without corresponding environmental and biological data. 6.4.2 technical Limitations While autonomous vehicle and telemetry technology has advanced considerably over the last 20 years, there are still numerous technical limitations that must be considered before attempting to utilize these tools. Although smaller and less expensive AUVs are commercially available, they are still quite expensive (base models are equivalent to the cost of a new, fully equipped 8-m research vessel), not including the cost of the telemetry system. ASVs are cur - rently the least expensive option for full autonomous track - ing platforms, but these systems are limited by battery life, power, and speed. Battery life poses a distinct challenge for either surveying or active tracking. Most smaller class AUVs (e.g., Iver2, Iver3, REMUS 100) have a depth range of only 100 m and have approximately 12 hr of battery life under low cruising speeds and with conservative use of power-consumptive sensors. Larger, more expensive AUVs (e.g., REMUS 600) can operate at deeper depths (600 m) and offer considerably longer battery life; they are capable of operating at low cruising speeds for up to 24 hr. However, these larger vehicles are heavy, making deployment and retrieval more difficult and requiring larger vessels to sup - port. Continuous multiple-day tracks would require at least two AUVs that could be swapped out during a track while the other is being recharged. This reduces the advantages of autonomy and may only be feasible in protected embayments or for coastal applications. Wave- and buoyancy-driven vehicles have reduced power requirements and therefore can be used for longer deployments, but they may also suffer from shorter battery life if power-consumptive sensors are not used conservatively. Another technical limitation of AUVs for tracking highly mobile elasmobranchs may be maximum operating speed of the platforms relative to the detection range of the transmitters being applied. Most AUVs have a maximum operating speed of 4.5 knots (2.3 m/sec) and may not be able to stay within the detection range of faster swimming species such as shortfin mako shark ( Carcharhinus ). Even though these highly mobile species of elasmobranchs can - not maintain these speeds for long periods of time, they may be able to lose the AUV by rapidly moving outside the AUV's detection range. In addition, much like while active tracking, acoustic receiver performance decreases with increased speed due to cavitation around the hydro - phone. This makes it more difficult for the AUV to main - tain contact with the tagged shark while it is traveling at higher speeds. This may also be problematic when track - ing smaller elasmobranchs which requires smaller acoustic transmitters that inherently have lower power output and shorter battery lives. Another major technical limitation required for full autonomous tracking or surveying is the ability to avoid stationary obstacles such as shore lines, seafloors, docks, and reef markers\u2014features for which there are discrete geospatial references. All AUVs have the capabilities to be programmed to remain within coordinate boundaries or to move around a coordinate position; however, their ability to make these movements correctly is based on the accu - racy of the geoposition estimates of these features and the AUV's accuracy of its position while moving. The altim - eter can help prevent the AUV from running aground, but steep vertical walls can pose navigation challenges; the situation is further complicated because the AUV's ability to estimate its geolocation is reduced the longer it remains underwater. Therefore, operating in complex and enclosed spaces can be challenging for even the most maneuverable AUVs. Moving and small-profile obstacles such as boats, 16 SHARK RESEARCH: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIELD AND LABORATORY moorings, kelp, and people in the water pose additional challenges for avoidance, as their geopositions are dynamic. To address these challenges, forward-facing sonar or video systems can be used and programmed to enable the AUV to avoid moving and potentially entangling obstacles; how - ever, these systems are power consumptive, which may further reduce tracking duration. Despite these limitations, engineers and programmers are developing new sensors and detection algorithms to improve obstacle avoidance, improve battery technology, develop in-water recharging stations, and control planning for AUVs. 6.4.3 p otential a UV System Configuration and p lanning a bilities The use of AUVs for tracking marine animals is not limited to a single AUV tracking a single animal. Recent research has demonstrated the advantages of using multiple AUVs to track an animal (e.g., Clark et al., 2013; Kukulya et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2013, 2017; Shinzaki et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). The combined sensor footprint is increased, and there is an increase in sensor vantage points, which reduces positional errors. There is also the possibility of tracking multiple animals simultaneously. If acoustic CDMA-type transmitters are used (e.g., share the same time slot with a time division multiple access protocol), then even a sin - gle AUV can detect and track multiple tagged individuals simultaneously as long as they all remained in the same area. To accomplish this, more sophisticated AUV path planning algorithms may be required that direct vehicles to optimal locations, such as the locations that when visited yield the highest likelihood of the AUV being in range of and detecting all animals. With such applications in mind, algorithms for the autonomous vehicle tracking of multiple targets has been an active area of research that is providing the AUV community with several starting points for such future work. 6.4.4 Future Sensor Integration and autonomy Capabilities Autonomous vehicle technology (AUV and ASV) has the potential to completely change the way marine life is sur - veyed and tracked. Work in the last decade has provided sev - eral examples of successful tracking experiments, and the technology has matured to the point where it can be used for systematic tracking deployments. Image sonar offers potentially one of the greatest additions to sensor integra-tion for AUV operations and enhanced tracking capabilities. Forward-facing image sonar could be used not only for AUV obstacle avoidance but also for visualizing the tagged sharks and its associated surroundings. This technology can also be used to measure the size of tagged sharks and any other associated individuals within the sonar window.Moving from SBL to USBL hydrophone arrays not only improves position estimates but also significantly reduces drag and the power consumption of tracking AUVs and increases the mobility and utility of ASVs. The USBL hydrophone arrays can also be used to detect one-way PIC-type transmitters, which will allow for a greater selec-tion of telemetry systems for integration into autonomous tracking platforms and tracking of much smaller transmit - ters (Rypkema et al., 2017). AUVs could be equipped with transponder technology and programmed to search out elas-mobranchs instrumented with archival transponding tags. Once located, the AUV would be programmed to follow the tagged shark until all the archived data from the shark's transponding tag has been downloaded to the AUV. Because transponding tags are quite large, this technology might only be feasible for larger elasmobranchs in the near future. The future of this technology will provide greater posi - tioning accuracy, increased temporal resolution, reduced labor intensity, and simultaneous sampling of the envi - ronment, as well as access to new datasets that were pre - viously unachievable. Automatic identification of habitat type, quantification of aggregation sizes and densities, and intelligent inference of near-future animal behavior are pos-sible, but these are only a subset of the new capabilities that will provide marine biologists with new data and hence new findings. 6.5 SUMM arY aND CONCLUSIONS While historically, autonomous vehicle technology was used and developed for remote open ocean exploration, the need for coastal autonomous oceanographic monitoring has increased, which has driven the development of a range of autonomous vehicle platforms (AUV and ASV) that are smaller, more maneuverable, and more affordable. In addi - tion, acoustic telemetry companies have begun to recognize the growing market for autonomous vehicles and need for adapting their technology for application on these robotic platforms. The expectation is that the development and use of autonomous tracking platform will expand greatly in the next decade and will require biologists to work more closely with oceanographers, computer scientists, and engineers in order to produce the systems and tools necessary to address more complex questions about the behavior and ecology of elasmobranchs. In addition, there is a growing need for higher resolution positioning and simultaneous environmen - tal monitoring in order to quantify habitat use, migration cues, migration pathways, and drivers of movement strate - gies of elasmobranch fishes. The continued development of these tools will help address questions regarding habitat recolonization of recovering populations; the effects of cli - mate change on distributions, migrations, and habitat selec-tion; and the evaluation of essential habitat for highly mobile shark and ray species.17 USE OF A UTONOMOUS V EHICLES FOR T RACKING AND S COUSTICALLY T AGGED ELASMOBRANCHS aCKNOWL eDGM eNtS Special thanks go to all the students of the CSULB Shark Lab for helping with AUV field trials and to students of the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and Harvey Mudd College LAIR labs for their innovation and determination in making autonomous shark tracking a reality.
