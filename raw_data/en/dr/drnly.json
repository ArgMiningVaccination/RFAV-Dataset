Email: bcschipper@ucdavis.edu1 Introduction Decisions in the face of risk and uncertainty have been at least as pervasive in the past of human mankind as they are in present. While today a decision maker's economic success or overall success in life is a ected by her risk preferences, it is conceivable that in the past also reproductive success was in uenced by risk preferences. Thus, evolutionary selection has probably acted on traits that a ect how a decision maker takes decisions under risk and uncertainty (see Robson 1996, Dekel and Scotchmer 1999, and Hamo and Heifetz, 2002, for theoretical models). These traits should have biological markers. In this paper we study rather comprehensively to what extent some biological factors like hormones are associated with risk preferences. Hormones are chemical messengers that transport signals from one cell to another. Finding hormones that are associated with risk preferences allows us to learn about the biological mechanisms involved in decision making under risk. The empirical literature on risk preferences studied the association with gender, one biological factor relevant to hormones. In summarizing the sizeable literature, Croson and Gneezy (2009, p. 2) write that \\(t)he robust nding is that men are more risk-prone than are women.\" Similarly, Eckel and Grossman (2008) state that \\in most studies, women are found to be more averse to risk than men. Studies with contextual frames show less consistent results\".1A more recent review by Filippin and Crosetto (2014) strikes a more cautionary note in concluding that \\gender di erences are less ubiquitous than usually depicted.\" From an evolutionary point of view, gender di erences in risk preferences would not be too surprising because males and females play di erent roles in human reproduction. Males and females di er also in circulating levels of various sex hormones like testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone. Thus, gender di erences in risk preferences suggest that risk preferences may also vary by sex hormones. In this paper, we study the association of risk preferences for both gains and losses with salivary testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. Testosterone is a steroid hormone that has anabolic e ects such as stimulating the bone density and muscle mass as well as androgenic e ects such as the maturation of sex organs and secondary sex characteristics especially in males. Since it is observed in most vertebrates, it must have had a long evolutionary history (Mechoulam et al., 1984). In humans, testosterone is associated with aggression (e.g. Archer, 1991, Dabbs and Hargrove, 1997) and dominance (e.g. Mazur and Booth, 1998, Mehta and Josephs, 2006) especially in males. More importantly for our study, testosterone has been previously associated with risk preferences. Apicella et al. (2008) nd a signi cant negative correlation between basal salivary testosterone and risk aversion in choice under risk for males. Sapienza et al. (2009) nd an insigni cant weak negative association between salivary testosterone and risk aversion in males but a signi cant negative relationship in females. Stanton et al. (2011a) nd a negative 1See also Byrnes, Miller, and Schafer (1999) for any earlier review of the literature. 2association for both genders in a gambling task that had not been incentivized. Stanton et al. (2011b) report a u-shaped relationship between risk attitudes and salivary testosterone in both genders, where individuals with high or low testosterone are approximately risk neutral and individuals with intermediate levels of testosterone are risk averse. Using a placebo-controlled experiment and a sample of 200 postmenopausal women, Zethraeus et al. (2009) did not nd a signi cant association between randomly administered testosterone or estrogen and risk-taking. In our current study, we replicate the nding by Apicella et al. (2008) with a di erent lottery experiment. That is, we show that in males testosterone is signi cantly positively associated with risk taking in males in Holt-Laury lottery tasks in the gain domain. We show a null result for the loss domain, which is new. Moreover, we observe null results for females both in the gain and loss domains. We measure risk preferences using a lottery task due to Holt and Laury (2002), which consists of presenting each subject of our experiment with a list of pairs of lotteries. The subject has to make choices between the lotteries for each pair of lotteries in the list (see Section 2.1). The probability of outcomes varies systematically across the list of lottery pairs. While this design has been originally applied to lotteries involving monetary gains only, Laury and Holt (2008) extend it also to lotteries involving monetary losses. This allows for studying postulates of prospect theory (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, and Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) such as the re ection e ect, i.e., risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses.2 While salivary testosterone has been previously studied, we also include salivary estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol in our study. We are not aware of any other study that analyzes the association of risk preferences with these hormones. Estradiol is also a steroid hormone that has anabolic e ects on the bone structure and androgenic e ects on the maturation of female sex organs and secondary sex characteristics. Progesterone is a steroid hormone as well. It is secreted in the ovaries, especially the corpus luteum, the adrenal glands, and during pregnancy in the placenta. There is evidence that increases in progesterone are positively associated with women's avoidance of \\social risks\" such as infections as re ected in behavior in public bathrooms (Fleischman and Fessler, 2011), increased attention to social stimuli (Maner and Miller, 2014) as well as non-conscious needs to have close, friendly relationships with others (Schultheiss, Wirth, and Stanton, 2004, Wirth and Schultheiss, 2006, Brown et al., 2009). In a companion study, Schipper (2014) nds that progesterone is signi cantly positively associated with bidding of females in rst-price auctions, which in theory is consistent with a positive association of progesterone with risk aversion. Finally, we include the steroid hormone cortisol. Cortisol is correlated with stress (Dickerson and Kemeny, Wuest, and Kudielka, 2009) and thus we nd it intuitive that it may be correlated with risk preferences as well. Besides the testosterone result for males discussed above, we observe null results for all hormones by gender 2See Harrison and Ruthstr\u007f om (2008) for a survey on experiments on risk preferences. 3except for cortisol. Cortisol is signi cantly positively associated with risk aversion for gains in females only. Some sex hormones like progesterone and estradiol vary over the menstrual cycle. Estradiol peaks during the midcycle and again in the second half of the cycle. Progesterone rises after ovulation. There is some mixed evidence of the association of bidding behavior in rst-price auctions with menstrual cycle phases. Recall that in the theory of rst-price auctions, bids are positively associated with risk aversion. Pearson and Schipper (2013) show that in rst-price auctions women bid similarly to men during ovulation but signi cantly higher in other phases of their menstrual cycle. Chen, Katu\u0014 s\u0014 c\u0013 ak, and Ozdenoren (2013) report that women bid higher than men in all phases of their menstrual cycle in a symmetric independent private value rst-price auction but not in a second-price auction. In our study, we also elicited menstrual cycle information from female subjects and observe no association of risk preferences for gains and losses with menstrual cycle phases. This is consistent with a very recent unpublished study by Drichoutis and Nayga (2013) who also do not nd an association of risk preferences with menstrual cycle phases. Some females in our sample use hormonal contraceptives. All hormonal contraceptives contain a progestin, a synthetic version of progesterone. We are not aware of studies on how hormonal contraceptives could a ect behavior except Pearson and Schipper (2013) and Schipper (2014) who show that the use of hormonal contraceptives is positively associated with bidding in rst-price auctions. This could be due to the hormonal contraceptives or to a selection e ect. In our study we report that females who use hormonal contraceptives do not have risk preferences di erent from naturally cycling females. Yet, risk preferences of females on hormonal contraceptives appear to be more \\consistent\" than risk preferences of naturally cycling females. Behavior may not just be a ected by circulating hormones levels but also by prenatal exposure to certain hormones. We are interested in what sense risk preferences may be in uenced by biological events before birth. We use as a putative biological marker the ratio between the length of the 2nd (index) nger and the 4th (ring) nger of the subjects' right hand (so called \\digit ratio\" or 2D:4D). (See Manning, 2002, for an introduction.) The digit ratio is thought to be positively correlated with prenatal exposure to estrogen and negatively correlated to prenatal exposure to testosterone (Manning et al., 1998, Lutchmaya et al., 2004, H\u007f onekopp et al., 2007). On average, men have lower 2D:4D than women. 2D:4D is to a large extent genetically determined (Paul et al., 2006), but it may also be a ected by the environment in utero . In any case, 2D:4D is determined before birth and thus before common economic, social, and cultural factors could shape risk preferences of the individual directly. Dreber and Ho man (2007) and Garbarino et al. (2011) show that risk-taking in investment tasks are signi cantly negatively correlated with 2D:4D in white subjects but Apicella et al. (2008) show that this is not the case in a racially more mixed male sample. Sapienza et al. (2009) do not nd a signi cant correlation 4between risk aversion and 2D:4D in a lottery task except for a marginal signi cant positive correlation for females in a sample of 550 MBA students. In a recent study, Drichoutis and Nayga (2013) observe no signi cant correlation between 2D:4D and lottery choices in a sample of 138 subjects. Using a questionnaire on various domains of risk, Stenstrom et al. (2011) nd a marginally signi cant negative correlation between nancial risk-taking and digit ratio in males but only null results for recreational, social, ethical, or health risks or females. Bra~ nas Garza and Rustichini (2011) study the correlation between 2D:4D, risk aversion, and abstract reasoning ability. They employ two measures of risk aversion in a sample of 188 Caucasian subjects. One of measures is derived from choices in a Holt-Laury lottery task. For this measure they report a signi cant but negative correlation between the digit ratio and risk aversion for females (for the other measure it is insigni cant). For males they report a nonsigni cant positive correlation between risk aversion and the digit ratio (for the other measure it is signi cant). Roney and van Hippel (2010) report that males with lower 2D:4D show greater risk-taking when primed with low power motivation and lower risk-taking when primed with high power motivation. Ho man, Jordan, and Yoeli (2013) present a meta study of the literature (that includes the present study). Overall they report a signi cant negative correlation between risk-taking and 2D:4D. With respect to this literature on the digit ratio and risk aversion, we essentially replicate the null results by Apicella et al. (2008) with a di erent task for choice under risk. But we also show that the null result extends to females and to choice under risk in the loss domain. Finally, we also study plain gender e ects on risk preferences in gains and losses. Surprisingly, there is no gender e ect on risk preferences for gains in our sample. Yet, in the loss domain females are signi cantly more risk averse than males. Moreover, females appear to have less \\consistent\" risk preferences than males. The paper is organized as follows: The next section introduces the experimental design and hypotheses. The results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes with a discussion. Further details on the methodology and instructions for subjects are relegated to an appendix. 2 Experimental Design 2.1 Holt-Laury Lottery Tasks We study choice under risk using lottery tasks introduced by Holt and Laury (2002) for the gain domain and by Laury and Holt (2008) for the loss domain. Each lottery task consists of a menu of 10 decisions between pairs of lotteries. Table 1 shows the lottery choices for the gain domain. The rst column numbers the decisions. The second and third columns present the pairs of lotteries, named \\option A\" and \\option B\", respectively. For each of the 10 choices, each subject had to decide between option A and B, and mark her choice in the fourth column. The 5 fth and last column is not shown to subjects in the experiment but printed here for convenience of the reader. It shows for each decision the di erence between expected payo s of options A and B. Table 1: Holt-Laury Lottery Task for the Gain Domain Decision Option Option Your Exp. Payo A - No. A B Choice Exp. Payo B (not shown) 1 $3.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 $3.00 2 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 $2.33 $3.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 3 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $1.66 $3.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 4 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $0.99 $3.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 5 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $0.32 $3.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 6 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 5 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 5 -$0.35 $3.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 7 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 6 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 6 -$1.02 $3.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 8 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 7 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 7 -$1.69 $3.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 9 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 8 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 8 -$2.36 $3.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 10 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 9 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 9 -$3.03 $3.20 if throw of die is 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 10 In Decision No. 1, the choice is between a gain of $3.20 (option A) and a gain of $0.20 6(option B). A subject respecting dominance should chose option A. Observe that the two payo s in lotteries under option A have roughly the same magnitude. Thus, lotteries under option A are relatively \\safe\". The lower the decision in Table 1, the higher becomes the probability for the best outcome $4.00 for option A and $7.70 for option B. The optimal choice of a risk neutral individual is to choose option A for the rst ve decisions and then switch to option B for decisions 6 to 10 as the expected value is higher for A than B in the rst ve decisions, while the expected value for B is higher than A for decisions 6 to 10 (see last column). A su\u000eciently risk averse individual tends to switch to option B after Decision No. 6, while a su\u000eciently risk seeking individual switches to option B before Decision No. 6. The lottery task for the loss domain is analogous to Table 1 except that gains are replaced with corresponding losses (see Appendix D) and thus the signs of di erences in expected payo s of the last column are reversed. A risk neutral individual will start out in Decision No. 1 with option B and switch to option A from Decision No. 6 onward. A su\u000eciently risk averse individual will switch to option A after choosing option B for less than the rst ve decisions, while a su\u000eciently risk seeking individual will switch to option A after Decision No. 6. In both, the gain and loss domains, risk neutrality implies choosing option A ve times, su\u000ecient risk aversion implies choosing option A more than ve times, while su\u000ecient risk seeking implies choosing option A less than ve times. Thus as a matter of terminology, we say that an individual is risk averse if she chooses option A more than ve time, risk neutral if she chooses option A exactly ve times, and risk seeking if she chooses option A less than ve times. We say that a group X of subjects is more risk averse (resp. more risk seeking) than a group Y if on average it chooses option A more often (resp. less often) than group Y. It is possible to t for each domain the corresponding interval of risk parameters for popular utility functions such as constant relative risk aversion (see Holt and Laury, 2002, Laury and Holt, 2008, Harrison and Ruthstr\u007f om, 2008). But we believe that for this correlation study it would add nothing beyond our behavioral de nitions of risk aversion and risk seeking behavior above. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1992) claim that frequently individuals are risk averse in the gain domain while risk seeking in the loss domain. This is called the re ection e ect. In our experiment, we can study the re ection e ect because conduct lottery tasks both in the gain and loss domains. In our setting, a subject is said to display the re ection e ect if she chooses option A more than ve times in gain domain and less than ve times in the loss domain. Not all subjects may display a unique cut-o for switching between the options but may switch several times between options A and B. Moreover, a subject may not respect dominance and thus may not choose option A and B in Decision No. 1 in the gain and loss domain, respectively. If we observe a subject switching several times, we should not dismiss the preferences too quickly 7as being \\inconsistent\". We simply don't know why it switches several times. It could be that the subject is just indi erent and that's why when forced to make a choice may switch between options several times. It could also be that the subject is not indi erent but simply makes a mistake in writing down the wrong choice. Finally, it could be that the subject \\happily violates\" the assumptions underlying the maximization of expected monetary payo s. In any case, the information obtained from subjects who switch several times or choose the dominated option is limited. That's why we call a subject's preference accessible if the subject has an unique cut-o for switching between options and respects dominance. Otherwise, we call the subject's preferences inaccessible . Appendix D contains the instructions for the lottery task provided to subjects of our experiment. 2.2 Experimental Design Subjects were recruited from the campus of the University of California, Davis, using the ORSEE recruitment system by Greiner (2004). Since our experiment also included auction games, it was advertised as a \\market game\" mostly via announcements in big classes, in advertisements on Facebook, and through the distribution of lea ets. All sessions were run between February 8 and March 16, 2010, at 16:00. Upon arrival at the lab, subjects were seated randomly at one of nine desks with computer terminals separated by dividers. Each subject faced the wall of the room. Subjects were given a consent form to read and sign. At every session, the same male native-English speaking experimenter was present to explain the instructions and supervise the experiment. Every session of the experiment was divided into eight phases: 1. First Saliva Sample: Subjects received written instructions for saliva sampling (see Appendix B.2) and a styrofoam cup that contained a 4.5 ml sterile Nunc Cryo Tubec vial. The cup functioned simply as a container to prevent the vial from falling over. Each vial had been labeled prior to the experiment with the session and subject number. Subjects also received one piece of chewing gum - Tridentc Original Flavor - to stimulate saliva (see Dabbs, 1991) as well as a sterilized plastic straw through which to drool about 2.5 ml saliva into the vial. After depositing the saliva, each subject closed the vial by screwing the top and placed it back into the cup. The cups with the vials were collected by the experimenter and immediately frozen. Further details of the salivary hormone methodology are contained in Appendix B. 2. Holt-Laury Lottery Task: Subjects received written instructions on the Holt-Laury lottery task (see Appendix D). Subject had ve minutes to read the instructions. Then the experimenter publicly explained the task to all subjects, after which any questions were answered also in public. The task was conducted on paper-sheets for both gains and losses. All subjects made 8decisions in private rst for the gain domain and only then for the loss domain.3In order to eliminate as much as possible any wealth e ect on the following tasks, the lotteries were not played out immediately after completing the tasks. After all subjects completed their choices, the paper sheets were collected by the experimenter.4 3. Auction Game: Each subject received printed instructions for the auction game. The auction game itself was computerized. The correlation between bidding and pro ts in those auctions and salivary hormones is analyzed in detail in a companion paper, Schipper (2014), where the instructions can be found as well. Since the auction game could not a ect behavior in the prior lottery task (except for expectations about future earnings in the auction game), it won't be discussed here any further. 4. Questionnaire: After the auction task, subjects completed a computerized questionnaire (see Appendix E). This questionnaire elicited demographic information, menstrual cycle informa- tion, the use of hormonal contraceptives, information relevant for assessing the quality of saliva, information on sexual orientation and sexual behavior, social lifestyle, personality characteristics, emotions during the experiment, dietary preferences, academic grades, etc. some of which are used as controls in our analysis. See Appendix B.5 for an analysis of some of those factors with salivary hormones.5 5. Playing out the Holt-Laury Lottery Task: Once subjects nished the questionnaire, the previously completed paper-sheets on the Holt-Laury lottery tasks were played out in front of the subjects. For each subject, a ten-sided die was rolled four times. The rst roll decided which binary choice in the gain domain is selected. The second roll played out this lottery in the gain domain. The third roll decided which binary choice in the loss domain is selected. The nal fourth roll played out this lottery in the loss domain. Payo s for each subject were noted on the decision sheet of each subject. 6. Hand Scan: After playing out the lottery tasks, each subject's right hand (and the right hand only) was scanned with a conventional o\u000ece image scanner. The purpose of the hand scan is to measure the length of the 2nd and 3rd nger and analyze the digit ratio (2D:4D). The second and fourth digits were later measured independently by two separate researchers from the center of the exion crease proximal to the palm to the top of the digit using the measurement tools in Adobe Photoshop and Gimp. When measuring the ngers, the researchers did not know whether the hand belong to a male or female subject or how this subject behaved 3Laury and Holt (2008, p. 9) claim that the order of these tasks do not matter. However, their experiment di ers from ours in that their tasks were separated by the play of a matching pennies game and additional Holt-Laury lottery tasks with varying payo s were included. 4In a companion paper, Schipper (2014) uses the data on the lottery task to control for risk aversion in estimations of bidding behavior in auctions. 5The extensive questionnaire was also used to generate a su\u000eciently long waiting between the auction task and the collection of the second saliva sample. 9in the experiment. The measures used here are based on the averages of both measurements for each nger of each subject respectively. 7. Second Saliva Sample: About 20{30 minutes after the auction task, subjects were asked for a second saliva sample in the same manner as for the rst saliva sample. Since it takes about 15 to 30 minutes before e ects on hormones become measurable in saliva (see for instance Schultheiss et al., 2005, Kivlighan, Granger, and Booth, 2005, Edwards and O'Neal, 2009, Saad and Vongas, 2009) and only less time had passed between playing out the Holt-Laury lottery tasks and the second saliva sample, this data won't be analyzed here.6 8. Payment: At the end of the experiment, subject received in private their total cash payment from the show up fee, the auction task, and the lottery tasks. The average total earning was US$ 19.03 with a maximum of US$ 48.39 and a minimum of US$ 5.00. The entire procedure took about 1 hour and 20-30 minutes. The average earning is above what a typical student job would earn in Davis for about the same time. Our lottery experiment may involve losses as well. Losses can typically not be collected from subjects. Yet, subjects knew that they can earn also money in the gain domain of the lottery task as well as from the auctions. 2.3 Hypotheses Gender Di erences Robson (1996) shows in an evolutionary model that some males may gamble and females behave strictly risk averse. Moreover, as discussed in the introduction, the received view in the prior literature is that females are more risk averse than males. Thus, we hypothesize that females are more risk averse than males in both the gain and loss domains. Hormonal Contraceptives All hormonal contraceptives contain a progestine, a synthetic version of the sex hormone proges- terone. Some contain also a version of estradiol, another sex hormone. Progesterone may have a sedating e ect (see Pluchino et al., 2006, van Broeckhoven et al., 2006).7Throughout the human brain, there are neurons secreting the neurotransmitter GABA. When GABA interacts with other neurons, they are inhibited which means that they are less likely to \\ re\". Well-known benzodiazepines drugs like Valium, Librium, and Xanax enhance the inhibitory e ect of GABA thus reducing anxiety and having a calming and sedating e ect. The same as been observed for some metabolites of progesterone, i.e., substances converted from progesterone in the body. We 6The purpose of including a second saliva sample into the experiment was to study salivary hormone responses to pro ts in the auctions; see Schipper (2014). 7We thank Coren Apicella (private communication) for drawing our attention to the connection between progesterone and GABA A. 10hypothesize that the calming e ect of progestines in hormonal contraceptives may make females more risk averse in both the gain and loss domain. Moreover, because of the sedating e ect we hypothesize that they are less consistent in their choices. Note however that we cannot claim a causal e ect since any e ect may be due to selection. In particular, women who decide to take hormonal contraceptives may also di er systematically in their risk preferences from women who decide not to take any hormonal contraceptives. It is not clear whether a priori more risk averse women are more likely to use hormonal contraceptives or whether women with more risky sexual behavior are more likely to take hormonal contraceptives. Conclusive evidence could be obtained in an experiment in which oral contraceptives or a placebo are blindly and randomly assigned to women. Obviously, such an experiment would be rather di\u000ecult to conduct. Moreover, women who would agree to participate in such a \\risky\" experiment may systematically di er in their risk preferences from the rest of the population. Menstrual Cycle Fecundity varies over the menstrual cycle. It is not clear from an evolutionary point of view why risk aversion should stay constant throughout the menstrual cycle since gains and losses of risky behavior vary of the cycle. On one hand, risky behavior may lead to a higher probability of conception, genetic diversity and higher quality o spring through extrapair mating. This may be especially successful in monogamous societies where some females must be matched with genetically substandard males. Thus females with risky behavior near ovulation may have a higher reproductive success. On the other hand, extrapair mating involves the risk of losses because if discovered it is punished severely in most societies and may lead to a loss of the long term mating partner who supports child rearing.8This is signi cant because males of higher genetic quality tend to have poorer parental qualities (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). These arguments suggest that in order to maximize tness over the menstrual cycle, a female should have the highest propensity for extrapair mating during her fecund period. Bressan and Stranieri (2008) show that partnered women favor single men with more masculine features during their fecund phase, while they prefer attached men during their low-fecundity phase.9 Wilcox et al. (2004) show that the frequency of intercourse increases during the fecund period.10 We hypothesize that females may behave more risky during their fecund period of the menstrual cycle, the peri-ovulatory phase. 8There is some evidence for greater mate guarding near ovulation (see Gangestad, Thorndill, and Garver, 2002, and Haselton and Gangestad, 2006), which may be a long-term male mate's best response to riskier behavior of the female during her fecund window and may in turn require more risky behavior of females to escape the guard. Yet, in humans, ovulation is concealed (to some extent even to the female herself) and thus time-targeted mate guarding must be rather limited. 9For related evidence, see Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver-Apgar (2006), Penton-Voak et al. (1999), and Penton-Voak and Perrett (2000). 10In Wilcox et al. (2004), evidence is provided only for women in stable relationships. 11The hypothesis that women may behave more risk-taking during their fecund phase of their cycle seems to contradict Br\u007f oder and Hohmann (2003), who report that women avoid taking risks near ovulation in order to reduce the chance of being raped (see also Chavanne and Gallup, 1998, for an earlier study).11In contrast, Fessler (2003) argues that rape is not less frequent during the ovulatory phase. The experiment by Br\u007f oder and Hohmann (2003) did not discriminate between risks in the gain and loss domains. Di erences in risk preferences between the gain and loss domains have been discussed since the emergence of prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Such risk preferences may be relevant in an evolutionary context (see Hamo and Heifetz, 2002, for some evolutionary arguments for such s-shaped utility functions). It is conceivable that women are more likely to avoid the risk of losses during the fecund phase but are also more likely to embrace risk of gains. Figure 1: Menstrual Cycle Some hormones such as progesterone vary across the menstrual cycle (see Figure 1) (see for instance, Chatterton et al., 2005). For instance, progesterone rises during the luteal phase after ovulation and declines before menstruation. As discussed above, there is evidence that increases in progesterone during the luteal phase are positively associated with women's avoidance of infections as re ected in behavior in public bathrooms (Fleischman and Fessler, 2011). Increases in progesterone during the luteal phase are also associated with increased accuracy in decoding 11I am grateful to Arndt Br\u007f oder who privately communicated to me that in a later study he could not replicate the results of Br\u007f oder and Hohmann (2003). 12facial expressions and increased attention to social stimuli (Maner and Miller, 2014) as well as non-conscious needs to have close, friendly relationships with others (Schultheiss, Wirth, and Stanton, 2004, Wirth and Schultheiss, 2006, Brown et al., 2009). Such dispositions could reduce social risks. Since increases in progesterone in the luteal phase prepare the body for pregnancy. Minimizing the risk to a potential fetus at the same time could yield an evolutionary advantage. Thus we hypothesize that the luteal phase is positively associated with risk aversion. Salivary Hormones We use hormone measurements of the rst saliva sample to analyze associations with risk preferences.12In the introduction, we discussed the somewhat mixed prior evidence on testos- terone and risk preferences in the literature. Nevertheless, we hypothesize a negative correlation between salivary testosterone and risk aversion. Stanton et al. (2011b) report a u-shaped relationship between risk aversion and salivary testosterone in both genders, where individuals with high or low testosterone are approximately risk neutral and individuals with intermediate levels of testosterone are risk averse. Translated into our setting this nding suggests that essentially the number of choices of lottery A should be \\concave\" in salivary testosterone (i.e., an inverse u-shape). With regard to estradiol, we hypothesize that if there is any association, then it is similar to testosterone but mainly in naturally cycling females. We hypothesize that progesterone is positively correlated with risk aversion in naturally cycling females only. The hypothesis is based on two alternative explanations. First, as we discussed earlier, progesterone may have a sedating or calming e ect (see Pluchino et al., 2006, van Broeckhoven et al., 2006) because metabolites of progesterone enhance the inhibitory e ect of GABA. Thus analogous to progestins in females using hormonal contraceptives discussed earlier, we believe that progesterone may make naturally cycling females more risk averse in both the gain and loss domain. The second explanation is based on the association between the luteal phase and risk to a potential fetus that we referred to in the hypotheses on the menstrual cycle. As discussed above, there is evidence that females try to minimize risk to a potential fetus in the second half of the menstrual cycle (Fleischman and Fessler, 2011, Maner and Miller, 2014, Schultheiss, Wirth, and Stanton, 2004, Wirth and Schultheiss, 2006, Brown et al., 2009). This is the phase when progesterone peaks (see Figure 1). Thus, progesterone should be positively associated with risk aversion in naturally cycling females. Moreover, because of the sedating e ect of progesterone we hypothesize that progesterone is negatively associated 12The second saliva sample won't be analyzed here since it takes about 15 to 30 minutes before e ects on hormones become measurable in saliva and only less time had passed between playing out the Holt-Laury lottery tasks and the collection of second sample. The purpose of the second saliva sample was to analyze the salivary testosterone and cortisol responses to pro ts in the auctions; see Schipper (2014). We can use the second saliva sample to access measurement errors for estradiol and progesterone; see Appendix B.6. 13with the accessibility of risk preferences in naturally cycling females. Cortisol responds positively to stress (see Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004, and Hellhammer, Wuest, and Kudielka, 2009). We nd it natural that risk aversion may be positively correlated with stress and thus positively associated with cortisol although we are not aware of any prior empirical evidence. Digit Ratio Based on the mixed evidence in the literature discussed in the introduction, we hypothesize that if there is a relationship then the digit ratio should be positively correlated with risk aversion in both males and females. 3 Results Table 2: Basic Demographics Variable Number Mean Std. Dev.

Out of the 208 subjects, 93 (45%) are female. Most of the subjects are asian-americans (55%) followed by whites (38%).14Six subjects (three females and three males) did not provide their GPA. One woman reported that she is pregnant. Since circulat- ing levels of various steroids change during pregnancy, we exclude her from our analysis of salivary hormones and the menstrual cycle information but not in our analysis of gender di erences and the digit ratio. Figure 2 shows the cumulative frequency of option A for both the gain and the loss domain. Recall that both in the gain and loss domain, 13Subjects were allowed to select multiple majors and ethnic backgrounds. Thus, the means do not add up to unity. In our sample all math majors happened to be male. 14For comparison, the distribution of races among all UC Davis students is 42% white, 38% asian, 3% black, 14% hispanic, and 3% other. See http://facts.ucdavis.edu/studentheadcountethnicity.lasso. We don't know why we have a larger fraction of asians in our sample. It could be that relative more asians are enrolled in majors that we reached with our advertisement. In particular, about 59% of economics students at UC Davis are asian. Another reason could be that asians were more attracted to our experiments. For instance, Loo et al. (2008) surveying the literature on Chinese gambling nd that gambling is widespread preferred form of entertainment among Chinese. 14a risk neutral individual would choose option A exactly ve times. If all subjects were risk neutral, the cumulative frequency would be zero up to ve and one thereafter. However, we see that both for gains and losses some subjects choose less than ve times option A while others choose more. This suggest that some subjects may be risk seeking while others are risk averse. The cumulative frequency for the gain domain is below the one for the loss domain indicating that subjects' choices may be relatively more risk averse in the gain domain as compared to the loss domain. This nding is consistent with Laury and Holt (2008). Figure 2: Cumulative Frequency Figure 2 considers choices by all subjects including subjects whose preferences are inaccessible. There are a few inaccessible subjects who do not have an unique cut-o for switching between options A and B or do not respect dominance. The left panel in Figure 3 shows that most of our subjects, 178 out of 208 (86%), have accessible risk preferences both in the gain and loss domains. However, slightly more subjects are accessible in the loss domain than in the gain domain. We do not know whether this is due to the fact that subjects had to choose among the loss lotteries after they chose among the gain lotteries and thus had more experience in thinking through the problem or whether subjects are simply more careful in making choices when it comes to losses. Our observations are comparable to Laury and Holt (2008) who observe that 72% of their subjects have accessible risk preferences. We can classify all accessible subjects approximately as choosing risk averse, risk seeking, and risk neutral according to whether they choose option A more, less or exactly ve times, respectively (see Section 2.1). The left panel in Figure 4 shows the risk attitudes for both the gain and the loss domain. The modal subjects (34) are risk neutral both in the gain and loss domains followed closely by 33 subjects who are risk averse in the gain domain and risk seeking in the loss domain. Latter subjects display the re ection e ect (see Section 2.1). These ndings 15Figure 3: Fraction of Subjects with (In-)accessible Preferences are somewhat di erent from Laury and Holt (2008). In their treatment corresponding to ours, they observe that the modal subject exhibits risk aversion both in the gain and loss domains. Figure 4: Number of Subjects by Risk Attitudes 3.1 Gender E ects We will estimate versions of the following parametric model ri= 0+ 1gi+ Qi+\"i (1) whereiis the index of the subject, riis the number of choices of option A by subject i(in either the gain domain or the loss domain), 0is a constant, giis a dummy for the gender of individual itaking on 1 if iis female and 0 otherwise, Qiis a subset of questionnaire variables including age, race, gpa, and \"iis an unobserved error term of subject i. With regard to race, we leave out white as the omitted category. Thus, our estimates should be interpreted as compared to whites males. This model will be estimated with ordinary least squares method (OLS). To account 16for heteroscedasticity, we use robust standard errors in all regressions.15We also estimate speci cations analogous to equation (1) where we replace the number of choices of option A by either a binary variable for re ection or a binary variable for accessibility as dependent variable. Because of the binary dependent variable, we will then estimate the model with probit or logit. The middle and right panels of Figure 4 suggest that relatively fewer women than men are risk seeking in the loss domain while in the gain domain women and men behave quite similar. This observations is con rmed in Table 3. In speci cation G0A, we regress the number of choices of option A for subjects with accessible preferences in the gain domain on gender and a subset of demographic variables using OLS. We do not nd a signi cant gender e ect (p= 0:617). This is in contrast to the analogous speci cation L0A for the loss domain. Here being female is signi cantly positively correlated with risk aversion ( p= 0:019) when controlling for demographics. Table 3: Gender E ects for Gains & Losses (G0A) :1812) (0 :1804) (0 :1850) Demographics Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Majors of Study Yes Yes No Yes Yes No Number of Observations 174 202 174 191 202 191 R20:0550 0 :0357 0 :0208 0 :1059 0 L0A just consider choices of accessible subjects in the gain and loss domain, respectively. The middle and right panels of Figure 3 reveal that preferences of men are slightly more accessible than references of women. About 77% of females have accessible risk preferences, while for males it is 92%. Speci cation A0 in Table 4 con rms that on average preferences of women are signi cantly less accessible ( p= 0:012) when controlling for demographics. In this speci cation, we regress the binary variable for accessibility of risk preferences on gender and a subset of demographic variables using logit. As we explained in Section 2.1, we do not know why subjects' preferences are inaccessible. It could be that the subject is not maximizing expected payo s. But it could also be that a subject is indi erent or just makes a mistake in lling out the decision sheet. In the last two cases, we would \\misclassify\" subjects if we consider them as inconsistent although they actually have consistent risk attitudes. Moreover, it could be that such misclassi cation is correlated with a particular risk attitude and that this misclassi cation is especially prevalent in females. Thus, when we dropped inaccessible 15For our regression speci cations we use the following name conventions: \\G\" (resp. \\L\") signi es that the dependent variable is the number of choices of option A in the gain (resp. loss) domain. \\R\" stands for (the binary variable) re ection , while \\A\" stands for (the binary variable) accessibility . \\F\" will indicate the female 17subjects in speci cations G0A and L0A, we may have introduced a selection bias. To check for such a bias, we estimate analogous speci cations G0 and L0 in which we consider as dependent variable the number of choices of option A of all subjects no matter whether their risk preferences are accessible or inaccessible. This increases the number of observations but presumably also adds some noise. Our results remain qualitatively unchanged. Another reason for why we may not nd a gender e ect in speci cations G0A and G0 is that regressors are correlated. In particular, females may select on average into di erent majors than males. For instance, all of our ve math majors are male and 68% of our econ majors are male. Therefore in speci cations G1A and L1A we drop the major of study. There is still no signi cant gender e ect for gains ( p= 0:909) and the gender e ect for losses is now just marginally signi cant ( p= 0:091).

Figure 5 shows that females' risk preferences in both the gain and loss domains are slightly more similar to each other than males' risk preferences. The middle and right panels of Figure 4 seem to suggest that relatively fewer women display the re ection e ect. Yet, when we regress for accessible subjects the binary variable for the re ection e ect on gender and a subset of demographic variables using logit in speci cation R0 (see Table 4), we do not nd a signi cant gender e ect ( p= 0:165). Again, it could be that variables for the major of study absorb some of the gender e ect since some majors are more popular for men than for women. When we drop the dummy variables for major of study in speci cation R1 in Table 4, the coe\u000ecient for female becomes marginally signi cant ( p= 0:072). It appears that females are less likely to display the re ection e ect as compared to white males. We summarize our ndings as follows: Observation 1 (Gender e ects) In contrast to our hypothesis, we do not nd signi cant gender e ects for risk aversion in the gain domain. In the loss domain, females are signi cantly more risk averse than males. Preferences of females are signi cantly less accessible than males. 18Figure 5: Cumulative Frequency by Gender 3.2 Hormonal Contraceptives Roughly 23% of women in our sample administer hormonal contraceptives. This number is reasonable given the age of women and their ethnic background.16 Table 5: Contraceptives and Gains & Losses (G2F) :9053) (0 :7020) Demographics Yes Yes Yes Yes Number of Observations 71 80 69 90 R20:0717 0 :0646 Robust standard errors *10%; ** 5%; *** 1%. We amend our earlier regression approach (equation (1)) by including also a dummy for the use of hormonal contraceptives and restrict to the subsample of females with accessible risk preferences only. In Table 5 we present results from regressions of the number of choices of option A on hormonal contraceptives and a subset of demographic variables using OLS. The coe\u000ecient for hormonal contraceptives should be interpreted as compared to white naturally cycling females (as omitted category). Speci cation G2F applies to the gain domain while speci cation L2F is on the loss domain. The use of hormonal contraceptives is not signi cant (p= 0:172 andp= 0:422 for G2F and L2F, respectively). 16The United States Department of Health and Human Services (2010) estimates that in the US roughly over 11% of asian, hispanic, and black women between 15 to 44 years of age use the pill compared to over 21% of white women. The use of the pill varies also with age. In the age group 15 to 19, it is slightly over 15%, while it increases to 26% in the age group 20 to 24. Note that the mean age of women in our sample is 20.1 years. 19The logit speci cation R2F in Table 5 reveals that the use of contraceptives is not signi cantly correlated with the re ection e ect in the female subsample ( p= 0:314). contrast to our hypothesis, the logit speci cation A2F in Table 5 shows that women who use hormonal contraceptives are signi cantly more likely to have accessible risk preferences than women who do not take hormonal contraceptives ( p= 0:028). Again, we like to emphasize that we are unable to disentangle a causal e ect from a selection e ect. Observation 2 (Hormonal Contraceptives) Contrary to our hypothesis, females who use hormonal contraceptives do not show risk attitudes di erently from naturally cycling females. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, risk preferences of females on hormonal contraceptives are signi cantly more accessible than risk preferences of naturally cycling females.

Estradiol, progesterone, the lutenizing hormone, and the follicular stimulating hormone all change over the menstrual cycle (see Figure 1).17Thus menstrual cycle information provides relative easy to observe within-female measures of some hormones. From all female subjects we obtained information about their menstrual cycle. Table 6 presents the distribution across menstrual cycle phases for naturally cycling women. Women who take hormonal contraceptives do not have a natural menstrual cycle, and their circulating 17The lutenizing hormone and the follicular stimulating hormone are glycoproteins that cannot be measured in saliva. 20levels of hormones may di er from naturally cycling women.18Therefore we consider for the classi cation of women into menstrual cycle phases only women who do not take hormonal contraceptives, so called naturally cycling women. For the 28-days standardized menstrual cycle phases (third and fourth columns in Table 6), we distinguish between the menstrual phase (days 1 to 5), the follicular phase (days 6 to 13), the peri-ovulatory phase (days 14 to 15), the luteal phase (days 16 to 23), and the premenstrual phase (days 24 to 28). One major implicit assumption behind the standardized 28-day menstrual cycle is that allwomen follow a menstrual cycle of exactly 28 days . Yet, we nd substantial variation in usual cycle length in our sample. All 72 naturally cycling women reported their usual cycle length. The average is 29 :5 days with a standard deviation of 3 :24.19Further noise may be introduced through intrapersonal variability in cycle length. The length of the menstrual cycle may vary from cycle to cycle even within the same woman, and the woman can not know the exact length of her current menstrual cycle. Finally, there is measurement error due to imperfect recall. Self-reports may be inaccurate and this inaccuracy may depend on the day of the menstrual cycle. Menstruating women usually know that they are menstruating while later in the cycle women may not remember exactly their rst day of their menstrual cycle. This raises the question whether estimation results will be robust to slight changes in the de nitions of the menstrual phases. Fortunately, we can use the information collected on the usual length of the menstrual cycle to construct more individualized menstrual cycle measures as in Pearson and Schipper (2013). Individualized phases are constructed in two ways: uniformly adjusted phases and follicular adjusted phases. Uniformly Adjusted Phases: We uniformly adjust the phases by the individual length of the menstrual cycle. Let xi:=Subjecti0snumber of days since the rst day of the last menstruation period Length of subject i0stypical menstruation cycle: We de ne the female subject ito be in the 1.Uniformly Adjusted Menstrual Phase if and only if xi\u00145:5 28, 2.Uniformly Adjusted Follicular Phase if and only if5:5 28<xi\u001413:5 28, 18See Briggs and Briggs (1972), Kjeld et al. (1976), Wiegratz et al. (1995), Coenen et al. (1996), Spona et al. (1996), Kirschbaum, et al. (1999), Schultheiss et al. (2003), Edwards and O'Neal (2009), and Liening et al. (2010). The withdrawal bleeding during the \\pill break\" should not be confused with the menstrual phase; see Fritz and Spero (2011). 19Regarding the \\Length Menstrual Cycle\", answers of \\ >35 days\" have been normalized to 37 days. Answers \\<25 days\" have been normalized to 24 days. Our estimations are robust to small changes of those upper and lower bounds. 213.Uniformly Adjusted Peri-ovulatory Phase if and only if13:5 28<xi\u001416:5 28, 4.Uniformly Adjusted Luteal Phase if and only if16:5 28<xi\u001423:5 28, Adjusted Follicular Adjusted Phases: Hampson and Young (2008) write \\The length of the luteal phase is relatively xed at 13 to 15 days. Therefore, most of the variation in cycle length from woman to woman is attributable to di erences in the length of the follicular phase.\" Thus, we consider adjusting the length of the follicular phase only. We start by rede ning recursively the last three phases starting with the last phase. Let yibe subjecti's the number of days since the rst day of the last menstrual cycle, and dithe average duration of i's menstrual cycles. Female subjectiis in the 1.Follicular Adjusted Premenstrual Phase if and only if yi>di\u00005, 2.Follicular Adjusted Luteal Phase if and only if yi>di\u000013 andiis not in the Follicular Adjusted Premenstrual Phase, 3.Follicular Peri-ovulatory Phase if and only if yi> di\u000016 andiis not in the Follicular Adjusted Premenstrual Phase or the Follicular Adjusted Luteal Phase. Next, female subject iis in the 4.Follicular Adjusted Menstrual Phase if and only if iis in the Menstrual Phase. Finally, female subject iis in the 5.Follicular Adjusted Follicular Phase if and only if iis not in the Follicular Adjusted Menstrual Phase, Follicular Adjusted Peri-ovulatory Phase, Follicular Adjusted Luteal Phase or Follicular Adjusted Premenstrual Phase. Table 8, columns 5 to 8, show the empirical distribution of uniformly adjusted and follicular adjusted menstrual cycle phases in our naturally cycling females, respectively. The distributions di er slightly. For comparison, we report in the last column of Table 8 the expected frequency of natural menstrual cycle phases assuming an uniform probability to participate in the experiment at any day of a 28 days standard menstrual cycle conditional on 23% of the female population taking hormonal contraceptives. In Figure 6 we plot the female/male di erences in the number of choices of option A for the gain and the loss domain, respectively. The left panel for the gain domain seem to suggest that women become less risk averse towards the midcycle when fecundity is highest. But the 22Figure 6: Female/Male Di erence in Risk Aversion over the Menstrual Cycle Table 7: Cycle :6504) (1 :1841) (0 :8852) Demographics Yes Yes Yes Yes Number of Observations 51 60 49 68 R20:1178 0 :0803 Robust standard errors intervals make also clear that noise is quite hight. No such cyclic tendency is observed for losses. We amend our earlier regression approach (equation (1)) further by including also dummies for menstrual cycle phases and restricting to the subsample of naturally cycling females only. We leave out the menstrual phase as omitted category. Thus, all estimates should be interpreted as compared to white naturally cycling females in the menstrual phase. Our analysis involves multiple testing of four menstrual cycle phases (in addition to the omitted menstrual phase. The chance of falsely observing one phase to be signi cantly correlated with risk preferences is much higher when four hormones are analyzed as compared to when, from the beginning, just one variable is analyzed. Thus, the use of p-values may lead to errors of inference, and in particular to the underestimation of false positives. We will point out whether or not results are signi cant when we use Bonferroni correction, which is a conservative method to correct for multiple testing. If the desired signi cance level is = 5%, then the Bonferroni corrected 23signi cance level for each menstrual cycle phase is 4= 1:25% (since there are four phases in addition to the omitted menstrual phase). Thus, any phase that is signi cant at the 1.25% level is Bonferroni corrected signi cant at the 5% level. In Table 7 we report coe\u000ecients and standard errors for regressions on dummies for follicular adjusted menstrual phases. We obtain clear null results for risk preferences in the gain and loss domains (G5F and L5F, respectively) as well as for accessibility of risk preferences (A5F). With regard to the re ection e ect, it appears that it is positively correlated with premenstrual phase but this association is just weakly signi cant ( p= 0:08) and becomes insigni cant when dropping subsets of demographic variables or controlling for multiple comparisons of more than one menstrual cycle phase using Bonferroni correction.20Similar results obtain when using the other two de nitions of menstrual cycle phases (not reported). We reject the hypothesis that naturally cycling females are more risk seeking in the peri-ovulatory phase or more risk averse in the luteal phase. Moreover, we also reject the hypothesis that naturally cycling females are less accessible in the luteal phase. Observation 3 (Menstrual Cycle) Contrary to our hypotheses, we do not nd any signi cant correlations between menstrual cycle phases and risk preferences for gains or losses, the re ection e ect, or accessibility of risk preferences. 3.4 Salivary Hormones From each subject we collected saliva after they arrived for the experiment about 5 to 8 minutes before they made decisions in the Holt-Laury lottery tasks. For one male subject, the amount of saliva we collected was not su\u000ecient to assay progesterone and cortisol, so he is excluded from the analysis of salivary hormones. Table 8 provides summary statistics for salivary hormones by gender and hormonal contraceptive use. Figure 7 displays histograms and kernel distributions by gender. Gender di erences are notable especially for testosterone and progesterone. Table 8: Summary Statistics of Salivary Hormones by Gender and Hormonal Contraceptive Use Natur. Cycling Females Fem. on Contraceptives Male Salivary Hormone Mean Std. Dev. re ection is predicted perfectly when the (accessible) women is in the peri-ovulatory or luteal phases. 24Figure 7: Densities of Salivary Hormones by Gender The relationships between ex ante salivary hormones and risk aversion in both the gain and loss domains are preliminarily explored in Figure 8 in which we print by gender for each hormone a scatter plot and t a linear regression between the hormone level and the number of choices of option A. In the upper two panels of Figure 8 we observe that higher testosterone is negatively correlated with risk aversion in males but not in females. This is more pronounced in the gain (upper left panel) than in the loss (upper right panel) domain. That is, testosterone is negatively correlated with risk aversion in males. A positive correlation is observed between estradiol and risk aversion for both males and females in the loss domain (second upper right panel) but not in the gain domain (second upper left panel). Similarly, a positive correlation is observed between progesterone and risk aversion for both males and females in both the gain and loss domains but the correlation is more pronounced for females and in the gain domain. Finally, a positive correlation is observed between cortisol and risk aversion for both males and females in the gain domain but not in the loss domain. We seek to corroborate these preliminary observations with multivariate regressions. In particular, we will estimate versions of the following parametric model ri= 0+ 1Hi+ Qi+\"i (2) 25Figure 8: Salivary Hormones and Risk Taking by Gender whereiis the index of the subject, riis the number of choices of option A by subject i(in either the gain domain or the loss domain), 0is a constant, Hiis the vector of salivary hormone measures,Qiis a subset of questionnaire variables including age, race, and gpa, and \"iis an 26unobserved error term of subject i. We exclude white from race as omitted category. Thus, our estimates should be interpreted as compared to whites. The model will be estimated with ordinary least squares method. We also estimate speci cations analogous to equation (2), in which we replace the number of choices of option A by either a binary variable for re ection or a binary variable for accessibility as dependent variable. These will be estimated with probit or logit. Since sex hormones di er by gender and are a ected by hormonal contraceptives, we estimate all speci cations separately for the subsamples of males, naturally cycling females, and females using hormonal contraceptives. Some hormones like salivary testosterone or estradiol are measured in pg/ml while others like progesterone or cortisol are measured in nmol/L. Moreover, we see in Table 8 that their absolute levels di er quite a bit. To be better able to interpret the regression results, we use standard scores or z-scores by centering hormones measures to their mean and dividing them by their standard deviation. Since sex hormones di er by gender, this normalization could a ect gender speci c results. To circumvent this problem, we compute z-scores for each gender separately. That is, we normalize each hormone by zi:=hi\u0000\u0016g(i) \u001bg(i); wherehiis subjecti's salivary hormone level, gis a function that assigns to each subject i its genderg(i)2fmale;femaleg, and\u0016g(i)and\u001bg(i)are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, of salivary hormone levels of subjects with gender g(i). For instance, in OLS regressions, the coe\u000ecient for any hormone measures the e ect on the number of choices of A in the Holt-Laury lottery task when the hormone level increases by one standard deviation above gender-speci c mean (keeping everything else constant). To account for heteroscedasticity, we use robust standard errors in all regressions. Moreover, we account for multiple testing of four hormones using Bonferroni correction. Thus, if the desired signi cance level is = 5%, then the Bonferroni-corrected signi cance level for each hormone is 4= 1:25% (since there are four hormones). Any hormone that is signi cant at the 1.25% level is Bonferroni-corrected signi cant at the 5% level. Table 9 presents regression results for males. Speci cations G3M and L3M show results for the gain and loss domains, respectively. We observe null results except for testosterone in the gain domain. Testosterone is signi cantly negatively associated with risk aversion in males (p= 0:007). The e ect size is small: Roughly, an increase of testosterone by two standard deviations would let the male individual switch from A to B almost one lottery earlier in Table 1. Nevertheless, the association is robust to dropping demographic variables, adding demographic variables like body-mass-index, number of siblings, physical activity, living situation, dating, sexual preferences, and the digit ratio, dietary preferences, adding the major of study, including 27Table 9: :1138) :2554) (0 :4227) Demographics Yes Yes Yes Yes Number of Observations 102 110 102 111 R20:1042 0 :1340 Robust standard errors *10%; ** 5%; *** 1%. data from males with inaccessible preference, controlling for factors that could potentially a ect the quality of saliva samples, dropping all salivary hormones except salivary testosterone, or using session xed-e ects instead OLS. It is also signi cant when controlling for multiple testing of four hormones using Bonferroni correction. Recall that based on ndings by Stanton et al. (2011b) we hypothesized that essentially the number of choices of lottery A should be \\concave\" in salivary testosterone. When we include as an additional regressor the square of the testosterone measure in a speci cation analogous G3M, then the coe\u000ecient in front of the squared testosterone measure is about 0 :19 and marginally signi cant ( p= 0:058) while the for \u00000:46 and signi cant ( p= 0:003). Thus, in contrast to our hypothesis, if there is any nonlinear relationship between the number of choices of lotteries A in the gain domain and salivary testosterone, then it appears to be \\convex\". This is contrary to Stanton et al. (2011b). The nding is also not robust as the coe\u000ecient for the squared term becomes insigni cant if session xed e ects are used instead of OLS. In a speci cation for the loss domain analogous to the gain domain, both the coe\u000ecients for testosterone and squared and A3M on the re ection e ect and the accessibility of risk preferences, respectively. We observe null results on the re ection e ect. With regard to accessibility of preferences, there appears to be a marginally signi cant negative association with estradiol (p= 0:096). The association is not robust as it becomes insigni cant when dropping subsets of demographic controls such as major of studies and gpa. It is also insigni cant when controlling for multiple testing using Bonferroni. Observation 4 (Males) In males, more risk-taking for gains is signi cantly positively cor- related with salivary testosterone. This association is also signi cant when accounting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. No other signi cant associations with salivary 28hormones are observed in males. Table 10 shows regression results when we restrict data to the subsample of naturally cycling females. For risk preferences in the gain and loss domains (G3F and L3F, respectively), we observe null results except for a signi cant positive association of risk preferences in the gain domain and cortisol ( p= 0:025). This is in line with our hypothesis although it is not clear why we observe it in naturally cycling females only. The association is robust to dropping subsets of demographic variables, adding demographic variables like body-mass-index, number of siblings, physical activity, living situation, dating, sexual preferences, and the digit ratio, adding dietary preferences, adding the major of study, including data from naturally cycling females with inaccessible preference, dropping all salivary hormones except salivary testosterone, or using session xed-e ects instead OLS. It becomes insigni cant if we control for factors that could potentially a ect the quality of saliva samples. In Appendix B.5 we show that both the time last eaten and the switch to daylight saving time a ected salivary cortisol in females. It turns out that these factors are also marginally signi cant if we regress the number of choices of lottery A in the gain domain on these factors and demographics. But the analysis suggests that they a ect risk preferences through cortisol. Our cortisol nding it is just at the borderline of being marginally signi cant when controlling for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Table 10: Salivary Hormones in :1718) :3429) (0 :3460) Demographics Yes Yes Yes Yes Number of Observations 51 60 50 69 R20:1946 0 :0957 Robust standard errors 5%; *** 1%. based on ndings by Stanton et al. (2011b) we hypothesized that essentially the number of choices of lottery A should be \\concave\" in salivary testosterone. When we include as an additional the square of the testosterone measure in speci cations analogous to G3F and L3F, both the coe\u000ecient for the testosterone measure and the coe\u000ecient for the squared testosterone measure are insigni cant. Thus, we reject the hypothesis. The re ection e ect has a marginally signi cant positive association with progesterone in naturally cycling females (speci cation R3F, p= 0:092). It seems that progesterone is positively 29correlated with the propensity to be risk averse in the gain domain and risk seeking in the loss domain. Yet, this correlation becomes insigni cant when dropping demographic variables or when controlling for multiple testing using Bonferroni method. Speci cation A3F shows marginally signi cant associations between the accessibility of risk preferences and testosterone and cortisol in naturally cycling females. The propensity to have accessible risk preferences is negatively correlated with testosterone remains marginally signi cant when dropping subsets of demographic variables while latter becomes insigni cant. Both are insigni cant if we control for multiple testing using Bonferroni. Altogether, we are reluctant to claim any robust associations of the re ection e ect or accessibility of risk preferences with hormones in naturally cycling females. Observation 5 (Naturally Cycling Females) In naturally cycling females, risk aversion is signi cantly positively correlated with salivary cortisol. This association is at the border of being marginally signi cant when controlling for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni method. No other robust signi cant associations with salivary hormones are observed in naturally cycling females. Ideally we would like to present an analogous analysis for females on hormonal contraceptives. Unfortunately, we just have 21 women in our sample who take hormonal contraceptives of which only 19 have accessible risk preferences. We fear that this sample is too small to draw meaningful inferences with respect to covariation of hormones and risk preferences. Thus the following analysis should be considered as extremely preliminary. Table 11 shows regression results females on hormonal contraceptives. Because of the lack of observations, we also include data on females using hormonal contraceptives whose risk preferences are not accessible. Moreover, we drop any demographic variables and only regress on the four salivary hormones and a constant. Table 11: Salivary Hormones in on of Observations 21 21 21 R20:4286 errors risk aversion in the gain domain is signi cantly positively correlated with salivary progesterone in females using hormonal contraceptives ( p= 0:002). It remains signi cant if we add demographic variables. It is also signi cant when correcting for multiple testing using Bonferroni method. In the loss domain, risk aversion is signi negatively correlated The association with estradiol remains signi cant if we add demographic variables, while the association with progesterone remains weakly signi cant. Note that associations with progesterone in the gain and loss domains have di erent signs. This suggest that re ection should be correlated with progesterone. This is indeed the case. Salivary progesterone slightly above the female mean perfectly predicts re ection. That's why this logit speci cation on the re ection e ect is missing from Table 11. Finally, salivary cortisol is signi cantly positively associated with accessibility of risk preferences in females using hormonal contraceptives ( p= 0:003). Yet, demographic variables such as gpa would predict accessibility of risk preferences perfectly. Altogether, this preliminary data suggests that it may be interesting to examine risk preferences and steroid hormones in a larger data set on females who use hormonal contraceptives. 3.5 Digit Ratio We scanned each subject's right hand from which we measured and calculated the digit ratio (2D:4D), the ratio between the lengthes of the pointer to the ring nger. The summary statistics are presented in Table 12. As it is well-known in the literature, females have on average a larger digit ratio than males. For one subject we accidently scanned the left hand instead the right hand. We measured the ngers nevertheless and include this observation in our analysis. Our results do not change when we drop this subject. Table 12: Summary Statistics of the Digit Ratio by Gender and Race Females Males Ethnicity Mean Std. Dev. Mean Std. Figure 9 we present scatter plots for the correlation between the digit ratio and the number of choices of option A by gender for both gains and losses. The upper two panels are for the full sample by gender. We also t linear regressions. These regression lines indicate a 31Figure 9: Digit Ratio and Risk Aversion by Gender and Ethnicity positive relationship between digit ratio and risk aversion. This appears to be more pronounced in females than males. However, when we try to corroborate these preliminary observations with multivariate regressions, we do not nd signi cant results. In particular, we estimate the following model ri= 0+ 1di+ Qi+\"i (3) whereiis the index of the subject, riis the number of choices of option A by subject i(in either the gain domain or the loss domain), 0is a constant, diis individual i's digit ratio, Qiis a subset of questionnaire variables including age, race, and gpa, and \"iis an unobserved error term of subject i. This model will be estimated with ordinary least squares method (OLS). We 32also estimate speci cations analogous to equation (3) where we replace the number of choices of option A by either a binary variable for re ection or a binary variable for accessibility of preferences as dependent variable. Because of the binary dependent variable, we will then estimate the model with probit or logit. Since the digit ratio is known to di er by gender, we estimate all speci cations separately for both the male and female subsamples.

Controlling linearly for race (with white as the omitted category), as we do in Tables 13 and 14, may not be appropriate as the digit ratio could have di erent associations in di erent races. That's why we split the samples further and analyze separately the white and asian subsamples by gender. Tables 15 and 16 show results for the white subsample by gender, respectively.21Again, we observe null results for both genders. Similarly, Tables 17 and 18 show null results for the asian subsample by gender, respectively, except for the re ection e ect for asian males. It appears that the propensity to display the re ection e ect is negatively correlated with the digit ratio in asian males ( p= 0:022). This observation is robust to dropping demographic variables or adding major of study or using probit instead of logit. It remains 21This time, we include just gpa and age as demographic variables. 34just marginally signi cant when demographic variables are dropped and also asian males with inaccessible risk preferences are considered. We do not have a hypothesis for this nding. It may simply be a false positive given that this is the only signi cant nding in our 24 regressions on the digit ratio. It would require a replication with larger samples to clarify the status of this observation. Observation 6 (Digit Ratio) No signi cant correlation between the digit ratio and risk pref- erences in the gain or loss domains are observed in either males, females, white males, white females, asian males and asian females. The digit ratio is signi cantly correlated with the re ection e ect in asian males only. 4 Discussion We present a fairly comprehensive study of correlations between risk preferences and sex hormones. While salivary testosterone has been studied previously for choice under risk in the gain domain, we are not aware of any previous study of choice under risk for both gains and losses and all of salivary testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol in both males and females . We show null results except for testosterone and cortisol. With regard to testosterone, we replicate the observation in Apicella et al. (2008) for males with a di erent lottery task in the gain domain only. In males, risk-taking for gains is positively associated with testosterone. The e ect size is small (likely to be attenuated by measure errors) but the nding is robust. We also observe that risk aversion for gains is positively associated with cortisol in females. This last nding has potential methodological implications for experimental economics. It is known that cortisol follows a circadian cycle. It is usually higher in the morning and then falls in the afternoon. It is also known to be a ected by stress such as exams etc. Thus, a careful experimenter should control for session e ects when experimenting with tasks in which behavior is sensitive to risk preferences especially if sessions are run both in the mornings and afternoons or during exam times. Both estradiol and progesterone vary over the menstrual cycle. Consistent with our null results on the correlation of risk preferences with salivary estradiol and progesterone, we also observe null results on the correlation of risk preferences with menstrual cycle phases. Our null nding with respect to hormonal contraceptives is consistent with the null result on salivary progesterone too since hormonal contraceptives contain an synthetic version of progesterone. Nevertheless, the null- nding for progesterone is puzzling because in our companion study, Schipper (2014), we report a robust positive association between basal progesterone and bidding of naturally cycling females in rst-price auctions. The e ects of risk aversion in rst-price auctions with symmetric independent private values are well established in theory (see Krishna, 2002, Chapter 4.1). Risk aversion increases equilibrium bids above risk-neutral Nash equilibrium. 35A higher bid translates into a higher probability of winning the auction, but it also leads to a lower pro t conditional on winning the auction.22The experimental evidence for risk aversion in rst-price auctions with symmetric independent private values is at best mixed (see for a survey, Kagel, 1995). Indeed, Schipper (2014) nds that the addition of our measures of risk preferences from our Holt-Laury lottery tasks to regressions of bidding on salivary progesterone does not diminish the positive association of bidding with progesterone. Thus, the association of progesterone on bidding does not seem to be mediated through risk preferences as elicited with Holt-Laury lotteries. This is somehow at odds with the literature showing that progesterone seems to mitigate \\social risk\" (Fleischman and Fessler, 2011, Maner and Wirth, and Stanton, 2004, Wirth and Schultheiss, 2006, Brown et al., 2009). One explanation for reconciling the evidence is that risk preferences are context-speci c rather than universal. Individual behavior in Holt-Laury lottery tasks may not be well-suited to measure risk attitudes in strategic contexts like auctions. The context-speci ty of risk attitudes may also explain to some extent poor correlations between behavior in the Holt-Laury lottery task and other elicitation methods (see Deck et al., 2010, and L\u007f onnqvist et al., 2011). Our null-results on the digit ratio are consistent with some of the existing literature. We replicate null-results for gains with a racially mixed sample of males by Apicella et al. (2008) and extend it to losses as well as a females. The null- nding is relevant given the positive ndings on the digit ratio and risk preferences reported in published research (see for a survey Ho man, Jordan, and Yoeli, 2013). It is also relevant given the positive ndings on the digit ratio and various economic behaviors both in the lab and the eld. Coates, Gurnell, and Rustichini (2009) nd that lower 2D:4D predicts the 20-month average pro tability of 44 male high-frequency traders in London. Guiso and Rustichini (2011) report that entrepreneurs with lower digit ratio manage larger rms and experience faster average growth. Van den Bergh and Dewitte (2006) report that in ultimatum bargaining games men with lower 2D:4D are more likely to reject unfair o ers in neutral contexts but are morel likely to accept unfair o ers in sex-related contexts. Using a public good game, Millet and Dewitte (2006) nd that men and women with lower digit ratio contribute proportionally, whereas those with higher 2D:4D contributed either more or less. Sanchez-Pages and Turiegano (2011) show that men with intermediate 2D:4D are more likely to cooperate in a one-shot prisoners' dilemma game. Our paper is related to an increasing literature on endocrinological economics. Pearson and Schipper (2012) show a null result for the correlation between the digit ratio and competitive bidding and pro ts in rst-price auctions. Both Chen, Katu\u0014 s\u0014 c\u0013 ak, and Ozdenoren (2013) and Pearson and Schipper (2013) study the correlation of bidding in auctions with self-reported menstrual cycle information and the use of hormonal contraceptives. Buser (2012a) and 22Various dispositions towards uncertainty, like anticipated regret from losing the auction (see Filiz and Ozbay, 2007), overcon dence in the winning probability of a bid, ambiguity aversion, etc. lead to similar behavioral predictions in rst-price auctions with independent private values. 36Wozniak, Harbaugh, and Mayr (2014) study the correlation between self-reported menstrual cycle information and the selection into tournaments. Buser (2012b) analyzes social preferences and self-reported menstrual cycle information. Several studies correlate economically relevant behavior with direct measurements of circulating hormones, mostly testosterone and oxytocin. See Burnham (2007) for results using the ultimatum game, Zak, Kurzban, and Matzner (2004, 2005) for the trust game, Sanchez-Pages and Turiegano (2011) for the prisoners' dilemma, Johnson et al. (2006) for a \\war\" game, and Apicella et al (2011) for salivary testosterone and cortisol for self-selection into tournaments. Zhong et al. (2013) show that cortisol responses are correlated with self-selection into tournaments. As mentioned above, Schipper (2014) studies the correlation of competitive bidding in rst-price auctions with salivary testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. He reports null ndings except for progesterone in females. A similar result has been reported by Shachat and Wei (2014). Outside the lab, Coates and Herbert (2008) show that salivary morning testosterone levels are positively correlated with daily pro ts in male nancial traders in the City of London. In an early study, Lehrer et al. (2004) study associations of salivary testosterone and cortisol with various types of adolescent risky behavior. The literature on endocrinological economics went beyond correlation studies. There are several papers on the e ect of placebo-controlled administration of hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and oxytocin on mainly on social preferences. See Kosfeld et al. (2005), Baumgartner et al. (2008), Zak, Stanton, and Ahmadi (2007) on oxytocin, Zethraeus et al. (2009) on estrogen and testosterone, and Zak et al. (2009) and Eisenegger et al. (2010) on testosterone. Ornter et al. (2013) report a null result for testosterone and discounting. It should be pointed out, though, that to further our understanding of how hormones e ect economic behavior requires both careful correlation studies and placebo-controlled experiments. In order to establish causalities with placebo-controlled studies, it is necessary to know whether exogenously administered hormones actually act similarly to endogenous hormones, to establish knowledge about doses administered, e ect sizes and their relation to endogenous levels, as well as to elaborate the interaction between exogenous and endogenous hormones. For most hormones of interest to behavioral studies, this knowledge is extremely preliminary. References [1]Apicella, C.L., Dreber, A., Campbell, B., Gray, P.B., Ho man, M., and Little, A.C. (2008).

Schipper A Instruction for Saliva Collection Instructions for Saliva Collection Terminal: __ In this experiment we are collecting saliva from the participants (you). The saliva is analyzed for the hormones it contains. You have received a collection tube. We need it about half full. Please do not eat, drink or chew any chewing gum other than provided by the experimenter during the experiment, as this will affect your saliva. How to collect saliva? 1. Chew one piece of Trident original sugarless chewing gum to stimulate saliva. 2. After half a minute, spit the gum out into a tissue. 3. Uncap the collection tube. 4. A short straw is provided for you. Please place it in the tube. 5. Drool saliva through the straw into the tube until it is approximately half full. 6. Remove the straw onto a tissue. 7. Recap the tube. The experimenters will collect the tubes during the experiment. The used chewing, straws and tissues should be deposited into the rubbish bin at the end of the experiment. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and an experimenter will attend to your ques tion. B Salivary Hormone Methodology B.1 Steroid Hormones Sex di erences in brain and behavior are to a large extent in uenced by sex steroids. According to the classic organizational-activational hypothesis of sexual di erentiation (see Phoenix et al, 1959), a transient rise in testosterone during prenatal or early postnatal development masculinizes the brain in males, while the absence of testosterone leads to female neural structures. During puberty, testicular and ovarian hormones act on previously sexually di erentiated circuits to facilitate expression of sex-typical behaviors in particular social contexts (see Schultz et al., 2009, Arnold and Breedlove, 1985, and Kelly et ial., 1999). Thus, sex steroids are thought to have both organizational e ects and activational e ects. Organizational e ects refer to more permanent in uences that often occur prenatally, early after birth, or during puberty. An example is the prenatal organization of tissues of male adult reproductive behavior. Activational e ects are temporary e ects and often they depend on prior organizational e ects. For instance, a male does not display mating behavior facilitated by the prenatally organized tissues unless adequate sex hormones are produced at puberty (see Baron-Cohen et al. 2006). Often, exogenous hormones are distinguished from endogenous hormones. The latter are hormones released by glands in the body, while exogenous hormones are hormones administered orally, transdermally, intranasally, or by various types of injections. Exogenous hormones may have e ects di erent from endogenous hormones of the same type depending on absorbtion, metabolism, and the presence of prior organizational e ects mentioned above. For instance, orally administered steroids are subject to the rst-pass e ect, i.e., the metabolic reduction of the steroid in the liver, and not all of the administered dose becomes available in the blood for binding on receptors. We focus on four endogenous steroid hormones: testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol (for Nelson, 2011). Testosterone, C19H28O2, belongs to the androgen group. It is derived via some intermediated steps from cholesterol and secreted in the testis, ovaries, and adrenal gland. Some of it is aromatized into estradiol. Since it is observed in most vertebrates, it must have had a long evolutionary history (Mechoulam et al., 1984). Testosterone has anabolic e ects such as stimulating the bone density and muscle mass as well as androgenic e ects such as the maturation of sex organs and secondary sex characteristics especially in males. It is necessary for sperm development. In humans, various behavioral correlations with testosterone have been reported mostly pertaining to aggression (e.g. Archer, 1991) and dominance (e.g. Mazur and Booth, 1998, Mehta and Josephs, 2006). Estradiol,C18H24O2, sometimes also named E2 or 17 -estradiol, is a member of the estrogen group. It is also derived via some intermediated steps from cholesterol and secreted in the testis, ovaries, and the adrenal cortex. It changes over the menstrual cycle, peaking shortly before ovulation and again in the second half of the cycle (see Fritz and Spero , 2011). However, in blood plasma, estradiol is bound to globulin and albumin, and only a small fraction is free and biologically active. This fraction is constant over the menstrual cycle (Wu et al., 1976). Estradiol enters cells relatively freely. Its anabolic e ects include e ects on the bone structure and its androgenic e ects are on the maturation of female sex organs and secondary sex characteristics. Wu et al. (2009) suggest that the aromatization of testosterone into estradiol is important for the organization and activation of neural circuits that control male territorial behaviors in mice. Progesterone, C201H300O200, sometimes denoted by P4, belongs to the progesten group. It is derived from cholesterol, secreted in the ovaries, especially the corpus luteum, the adrenal glands, and during pregnancy in the placenta. It is also contained in milk. Progesterone is stored in fat tissue. It can be metabolized (via some intermediate steps) into cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol. Progesterone changes over the menstrual cycle, rising after ovulation and declining before menstruation (see Fritz and Spero , 2011). As its name suggests, it plays a prominent role during pregnancy (\\pro-gestation\"). Progesterone is a neurosteroid that can be synthesized within the central nervous system. There is a surprisingly small literature on behavioral e ects in humans; see Fleischman and Fessler (2011), Maner and (2014), Schultheiss, Wirth, and Stanton (2004), Wirth and Schultheiss (2006), and Brown et al. (2009). Cortisol,C21H30O5, is a steroid hormone belonging to glucocorticoid group. It is secreted in adrenal iiglands and controlled by the hypothalamus. It is considered to be the \\stress hormone\" since it is released in response to stress (Hellhammer, Wuest, and Kudielka, 2009). It increases blood sugar, suppresses the immune system, and is aiding fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism. As the other steroid hormones, it is derived from cholesterol via some intermediated steps. Massage (Field et al. 2005), intimacy (Ditzen et al., 2007, 2008), and sexual arousal (Hamilton and Meston, 2011) reduce cortisol levels. Ca eine (Lovallo et al., 2006) and sleep deprivation (Leproult et al, 1997) can increase cortisol levels. Cortisol follows a typical circadian cycle. On average it is lowest at 4:00 am and peaks at 8:00 am. In terms of behavioral e ects, cortisol may interact with testosterone. For instance, Mehta and Josephs (2010) report that testosterone is positively correlated with dominance in low cortisol males while negatively correlated in high cortisol males. B.2 Instruction for Saliva Collection Instructions for Saliva Collection Terminal: __ In this experiment we are collecting saliva from the participants (you). The saliva is analyzed for the hormones it contains. You have received a collection tube. We need it about half full. Please do not eat, drink or chew any chewing gum other than provided by the experimenter during the experiment, as this will affect your saliva. How to collect saliva? 1. Chew one piece of Trident original sugarless chewing gum to stimulate saliva. 2. After half a minute, spit the gum out into a tissue. 3. Uncap the collection tube. 4. A short straw is provided for you. Please place it in the tube. 5. Drool saliva through the straw into the tube until it is approximately half full. 6. Remove the straw onto a tissue. 7. Recap the tube. The experimenters will collect the tubes during the experiment. The used chewing, straws and tissues should be deposited into the rubbish bin at the end of the experiment. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and an experimenter will attend to your ques tion. B.3 Further Details on Saliva Collection and Storage All sessions were run between February 8 and March 16, 2010, at the same time of the day in the afternoon. This is important as some hormones such as cortisol follow a circadian cycle (Van Cauter and Turek, 1995). The starting time of each session, 16:00, was scheduled such as to have su\u000ecient time passed after lunch and to complete the session before dinner time. This is because salivary testosterone or cortisol may respond to meals 30 to 60 minutes before saliva collection (e.g. Al-Dujaili and Bryant, iii2005). For testosterone, late-afternoon collections represented samples with physiologically relevant \\low\" hormone concentrations (Granger et al., 2004). We must mention that the switch to Daylight Saving Time occurred on March 14, 2010. Although we were not able to nd studies analyzing the e ect of Daylight Saving Time on cortisol or other steroid hormones, it is know from Valdez et al. (2003) and Kantermann et al. (2007) that the switch to Daylight Saving Time may a ect the circadian cycle. Thus, salivary hormones from subjects in sessions on March 15 and 16 may be a ected by Daylight Saving Time. We will analyze this issue below. Saliva samples were stored immediately after collection at -20\u000eC till the end of March 2010 and then at -80\u000eC till May 2010 when they were assayed. Granger et al. (2004) study testosterone concentration in stored saliva samples. They found no associations between testosterone levels and storage duration for samples stored at -80\u000eC over a period of 36 months. The same applies for samples collected in the late afternoon and stored at -20\u000eC over a period of 24 months. B.4 Assays Assays were conducted by the Endocrine Core Laboratory of the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis. Prior to assay of cortisol, progesterone, estradiol and testosterone, saliva samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to separate the aqueous component from mucins and other suspended particles. Salivary concentrations of testosterone were estimated in duplicate using the salivary testosterone enzyme immunoassay kit (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA). Assay procedures were run in accordance to manufacturer's protocol salivary salivary assay has a least detectable dose of 1.0 pg/mL, and intra- and inter-assay coe\u000ecients of variation were 4.44 and 7.96, respectively. Salivary concentrations of estradiol were estimated in duplicate using the high sensitivity salivary 17 {estradiol enzyme immunoassay kit (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA). Assay procedures were run in accordance to manufacturer's protocol HS Salivary 17 -Estradiol EIA Kit Insert, revision date 2-22-10. The salivary estradiol assay has a least detectable dose of 0.1 pg/mL, and intra- and inter-assay coe\u000ecients of variation were 3.43 and 6.01, respectively. Salivary concentrations of progesterone were estimated in duplicate using commercial radioimmunoas- say kits (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Assay procedures were modi ed to accommodate overall lower levels of progesterone in human saliva relative to plasma as follows: (1) standards were diluted to concentrations ranging from 0.05{4.0 ng/mL, and (2) sample volume was increased to 200 \u0016l. The salivary progesterone assay has a least detectable dose of 0.00914 ng/ml, and intra- and inter-assay coe\u000ecients of variation were 4.15 and 5.84, respectively. Salivary concentrations of cortisol were estimated in duplicate using commercial radioimmunoassay kits (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Assay procedures were modi ed to accommodate overall lower levels of cortisol in human saliva relative to plasma as follows: (1) standards were diluted to concentrations ranging from 2.76 to 345 nmol/L, (2) sample volume was increased to 200 \u0016l, and (3) incubation times were extended to 3 h. Serial dilution of samples indicates that the modi ed assay displays a linearity of 0.98 and a detectable dose of 1.3854 nmol/L. Intra- and inter-assay ivcoe\u000ecients of respectively. B.5 Factors A ecting Salivary Hormones As mentioned above, the quality of saliva samples may be compromised by food intake prior to collection. To control for such e ects, we asked subjects in the questionnaire to report whether or not they had lunch today, when they had lunch today, about the time they ate last, what they ate last, about the time they drank last, and what they drank last. From this we construct variables \\When lunch today\" that is zero if lunch was skipped and monotonically increases with the lunch time of the day. Similarly, we construct variables \\Time last eaten\" and \\Time last drank\" that monotonically increase with the time since last eaten (resp. drank). Granger et al. (2004) and Kivlighan et al. (2004) show that salivary testosterone may be increased by blood contamination through microinjuries in the mouth or teeth brushing. Similarly, Kivlighan, Granger, and Schwartz (2005) observed decreased levels of salivary estradiol and increased levels of salivary progesterone due to microinjuries in the mouth or teeth brushing. Kivlighan et al. (2004) found that cortisol is irresponsive to microinjuries in the mouth or teeth brushing. To control for potential blood contamination, we asked subjects in the questionnaire to report on their daily dental care, the last time they brushed their tooth and whether they know of any injuries in their mouth. From this information we construct a dummy variable for \\Mouth injuries\", and variables \\Freq. toothbrush.\" and \\Time last toothbrush.\", respectively. Smoking may impact the endocrine system (Kapoor and Jones, 2005) but the evidence is mixed. Zumo et al. (1990) show an association of smoking on serum levels of progesterone and estradiol but Thomas et al. (1993) were unable to nd signi cant e ects of smoking on salivary progesterone, plasma testosterone, and urinary estradiol. The use of tobacco can a ect salivary testosterone levels (Attia et al., 1989). We don't know whether smoking could change the endocrine system or just measurable levels of salivary hormones. Anyway, we asked in the questionnaire to self-report the frequency of smoking and created a variable \\Smoking\" that is monotonically increasing in the frequency of smoking. As mentioned above the switch to Daylight Saving Time on March 14, 2010, may a ect our data collected on March 15 and 16. Although, we were not able to nd studies analyzing the e ect of Daylight Saving Time on cortisol or other steroid hormones, it is know from Valdez et al. (2003) and Kantermann et al. (2007) that the switch to Daylight Saving Time may a ect the circadian cycle. We created a dummy variable \\Daylight Sav. Time\" that is one for sessions March 15 and 16 and zero otherwise. In the questionnaire (see Appendix E) we collected further information on factors that may a ect salivary hormones. Ellison and Lager (1986) report that moderate recreational running may be associated with lower salivary progesterone levels in females. Thus, we collect information on physical exercise scheduled. Brown et al. (2009) indicate that \\social closeness\" may e ect progesterone. We asked for dating activities, whether students live alone, with family etc. Hooper et al. (2009) report associations between soy consumption and endocrinological factors. While they did not nd an e ect of soy consumption on estradiol, they found signi cantly reduced FSH and LH and increased menstrual cycle length. Our sample contains a large fraction of Asians and soybean protein is relatively common in ethnic asian food. Besides race, we also collect data on dietary preferences. Obesity has been linked to abnormal menstrual cycles and de cient progesterone secretion (Jain et al. 2007). Therefore we collect information on height vand weight. While all those factors may a ect hormones, they may not necessarily a ect the quality of the assays. Thus, we do not include them in the analysis of quality. Yet, the analysis is available from the author on request and can be produced from the datasets and the Stata do- le available from http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/ . In Table 19, we present results from OLS regressions of salivary hormone levels normalized by their standard deviation on above-mentioned variables and session dummies by gender. \\T\", \\E\", \\P\", and \\C\" refer cortisol, respectively. \\F\" and \\M\" refer to female and male, respectively. We use robust standard errors to adjust for potential heteroscedasticity and non-normality. We observe that whenever a variable is signi cant, then the coe\u000ecient is close to zero with four exceptions. Testosterone and cortisol of males (speci cations TM and CM, respectively) where \\`When lunch today\" on average decreases testosterone by 0.07 of its standard deviation and cortisol by 0.13 of its standard deviation, respectively. Moreover, for estradiol in males we nd that the frequency of smoking is positively correlated with salivary estradiol (speci cation EM). Finally, the frequency of brushing teeth is positively correlated with cortisol in males only (speci cation CM). This is somewhat surprising given that Kivlighan et al. (2004) found that cortisol is irresponsive to microinjuries in the mouth or teeth brushing. Some of the variables we used in robustness checks of our results. B.6 Assessing Measurement Errors in Salivary Hormones Measurement error cannot be avoided in salivary hormones measurements. Our results may by downward biased (i.e., attenuation bias). It is possible that our null ndings are due to measurement error. In this section we study to what extent we can use the ex post salivary hormone measures to assess the measurement error of the basal (i.e., rst sample) salivary hormone measures. LetHt idenote the hormone measure of subject iatt= 1;2, wheret= 1 stands for the basal measure and t= 2 for the ex post measure. We assume that the basal measure H1 iis noisy but related to the true underlying hormone level HibyH1 i=Hi+\"1 i, where\"1 iis the measurement error of the basal measure.

Table 20: Regressing Basal on Ex Post Measures and Vice Versa Progesterone (0:0434) Number of 205 R20:4691 0 :4691 0 :6387 ** *** companion paper, Schipper (2014), salivary testosterone and cortisol may respond to events in the auction while we do not expect estradiol or progesterone to respond to events in the auction. If we assume this hypothesis to hold, then for these two hormones we can use the ex post salivary measures to assess the measurement error in the salivary measures of those basal hormones. Table 20 shows the results from regressing basal estradiol on ex post ex post progesterone cation \\P21\"). The coe\u000ecients for estradiol are of very similar magnitude. The coe\u000ecient of ex post progesterone in \\P12\" is slightly smaller than the coe\u000ecient of basal progesterone in \\P21\" suggesting that basal progesterone has a slightly smaller measurement error. We conclude that our measurements of basal estradiol and progesterone do not have larger measurement errors than our ex post measurements. Nevertheless, we emphasize again that some degree of measurement error is unavoidable in endocrinological economics. This may lead to the underestimation of the size of the true association between behavior and hormones. C Further Details on Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal contraceptives may in uence endogenous basal hormone levels. Schultheiss et al. (2003) report that users of oral contraceptives show suppressed levels of salivary testosterone and estradiol. Roughly 25.6% of women in our sample administer hormonal contraceptives. This number is reasonable given the age of women and their ethnic background.23From 21 females using hormonal 23The United States Department of Health and Human Services (2010) estimates that in the US roughly over 11% of asian, hispanic, and black women between 15 to 44 years of age use the pill compared to over 21% of white women. The use of the pill varies also with age. In the age group 15 to 19, it is slightly over 15%, while it increases to 26% in the age group 20 to 24. Note that the mean age of women in our sample is 20.1 years old. Another study, Collins and Hershbein (2011), nds higher percentages of users among college women but that study contains only about 10% of Asian women. The use of hormonal contraceptives is less common in Asian viiicontraceptives, 10 females reported the name of the contraceptive. This enabled us to evaluate their typical administration schedules and active ingredients. Contraceptives can be classi ed into three categories (see Fritz and Spero , 2011, Section III, for an extensive overview): First, there are injections like Depo Provera. This is a long-acting reversible contraceptive acting over 12 weeks containing as the active ingredient only a progestin. Second, there are oral birth control pills. While some of the pills available may contain as the active ingredient a progestin only, all the pills reported in the experiments contained both a progestin as well as ethinyl estradiol. Ethinyl estradiol is not converted into estradiol in the body but can bind to estrogen receptors. There are oral contraceptives that contain the active ingredient for three weeks and an inert ingredient (i.e., placebo) for one week during which a withdrawal bleeding usually occurs (e.g. Avian, Desogen, Junel, Microgestin, Ortho-Tri-Cyclen, Sprintec, and Yasmin). Then there are oral contraceptives that contain the active ingredient for 24 days after which an inert ingredient is taken for 4 days during which withdrawal bleeding usually occurs (e.g. Yaz). For some oral contraceptives like Ortho-Tri-Cyclen, the concentration of active ingredient varies across the cycle (i.e., biphasic or triphasic oral contraceptives). Third, there are extended cycle oral contraceptives that contain an active ingredient for 84 days after which an inert ingredient is used for 7 days during which withdrawal bleeding usually occurs (e.g. Seasonale). Fourth, there is the NuvaRing, a exible vaginal ring that when placed in the vagina releases both a progestin as well as estradiol over a period of three weeks, after which it is removed for a one-week break during which a withdrawal bleeding occurs. Compared to oral contraceptives, whose active ingredients peak about two hours after intake and then decline for the rest of the day, the NuvaRing releases the active ingredients more constantly. Except for Depo Provera, all hormonal contraceptives reported involve a regular break/placebo during which circulating levels of progesterone are expected to be lower than when active ingredients are taken. This break may a ect behavior. Not all women may observe the break but skip the placebo or break in order to avoid the inconvenience of withdrawal bleeding. Di erent hormonal contraceptives contain di erent progestins, and di erent progestins have di erent e ects on the brain. Not all progestins can be converted into the GABA Areceptor{active metabolites (Pluchino et al., 2009). Thus, not all hormonal contraceptives may have the same slight sedating e ect that we alluded to in the main text. While we nd the progesterone-GABA A-sedation explanation for the correlation with the use of hormonal contraceptives quite attractive, we cannot claim a causal e ect since it may be a selection e ect. In particular, women who decide to take hormonal contraceptives may also di er systematically in their bidding behavior from women who decide not to take any hormonal contraceptives. It is not clear whether a priori more risk averse women are more likely to use hormonal contraceptives or whether women with more risky sexual behavior are more likely to take hormonal contraceptives. Conclusive evidence could be obtained in an experiment in which oral contraceptives and a placebo are blindly and randomly assigned to women. Obviously, such an experiment would be rather di\u000ecult to conduct. Moreover, women who would agree to participate in such a \\risky\" experiment may systematically di er in their risk preferences from the rest of the population. women compared to white. ixD Holt-Laury Lottery Task Instructions for the Lottery Experiment Terminal: __ Along with these instructions, you have received two decision sheets. Each of them shows ten decisions listed on the left. Each decision is a paired choice: either \"Option A\" or \"Option B.\" On each sheet, you will make ten choices and record these in the final column, but only one of them from each sheet will be used in the end to determine your earnings. Before you start making your ten choices, please let me ex plain how these choices will affect your earnings for this part of the experiment. There is a tensided die that will be used to determine payoffs in front of your eyes; the faces are num bered from 1 to 10 (the \"0\" face of the die will serve as 10). After you have made all of your choices, we will throw this die twice for each decision sheet, once to select one of the ten decisions of the sheet to be used, and a second time to determine what your payoff is for the option you chose, A or B, for the particular decision selected. Even though you will make ten decisions on each sheet, only one of these from each sheet will end up affecting your earnings, but you will not know in advance which decisions will be used. Obviously, each decision has an equal chance of being used in the end. Now, please look at Decision 1 at the top of the first sheet. Option A yields a sure gain of $3.20 (320 cents), and option B yields a sure gain of $0.20 (20 cents). Next look at Decision 2 in the second row. Op tion A yields $4.00 if the throw of the ten sided die is 1, and it yields $3.20 if the throw is 210. Option B yields $7.70 if the throw of the die is 1, and it yields $0.20 if the throw is 210. The other decisions on the sheet are similar, except that as you move down the table, the chances of the better payoff for each option increase. The second decision sheet is identical to the first one except for one difference: all payoffs are negative. For instance look at Decision 1 at the top of the second sheet. Option A yields a sure loss of $3.20 (minus 320 cents), and option B yields a sure loss of $0.20 (minus 20 cents). Payoffs for this choice are negative and will be subtracted from your previous earnings. To summarize, on each decision sheet you will make ten choices: for each decision row you will have to choose between Option A and Option B. You may choose A for some decision rows and B for other rows, and you may change your decisions and make them in any order. When you are finished, we will come to your desk and collect both decision sheets. Then the market experiment will be run. After the market experiment we will throw the tensided die for each decision sheet to select which of the ten Decisions will be used. Then we will throw the die again for each decision sheet to determine your payoff for the Option you chose for that Decision. Payoffs for your choices and will be added/subtracted to/from your previous earnings from the market experiment, and you will be paid the sum of all earnings in cash when we finish. So now please look at the empty boxes on the right side of the record sheet. You will have to write a decision, A or B in each of these boxes, and then the die throw will determine which one is going to count. We will look at the decision that you made for the choice that counts, and circle it, before throw ing the die again to determine your earnings for this part. Then you will write your earnings in the blank at the bottom of the page. Please note that these gains/losses will be added/subtracted to/from your previous earnings up to now. Are there any questions? Now you may begin making your choices. Please do not talk with anyone while we are doing this; raise your hand if you have a question. x Terminal: ___ Session No.: _______________ Decision Sheet (Gains) Option A Option B Your Choice A or B Decision 1 $3.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 Decision 2 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 $3.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 $0.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 Decision 3 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $3.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $0.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 Decision 4 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $3.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $0.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 Decision 5 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $3.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $0.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 Decision 6 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 5 $3.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 5 $0.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 Decision 7 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 6 $3.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 6 $0.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 Decision 8 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 7 $3.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 7 $0.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 Decision 9 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 8 $3.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 8 $0.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 Decision 10 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 9 $3.20 if throw of die is 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 9 $0.20 if throw of die is 10 Decision used: ___________ Die throw: _____ Your Terminal: ___ Session No.: _______________ Decision Sheet (Losses) Option A Option B Your Choice A or B Decision 1 -$3.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 $0.20 if throw of die is 1 to 10 Decision 2 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 $3.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 $0.20 if throw of die is 2 to 10 Decision 3 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $3.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 or 2 $0.20 if throw of die is 3 to 10 Decision 4 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $3.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 3 $0.20 if throw of die is 4 to 10 Decision 5 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $3.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 4 $0.20 if throw of die is 5 to 10 Decision 6 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 5 $3.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 5 $0.20 if throw of die is 6 to 10 Decision 7 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 6 $3.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 6 $0.20 if throw of die is 7 to 10 Decision 8 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 7 $3.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 7 $0.20 if throw of die is 8 to 10 Decision 9 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 8 $3.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 8 $0.20 if throw of die is 9 or 10 Decision 10 $4.00 if throw of die is 1 to 9 $3.20 if throw of die is 10 $7.70 if throw of die is 1 to 9 $0.20 if throw of die is 10 Decision used: ___________ Die throw: _____ Your earnings on this sheet: _________ xiiE Questionnaire SURVEY (collected on the subject's computer terminal) We are interested in whether there is a correlation between participants' bidding behavior and some sociopsychological and biological factors.
