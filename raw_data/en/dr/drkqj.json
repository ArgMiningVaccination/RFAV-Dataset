BSN, CPN, NEA-BC Emily PhD PhD Adapted from: \"Implementing an Autism-Friendly Vision Clinic\" (2022) Barrett, Carissa Weaver, Roseann Schaaf *In partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Doctorate in Occupational Therapy 3 Purpose The purpose of this manual is to provide evidence-based strategies and resources to help healthcare providers implement a sensory-friendly vaccine clinic for autistic persons. Autistic individuals demonstrate unique sensory differences that can impact their ability to participate in healthcare experiences, including vaccine administrations. Sensory supports can increase an autistic person's ability to successfully receive a vaccine. The following resources are provided to guide clinicians through identifying a child's unique sensory needs and preferences, selecting appropriate sensory strategies accordingly, and implementing those strategies throughout a vaccine clinic.

References 4 Why is a Sensory-Friendly Vaccine Clinic Needed? Sensory Features of Autism Many individuals with autism experience sensory features. Examples of sensory features include hyper-reactivity, hypo-reactivity, and difficulties with sensory integration. Sensory features of ASD can strongly influence an autistic individual's behavior and participation in healthcare and other daily activities (Schaaf & Lane, 2015). For more information on the sensory features of autism and the sensory systems, complete the training modules developed for this projection. See Procedures for Implementation of a Sensory-Friendly Vaccine Clinic on page 6 for more information and to access the training modules. Hyper-reactivityAn individual who is hyper-reactive exhibits intense or exaggerated reactions to sensory stimuli that others may not notice (Schaaf & Lane, 2015; Schaaf & Mailloux, 2015). When an individual who is hyper-reactve experiences a sensation, they may show signs of stress or have a negative reaction (Schaaf & Lane, 2015). For example, someone who is hyper-reactive to auditory input may cover their ears in response to certain sounds. Someone who is hyper-reactive to tactile input may express discomfort when wearing certain fabrics or may become agitated when touched by someone or something. Hypo-reactivityAn individual who is hypo-reactive does not react or exhibits reduced reactions to sensory stimuli (Schaaf & Lane, 2015; Schaaf & Mailloux, 2015). Individuals who are hypo-reactive often display sensory-seeking behaviors because they require more sensory input than that provided by their environment for self-regulation (Schaaf & Mailloux, 2015). For example, someone who is hypo-reactive may spin, jump, rock back and forth, chew on objects, or feel the objects/surfaces around them as a way of increasing their sensory input. Increased sensory stimulation provides hypo-reactive individuals with comfort and helps with self-regulation. Difficulties with Sensory IntegrationSensory integration refers to the processing, management, and organization of sensory information from the body and environment (Schaaf & Lane, 2015; Schaaf & Mailloux, 2015). Individuals with ASD often have difficulty managing multiple senses simultaneously (Schaaf & Lane, 2015). For example, an individual may have difficulty following verbal instructions while looking at something because they have trouble integrating the information coming from their visual system and their auditory system simultaneously. 5 Benefits of Sensory-Friendly Clinics Autism and Healthcare Experiences: Healthcare visits can be both physically and psychologically stressful for autistic children for a variety of reasons (Sadatsafavi et al., 2015). Autistic children are more inflexible than neurotypical children and disturbances to their routines can cause a sudden increase in anxiety (Amorim et al., 2020). A healthcare visit breaks a child's daily routine which can cause distress and lead to negative behaviors (Bultas et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2019). Bright lights, loud and unfamiliar sounds, long wait times and crowded waiting rooms, encounters with strangers, unfamiliar smells, use of unfamiliar objects or tools, fast-paced encounters, and uncomfortable tactile sensations can lead to overstimulation during the healthcare visit (Bultas et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2019; Sadatsafavi et al., 2015). How to Make Healthcare Experiences More Sensory-Friendly: Research assessing the effects of sensory adaptations within healthcare environments have found that making healthcare encounters more sensory-friendly improves the experiences of autistic children and make visits more productive (Bultas et al., 2016; Sadatsafavi et al., 2022). Clinics can be made more sensory-friendly for autistic patients by modifying the clinic environment, making alterations to the care delivery processes, changing the behavior of healthcare providers, and offering sensory supports and preparatory materials (Bultas et al., 2016; Sadatsafavi et al., 2022). Clinic EnvironmentAvoid excessive light, noise, and clutterRemove clutter from waiting areas and treatment roomsPrevent crowded waiting rooms and minimize wait times through appropriate scheduling Behavior of Healthcare ProvidersAdapt communication based on the patient's preferences/needs (ex. speak softly)Minimize the number of staff members interacting with patients Materials and SupportsOffer sensory toys and itemsProvide social stories and/or educational handouts. Methods Used to Make Clinics Sensory-Friendly 6 Role of Occupational Therapy Practitioners Occupational therapy (OT) practitioners improve a client's ability to complete daily tasks, also known as \"occupations,\" using their unique understanding of how an individual, tasks, and environment influence participation (AOTA, 2020). OT practitioners are also recognized for their knowledge of the sensory systems and their ability to address an individual's sensory needs to promote participation in activities (AOTA, 2020). Thus, OT practitioners can support a sensory-friendly vaccine clinic in many ways as described below: Identify the sensory needs and sensory preferences of each patient through the analysis of survey responses and/or conversations with patients and caregivers and recommend sensory tools and strategies Administer pre-clinic surveys to prepare personalized sensory adaptations for each patient Administer post-clinic surveys to assess patient satisfaction with the clinic and question participants on how the clinic protocol can be improved Assess caregiver satisfaction and value of sensory adaptations after participation in the clinic Serve as a liaison between families and clinic staff to summarize the sensory survey responses and reiterate any noteworthy comments from conversations with families Recommend sensory modifications to the clinic environment Develop resources for families, such as educational handouts and social stories to help caregivers prepare their children for the vaccine clinic prior to arrival Support caregivers and patients within the vaccination room by providing sensory adaptations and supports for the duration of the visit If OT practitioners are not available at your clinic, consider identifying a local university's OT program or reaching out to OT students. OT students may be available to volunteer at your clinic or your clinic may be a potential fieldwork site for clinical education. 7 Procedures for Implementation of a Sensory -Friendly Vaccine Clinic 1. Complete asynchronous training modules on the sensory features of autism In preparation for the vaccine clinic, the medical assistants/nurses who will be administering the vaccines will complete a series of training modules designed to help professionals understand the sensory systems and the sensory features of autism. The training consists of 5 modules and offers an overview of autism spectrum disorder, describes sensory response patterns, and offers a look into how the sensory systems can impact healthcare visits. The training takes approximately 40 minutes to complete. Click HERE to access the training modules. 2. Schedule the vaccine clinic It is best to schedule the clinic 4 weeks in advance to allow time for pre-clinic activities. The vaccine being administered and the frequency of scheduled clinics may vary. For example, weekly clinics may be appropriate during flu season. Schedule your clinic on a date and time when the clinic is less busy to minimize wait times and to prevent families from feeling rushed when they are called for their vaccination. 3. Recruit patients Identify autistic patients in your clinic or community who would benefit from a sensory-friendly clinic. Patient recruitment sites can include online forums, pediatric clinics/pediatrician's offices, schools, and local hospitals. A recruitment period of 1 month prior to the clinic date is recommended. Methods of recruitment can include (but are not limited to) flyers, emails, and phone calls. See Appendix B to view a recruitment flyer used for a previously conducted vaccine clinic. 4. Schedule patients for the clinic Scheduling vaccination times in advance is important for a sensory-friendly clinic as it minimized wait times and helps to maintain a calm clinic environment. Inform patients that they may come early if they expect that they will need time transitioning to the clinic environment. 5. Complete pre-clinic survey The pre-clinic survey is administered to the caregivers of patients prior to the vaccine clinic via internet or phone interview by clinic staff or by OT practitioners. If the patient is unable to complete the survey in advance, it can be completed on the clinic date upon their arrival and check-in. 6. Prepare the clinic environment It is imperative that the clinic environment and all materials are prepared prior to the start of the clinic. The waiting and exam rooms should be clean and free of clutter and unnecessary equipment. The sensory tools and materials should be organized for easy access and cleaning materials should be readily available so that the tools can be disinfected after each use. The surveys and other documents should be ready prior to patient arrival (ensure QR codes are working, have printed copies available). Finally, meet with the clinic team to discuss the clinic protocol and the roles of all personnel involved (occupational therapists, medical assistants/nurses, desk staff, etc.) 8 Vaccine Clinic Day 3-4 hours is an appropriate amount of time for a vaccine clinic although the time will vary based on the number of participants and each sites individual needs. Allot approximately 30 minutes before and after the clean for preparation and clean up. During Check-inWhen the patient arrives at their scheduled time, check the patient in and write their ticket number on the top of their To-Do List (see Appendix E).Point out the ticket number on the form to the patient and explain that they will enter their ticket number on the Pre-Clinic and Post-Clinic Surveys.If the patient did not complete the Pre-Clinic Survey in advance, instruct them to complete it by scanning the QR code or provide them with a paper copy.Direct the patient to the waiting area and instruct them to wait for their name to be calledWhile the patient waits, the OTs at the clinic will use the information from the Pre-Clinic Survey to develop sensory adaptations for the patient.Prior to calling the patient's name, the OTs will meet with the medical assistants/nurses to summarize the patient's sensory needs. They will provide them with methods of keeping the patient calm and comfortable during the vaccination. During an AppointmentThe patient's name will be called when their vaccine and sensory adaptations are ready to minimize wait-time in the designated vaccination area.The OT who reviewed the patient's Pre-Clinic Survey and developed the patient's sensory adaptations will accompany the medical assistant/nurse into the vaccination area.During the vaccination (and waiting period if required for the vaccine), the OT will provide the paitent with sensory supports.During Check-outDirect the patient to the check-out area after receiving their vaccine.Ask the patient to complete the Post-Clinic Survey when they enter the waiting area. Explain that the Post-Clinic Survey is designed to assess their satisfaction with the sensory-friendly clinic and that they are encouraged to provide feedback and recommendations so that the clinic can be improved for the future.Clean and disinfect all sensory items between patients. 9 Appendix The following resources may be downloaded and customized to serve the specific needs of your clinic.
