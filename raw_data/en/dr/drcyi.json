In this study, comparative proteome analy sis of the secreted fractions of MTBVAC and its M. tuberculosis parental strain Mt103 was performed through WesternBlot and fluorescence twodimensional di fference gel electrophoresis (Di GE) techniques. Two protein datasets preferentially expressed either on MTBVAC or M t103 were obtained. These results allowed us to show the higher secretion of the Tw in Arginine Translocation (TAT) secretory system substrates in MTBVAC and t o confirm the complete absence of the virulenc e factors ESAT6 and CFP10 fro m its secretome. Intracellular trafficking of MTB VAC was the other aspect of the interaction with the host to be studied. Being MTBVAC a double phoP and fadD26 mutant, the individual contribution of each mutation to the final phenotype was also a matter of study. Infections with the correspondent GFPexpressing strains were p erformed in two different cell models: a cell line of mouse alveolar macrophage s (MHS) and human macrophages derived from monocyt es (hMDM), and the results were a n a l y z e d through microscopy techniques. Results obtained suggest that MT BVAC, as an attenuated strain, is not able to arrest phagosomal maturation at early stages of the process, but it does arrest the m aturation before the mycobacte rialcontaining phagosome evolves to a lysosomal stage. This strategy prevents MTBVAC to be degraded in the phagolysosome. Ne vertheless impaired ESAT6 and CFP10 secretion in MTBVAC does not allow it to escape to the cytosol, presentin g a persistence phenotype in which MTBVAC is \"t rapped\" in a late endosome. The individual phoP and fadD26 m u t a t i o n s o f M T B V A C a r e p r e d i c t e d t o h a v e a s y n e r g i s t i c e f f e c t o n t h e intracellular trafficking phenotype of the vaccine candidate. The second objective was the exha ustive study of the PhoP regul on in order to attempt to determine the signal modulating its expression. To achieve t his objective, two different approaches were applie d : i ) t o s t u d y t h e e x p r e s s i o n o f different PhoPSummary 6 regulated genes through a reporter system based on genetic fusi ons of PhoPregulated promoters to the GFP protein, ii) to directly measure the expre ssion of the selected PhoPregulated genes through RNA extraction and qRTPCR techniq ues. In both cases, the wildtype strain H37Rv and its phoP mutant were exposed to the intracellular environment either through in vitro culture conditions mimicking it (acidic pH, ions, temperatures, hypoxia, etc.) or after infection of phagocytic a nd nonphagocytic cells. The pks2 promoter was chosen to be the most representative reporter of t he PhoP regulon activity, demonstrating the relevant role of low pH to activate the PhoP regulon. None of the conditions suggests an exclusive signal ac tivating the PhoP regulon, insinuating that it is a multifactorial event occurrin g during the entrance of the bacteria inside the macropha ge; nevertheless, the response of the regulon when exposed to acid pH demonstrates that it is a key factor in the induction of PhoP regulated genes. Based on our results, a timedependent express ion of the different genes at different times postinfection was suggested. The firs t genes activated by PhoP are those related with lipid metabolism and oxidative stre ss, probably to protect bacteria against new stresses inside the phagosome. Secondly, a fter 35 days, genes related with the ESX1 secretory system are upregulated and con sequently, ESAT6 and CFP10 are secreted, inducing the phagosomal rupture and the es cape of the bacteria to the cytosol. In the successive time points, Mcr7 ncRNA becam es highly induced, inhibiting the TAT secretory sys tem, and consequently restricti ng the secretion of components from the Antigen 85 complex in order to \"hide\" from the host response in its new cytosolic location. This mechanism would allow virulent mycobacteria to overcome the immune control fav oring bacterial dissemination. A third objective of this thesis was to construct an hyperatte nuated vaccine based on MTBVAC to be used in individuals in risk of immunosuppression w here BCG vaccination in not indicated. A third mutation in the zmp1 (Rv0198c) gene was introduced in the vaccine strain MTBVAC (live attenuated strain with deletions in genes phoP and fadD26) in order to hyperattenuate this strain maintaining protectio n against tuberculosis. Using a double recombination strategy was possibl e to generate a triple mutant in genes phoP, fadD26 and zmp1. Preliminary results show that the triple Summary 7 m u t a n t d i d n o t i m p r o v e t h e a t t e n u a t i o n , t h e i m m u n o l o g i c a l r e s p o nse or the protection when compared with MTBVAC; further studies in the gu inea pig model are necessary to gain any conclusion.

Summary 12 Introduction 13 Introduction Introduction 14 Introduction 15 In 2014, tuberculosis (TB) ranked alongside Human Immunodeficie ncy Virus (HIV) as a leading cause of death from an infectious agent worldwide. Nowa days, 9.6 million people are estimated to have fallen ill with TB and 1.5 million died in 2014 (including 0.4 million deaths among HIVposit ive people) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. This pla gue affects virtually every nat ion and every ethnicity. T B i s c a u s e d b y Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and usually attacks the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect almost any organ (extrapulm onary TB). The pathogen is extremely well adapted to humans and its success co uld be due to its ability to persist for years inside the host [2]. However most of the infection cases will not develop into disease; asymptomatic, latent infection is the most common. About one in ten of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease, which, if untreated, kills more than half of its victims. 1. HISTORY OF TUBERCULOSIS. Tuberculosis is the greatest human killer in history; taking on ly the past two centuries into account, TB was responsible for the deaths of approximatel y one billion human b e i n g s [ 2 , 3 ] . I t i s p r e s u m e d t h a t a n e a r l y p r o g e n i t o r o f M t b w as probably contemporaneous and coevolved w ith early hominids in East Afri ca, three million years ago [4]. Signs of the disease have also been found in Egy ptian mummies dated between 3000 and 2400 BC and it appears that Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti both died from TB [5]. Mycobacterial DNA was detected in some pathol ogy skeletal lesions in Egyptian and Peruvian mummies dating back to 5001500 BC, an d also in a human skeleton from the Iron Age (400 230 BC) found in the United Kin gdom [6]. TB has also been called consumption , because it seemed to consume people from within, with a bloody cough, fever, pallor, and a long relentle ss wasting. Hippocrates, around 460 BC, used the term \"phthisis\" (from the Greek phthiein, meaning \"to waste away\") to describe the most widespread disease of the times [7] . Although Aristotle Introduction 16 believed that the disease might be contagious, many of his cont emporaries believed it to be hereditary [8]. It is believed that Europe became the epicenter of many TB epid emics from the 16th and 17th century due to the growing population expansion, the industria lization and the development of large urban settlements. TB was supposed to be an incurable disease and it was called \" The Great White Plague \" or the \" White death \" because sufferers appear markedly pale. Death by TB was considered inev itable, being the principal cause of death in 1650. The high population density a s well as the poor sanitary conditions that characterized most European and North American cities created a perfect environment for the propagation of the diseas e. The epidemic reached its peak in Europe in the first half of the 19th century, and it is estimated that as many as one quarter of Europeans died of TB at this time [7] . In diseas e [5, 8]. He was a young student affected by TB when his physician advised him to seek a healthier climate, so he spent some time in the Himalayas and came back h ome cured. This e x p e r i e n c e m o v e d h i m t o b u i l d t h e f i r s t s a n a t o r i u m , p l a c e s w h e r e patients were exposed to fresh air and healthy nutrition. Sanatoriums, founde d throughout Europe and the United States, provided a dual function: to isolate the sick people from the general population, and to force the patients to rest, thus ass isting the healing process. In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin demonstrated that TB was transmi tted from humans to cattle and from cattle to rabbits. In the light of this revolut ionary evidence, he postulated that a specific micr oorganism caused the disease [8] . On March 24th 1882, Robert Koch made his famous presentation \"The etiology o f TB\". He demonstrated the infectious n ature of TB and described Mtb t hanks to the new techniques developed by him, nota bly specific staining techniqu es and special solid culture media. The studies of Koch fulfilled in a paradigmatic manner the criteria named after him, the Koch's postulates. These comprise identifi cation of the pathogen Introduction 17 in affected tissue, growth of single clones of the pathogen in vitro, and establishment of a similar disease in experimental animals by means of the pu re culture [9]. Once Mtb had been identified Koch's next step was to find a cur e for the disease. Eight years later Koch announced the discovery of a vaccine against T B consisting of glycerol extracts of pure cultures of tubercle bacilli. The vaccine cand idate was assayed in a clinical trial with disastrous results but in 1908, Charles Man toux found that it was an effective intradermic test for diagnosing TB [9]. With Edward Jenner's successful invention, showing that infecti on with cowpox confered immunity against small pox in humans, many doctors pla ced their hopes on the use of Mycobacterium bovis (the agent that causes bovine TB) for the development of a vaccine against human TB. In 1908 Albert Calmette and Cami lle Gu\u00e9rin started the development of a vaccine against TB. They isolated M. bovis from a dead cow and for the next 13 years, grew every fortnight a new batch of bacteria in a solution of beef bile and potato. After 230 serial passages, the bacteria lost t heir ability to cause disease, but were still capable of stimulating the immune syste m to protect mice, pigs, guinea pigs and monkeys from TB. The attenuated strain was call ed Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin or BCG and it was first administered to humans in 1921. A total of 8 million babies and nearly 14 million people were given the BCG vaccine in the International TB Campaign, which ran through 1951. Since then, more than a billi on people have been vaccinated with BCG [10]. Then, in 1943 during the World War II, Selman A. Waksman who ha d been working for decades to find an effective antibiotic against TB, finally succeeded. Streptomycin, a compound with antibiotic activity, was purified from Streptomyces griseus . When this therapy was used in TB patients a considerable improvement was observed. A rapid succession of antiTB drugs appeared in the following years: pa raaminosalicylic acid (PAS, 1949), isoniazid (INH, 1952) , pyrazinamide (PAZ, 1954), e thambutol (EMB, 1962) and rifampicin (RIF, 1963). Unfortunately, this initial optimis m was soon tempered by the development of the first resistant strains to antiTB drugs . However, it was soon Introd 18 demo this p 1.

The most common methods for TB diagnosis worldwide are sputum s mear microscopy and the Mantoux tuberculin skin test. These methods are simple, inexpensive and quick, but their main drawbacks are low specificity and sensiti vity. It is necessary to carry out more tests such as chest radiography, Interferon Gamm a Release Assays (IGRAs), and culturing, m the infection with Mtb [15]. Diagnosing TB using culture involves the identification of Mtb by biochemical tests [16], which is important to get successful treatment in drugresistant TB patients. Early identification of people with symptomatic TB not only all ows therapy to be administered before serious lung damage occurs, but also helps to prevent the spread of the bacteria to other susceptible people. For this purpose, there are several new diagnostic technologies under development [17]. Drug treatment is the only effective therapy for TB. Drugs are classified into three groups based on evidence of effi cacy, potency a nd experience of use [18]. Firstline antiTB drugs are the most effective and widely used drugs for the treatment of drugsusceptible TB (which is not drug resistant). Secondline antiTB drugs are reserved for resistant bacilli to firstline therapy. A drug may be classed as secondline instead of firstline for being less effective (e.g. paraaminosalicylic acid), having toxic sideeffects (e.g. cycloser ine) or being effective, but unavailable in many developing countries ( e.g. fluoroquinolones). Thirdline antiTB drugs are char acterized for not being very e ffective (e.g. clarithromycin) or because their efficacy has not been proven ( e.g. clofazimine). With appropriate antibiotic treatment, around 90% of HIVnegati ve patients with drug susceptible TB can be cured in 6 months using a combination of RIF, INH, PAZ and EMB for 2 months, followed by a fourmonth continuation phase of RI F and INH. The main reason for prescribing this combination of medicines in the tre atment of TB is because the likelihood of the emergence of MDR bacteria is virtually im possible [19], apart Introduction 20 from the fact that the distinct antiTB drugs have different mo des of action: INH is bactericidal against replicating bacteria; EMB is bacteriostati c at low doses, but is used in TB treatment at higher, bactericidal doses; RIF is bacterici dal and has a sterilizing effect; and PAZ is only weakly bactericidal, but is very effect ive against bacteria located in acidic environments, inside macrophages, or in areas of acut e inflammation. 3. BIOLOGY OF M. tuberculosis. 3.1. General characteristics of the bacillus. Mtb is an acidfast, rodshape and aerobe bacterium belonging t o the family the suborder Corynebacterineae , is not classified as either Grampositive or Gramnegative since it gives the appearance of \"ghost\" cells when it is Gram stained [21]. Pheno typically it is a catalase and nitrate reductase positive, nonmotile and nonspore formin g bacillus of 25 m in width. Mtb is a slowgrowing mycobacteria with a generation tim e of approximately 1520 hours. It takes 4 weeks to get visual colonies on solid m edium. In smears made from in vitrogrown colonies, chains of cells often form distinctive serpent ine cords, this phenomenon is called cording, and it is associated to viru lent strains of the bacterium. 3.2. Genetics of M. tuberculosis. The complete genome sequence of the bestcharacterized strain o f Mtb, H37Rv [22], was obtained in 1998 [23] and it is in continuous revision sinc e then [24]. The genomic sequence consists of 4.411.529 base pairs (bp), with an unusual G+C (guanine plus cytosine) content of 65.6%. Approximately 91% pre sents coding capacity; the last reannotation identified 4,110 genes though to encode 4,018 proteins and 80 stable RNAs.

The mycobacterial envelope is un ique, both in molecular composi t io n a n d i n t h e architectural arrangement of its constituents. Its complex stru cture consists of a plasma membrane surrounded by a complex cell wall of peptidogly can (PG) and arabinogalactan (AG) to which an outer membrane or mycomembrane is attached, which is in turn enveloped by an outer layer called \"capsule\". Between the plasma membrane and the PG there is a periplasmic space. The plasma me mbrane does not seem to differ from other biological plasma membranes and it is composed mainly of anionic phospholipids in a bilayer arrangement with proteins [2 6]. The \"cell wall skeleton\" consists of covalently linked PG, AG and mycolic acid s, and it defines the shape of the mycobacterial cell. The mycomembrane consist of an asymmetric lipid bilayer with its inner leaflet made of the long chain (C60C90) mycolic acids residues covalently attached to the cell wall AG, and an outer leaflet c onstituted with non covalently intercalating glycolipids, waxy components and prote ins [2729]. The capsule is mainly composed of polysaccharides, proteins and sma ll amounts of lipids, and it is considered to have a different molecular composition in pathogenic and non pathogenic species [30]. The outermost layer is visible in conv entional electron m i c r o s c o p y p r e p a r a t i o n s o n l y w h e n c u l t u r e s h a v e b e e n g r o w n i n d etergent free medium (Figure 3) [31]. Noncovalently attached glycolipids are important components of the mycomembrane outer leaflet. Among them can be found trehalose dimycolates (T DM), often referred as phos phatidylinositol mannosides (PI Ms) 3). Figure The m of th enve bacte confe show down 4 TB pulm osteo wn 4.

Life inside the macrophages. Mtb is an obligate intracellular pathogen widely adapted to sur vive within the human macrophages. Phagocytosis provides an effective initial barrier a g a i n s t i n f e c t i o n ; mycobacterial entrance is mediated by specific macrophage recep tors, and a pro inflammatory response, that leads to recruitment of mononuclear c e l l s f r o m neighboring blood vessels, is induced [34], triggering granulom a formation [35]. The granuloma contains the infection but does not eliminate Mtb. Ov er time, the granuloma becomes a stratified lesion which includes bloodderi ved infected and uninfected macrophages, foamy rophages, epithelioid cells (u niquely differentiated macrophages), and multinucleated giant cells (La ngerhans cells), B and T lymphocytes, and fibroblasts [36]. In many lesions these cell p opulations are separated by a fibrous layer of extrace llular matrix (Figure 4) [37]. The main function of the granuloma is to localize and contain M tb while concentrating the immune response to a limited area. Thanks to this strategy 90% of infected individuals defeat the disease or are successful in controlling TB (latent TB) [35]. People with latent TB are still infected but are noninfectious and asymptomatic. However, in 10% of the cases, when the host immune status chang es as consequence of aging, malnutrition, stress, cancer, immunosuppressive drugs or coinfection with HIV among other factors, this situation leads to active disease in which the centre of the granuloma becomes necrotic, liquefies (caseous necrosis), a nd viable bacilli can be released and spread to the lung, other parts of the body and th e atmosphere (Figure 4) [36].

There is considerable evidence that Mtb cell wall lipids act as virulence factors during infection [4650]. Mtb lipids have been observed to intercalate into host membranes leading to decreased membrane fluidity and increased passive pe rmeability [51]. The ability of mycobacterial PDIM and TDMs to alter host membrane f luidity may influence the process of phagocytosis as well as subsequent trafficking. PDIM also constitute a potential candidate for modulating the initial step of entry in to macrophages and for controlling the outcome of bacterial infection; it has been dem onstrated that PDIM production in Mtb contributes to the initial growth of the baci llus in mice by protecting it from the nitric oxidedependent killing of macrophages and m odulating the production of key inflammatory cytokines such as TNF [52]. The mycobacterial analog to the phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate (PI3P), blocks the host PI3P altering [54]. has been described as modulating phagosomelysosome fusion [55, 56] and the cytokine responses of human phagocytes [57]. DAT and PAT li pids also participate in early interactions between Mtb and phagocytes [52, 58]. The use of transposon raries in combination with diff erent in vivo screening methods has allowed the identification of mycobacterial virulen ce genes, and factors, whose role in virulence is clear. For example, the nucleoside d iphosphate kinase Ndk [59] and the phosphatase the maturation o f the mycobacterial containing phagosome; but also enzymes such as AhpC, SodC, KatG ant Tpx which contribute to the detoxification of ROI and RNI [60, 61]; or is ocitrate lyase enzyme, essential for the metabolism of fatty acids [62]. It has also b een demonstrated that many of these mutants present altered intracellular trafficking [56, 58, 63], which is consistent with all the facts mentioned before. Introduction 28 A great variety of secreted and cell wallassociated proteins h as been demonstrated to play a key role in bacterial survival and immune modulation in the host. For example, ESAT6 is secreted in the early stages of Mtb infection, induce s strong cell mediated and humoral immune responses [64] and facilitates the access an d/or translocation of SAT6, encoded in the region of difference1 (RD1) gene cluster, plays a key role in this process [66, 68, 69]. The Ag85 complex (Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C) is the major sec reted protein constituent of mycobacterial cell culture, and contributes to t he biosynthesis of TMM and TDM [61]. drrC and mmpL7, take part in the biosynthesis or transport of PDIM, a major virulenc e factor of Mtb, in particular during the early step of infection when bacilli enco unter host macrophages [61]. The bacterium also needs intermediate metabolism and nutrient u ptake as it has to face hostile, nutrientdeprived environment during infection, l ike the biosynthesis of purines bacterial survival in vivo. However, adaptation to environmental stimuli in bacteria is mediated primarily through the expressio n of transcriptional regulators, including serinethre onine protein toplasmic function factors, signal transduction systems. These s trategies allow Mtb to prevent elimination and survive during the initial stages of infection. The course of infection during later stages is mainly determined by the state of the host immune system. 4.2. Twocomponent signal tran sduction systems (TCSs). The number of systems present in a given organism generally cor relates with its genome size and the complexity o f the environment(s) in which t he bacterium typically resides. TCSs have been shown to regulate many physiological p rocesses, including sporulation, competence, antibio tic resistance, stationary virule syste Cons virule TCSs (SK), Figure result in the conse bindin and a the RR The prote kinasence, and erial surviv ems attract i sistent with ence atten u as its na m placed in t SK and R R enting inte r ure 6) [76]. e 6.

Once this residue is phosphorylated, it i nteracts with the receiver domain. Consequently, there is a conformational change in the R R which allows the DNA binding domain of the RR to interact with the DNA of the ch romosome (Figure 6). Mtb is an intracellular pathogen subjected to numerous stimuli and stresses once into eukaryotic cells. To face this particular environment, Mtb enco des approximately 11 genetically linked TCSs, five o rphan RRs and two orphan SKs. Th e number of intact TCSs is lower than typically found in other bacteria of similar geno m e s i z e , p o s s i b l y reflecting the evolution if this bacterium as a strict human pa thogen and its adaptation to a predominantly intra cellular lifestyle [76]. 4.2.1. TCS PhoP/PhoR . One of essential in Mtb viru lence [77]; ( phoP) and Rv0758 ( phoR), these genes are transcribed in operon although the phoR gene may also be expressed under the influence on its own promoter [78]. DNA footprinting studies have demonstrated t hat PhoP binds upstream phoP gene controlling the operon expression [78] recognizing two di rect repeats (DR) of 9bp upstream the transcription starting point [ 79, 80]. These DRs have also been found upstream several genes: pks2, pks3, lipF and fadD21 [80] identifying it as a possible consensus sequence for PhoP binding to DNA. PhoP binding to DNA has been demonstrated to occur due to a conformational change upon phosphorylation of Asp71 [9, 81, 82], that promote s the protein dimerization and DNA binding stability. Structure of PhoP DNA binding domain has been resolved presenti ng typical fold of attenuated, Mtb strain, H37Ra presents a point mutation in the DNA binding doma in that inhibits most part of the affinity of the domain for the DR region affecting gene expression of PhoP regulated genes [85, 86]; this mutation can explain the attenua tion of H37Ra due to a malfunction down with DosT using dorm well dor m Figure RelevP has been ome of Mt iration (Fig u 2) and PAT or the nit r ants, also p genes dosRS it is likel nstream by RST is a TC S DosR and T is sensin g g m i c r o a r r a mancy [90, 9 as dosR and mancy medi e 7.

Adapted from [88]. There are also many genes of the ESX1 secretion system (respon sible for secretion by PhoP regulati on (Figure 7) [88]; being EspR, the responsible regulation of ESAT6 secretion, itself PhoPregulated [93]. A synergistic effect of both transcriptional regulators o ver the operon espACD in order to activate its expression and, ultimately essential for a correct secretion of ESAT6 and CFP10 has been recently described [94, 95]. It has also been shown that a phoP mutation impairs ESAT6 secretion in the bacteria whereas it d oes not impair ESAT6 production, the same pheno type has been observed in H37R a [96]. PhoP implications in virulence have been demonstrated by severa l lines of evidence: i) A XDR M. bovis carrying an IS 6110 c o p y u p s t r e a m phoP w h i c h a c t s a s a s t r o n g promoter, caused a TB outbreak in Spain [97, 98], ii) a phoP insertion mutant presents attenuation in replication experiments within phagocytic cells [77, 87, 99] and it is also attenuated compared to the wild type strain in animal models, i ncluding mice, guinea pigs and macaques [100, 101]. Taken together all these evidence s, PhoP virulence implications and phoP mutant attenuation, a new vaccine candidate, MTBVAC, based on a phoP deletion has been constructed at the University of Zaragoza [1 02]. Introduction 33 5. VACCINES. 5.1. BCG, the current vaccine. Currently, the only commercial vaccine licensed to use against TB is M. bovis Bacillus CalmetteGu\u00e9rin (BCG). It is a live attenuated strain obtained in 1921 by subcultivation of a virulent strain of M. bovis during 13 years by 230 consecutive passages in the laboratory. This process resulte d in the deletion of a number o f regions (RD regions) implicated in many cellular process including virulence factors . BCG has lost more than 100 genes and chromosomal regions being an attenuated strain un able to induce disease but stimulating the immune response [103]. The most des cribed deleted region implicated in virulence is RD1, containing the ESX1 clu ster, which includes the genes esxA(Rv3875) and esxB (Rv3874), encoding for the virulence factors ESAT6 and CFP10 respectively, as well as genes coding for proteins direc tly involved in their secretion [104]. A deletion of this region in H37Rv results in attenuation [105] of the strain, but complementation of RD1 in BCG Pasteur does not rest ore full virulence [106]. BCG is able to protect against the most severe forms of TB in c hildren, like tuberculous meningitis and miliary its efficacy against pulmonary TB , the transmissible form of the disease, is variable with protection ratios from 80% in developed countries to 0% in some developing countries [107]. The causes of the diverg ence in protection are still unknown; exposure to enviro nmental mycobacteria has been proposed to explain it, preexposed mice with nonpathogenic mycobacteria inhibit B CG replication before the vaccination immune response is fully developed [108]. These evidences together with the fact that regions were BCG barely confers protection, such as Mali or Malawi, are those where there is more exposition to these environmental m y c o b a c t e r i a support this theory [108]. Since the first BCG strain was obtained in 1921, it has suffere d numerous passages resulting in a number of different BCG substrains (Figure 8) th a t d i f f e r i n g e n e expression, levels of production of surface proteins and immuno dominant antigens Introd nd higher p e differen c ween zone s trains licen s ]. e 8.

Other strategy is based on construction reco mbinant strains of BCG (rBCG) that express antigens not present in BCG [112] to enhanc e immune recognition and its concomitant response. There is a third strategy based o n a rationally attenuated live Mtb derivate [112]. 5.2. MTBVAC. In 1991, a MDRTB outbreak was detected, killing over 100 peopl e, most of them also infected with HIV [98]. Surprisingly, it was caused by a M. bovis strain, characterized for being capable to infect humans but not usually transmissibl e between them. This strain, called strain B, was initially described as MDR in 1997 but today is considered to be extremely resistant (XDR) [97] and therefore virtually untre atable. Genetic studies revealed that this strain carried a copy of a IS 6110 upstream phoP which acted as strong promoter of t he gene increasing phoP expression [97], these data suggested the role of PhoP in Mtb virulence. The SO2 strain is a phoP mutant generated by the insertion of a kanamycinresistance cassette in a Mtb clinical isolate, Mt103 [77]. Primary mouse b one marrow macrophages infected with this phoP mutant showed an impairment of intracellular replication [77], same phenotype was observed in immunocompeten t BALB/c mice [77]. SO2 was used as a prototype vacci ne in several preclinical stud ies showing similar efficiency to BCG Pasteur in BAL B/c mice protection studies, an d higher immunity. SCID survival studies with SO2 showed high attenuation: the SCID mic e inoculated by aerosol route with the phoP mutant survived until the end of the experiment (6 months) [100].

MTBVAC is the first Mtb liveattenuated vaccine that has entere d into clinical trial evaluation in history (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT0201324 5), phase I has been already completed [115]. Currently MTBVAC has entered in clinic al trial phase II with newborns in South Africa (NCT02729571). Introduction 38 REFERENCES 1.

Chapter 1 48 C h a p t e r 1 49 INTRODUCTION Protein secretion is one of the most important mechanisms that allows intracellular bacteria to interact with the host. Through action of these sec reted proteins bacteria can adapt to intracellular conditions, such as the environment inside the phagosome, and/or escape from one com partment to another [1]. In Mtb, there are two highly conserved protein secretion system s the Sec and TAT export pathways. Mtb also posse sses specialized protein export systems dedicated to the secretion of a more limited set of proteins: the accessory ry conserved secretion systems are present in all b a c t e r i a ( S e c A s e c r e t i o n s y s t e m ) o r i n a l a r g e n u m b e r o f f a m i l i e s b u t n o t i n a l l microorganisms (TAT secretion system). The specialized secretio n systems are not conserved among species and play specific roles, like those imp licated in pathogenesis of some important intracellular bacteria [1, 2]. Twinarginine translocase (TAT) export systems exist in both Gr amnegative and Gram positive bacteria, but they are not present in all bacteria. Wh en TAT export systems are found in bacterial pathogens, they are frequently responsib l e f o r e x p o r t i n g virulence factors, and thus contribute to pathogenesis. In Mtb, the TAT system plays a role in both virulence and drug resistance, and it is also esse ntial for viability [2, 3]. ESX secretion systems, which are also referred to as Type VII a re specialized protein export systems originally identified in mycobacteria. The first ESX system identified was ESX1 of Mtb, which is respo nsible for exporting protein secreted ch export ESAT6like proteins with various functions in mycobacterial physiology and /or virulence [4, 5]. In a previous work proteomic analysis were done in order to com pare the secretome of the Mtb H37Rv wildtype strain and its phoP mutant [3]. 37 proteins were found to be more secreted in the phoP mutant compared to the wild type strain, 16 of these Chapter 1 50 (43.24%) exhibited an RR motif within the first 50 aminoacids. On the other hand, 6 out of 35 proteins that were more abundant in the wild type, di splayed the RR motif. This twin arginine motif (RR) is required to export proteins th rough the TAT secretory system [3]. The predicted TAT substrates (those with a RR motif ) were significantly more present in the secreted fraction of the phoP mutant relative to wild type strain. I n a d d i t i o n , t h e r e l a t i v e s e c r e t i o n l e v e l s o f E S A T 6 , C F P 1 0 , E spA and EspC were compared since these proteins are wellknown PhoPdependent ESX 1 secretion substrates [6] and as it was expected, the secretome of the phoP mutant contained very low amounts of ESAT6, CFP10, EspA and EspC, thus showing the opposite trend to TATdependent substrates [3]. A novel regulatory model was identified, where Mcr7, an ncRNA s trictly regulated by PhoP is playing a key role in the tatC mRNA regulation, probably preventing its ribosome loading and, consequently translation of tatC mRNA. Thus the TAT secretory system regulation will be impaired [3]. This entire new regulatory model implies that the Mtb H37RvphoP mutant presents diverse phenotypic divergences, b eside the absence of productio n of SL, DAT and PAT [7], it has altered protein secretion. The phoP mutant displays absence of secretion of ESX1 substrates, while TAT substrates are considerably increas ed in the secreted fraction [3]. Besides the secreted proteins, a significant contributor of Mtb pathogenicity during infection resides in its capacity to manage the hostile environ ment encountered within the host in order to survive and replicate. Mtb has evolved mec hanisms of resistance to overcome the defense function s of macrophages; these involve the use of receptors for cell invasion [8], the modulation of normal progression of the phagosome into an acid and hydrolytically active phagolysosome, the regulation of local modulators of the immune response and the cont rol of cell apoptosis [9]. C h a p t e r 1 51 One of the most important mechanisms that allow Mtb to persist and replicate inside the macrophage is the phagosomal maturation arrest [10]. It ret ains or eliminates some host molecules from the pha gosome in order to prevent its maturation, it stops the compartment acidification which will remain at pH=6,5 appro ximately. To manage this, for instance, the mycobacteria block the presence of the vacuolar proton ATPase (VATPase) responsible of the phagosomal acidification; other m ycobacterial enzymes also helps to keep the neutral pH of the phagosome through the production of NH4+ ions, like the urease, glutam ine synthetase or the ureoamid e lyase [11]. By inhibiting the formation of the phagolysosome, Mtb persists in a phagosome with markers typical from an early endosome like the mannose recepto r o r t h e s m a l l GTPase, but not with markers typical from late endosomes or pha golysosomes like the cathepsin D, the small GTPase protein Rab 7, the lysosomalasso ciated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and the lysosomalassociated membrane protei n 2 (LAMP2) or the membrane protein CD63 [12] (Figure 1). Inside this mycobacteria lcontaining phagosome, the bacteria have sources of nutrients, can evade th e immune system, avoid the acidic pH and the hydrolases contained in the phagoly sosome.

The outermost layer of the mycobacterial cell envelop e contains unique cell surface lipids and acts as an interface between the host and th e pathogen. Passemar et al. established for SL, PDIM and DAT/PAT an essential role in the remodeling of the Mtbcontaining phagosome and in preventing its acidification, a nd as a consequence in the survival in human macrophages [17]. PDIM constitute a potential candidate for modulating the initia l step of entry into macrophages and for controlling the outcome of bacterial infect ion. Astarie et al. proposed a model in which contac t of Mtb with phagocytes is fol lowed by the insertion o f P D I M i n t o t h e p l a s m a m e m b r a n e of the host. This modification i n c r e a s e s t h e efficiency of receptormediated phagocytosis and affects phagos ome acidification thereby facilitating the access of the pathogen to its ecologic al niche. A mutant lacking PDIM was unable to prevent vacuole acidification, acquiring lat e endosomal markers [17, 18]. Purified SL has been described as modulating phagosom elysosome fusion [19, 20], blocking [22], increased phagosome or gro wth restriction in human macrophages [23] among others. Concerning DAT and PAT, th eir role in downmodulation of IL2, IL10, IL12 and TNF responses in CD4+ CD8+ human T cells has been demonstrated [24], DAT/PAT are potent inhibitors o f l e u c o c y t e migration [25] and T cell proliferation [26] and participate in e a r l y i n t e r a c t i o n s between Mtb and phagocytes [27]. It also has been reported that deficiency in some forms of DAT and PAT affects the surface properties of Mtb, res ulting in enhanced interaction with host cells [18, 28]. The presence of PDIM is required but not sufficient to arrest t he phagosome maturation since heatkilled bacteria that contain PDIM, accumu late in acidified compartment. All these results imply that modulation of phagoso me maturation is likely a multifactorial process [18]. A study based on screenin g of mycobacterial mutants [29, 30] identified multiple genes required for phagoso mal arrest, including Chapter 1 54 those involved in biosynthesis of surface lipids, transport of possible effector molecules, and production o f isoprenoid compounds. The SO2 vaccine candidate strain is a phoP mutant in the Mtb clinical isolate, Mt103, which is also naturally deficient in SL. Due to the phoP mutation, the strain also lacks DAT and PAT [31]. The ability of SO2 to arrest phagosome matura tion was studied by colocalization analysis with the acidotrophic probe Lysotracke r (for early stages of maturation), LAMP1 and CD63 markers, two different lysosomeas sociated membrane glycoprotein characteristic of latecompartments of the phagocy tic route (for late endosomephagosome and phagolysoso me stages, respectively). Hig h colocalization of SO2 was observed with Lysotracke r and LAMP1, but it showed poo r colocalization with CD63 [32]. Suggesting that SO2 does not escape phagosomal maturation, however it displays a persistence phenotype. SO2 attenuation co uld be due partially to its inability to inhibit phagosome maturation characteristic of the wildtype strain [32]. Beside the trafficking studies, rigorous preclinical testing of SO2 as a vaccine candidate provided robust data for its hig h degree of safety, improved im munogenicity and protective efficacy compared to B CG in relevant animal models o f TB, from mice to nonhuman primates [31, 33]. Despite the promising results, the establishments of Geneva consensus for new live mycobacterial vaccines, requiring the presence of two stable independent mutations without antibioticresistance mark ers for Mtbbased candidates, in addition to a safety and efficacy profile at lea st comparable to BCG in the relevant animal models, rendered SO2 unsuitable for entry i nto clinical trials [34, 35]. Simultaneously to the preclinical testing, it was observed that the phoP mutant SO2 showed incomplete restoration of the wildtype virulence in imm unocompetent mice when it was complemented with the phoP gene, suggesting that other genetic lesions might also be involved in the attenuated phenotype [36]. Lipid profile analysis of SO2 mutant revealed that, apart from being deficient in DAT and PAT as result of the phoP mutation, the strain is devoid of PDIM. Although the precise re ason for the loss of C h a p t e r 1 55 PDIM synthesis in SO2 is unknown, similar \"spontaneous\" losses of PDIM production have been reported in other allelic exchange mutants; PDIM defi ciency is also a generated by subculture, like H37Ra [37]. biosynthesis; it encodes an ligase, the the PDIM biosynthesis operon. Thus, an Mtb mutant in this gene is completely devoid of this family of lipids, being attenuated in several mouse models. When tested as vaccine, this mutant protected mice infected wit h virulent Mtb [38, 39]. Based on these last results, a new vaccine candidate was constr ucted following a stepwise approach to genetically engineer two stable, unmarked deletions in phoP and fadD26 genes in the SO2 strain, generating a novel vaccine candidate that was named MTBVAC. Results obtained in imm unogenicity and protective effic acy bridging experiments provide evidence that MTBVAC is functionally compar able to its prototype SO2 [40]. This new vaccine candidate, even considering it is a phoP mutant and it is based on SO2, is a new strain. Accordingly, we considered necessary to a nalyze both the secretome and the trafficking of MTBVAC itself and to study the contribution of each single mutation ( phoP and fadD26 genes) to the intracellular trafficking in order to a better understanding the nature of hostvaccine interactions du ring infection. Chapter 1 56 1.1. Proteomic profiling of the v accine candidate strain. In vitro culture of Mtb results in the accumulation in the extracellula r milieu of a complex set of proteins. A considerable number of the proteins secreted by Mtb are known to contribute to the immunology of TB and to possess enzy matic activities associated with pathogenicity. In previous studies it has been proved that culture filtrate is a major repository of antigens involved in the prot ective immune response and it has also been demonstrated the ability of these proteins to induce a protective Tcell response [41]. In order to verify the secretome profile of MTBVAC, we cultivat ed MTBVAC and its parental strain Mt103 until late stationary phase in standard c ulture medium without any detergent (tween) or albumin to avoid protein interferences . Comparative analysis between the wild type strain Mt103 and the vaccine candidate MT BVAC secreted protein were carried out by two methodologies, western blot and differential gel electrophoresis techniques. T h e m a i n o b j e c t i v e o f t h i s p a r t o f t h e w o r k w a s a n a l y z i n g t h e s ecreted proteins through the fluorescence twodimensional difference gel electro phoresis (2DDiGE). D i G E i s b a s e d o n f l u o r e s c e n t c y a n i n e d y e s a n d a l l o w s c o m p a r i s o n s between two protein samples, which are resolved on the same gel [42]. The p rinciple involved in the DiGE technique is that different dyes provide different fluores cence wavelengths for detection, allowing two or more differentially labeled samples to be combined before being loaded onto isoelectric focusing (IEF)(first dimension). The strip is subsequently subjected to a SDSPAGE (second dimension) and the gel is scann ed with the excitation wavelength of each dye so we are able to resolve each sample se parately. Frequently, three samples are labeled: two of them are experimental samples whereas the third sample is composed of a mixture of equal amounts of all experim ental samples (pooled internal standard). This creates a standard for each pr otein during analysis. The protein samples are then visualized using fluorescence imag ing, which enables the detection of differences between protein abundances in the samp les [42]. The most C h a p t e r 1 57 c o m m o n l y u s e d f l u o r e s c e n t p r o t e i n l a b e l i n g r e a g e n t s f o r D i G E a r e synthetic N hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) and react with primar y amine groups of lysine residues. The dyes are positively charged to offset the charge of lysine. At this point, the samples should be labeled in denaturing 2D electrophoresis lysis buffer at pH values between 8 and 8,5 [42]. The different protein samples labeled can be visualized separat ely by exciting the different dyes at their specific excitation wavelengths. Theref ore, from the images generated for each dye, the signa ls from labeled proteins spots are determined and the normalized intensities or spot volumes for each spot are co mpared in order to identify differentially expre ssed protein between samples. For quantitative protein analysis, an internal standard is used , which is marked with a dye (generally Cy2) and applied to gel electrophoresis, along w ith two samples to be analyzed (labeled with Cy3 and Cy5) (Figure 2). The internal st andard is prepared from a mixture of equal amounts of proteins from the two samples and therefore contains all proteins that are present in each sample. Thus, each protei n has a single signal in the internal standard, which is used for a direct quantitative comparison within each gel and for normalizing the abun dance values for each protein w hen comparing different gels. As a consequenc e, the abundance of each protein spot in a biological sample can be measured as a ratio (not a volume) to its corresp onding spot present in the internal standard. In this way, as each sample spot is cod etected with a standard s p o t m a p , a l l s p o t s a r e c o m p a r e d i n t h e g e l t o t h e s a m e s t a n d a r d. This enables accurate quantification and accurate spot statistics between ge ls and, most importantly, separation of experimental geltogel variation fr om biological variation in studying protein spot abundance [42, 43].

The ESX1 substrate ESAT6 has the opposite trend, being only se creted on Mt103. Same amounts of protein were loaded in each western blot assay. We verified that Antigens 85 A, B and C showed increased secret ion in MTBVAC compared to the parental strain Mt103. This effect is due to th e absence of the ncRNA Mcr7, the strongest PhoPregulated region, which has been propo sed to be a TatC down regulator. Therefore the absence of Mcr7 is traduced on an increased secretion of TAT substrates, like the comp onents of the Antigen 85 Comple x. We also corroborated that ESAT6 is not secreted by the vaccine candidate strain.

Differential in Gel Electrophoresis (DiGE). In order to compare the secretome of the vaccine candidate MTBV AC and its parental strain we performed the 2D DiGE technique. First of all we car ried out a regular two dimensional electrophoresis (2D) with one of the samples of MT BVAC secreted proteins, without fluorescent dying and using silver staining t o visualize protein spots. For the IEF separation we used strips with pH range from 3 to 1 1. In this range proteins did not separate correctly since Mtb proteins are mainly acidic . However, we could observe that our protein extract ions work fine for 2DDiGE tech nique (Figure 4). Chap 60 Figure staini consid the le In th DiGE mark able abse(Ant the eter 1 e 4.

Fold change expressed as the log 2. It is remarkable the absence of ESAT6, part of the RD1, in the obtained protein lists. Nevertheless we did verify its presence in the protein samples through the western blot analysis. Although, in the image obtained of the DiGE gel (Figure 6), we can observe in the downleft part of the gel a big green spot that might correspond to the ESAT6 and ESAT6like proteins. These proteins are exported th rough the ESX secretion system which is PhoPdependent, therefore they are ab sent in MTBVAC and consequently we visualize them in green. On the other hand, the CFP10 protein, which is part of the ESX system and is secreted together with E SAT6, was identified from the picked spots of the gel. It presence corroborates our assumption. Chapter 1 66 1.2. Analysis of the mycobacterial ce ll envelope lipid composition. One of the aims of this chapter was to characterize the intrace llular trafficking of the vaccine candidate MTBVAC. The va ccine candidate is the product of two independent and nonreversible deletions in phoP and fadD26 genes. In addition to characterize the MTBVAC trafficking, we also wanted to study the individual cont ribution of these mutations to the vaccine trafficking since, as it has been prev iously described, some Mtb single mutants present defects in phagosome maturation arre s t and in their intracellular trafficking [29, 30]. To carry out the trafficking characterization, we designed the experiments using GFP fluorescent strains. An integrative plasmid with the gfp gene under the control of a strong promoter was introduced by electroporation in each strai n. On the other hand it has been described the spontaneous loss of the lipid PDIM during in vitro subculturing [37]. The \"spontaneous\" loss of PDIM is probably an energy saving process since the biosynthesis a nd transport of this lipid have a high energetic cost due to the high size and abundance of this compound. Consequently, mutants that are no longer synthesizing PDIM have a competitive growth advantage wi thin a heterogeneous population. This st udy was performed in H37Rv lab oratory reference strain, but the loss of PDIM has also been noted for the clinic al isolate Mt103 [46]. To perform our study with Mt103 and its derivative strains, the first step was to characterize the lipid profile of the strains in order to verif y that PDIM were not spontaneously lost. Cultures of the wild type strain Mt103, the s i n g l e m u t a n t s Mt103phoP and Mt103 fadD26 and the double mutant MTBVAC vaccine candidate were incubated with 14Cpropionate. 14Cpropionate integrates in the lipid synthesis pathway of the mycobacteria because it is the precursor of the malonylCoA molecule and it is integrated in the methylbranched fatty acids which w ill form part of the cell wall complex lipids; thus mycobacterial lipids are radio labele d. We extracted lipids from liquid cultures and analyzed them by thin layer chromatogr aphy (TLC) using diffe of PDI bserve the a e 11.

Presence of DAT is only observed in the strains were the phoP gene has not been deleted, lanes 2 and 7. C. Presence of PAT is only observed in the strains were the phoP gene has not been deleted, lanes 2 and 7. For the present study we used the strain H37Rv (STR) gfp, which is known to be devoid of DAT/PAT, as positiv e control for PDIM presence. On the other hand we previously know that the clinical isolate Mt103 is naturally defective in SL synthesis, thus neither the wild type strain nor its mut ants synthesize SL molecule. Fo r Mt103phoPgfp strain we analyzed three different clones. TLC results confirm the presence of PDIM in the wild type strai n Mt103 gfp and in the three Mt103 phoPgfp selected clones; the absence of PDIM was the fadD26- strains, MTBVAC gfp and Mt103 fadD26gfp as it was expected. SL absence in Mt103 and its mutants was confirmed in all cases. And finally D AT and PAT presence was confirmed for Mt103 gfp and Mt103 fadD26gfp; phoP- strains are not able to synthesize these lipids as it ha s been previously described [7] , it can be observed for the Mt103 phoPgfp selected clones and for the vaccine candidate MTBVAC (Figure 11). C h a p t e r 1 69 1.3. Determination of the individua l contribution of the single phoP and fadD26 gene deletions to the intracellu lar trafficking of the vaccine candidate. Once inside the organism, Mtb reaches the alveolar macrophages that phagocyte the bacterium in order to contain the infection. Mycobacteriaconta ining phagosomes will evolve to a more hostile environment whose final aim is to harm and kill intracellular bacteria. Mtb has developed strategies to arrest the phagosomal maturation and to be able to replicate inside the mac rophages so it can survive [10] . The vaccine candidate SO2 strain is a phoP insertion mutant in a Mtb clinical isolate, Mt103 [47]. Despite the promising results in preclinical studie s [31, 33, 48], SO2 does not fulfill the establishment of the Geneva consensus for new l ive mycobacterial vaccines [34, 35]. Therefore it was necessary to construction o f a new strain based on t h e p r o t o t y p e S O 2 . T h e n o v e l v a c c i n e c a n d i d a t e M T B V A C w a s c o n s t ructed by genetically engineer two stable, unmarked deletions in phoP and fadD26 genes in the SO2 strain [40]. Defective arrest of the phagosomal maturation was previously ob served for SO2 [32, 49]. MTBVAC, even though is based on SO2, is a new strain with an additional mutation which alters its lipid profile and hence its intracellular traf ficking. Consequently, we wanted to characterize the intra cellular trafficking of the new vaccine candidate in two different cellular models, the mu rine alveolar macrophage (MHS) cell line and primary human macrophages (hMDM). Additi o n a l l y w e w a n t e d t o s t u d y t h e i ndividual contribution of each mutation in the trafficking of MTBVAC usin g phoP and fadD26 single mutants. early phagosomal maturation stage in MHS mouse macrophages cell line. We decided to analyze the trafficking of the vaccine candidate MTBVAC, its parental strain Mt103 and the single mutants Mt103 phoP and Mt103 fadD26; we also Chapter 1 70 included in the study the present vaccine BCG Pasteur and a PDI M- BCG Pasteur strain [18] in order to compare the effect of the absence of PDIM in b oth strains. All these strains carried a GFP expression plasmid. We chose a murine cel l line of alveolar macrophages (MHS) for the study, which were infected with the s trains mentioned below and processed after 48 hours of infection. The infection was performed over cover glasses in order to anal yze results with the confocal microscope. Before fixing the cells, we incubated them with the acidotropic probe Lysotracker, which will dye in red those compartments wit h a pH lower than 6. After that, the cell nuclei were dyed in blue with the nucleic acid stain Hoechst. Since the bacterial strains were GFP positive, we were able to observ e them in green through the microscope. When the bacteria is in an acidified co mpartment, hence the maturation has not been arrested, we will observe it in orange/ yellow due to the superposition of both colors, green for the bacteria and red fo r the Lysotracker acid compartments. The quantification of the colocalization of bacteria with acidi c compartments was performed by counting a represen tative number of total bacteria in different fields of each cover glasses. We determined the % of colocalization with Lysotracker by dividing the number of bacteria colocalizin g by the number of total bact eria counted. A B Figure strain fluore When e.g. i e 12. Confoc s .

Chapter 1 78 DISCUSSION The aim of this chapter was to perform a finest characterizatio n of MTBVAC vaccine candidate in some aspects that had not been studied before, lik e the secretome analysis compared with the parental strain or the study of the intracellular trafficking. We studied the comparative secretome of MTBVAC vaccine candidat e and its parentl strain Mt103 though WesternBlot and DiGE techniques. Finally w e obtained a list of proteins identified. The list is quite small compared with the high number of spots that were marked and picked. There were a high number of unidentifie d spots, this could be due to the detection limit of the technique used, as a resul t of the fact that it could be a low concentration of protein in some spots. The list obtained was divided in two, the proteins that were mo re expressed in MTBVAC and the ones which expression was higher in the parental strain Mt103. Both lists were compared with different antigen lists as the Epitope list that compiles all the human T cell epitopes of Mtb eliciting a positive immune respon se in humans reported in the literature from the work of Comas et al. 2010 [44]; or the classification of Mtb T cell antigens absent from BCG strains and the classification of Mtb proteins with epitope sequence variants in BCG strains obtained from the work of Copin et al. 2014 [45]. The Rv1886c/ fbpB gen e, enco des fo r the Ag85B, part o f the Antige n 85 co mplex (Ag85AC), it is mainly expressed in MTBVAC strain and it was c ommon with the two protein lists compared. These proteins are TAT secretory system substrates and based on the work of Solans et al. 2014, their secretion is indire ctly and negative regulated by PhoP through the ncRNA mcr7 thus in a PhoP mutant TAT substrates like Ag85B is upregulated [3]. From the work of Sola ns et al. we obtained a list of TAT substrates [3]. The cross identification turn out i n a list of 10 common proteins with MTBVAC, ergo only 2 of the 12 spots identified as secreted proteins for MTBVAC in our DIGE experiment are not secreted by the TAT secre tion system, C h a p t e r 1 79 demonstrating therefore the importance of TAT substrates in the secretome of the vaccine candidate strain. Some of the TAT secreted proteins are involved in the interacti on with the host cell wall, like the Rv0315 which possible encodes for a 1,3glucanaseprecursor that could have lytic activity against cell walls [50]. Also the Ag8 5B, part of the Ag85 complex (Ag85AC) which is a family of proteins all with enzyma tic mycolyltransferase activity involved in the generation of trehalose dimycolates (T DM) or cord factor, an envelope lipid essential in Mtb virulence; these proteins are a lso known for their capacity to bind to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronect in and elastin, and to induce strong Th1type immune responses. Members of the Ag85 co mplex are immunodominant mycobacterial antigens and because of their role i n c e l l w a l l integrity and synthesis of the cord factor, they have long been considered as virulence factors [5153]. Components of the antigen 85 complex, Ag85A an d Ag85B mainly, are largely used in development of new vaccine candidates as subuni ts protein transported in viral vectors with the objective of increase and i m p r o v e t h e immunological response of BCG as vaccine [54]. Through the DiGE analysis only the Ag85B was identified, but in the previous western blot analysis with the same culture filtrate we were able to ve rify the more abundant presence of the three Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C in MTBVAC strain c ompared to the parental strain Mt103. This upregulation of the Ag85 complex in t h e a t t e n u a t e d vaccine candidate MTBVAC is a highlight since it is going be re ally helpful in order to generate a better immunological response to Mtb infection itsel f without the need of introduce any external vector as boosting strategy. On the other hand, from the Mt103 identified proteins it is rem arkable the Rv3874/esxB gene, coding for the Culture filtrate antigen CFP10. This prot ein is encoded in the region of difference 1 (RD1), which contains par t of the genes encoding the ESX1 secretion system structural components and substrates , like antigenic and CFP10 prote ins are cosecreted Chapter 1 80 and are key virulence factors implicated in the phagovacuole es cape of the mycobacteria in infected cells [4, 6, 55]. The secretion system ESX1 is PhoPregulated, and in consequence these proteins are more secreted in the pare ntal strain Mt103. The ESAT6 protein was not identified in the DiGE, but it was id entified through the westernblot techniques with the same culture filtrate and we c an clearly visualize it in the DiGE image, a big green spot in the low molecular weight zo ne corresponding to a secretion due to Mt103 exclusive ly as we verify also with the w esternblot. The RD1 region is deleted or tr uncated in several attenuated st rains, such as the actual vaccine M. bovis BCG. The absence of this region implies the attenuation of BCG with impaired celltocell , activation or T cell resp onses [56]. Additionally, ESAT6 and CFP10 contain a high percentage of the human T cell epitopes of Mtb [44]. The fact that MTBVAC does not secrete CFP10 or ESAT6, key vir ulence factors, is an advantage for its attenuation since it will not be able to esca pe from the phagosome [57], and consequently its trafficking will be also altered. Ho wever, even if MTBVAC does not secrete them, it does synthesize ESAT6 and CFP10 so they will accumulate inside the bacteria, and when it eventually reaches the lysosom e MTBVAC will be degraded and the protein epitopes exposed to the immune system conferring an advantage since it will induce a proper immunological response. Concerning the intracellular trafficking study, we decided to u s e fluo res cent GF P+ bacteria in order to simplify the postinfection treatment befo r e t h e m i c r o s c o p e analysis of the infected cells. Since the construction of GFPe xpressing strains was necessary for the study, and cons idering the spontaneous loss o f PDIM lipid that could occur during the electroporation process or the subculture proc ess [37], we needed to analyze the lipid profile of the new GFP+ strain in order to confirm the presence of PDIM. Once we assured that PDIM was still present in our GFP+ derived strains, we could proceed to the trafficking study. C h a p t e r 1 81 For both cellular models in whic h we performed the infection, M HS and hMDM, we can observe the marked different ial phenotype between MTBVAC an d Mt103 at early s t a g e s o f m a t u r a t i o n . T h e p a r e n t a l s t r a i n p r e s e n t s a l o w c o l o c a lization rate with Lysotracker, which means it resi des in nonacidificated phagoso mes; therefore it is arresting the phagosomal maturation. The vaccine candidate, as i t w a s e x p e c t e d , presents high colocalization percentage with Lysotracker, it is n o t a r r e s t i n g t h e phagosomal maturation at this e arly stages and it remains in ac idificated phagosomes. More advanced stages of phagosomal maturation were only studied in hMDM. Mt103 presents low percentage of colocalization with late phagosomal and phagolysosomal markers, LAMP1 and CD63 respectively; indicates that as being a fully virulent strain, Mt103 is arresting the maturation of the phagosome at early sta ges creating a favorable environment in which it could be able to persist and replicate. The vaccine candidate MTBVAC, as attenuated strain, is not able to arrest t he phagosomal maturation at early stages, as we can observe through the coloc alization with the late phagosomal marker LAMP1; but the poor colocalization with the phagolysosome marker CD63 suggests it do arrest the maturation in some interm ediate point during the maturation process, present ing a persistence phenotype. Concerning to the single mutants, the Mt103 phoP strain presents a phenotype more similar to the Mt103 wild type, for both types of cells and all the different maturation markers, and so the bacteria is arresting the phagosomal matura tion at an early stage. Nevertheless the Mt103 fadD26 single mutant phenotype i s remarkably alike to the MTBVAC one, for both type cells and all the different maturatio n markers; this strain is not able to arrest phagosomal maturation at early stages, but i t do not colocalize with the phagolysosome marker CD63, suggesting indeed that the singl e mutant also arrest the maturation in some intermedi ate point before the phagolysos ome stage presenting the same persistence phenotype as MTBVAC (Figure 18) . The fadD26 gene product is an acylAMP lig ase which is required for the b iosynthesis of PDIM. Thus, an Mtb mutant in this gene is completely devoid of this family of lipids. Chapter 1 82 The phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM) constitute potential can didates for modulating the initial step of entry into macrophages and for c ontrolling the outcome of bacterial infection [18, 27]. Therefore considering the lite rature data and our results it is consistent a model where the absence of PDIM might make t he bacteria more sensitive to the stresses gen erated by the phagosome. The phenotypes of the single mutant strains suggest that the phoP contribution to intracellular trafficking is considerably lower than the fadD26 contribution. However, taking into consideration previous studies carried out in the s tudy of the virulence of these two single mutants [36], we propose a model in which both mutations have a synergistic effect contributing to the altered trafficking of M TBVAC. Regarding the trafficking of BCG Pasteur, it was only analyzed for early stages of maturation and its colocalization with Lysotracker was signific antly lower compared with MTBVAC. Its percentage of colocalization it is intermediat e between the parental strain Mt103 and the vaccine candidate, meaning it is more able to stop phagosomal acidification than MTBVAC (Figure 18). The BCG strain lacking o f PDIM shows a higher percentage of colocalization than BCG but lower than MTBVAC. BCG was obtained through the lon gterm subculture of a virulent strain, during this process the bacteria got attenuated but it was not a controlled event. Genomic analyses have been carried out and several regions have been id entified as deleted from BCG, resulting in the loss of more than 100 genes compared with Mtb [58]. Thus we cannot reach any conclusion here, because even observing an improvement in the BCGPDIM- colocalization with Lysotracker , BCG has so many genes deleted compared to an Mtb strain [45] that the analysis of the differences obse rved when PDIM is absent are much wider and not co mparable with the mentioned for the Mt103 strain.

All the mentioned vacc ine candidates are currently in different stages of clinical trials. In contrast MTBVAC, as we have described before in the secretom e analysis, has improved secretion of important immunodominant antigens part of the Antigen 85 complex and it is deficient in secretion of ESX1 substrates, l ike ESAT6 or CFP10 proteins which are key virulence factors, absent in BCG strains [4, 5, 57]. The lack of ESAT6 secretion makes the strain unable to escape from the pha gosome, so even if it is able to arrest the phagosomal maturation before reaching the phagolysosome, it will get trapped inside the macrophage and will be eventually degrad ed; its components, including ESAT6 and CFP10 epitop es which will accumulate insi de the bacteria, will be exposed to the major histocompat ibility complex in order to dev elop an immunological response to the infection [60].

C h a p t e r 2 89 Chapter 2: Indeep study of the PhoP regulon. Chapter 2 90 C h a p t e r 2 91 INTRODUCTION Twocomponent systems (TCSs) are highly conserved prokaryotic s ignaltransduction pathways, consisting in a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and an e ffector response regulator (RR). The HK, often membraneassociated, is responsib le for detection of extracellular stimuli. In response to signal sensing, the HK au tophosphorylates itself and then transfers its phosphate to the RR, which alters its co nformation and modulates gene expression, usually through DNA binding. Overall , this mechanism enables bacteria to detect and respond to a wide range of envir onmental stimuli [1]. Intracellular pathogens usually use TCSs to respond to host def enses being often essential for virulence. Compared with environmental bacteria, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) possesses a few TCSs, 11 operons among the genome [1]; this relatively small number o f TCSs might reflect the adaptation of Mtb to the intracellular lifestyle. One of th e most widely studied TCS is PhoPR virulence system [2]. To study the essential role of P hoPR in Mtb virulence, a phoP mutant was constructed in the clinical isolate Mt103, it was u nable to replicate in mouse bone marrowderived macro phages and showed marked attenua tion in i n t r a v e n o u s l y i n o c u l a t e d B A L B / c m i c e [ 3 ] . I t w a s a l s o o b s e r v e d altered colony morphology, diminished cording formation and smaller bacillary size compared to the wild type. These phenotypes are related to the cellwall compos ition, studies of lipid composition of different phoP and phoPR mutants demonstrate that PhoP controls the biosynthesis of SL and DAT and PAT [4, 5]. In addition to the i mpaired synthesis of acyltrehalosebased lipids, PhoP controls secretion of y regulating the espACD gene cluster [6]; ESAT6 is considered one of the major Mtb sec reted virulence factors [7], promoting phagosome phenotype is involved in the ce lltocell spread of pathogenic strains and consequently in propagation of Mtb [12]. Additionally, an Mtb phoP mutant displays increased immunogenicity and enhanced generati on of memory Tcells [13]; a recent work has de monstrated an increased secre tion of the Twin slocation depending on a PhoPregulated noncoding RNA [1 4], as it was Chapter 2 92 described in chapter 1 for MTBVAC secreted protein fraction whi ch is enriched in TAT substrates. In an attempt to decipher the entire PhoP regulon, transcriptom es of wild type and phoP were compared using microarrays [4, 15]. Compar isons started to delineate the molecular mechanism by which PhoP controls the sy nthesis of SL and DAT/PAT or the secretion of ESAT6. Although microarray analyse s are useful to obtain a g l o b a l l a n d s c a p e o f g e n e e x p r e s s i o n , t h e y f a i l t o a n s w e r s o m e basic biological q u e s t i o n s s u c h a s w h e t h e r a g i v e n g e n e i s d i r e c t l y o r i n d i r e c t l y regulated by transcription factors or if there are transcripts in noncoding regions. A recent study has applied two nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques to study the PhoP regulatory network [14]; ChIPseq made possible to det ect all PhoP binding region throughout the Mtb H37Rv chromosome and consequently to dissect those genes directly regulated by PhoP, and using RNAseq, it was pos sible to obtain a detailed transcriptome and to identify PhoPdependent transcrip tion across the including intergenic and noncoding regions. The combina tion of all data together made possible to obtain a fine portrait of transcripti onal regulation and allowed to discriminate between those genes regulated by PhoP i n all conditions, the \"core\" PhoP regulon, and those genes whose transcriptional prof ile varies across conditions [16]. A total number of 35 regions were found to be significantly enr iched in PhoPDNA binding compared to phoP mutant (ChIPseq); among th em, 12 genes were found to keep the expression trend in all conditions tested by RNAseq [ 16]. These twelve genes were proposed to be the PhoP \"core\" regulon. Among these genes some are involved in lipid metabolism, like the pks2 gene which codifies for a polyketide synthase involved in the synthesis of SL [17], which has been reported t o play a highly significant role in the interaction of the mycobacteria with its host [18]; pks3, which has a role in the synthesis of DAT/PAT [19]; lipF codifies for an esterase implicated on modifing the mycobacterial cell wall to render the bacteria more resistant t o acidic stress, is known to be upregulated in the presence of acidic media and another p ossible function could C h a p t e r 2 93 be to regulate the intracellular pH during acidic stress [20, 2 1]; or fadD21 which is involved in lipid degradation and codifies for a probable fatty acidAMP synthetase [19]. respiration, codif ies for a probable nitrite extrusion protein and it is involved in excret ion of nitrite produced by the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, process that allows the bacteria to face the respiratory stress once inside the macrophages [22]. Among the PhoP ChIPseq peaks, t h e m o s t p r o m i n e n t i n t e r a c t i o n w a s d e t e c t e d w i t h i n a n i n t e r g e n i c region and subsequent inspection of the adjacent RNAseq profiles led to p ropose that a non conding RNA (ncRNA) named mcr7 is one of the most PhoPregulated regions [14]. The characterization of mcr7 demonstrated that this ncRNA modulates post transcriptionally translation of the tatC mRNA, an essential gene and a constituent of the TAT secretion system, involved in the secretion of proteins with a twin arginine motif such as the Ag85 complex [23]. Indepth exploration of NGS data has allowed to propose PhoP as a master regulator of different genetic networks, there were also 6 other regions in where PhoP bound upstream of transcription factors indicating the presence of a complex regulatory network controlled by PhoP [16] w here different responses like hypoxia adaptation ( espR) [27], are induced indirectly through action over these response regul ators. Regarding PhoP control o f ESAT6 secretion, PhoP binds to the promoter region of espR and regulates the expression of this gene [14, 28] which has been proposed to transcriptionally regulate the espACD operon [29, 30]. PhoP is also able to interact with the espA promoter [31]. Taken together these facts and considering the essential role of EspA in ESAT6 secr etion [6, 32], PhoP is on the axis of the PhoPEspREspA regulatory loop. On the other ha nd, recently it was reported that PhoP regulates expression of whiB6 by interacting with its promoter r e g i o n [ 3 3 ] , i t i s lo c a t e d a d j a c e n t t o t h e E SX 1 r e g i o n t h a t c o des for the ESAT6 secretory apparatus, pointing at WhiB6 as a putative regulator of this region. It has been demonstrated that WhiB6 interacts with the promoter region s of espA as well as with the ESX1 genes [34], required for ESAT6 36]. Thus, a second regulatory network involving PhoP as the master regula tor and WhiB6 as Chapter 2 94 secondary player is proposed to regulate ESAT6 secretion and c onsequently whiB6 is included within the ESX1 system. Among the few genes negativel y regulated there is icl, which allows mycobacteria to grow using fatty acids as sole c arbon source and it is required for intracellula r persistence [37, 38]. Despite the phoP gene and its implication in virulence have been extensively st udied, the signal sensed by the PhoR component remains still unknown. Several works have attempted to identify the PhoPR stimulating signal and given th e intracellular life cycle fitness of Mtb and the in vitro and in vivo attenuation showed by phoPR mutants [3, 39]; it link the PhoR sensor kinase with intrac ellular signals. Thus, one could speculate that following phagocytosis of Mtb by resident macrophages, PhoR sensing some of the changes occurring during phagosomal maturat ion would likely result in phosphorylation of PhoP. Upon phosphorylation, PhoP i s expected to modulate transcription of its regulon, which could result in po sitive regulation of SL and DAT/PAT synthesis and ESAT6 secretion and in promoting imm unomodulation of T cells and phagosome escape. Taking in consideration all these facts we carried out a series of experiments, first through a reporter system and later directly measuring gene exp ression through qRT PCR, in which we tried different extra and intracellular condi tions and analyzed the activity of different PhoPregulated genes in H37Rv and its phoP mutant. The aim was to found any condition in which the PhoP regulon was upregulate d compared to standard growth conditions and no changes in its expression wer e detected in the phoP m u t a n t ; c o n s e q u e n t l y t h e u p r e g u l a t i o n w o u l d b e d u e t o a P h o P d ependent activation, which otherwise woul d be related to the PhoR activa ting stimulus.

We choose the pFPV27:: pks2promoter strain to study indirectly the activity of the PhoP regulon. The aim of the reporter system is to analyze the effect of different culture conditions on the expr ession of the PhoP regulon. 2.1.1. Expression of the PhoP regulon under acidic conditions. S i n c e M t b i s a n i n t r a c e l l u l a r p a t h o g e n a n d i t h a s b e e n a l r e a d y observed the importance of acidic pH inside the macrophage phagosome [42], w e decided to study the pH effect on the Mtb reporter strains. The pH assay was per formed with the strains containing the constructions of both pks2 and lipF promoters because it has been previously reported pHinduced activa tion of lipF gene [20, 43]. used in our constructions a region of 550bp upstr eam of lipF gene were the promoter was supposed to be. However, when we performed the assays in acidic pH, the lipF promoter did not show transcriptional activation which was inc ongruent with previously described experi ments [43]. Recent results obta ined in our laboratory from ChIPseq and RNAseq technologies, show that the distance between the PhoP peak and the ORF start site is in the majority of the cases (83 %) between 0 and 200bp (Figure 4). Nevertheless there were two PhoP binding sites cons iderably far away from the closer ORF as was the case of lipF, with PhoPbinding region located at 525bp from the start site (Figure 5).

This result could be explained if the activation of pks2 promoter is regulated by PhoP under acidic conditions. 2.1.2.

We assayed not only the pks2 promoter, but also other promoters from the PhoP regulon. The assays were perfor med in different conditions in in vitro culture: Different sources of Carbon in the culture medium: Glucose, Ace tate or Propionate. is a meta bolic enzyme u s e d b y b a c t e r i a t o s u s t a i n g r o w t h o n e v e n c h a i n f a t t y a c i d s t h rough an anaplerotic pathway called the glyoxilate shunt.

This assay was performed in order to verify the activation of the icl promoter in presence of propionate, which allows us to verify the accurate functioning of the reporter system constructions. Hypoxia conditions: in order to mimic the anaerobic environment inside the granuloma during latent infection.

Fatty acids: It has been shown that Mtb uses host lipids, in pa rticular, fatty acids and cholesterol, as energy sources during intracellular g rowth and persistence [50]. In order to st udy the response of PhoPregulo n to fatty acids, we incubated cultures of Mtb with culture medium in presence of oleic, palmitic and estearic acids. However, we could not find, in none of these assays, any expres sion profile corresponding to a PhoP regulon activation signal. Results deta iled in the Appendix. C h a p t e r 2 105 2.2. Direct quantification of the PhoP regulon by qRTPCR. Once we obtained an expression profile through the GFP reporter system that led us to think that PhoP is regulating the pH response or, in other word s, that the acidic pH could be the signal activating t he PhoPregulon, the next step was to directly quantify the expression of pks2 gene by RNA extraction and qRT PCR, and confirm the induction of pks2 expression as the PhoP activity reporter. We will also analyze some other genes of the PhoP core regulon. Assays performed before were through a GFP reporter system, in which it is necessary pks2 promoter to be activated so gfp gene started to be expressed. To be able to detect the fluorescence due to GFP expression the protein have to accumulate inside the bacterium, so the time course of the assay it is slower tha n the real response. In order to obtain a direct measure of the response of the PhoPre gulon to acidic pH, we decided to perform the study at different time points, starting from very short times to long times of exposure to acidic pH. 2.2.1. Expression of PhoPregulated gen es after short times of acid pH exposure. In a first approach we performed the assay as it was done for t he reporter system, were the acidic response was registered three days after introd ucing the stimulus in the culture medium, but no response was detected. Taking into c onsideration the time lapse due to the accumulation of GFP, we decided to perform a k inetic assay at short times after exposure to acidic pH. RNA was extracted at 30 minutes, 1 and 6 hours after changing t he growth medium to the acidified one in exponential growth cultures. We obtained c DNA in order to carry out the qRTPCR and directly ana lyze the express ion of the PhoP regulated genes.

Average graphs from triplicate experiments. We found mcr7 to be highly overexpressed in acidic pH after 56 days of expo sure for the wild type strain, but not in the phoP mutant, meaning that response to acidic pH is activated by PhoP. When phoP is complemented, response to pH is restored, confirming the PhoPmediated phenotype (Figure 16). Mcr7 has be en recently described as an ncRNA, in fact is the first report of an ncRNA controlled by a 2CS in Mtb [14]. This aced between Rv2395 and PEPGRS41) as the most PhoPregulated region. Surprisingly, in the aprABC study previously cited [51], the locus, placed in Rv2392Rv2397, was described to be upregulated by acidic pH and PhoP dependent, however the bioche mical function of its products was unknown. mcr7 matches with the region and the phenotype described for the aprABC locus in the work of Abramovitch et al.. C h a p t e r 2 115 2.3. Intracellular expression of the PhoP regulon in different cell types. Mtb is known to be an intracellular pathogen, it infects and mu ltiplies in phagocytic cells like macrophages; it can also infect nonphagocytic cells like fibroblasts or epithelial cells, and proliferate inside them [52]. Macrophages are the first line of defense for the host, presenting a high number of vacuoles cont aining acidic pH, to an oxidative respons e producing H 2O2 and NO, toxic for the bacilli [53]. On the other hand, mycobacteria has an important role blocking or retarding acidification of the phagolysosome and av oiding lysosomal fusion through the manipulation of host signal transduction pathways. One of the first signals encountered when the mycobacteria ente r into the phagosome hostile environment, is the acidic pH. Since we have already st udied the expression in invitro assays, we decided to confir m the pH driven phenotype in ex vivo conditions. 2.3.1. Comparative expression studies between phagocytic and non phagocytic cells using a GFP reporter system. We wanted to compare PhoPregulo n expression inside two differe nt cellular models, phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells, through the reporter syste m based on the fusion of the pks2 promoter with the GFP protein as representative gene from the PhoP regulon. As phagocytic cells, mouse alveolar macrophage s chosen; and mouse embryonic fibroblast MEF cell line was used as nonphagocytic c ells.

Chapter 2 118 In this experiment, time course was shorter than the one for MH S cells; cells were infected 24 hours before processing, in order to minimize bacte rial replication. The activity of pks2 promoter at 24 hour in the wildtype strain compared to the phoP mutant strain was considerably increased when the fluorescence registered was normalized with the number of intracellular bacteria (CFUs/ml). We can observe a significant increase in the expression of pks2 promoter in the wildtype strain, not observed in the mutant one (Figure 19). This result in J774 cel l line is consistent with the previous results obtained with the MHS macrophages cell lin e. In addition artifacts due to replication inside hos t cells can be discarded. 2.3.2. Direct measurement of gene expre ssion profiles in activated and nonactivated phagocytic cells. We have already checked the correspondence between the GFP repo rter system and the direct quantification by qRTPCR of the pks2 gene to study the activity of PhoP regulon in invitro conditions. Therefore we decided to verify the upregulation of pks2 inside phagocytic cells compared to extracellular conditions, i n both wildtype and phoP mutant strains. For this assay we use bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) fr om C56BL/6 mice, some of them were activated with INF and LPS as it occurs in vivo. Cells were infected with H37Rv and its phoP mutant strain and processed to extract intracellular mycobacterial RNA after 24 hours postinfection.

When BMDM ar e pretreated with Bafilomycin, acidification of the phagosome is inhibited, and we can only observe residual fluorescence instea d of defined bacteria. The same residual fluorescence is observed w hen infecting with the phoP mutant strain. In nontreated cells (control), bacilli (green) colocalize with Lysotracker (red) marked compartments inside the cells, registered by an overlapping in both markers (yellow). Well defined mycobacteria are observed in cells infected with t he wildtype strain but not in cells infected with the phoP mutant strain, where we can only observe residual fluorescence due to the low expression levels of the pks2 promoter in this strain. In the case of Bafilomycintreated cells, we were not able to observe Lysotracker marked compartments since phagosomal acidification was inhibited, and consequently, no GFP activity was observed due to absence of pks2 promoter expression (Figure 23). Infected cells were also processed (fixed) at 20h post infectio n and analyzed by flow citometry. Results from microsco py and by flow cytometry are bo th in concordance. The difference in fluorescence correspondent to H37Rv infected cells treated and untreated with Bafilomycin is significantly higher than the dif ference obtained for phoP mutant infected cells; meaning that the effect of the Bafilomyc in dramatically decreases the levels of GFP fluorescence registered and in cons equence, the expression of pks2 gene in the case of wildtype infection, while in the phoP mutant infections the effect is considerably minor since the GFP fluor escence levels registered are much lower in a regular infection (Figure 24).

Once inside the cells the mycobacteria are rapidly engulfed in the phagosome, trying to contain the infection. Meanwhile, Mtb sens es the host signals and activates its virulence netw ork in order to protect itself and to avoid lysosomal fusion of the phagosome through the manipulation of host signal transduction pathways, this ability gives it the capacity to persist and rep licate within macrophages [42]. In the present study we wanted to analyze the host signal(s) th at activates the PhoPR TCS of Mtb. In a first approach we used a gene activity reporte r system based on the fusion of some PhoPregulated genes promoter region with gfp (green fluorescent protein) gene to perform a wider study of different stress cond itions. But GFP has a limitation since it is necessary to accumulate enough protein a mounts to be detected by the fluorimeter. Consequently the response we register is sl ower than the real one. Finally we carried out a deeper gene expression study through R NA extraction and semiquantitative qRTPCR where expression of the genes is dete cted in a much direct and reliable way. Based on our results studying the effect of several extracellul ar stimuli, PhoP system might respond to acidic pH and it triggers the expression of th e PhoP \"core\" regulon. The acidic pH is one of the first stresses that mycobacteria ha ve to face inside the macrophage phagosome. Besides th ese extracellular assays, we va lidated our hypothesis exvivo, where we were able to observe a response in the activity of pks2, chosen as PhoP regulon reporter gene, under intracellular condi tions. There was a notably increase in the expression of pks2 when Mtb is infecting phagocytic cells, meanwhile no changes are detected when is infecting nonphagocy tic cells or when the infection is carried out with the phoP mutant strain, demonstrating once again that it is a PhoPdependent phenotype . Additionally, the expression is repressed when we used a phagosomal acidification inhibitor during the infection of phagocytic cells, reinforcing the suggested role of the pH in activating PhoPR. Chapter 2 126 W e p r o p o s e t h a t t h e a c i d i c e n v i r o n m e n t i n i t i a t e s a s p e c i f i c k i n etic mechanism activating PhoPRregulated genes depending on the lifecycle of Mtb during infection. One of the first genes expressed when the bacteria are exposed to acidic conditions are those implicated in lipid metabolism, like pks2, which is highly overexpressed at very short times of acidic exposure. There is also overexpressi on of lipF and pks3 genes. It is possible that, to face the acidic environment, the bacter ia activates the production of SL, DAT and PAT which have an important role in the hostmyc obacteria interaction and mainly modifies components of the cell wall to protect itse lf [54]. These responses w e r e o n l y r e g i s t e r e d f o r t h e w i l d t y p e s t r a i n , b u t n o t f o r t h e phoP mutant one, demonstrating that is a PhoPmediated response. Genes involved in oxidative stress like nark1 are also overexpressed at short times after exposure to acidic pH; its product is implicated in the e xcretion of nitrite, helping the bacteria to face the respiratory stress [45, 49]. Likewise the acidic stress, the oxidative stress is a mechanism of phagosomal defense against b acteria, so it could be possible that in response to acidic stress, PhoP also activates the genes to help the bacteria to survive inside the macrophage. Meanwhile mcr7 which is the most PhoPregulated region, it is not responding to acidic pH at short times of exposure. A highly marked overexpre ssion started up to day 6 of exposure. Mcr7 was predicted to highly interact with ribo some binding site of the tatC gene, Mcr7 probably prevents ribosome loading and consequently translation of tatC mRNA. TatC gene encodes a transmembrane protein part of the Ta tABC secretory apparatus required for export of proteins with a twin arginine motif such as the Ag85 complex, immunodominant antigens involved in binding to human f ibronectin important for cell adhesion and invasion [14]. Consequently, ac tivation of mcr7 at long time postinfection would result in decreased export of Ag85 co mplex. C h a p t e r 2 127 According to the results, we propose a model of virulence where Mtb needs to interact with the host once it is engulfed by the macrophage in order to stimulate the innate immune response [42]. Inside the macrophage, bacteria are rapid ly absorbed by the phagosome where it will find a hostile environment with acidic pH and oxidative stress mainly [53]. Acidic pH might activate the PhoPR TCS, starting t he regulatory cascade. In this early phase of the infection it is important the presence of immunodominant agents as the Ag85 complex [55] or the sulfolipids present in t he envelope [54], for these to occur it would be a reforming process of the cell wall in order to protect the bacteria and to stimulate host interactions. The first genes ac tivated by the PhoP transcriptional regulator and, c onsequently expressed, are thos e implicated in the lipid metabolism as pks2, pks3 and lipF; nark1 gene is also expressed in this early response to help facing the oxidative str ess. The PhoPregulated region, mcr7 i n c r e a s e i t s expression levels at long postinfection times. Since mcr7 r e g u l a t e s t h e p o s t translational inhibition of the TAT secretory system, low level s of mcr7 at early times postinfection suggest us the importance of having this secreto ry system actively working in order to allow immunodominant TATsubstrates (Ag85 c omplex) to be secreted by mycobacteria to interact with the host and to stimu late the immune system [23, 56]. In this regard it is important to remember tha t mycobacterial antigens are evolutionarily hyperconserved (Figure 25). This highlight t he importance of immune recognition of Mtb [57]. On the other hand, the and EspC are well known to be also PhoPdependent, is going to play a key role [27] in inducing the phagoso mal rupture and in consequence Mtb will escape to the cytosol [9]. This will happen up to 35 days post infection (Figure 25), being ESAT6 and CFP10 the key effector molecules of the ESX1 system, gene rating pores in the phagosomal membrane and inducing the escape to the cytosol of M tb [27]. Phagosomal escape allows the mycobacteria to overcome the immun e control and favor bacterial dissemination [36], reported ESX1 related effe cts in tubercle bacilli th desc envir phag the T from these cytos imm ter 2 e 25.

Subsequent to phagocytosis, in order to avoid the acidified environment generated by the phagosomelysosome fusio n, some specialized intracellular into the cytosol [6 062]. In contrast, Mtb has been described as a bacterium that resists de gradation in the phagosome by inhibiting the fusio n with lysosomes, a characteri stic feature that seems to protect the bacilli from bacte ricidal mechanisms of the phag ocytes and allows intracellular survival and multiplication; at later stages of i nfection ESX1dependent vacuolar breakage might be an important requirement for the pat hogenic potential of Mtb [63]. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated how the par tial inhibition of phagosome acidification emerges as a prerequisite to mycobacter ial phagosomal rupture, plausible only when phagosome acidification is partial ly inhibited, mycobacteria may survive; use their virulence factors and induc e phagosomal membrane disruption [63]. Concluding, our results strongly suggest the key role of the ac idic stress in the activation of the key TCS PhoPR, which not only initiates the m ycobacterial mechanism of virulence but also carry out its function as transcriptional regulator during infection depending on the lifecycle of Mtb and its needs (Figure 26).

C h a p t e r 3 135 Chapter 3: Study of a new vaccine generation based on MTBVAC zmp1 -. Chapter 3 136 C h a p t e r 3 137 INTRODUCTION The only existing licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) is an attenuated strain of M. bovis Bacille CalmetteGuerin (BCG) which has been used worldwide si nce 1921 when it was first administrated to a newborn with a household c ontact of TB. BCG confers protection against severe forms of TB (meningitis and m iliary TB) in children but lacks consistency preventing the pulmonary disease, the mos t common transmissible form [1]. Even though BCG is considered very safe , serious immunodeficiency states have been associated with increased ris k of systemic BCG dissemination postvaccination [2]. The risk groups, for which vaccination with BCG is contraindicated, include patients with primary and secondary im munodeficiency and HIVinfected people, including HIVinfected newborn infants [1] . There has been particular concern in HIV implications into BCG vaccination saf ety [3]. A recent retrospective study documented a high frequency of BCG infectio n with complications in HIVinfected infants [4]. Curre nt WHO vaccination policy inc ludes a recommendation not to vaccinate with BCG infants known to be HIVinfected, wit h or without infection symptoms [1]. Very substantial efforts have been made over the past decade to develop vaccines against TB, including vaccines targeting individuals in risk of immune suppression [5]. Various preventive strategies in the current Global TB vaccine Portfolio include recombinant BCG strains, boost su bunit vaccines for use in BCG immunized individuals or live attenuated M. tuberculosis (Mtb) strains at different stages of clinical and preclinical trial development [6]. MTBVAC, a live attenuated Mtb va ccine based on two independent stable deletion mutations, without antibiotic resistance markers, in the virule nce genes phoP and fadD26, is currently the first and only vaccine to fulfill the Geneva consensus criteria for progressing new live mycobacterial vaccines to clinical eva luation [7, 8]. MTBVAC has been the first vaccine based on Mtb attenuation to enter an d complete clinical Chapter 3 138 phase I trials (NCT02013245) [9], and currently has entered in clinical trials phase II with newborns in South Africa (NCT02729571). Considering individuals in risk of immune suppression as a poss ible target population for MTBVAC, here we describe the hyperattenuated profile of a v accine based on MTBVAC with an additional inactivation in the zmp1 gene. This gene encodes a putative cteria [10]. The zmp1 gene plays a critical role in preventing the inflammasome acti vation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex composed by members of t he cytosolic sensor proteins family called nucleotide binding oligomerizatio n domain which, once activated upon recognition of pathogenassociated molecules in the extracellular or the intracellular compartments, drives the activation of proca in an autocrine and paracrine fashion triggers the phagosome fusion w ith intracellular lysosomes and the early inflammatory response [11]. Phagolysosomes are equipped with the machinery to generate pept ideMHC class II complexes, and inhibition of phagosomelysosome fusion is one p roposed mechanism by which Mtb may escape efficient MHC class II antigen presenta tion [12]. Arrest of phagosome maturation may also affect of myco bacterial peptides via the putative phagosometocytosol MHC class II antigen pres entation pathway or via MHC class I presentation that occurs by fusion and fission of phagosomes with endoplasmic reticulumderived ve sicles containing newly synthes i z e d M H C c l a s s I molecules [13]. Consequently an Mtb strain, with zmp1 disrupted, during mice infection might allow the inflammasome activation and an increased IL1 secretion, which is traduced in an enhanced maturation of mycobacte rialcontaining phagosomes, in a better MHC I antigen in an improved mycobacterial cl earance by macrophages and lower bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice [10]. C h a p t e r 3 139 Here we describe the constructio n and preclinical characterizat ion of a liveattenuated vaccine based on Mtb ( phoP-, fadD26- and zmp1-) conceived to be administrated to patients in risk of immune suppression.

A s a result there is urgent need for effective vaccines that could arrest the social and medical problem caused by TB. One of the advantages of using live attenuated Mt b vaccines is that major antigens lost during BCG attenuation would still be retai ned [15, 16], thus providing a rational solution for replacing BCG. Moreover BCG v accination is contraindicated in patients with primary and secondary immunode ficiencies including HIVinfected people [1]. As a result, development of effective TB vaccines safer than BCG that could be used in this p opulation is also urgently need ed. The main challenge in the development of live vaccines is achie ving a satisfactory level of safety (attenuation) without severely compromising vaccine i mmunogenicity and protectiveness. There are examples in the existing literature i n the field of invention of liveattenuated Mtb mutants as vaccine candidates that even tho ugh attenuated, confer protection levels, against infection, comparable to BCG. The single auxotroph mutant of Mtb deficient in the biosynthesis of leucine (H37Rv leu) exhibits attenuation in vitro and in vivo but is characterized by poor p rotective efficacy relative to BCG [17]. Whereas the lysine auxotroph of Mtb was only able to induce similar protection as BCG against TB challenge when (H37Rv panCD), which exhibits of attenuation, can induce protection comparable to BCG in a single dose of adm inistration [19]. When combining the auxotrophic mutations to generate a safer double auxotroph of Mtb on the resulting candidates are highly attenuat ed but does not increase the protection induced by the pantothenate auxotroph s train [19, 20]. These Chapter 3 148 evidences strongly suggest a nonadditive effect of the second mutation either in protection or attenuation. M. bovis BCG zmp1 mutant has been studied and it presents a phenotype with an increase in presentation of MHC class IIrestricted antigens. D eletion of the zmp1 gene reestablished the activation of the inflammasome and consequent l y t h e f u l l maturation of the phagosome into phagolysosome, leading to the clearance of the pathogen [11]. Results suggest that phagosome maturation and ly sosomal delivery of BCG facilitate mycobacterial antigen presentation and enhance i mmunogenicity [12]. Safety of BCG zmp1 mutant strains was studied in a recent work; safety profile of BCG Denmark tested in immunocompromised CB17 SCID mice in parallel with their parental strains, showing that the median survival was prolonged for 50150 days for each mutant strain, indicatin g that they are attenuated when compared to their BCG parental strains [22]. Fu rthermore zmp1 deletion mutants of BCG provided enhanced protection by reducin g the bacterial load of tubercle bacilli in the lungs of infected guinea pigs, makin g BCGzmp1mutants promising candidates for further vaccine development [22]. Based on these last results on BCG zmp1-, here we present the triple mutant MTBVAC zmp1- as a vaccine candidate with protective capacity against TB infe ction holding potential use for patients in risk of immune suppression. Howev er no special hyper attenuated phenotype was observed when compared with MTBVAC in the survival study with SCID mice, the immunoco mpromised mice infected with MTBVAC zmp1- survive 134 days and the ones infected with MTBVAC 127 days; on the other hand, they do survive longer than BCG Pasteur infected mice. The zmp1 mutation introduced in MTBVAC ( phoP- and fadD26-) does not seem to present any effect in attenuation and it does not affect the protection ability of the vaccine ag ainst TB infection either when compared to MTBVAC vaccine candidate, which is coherent wi th the first studies performed in mice with BCG zmp1-, where no difference in attenuation were registered [12]. When compared to BCG, protection conferred in this model has no C h a p t e r 3 149 significant differences; however the BCG zmp1- vaccine candidate did not show any improvement in protection in the mouse model, only in guinea pi gs [22]. This work was done in parallel with the development of the trip le mutant MTBVAC erp- in our group. Nevertheless our triple mutant MTBVAC zmp1- does not present the attenuated profile presented a hyperattenua tion phenotype in SCID mice. In this case, the erp mutation introduced in MTBVAC ( phoP- and fadD26-) likely presents a synergic effect in attenuation that not affects the protection ability of the vaccine against TB infection [23]. The absence of hyper attenuation in SCID mice for the triple mu tant MTBVAC zmp1- drives it out of consideration f or a future prophylactic strate gy development for use in individuals at risk of immune s uppression. Nevertheless, furthe r studies are needed in other animal models in order to establish any conclusions in th e protective capacity of our candidate MTBVAC zmp1-. Chapter 3 150 REFERENCES 1. WHO.

MTBVAC presents an increased secretion of immunodominant antige ns, like the components of the Antigen 85 complex, through the upregulat ion of TAT secretion system. Also presents an impaired phenotype for ESX1 secretion system substrates, like the key virulence factor ESAT6; althou gh it does not secrete it, MTBVAC does produce and accumulate it inside the ba cteria, allowing the presentation of ESAT6 epitopes to the immune syst em once the bacteria are degraded. These two facts suggest that the vaccine candidate MTBVAC is going to generate a better immune response and protec tion than the actual vaccine BCG. 2. MTBVAC presents an altered intracellular trafficking phenotype where it is not able to arrest phagosomal maturation at early stage but it does not reach the lysosome, suggesting that it arrest the maturation in some inte rmediate point between the late endosome and the lysosome phases. 3. The single mutations phoP and fadD26 of MTBVAC have a synergistic effect on the intracellular trafficking phenotype of the vaccine candidat e. 4. Acid pH might activate the Mtb TCS PhoPR, starting a cascade of events where lipid metabolism and defense against oxidative stress are upreg ulated at short times; and where the TAT secretor y system works normally secret ing the immunodominant components of the Antigen 85 complex in order to stimulate the host interactions. After 35 days, the components of the RD 1, ESAT6 and CFP10 induce phagosomal ruptur e and bacteria will reside in th e cell cytosol; at this time an upregulation of Mcr7 ncRNA is registered and co nsequently, Antigen 85 complex secretion through the TAT secretory system w ill be interrupted in order to \"hide\" from the host immune system. General Conclusions 154 5. No improvements in attenuation or immunogenicity were registere d for the new strain MTBVAC zmp1- compared with MTBVAC in mouse model.

For the intracellular trafficking study the Mt103 strain [1] an d its phoP and fadD26 mutants were used, also the vaccine candidate MTBVAC [2] and th e BCG Pasteur containing an integrative plasmid with the gfp gene preceded by a strong promoter. Mt103 and the vaccine candidate MTBVAC were used in the comparative analysis of the secreted proteins. Mt103 and its zmp1 mutant, MTBVAC zmp1 and BCG Pasteur were used in the study of a new hyper attenuated vaccine generation. All M. tuberculosis (Mtb) strains were grown at 37C in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with ADC (Difco). In order to keep the culture clumpfree, Tween80 was added to a f inal concentration of 0.05% (7H9TADC). Solid medium was Middlebrook 7H10 supplement ed with ADC (7H10ADC), 2% sucrose was added if appropriate. Km (20 g/ml) or Hyg (50 g/ml) were added if appropriate. Liquid cultures were done in cell cu lture flask without shaking. In order to study the PhoPregu lon expression under different c onditions, wild type Mtb H37Rv [5] and promoter, pFPV27GFP:: icl promoter and pFPV27GFP:: phoP promoter were used. For the study of the promoter expression under acidic conditions, t he pH of the 7H9T medium was modified with HCl 6N or KOH 1N until the wanted pH, then supplemented with ADC; using different sources of carbon, strains were grown in 7H9T medium supplemented with AS (0.5% (C 2H3NaO2) or Napropionate (C 3H5O2Na); under hypoxic conditions, 1.5 g/ml of blue methylene was added to the 7H9TADC in control samples in order to know when the O 2 of the medium has been consumed; using a concentration range o f different ions, for ZnSO 4 or CuSO 4 from 450 M to 0M and CaCl 2 from 8mM to from 8mM to 0mM modified Sauton without stress, 0mM, 10mM or 15mM H 2O2 w a s a d d e d t o 7 H 9 T supplemented with ADS (0.5% BSA, 0.2% dextrose, 0.085% grown in 7H9TADC and incubated at room temperature, 37C and 42C; fatty 0.001% acid and 0.001% oleic acid were added to 7H9TADC. All the culture media used were supplemented with Km (20 g/ml). Storage of strains was done at 80C in 7H9TADC supplemented with 15% glycerol. Mtb manipulation was carried out a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. 1.2. Neutralred staining. This method was adapted from Soto el al. [6] mycobacterial strains were grown on 7H10 ADC medium for 3 to 4 weeks. Cells were placed and gently disaggregated in 15ml Falcon tubes containing 4ml of 50% aqueous methanol, and i ncubated for 37C. Cells were pelleted by sodium barbital in 5% NaCl, pH=9. 8) were added. Subsequently, 150 l of a solution of 0.05% aqueous neutral red were added. Result s were evaluated after 1h incubation at 37C. Materials and Methods 161 2.

Briefly, pH=8) and heated for 10min at 85C. Samples were slightly cooled at RT be fore adding 50 l of 10mg/ml lysozyme and were then incubated for at least 1h at 37 C. Subsequently, 75l of a solution containing 72.5 l of 10% SDS and 2.5 l of 20mg/ml proteinase K were added and the suspension warmed for samples incubated further 10min at 65C. Genomic DNA was ex tracted by adding 750l of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 24:1. Samples were mixed by vor texing for 10s before centrifugation (13000rpm for 5min). The upper (aqueous) phase was t r a n s f e r r e d t o a f r e s h t u b e c o n t a i n i n g 4 5 0 l isopropanol and samples incubated overnight at 20C. Precipitated nucleic acids were collected b y centrifugation (13000rpm for 10min at 4C). The pellets were dissolved in 50 l doubledistilled water and treated with RNAse. DNA was quantified by Abs 260nm readings using a ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). 2.1.2. Plasmid extraction from E. coli. 2.1.2.1. Mini preparation (Miniprep). 1.5ml of a liquid culture grown overnight were centrifuged (100 00rpm for 3min) and the pellet resuspended in EDTA, 2mM Tris HCl II (0.2M NaOH, 1% SDS) were added, a nd the content mixed by inverting the tube several times, until it becomes transparent and viscous. After incubation on ice for 5min, 150 l of cold Solution III (5M KAc, 11.5% glacial HAc) were added and the tubes were mixed by inversion; as a result, a white pellet is formed. This mix was incubated on ice for 5min, follo wed by centrifugation Materials and Methods 162 (12000rpm for 10min). Supernatants (400 l approx.) were then transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with the same volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcoh ol 24:1. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a tube con taining 900 l EtOH and 50l 3M acids pelleted, and then washed with 100l 70% EtOH. Finally, the pellet was dried in a vacuum drier and resuspended in 30l of double distilled water. RNA, which copurifies with plasmi dic DNA, was removed by adding 1 l of RNAse 1mg/ml and incubating for 15min at kept at 20C. 2.1.2.2. Maxipreparation (Maxiprep). This method was used to obtain large quantities of plasmid. The process is the same as the minipreparation, but starting with 100ml of liquid culture . Larger volumes of solutions are needed: 5ml Solution I, 10ml Solution II and 7.5m l Solution II. Besides, precipitation of plasmid DNA is done by adding 0.7 volumes of i sopropanol instead of ethanol. Finally, nucleic acids are dissolved in 350 l of double distilled water and treated with 10 l RNAse 1mg/ml for 15min at 37C. 2.2. Mycobacterial RNA isolation. 2.2.1.

The upper (aqueous) pha s e w a s t h e n transferr ed to a fresh tube co ntai ning 90 l of 0.3M NaAc (pH=5.5) and 900 l of isopropanol incubated overnight at 20C. Prec ipitated nucleic acids were collected by centrifugation (14000rpm for 1 hour at 4C). The pellets were rinsed with 70% ethanol and air dried before being redissolved in RNA sefree water. DNA was removed from RNA samples using Turbo DNA free (Ambion) by i ncubation at RT for 1hour 30min. Then RNA was pu rified with acidphenol:chlorof orm (5:1, pH=4.5) and the same steps to precipitate, collect and dry were repeate d to dissolve RNA in RNAsefree water. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA was estimated from the Abs 260nm/Abs280nm readings using ND1000 spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was assessed by agarose gel elect rophoresis. RNA samples were s tored at 80C. 2.2.2. RNA isolation in intracellular conditions. Intracellular mycobacteria RNA extraction was performed with a modified protocol based on the one described by Fontan el al. [8].
