And regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, most health-care leaders agree that accountable care in one form or another is here to stay. As more hospitals, physicians and pay - ors nationwide enter into integrated care models, the time is ripe for hospi-tal leaders to consider issues ACOs will face during formation, in order to ad-dress the biggest mistakes they might make on the path to starting one. In the coming months, as more ACOs devel - op, there will likely be a clearer picture of all the issues an ACO could run up against. For now though, here's a list of some mistakes that could spell serious trouble for an up-and-coming ACO. The Future of the American Hospital: Role and Relevancy in the Next Decade By Molly Gamble If predictions ever hold weight, they certainly don't in the healthcare industry. Too much is prone to change \u2014 like the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which awaits its summer Supreme Court rul-ing. When components of an industry as large as its entire reform law aren't even certain, it's tough to say what is. 11 Hospital, Health System Executive Compensation Trends By Sabrina Rodak Hospital and health system executive compensation is affected by several factors in the healthcare industry, including a greater focus on quality and patient satisfaction, as well as consumers' increasing involvement in their healthcare. As healthcare organizations face the uncertainty of the healthcare reform law's constitutionality and changing regulatory requirements, the need to recruit and retain strong leaders may be more important than ever. Here are 11 hospital and health system executive compensation trends experts are seeing in the current market. continued on page 8continued on page 21 continued on page 30 SPECIAL COMPENSATION ISSUE: 200 Statistics on Physician Compensation & Much More! p. 20 SUBSCRIBE T ODAy!

We are pleased to share with you the June special issue of Becker's Hospital Review. This \"Special Compensation Issue\" features more than 300 statistics and benchmarks on hospital executive and physician compensation. It also includes two of our most popular annual lists, \"100 Great Places to Work in Healthcare\" and \"100 Great Hospitals\" featuring outstanding healthcare organizations across the country of all sizes and types that have demonstrated excellence. Also included in this issue are Q&As with two leading hospital executives: Amir Rubin, CEO of Stan-ford Hospital & Clinics and Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, CEO of Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago, part of Vanguard Health Systems. Both share their insight on challenges facing their organizations and opportunities ahead for healthcare delivery. ACOs. CMS recently announced the names of 27 organizations which will be the first to participate in the agency's Medicare Shared Savings Program. These organizations join 32 Pioneer Accountable Care Orga-nizations and other commercial ACOs currently in operation across the country. CMS is continuing to accept applications for the MSSP . While the future success of the ACO model is one that is still hotly debated, there are certainly a number of health systems that have not been afraid to embark on testing the model. In this issue, you'll find a handful of stories directly related to effective ACO operations including: \"8 Biggest Mistakes an ACO Can Make\" and \"7 Steps to Navigate Payment Allocation Under ACOs.\"upcoming events. If your hospital or health system operates or has joint ventured on an ambulatory surgery center or is considering doing so, please save the date for our 19th Annual Ambulatory Surgery Centers Conference, October 25-27, 2012, at the Swissotel Chicago.

Will hospitals remain the cornerstone of community healthcare? Could hospital beds become void of certain diseases as medical discoveries either cure them or drive their treatment into alternative care settings? Will mediocre hospitals drop like flies in the next 10 years, while others behave like other consumer-oriented American industries, such as banks? The questions vary but share this common theme: The role of the Ameri- can hospital is about to undergo some serious change. Fewer heads in beds The growth of outpatient service utilization is going to present the larg- est change to hospitals' strategic plans in the next decade. Care delivery in the outpatient setting is expected to grow exponentially by 2022, redefin - ing hospitals' reliance on some of the most lucrative service lines. Sg2, a healthcare analytics firm based in Skokie, Ill., estimates a 27 percent growth in outpatient cancer care within the next 10 years. Other specialties ex- pected to boom in this environment include general surgery (23 percent), neurosciences (22 percent) and cardiovascular (19 percent). A simultaneous decline in hospital inpatient services is expected, affect - ing a range of specialties. Cardiovascular care will take the largest hit, according to Sg2, experiencing a 27 percent drop in inpatient volume by 2022. Recent studies and reports have already shown a dramatic shift in treatment locations for some of the country's most prevalent and serious conditions. From 1998 through 2008, heart failure-related hospitaliza-tions declined by roughly 30 percent. 1 In 1987, the share of total cancer costs resulting from inpatient admissions stood at 64 percent. Between 2001 and 2005, that figure plummeted to 27 percent, according to a 2010 study 2 published in Cancer.2 These developments and forecasts have left hospital leaders re-examining their business strategies and how they plan to respond to changes in pa-tient volume. In an interview last year, Kevin Tabb, MD, CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said his organization is turning away from the heads-in-beds business model. \"In the past we thought about, 'How do we get more referrals here downtown?' That's not the model for the future,\" he said in a recent report by Boston's NPR news station. In-stead of focusing acutely on referrals and patient volume, Dr. Tabb said he sees his hospital becoming part of a larger ecosystem. Craig Rhyne, MD, CMO of Lubbock, Texas-based Covenant Health Sys - tem, also anticipates a decline in the relevance of inpatient volume. \"As cost containment efforts continue in healthcare, there must be a greater emphasis placed on keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital. This will probably come in some form of community wellness model where physicians and hospitals are rewarded for treating conditions on outpatient basis before they become so severe that they actually require hospitaliza - tion,\" he says. Finding new niches in the healthcare ecosystem These clinical changes raise questions over whether wellness maintenance \u2014 opposed to treating the acutely-ill \u2014 is a viable business strategy for hospitals. The country's top-tier hospitals have tailored their specialty pro - grams to incorporate survivorship services, health education and therapy. These multidisciplinary elements may have been deemed somewhat un- common only a few years ago in traditional hospital-based treatment but have become staples in patient-centered disease management. \"Cancer used to be about surgery. Now treatment is increasingly focused on sur - vivorship,\" says Eric Louie, MD, CMO with Sg2. \"All of it is moving to a wellness focus.\" There is a distinct need for wellness services, particularly in the framework of today's healthcare continuum that aims for seamless care delivery. Hos-pitals are responding to declined inpatient volumes by finding other ways to add value to the healthcare continuum \u2014 and it's more than a gym. \"I don't think providing a gym for people is a business strategy, necessarily,\" says Steve Lefar, president of Sg2. \"But, providing the kind of care that keeps people well and has the right incentives \u2014 that will be a strategy. This is an issue of value. Those [hospitals] delivering that kind of value will have more patients sent to them.\" For example, one of the survivorship programs offered at Johns Hopkins' Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center is specifically designed for breast cancer patients. The program's website 3 says \"living through treat - ment is only half the story,\" and emphasizes the need for hospital-based survivorship services, as \"there is no organized system in place to ensure communication between a woman's cancer specialist and primary care pro - vider once treatment is completed.\" Groundbreaking advancements in genetic counseling services will help providers make enormous strides in preventive care and are likely to signal a sea change in healthcare. \"The advent of modern genomics and the abil-ity to understand what drives illness at a personal level will have an extraor - dinary impact,\" says Mr. Lefar. \"We'll have a much better understanding of what people need to do to stay well,\" he says. Dr. Rhyne also anticipates fewer people dying in hospitals within the next few years. He also expects a change in public perception \u2014 people will no longer expect patients with fatal diagnoses to die in a hospital bed. \"The custom of dying only in a hospital is a fairly recent event,\" says Dr. Rhyne. \"Prior to 50 or 60 years ago, most patients actually died in their home.\" Dr. Rhyne says that when hospital services or treatment no longer offer substantial hope for recovery or improvement, more patients may choose to die in their homes. The partnering phenomenon The odds of a hospital surviving on its own \u2014 without being part of this healthcare ecosystem \u2014 are low, leaving many partnering, forming clinical affiliations, merging or selling. The current wave of hospital consolidation has involved unlikely suitors, such as for-profit corporations, private equity firms and insurance companies. Religiously-affiliated institutions are also pairing with public, secular ones \u2014 the New York Times 4 recently reported 20 such transactions within the past three years. Fewer independent hospitals will make it to 2022 without striking some type of deal with a larger healthcare system, but there is a new facet to the pending consolidation. With more options available today than 10 years ago, the million-dollar question has been extended beyond whether a hospi- tal will merge or partner, to what it will merge or partner with, and how it will work as a local system. Whether under the Medicare Shared Savings Program or a private, com- mercial model, accountable care organizations are a significant driver in healthcare consolidation. ACOs incentivize providers to control costs within the continuum of care, such as primary care, home healthcare, outpatient clinics and preventive services. This incentive makes integrated delivery systems the best option. \"ACOs offer a model in which hospitals may be integrated, though perhaps on a limited basis, into a wellness deliv-ery paradigm,\" says John Romley, PhD, an economist with the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at University of South-ern California. \"Watching the rollout of ACOs will be fascinating.\" While short of a strict merger or acquisition, providers are likely to col- laborate for clinical purposes as well, especially in the age of personalized medicine. Medicine based on individual risk assessments or genetic coding is still novel, and a recent PwC report said hospitals that make long-term investments in genetic medicine and partner \u2014 with organizations either inside or outside the healthcare industry \u2014 are most likely to succeed in The Future of the American Hospital: Role and Relevancy in the Next Decade (continued from page 1)9 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 competitive environments. \"Personalized medicine is a highly complex field, and no one organization or industry has all the resources, knowledge and tools needed to implement personalized medicine,\" the report read. No more flying under the radar America's hospitals are likely to be fewer in number albeit better quality by 2022, and financial performance won't be the only factor driving some hos-pitals' fallout. Increased transparency around hospital quality and the Value Based Purchasing Program, slated to go into effect in October 2012, have refined accountability in healthcare. The VBP Program is based on mea-sures used in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program, including patient experience measures as indicated by CMS' HCAHPS survey. Patient experience ratings will determine 30 percent of the total VBP bo- nus payments. The HCAHPS survey asks patients a variety of questions, including one in which they must rank their hospital stay on a scale from one through 10. Aside from government regulation, marketplace competi - tion is also propelling hospitals to vie for patients by posting the prices of their most common procedures online \u2014 a practice that has traditionally been unheard of. \"Up until now, we haven't had appropriate transparency around perfor - mance and quality,\" says Dr. Louie. \"In transparency's absence, a lot of hospitals flew under the radar. Now, low-performers are falling by the way - side.\" As hospitals publish infection rates online for patients to view, or choose to post prices, they are beginning to resemble other industries that have been sharing similar information for years. Modeling other industries in the face of increased competition Hospitals are finding themselves in a game of consumerism catch-up, ac-cording to Mr. Lefar. Business innovation in the hospital industry mildly resembles that which banks experienced. The emergence of convenient, transparent and customer-centered strategies like ATMs and online bank-ing bears resemblance to telemedicine, for example. But hospitals still have a ways to go, according to Mr. Lefar. \"The demands from consumers are for this industry to behave more like other industries,\" he says. Although people can deposit checks from home and sign mortgages online \u2014 and have been able to do so for years \u2014 making an appointment with a physician online from the comforts of home is still considered novel. American hospitals are likely to face a larger pool of competitors as well, including some entities that may have been less of a concern in the past. For example, even the country's most reputable and financially sound hos-pitals haven't been immune to the competition of retail walk-in clinics in neighborhood CVS and Wal-Mart stores. Many physicians are quick to deem these care settings \"as cheap, unwor - thy competitors,\" according to a 2009 New York Times 5 report, but more recently hospital systems have joined their ranks in a move to own one more piece of the care continuum. In 2009, Cleveland Clinic partnered with CVS stores in northeastern Ohio and took over nine of the stores' MinuteClinics, assigning a physician to each one. Mayo Clinic did the same thing in 2008 when it began opening retail clinics in grocery stores within the Rochester, Minn.-area. Will a change in role mean a change in relevance? Role and relevance are entwined in any industry, begging the question of whether the American hospital will hold the same relevance in 2022 that it does today. Hospitals as many Americans know them today are likely to evolve into integrated, multidimensional institutions \u2014 much more than a building to visit when you're sick. \"In a broader sense, as a convener of human activities and resources to deliver wellness care, [the hospital] will flourish. That will expand beyond the four walls of the traditional hospital,\" says Dr. Louie. \"That's the role the hospital of the old will fulfill in the new world.\" n Footnotes : 1 Jersey Chen, Sharon-Lise T.

Hospital & Clinics is known worldwide for advanced treat-ment of complex disorders in areas such as cardiovascular care, cancer treatment, neuro-sciences, surgery and organ transplants. It is cur - rently ranked No. 17 on the U.S. News & World Report's \"America's Best Hospitals\" list and No. 1 in the San Jose metropolitan area. Stanford Hospital is also internationally recognized for translating medical breakthroughs into the care of patients. For instance, Stanford Hospital recent - ly became the first hospital in Northern California to have the Solitaire FR, a new FDA-approved de - vice to remove blood clots, available for use. Amir Dan Rubin leads Stanford Hospital as president and CEO. Previously he served as COO of the 832-bed UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, where he oversaw an operating budget of $1.6 billion. Since his appointment in 2011, Mr. Rubin has maintained Stanford's repu-tation as a leading healthcare provider. Here he discusses how focusing on the orga- nization's vision rather than finances, transpar - ency and a \"Lean\" approach to performance im-provement help him guide Stanford into a future that is better than its past 50 years. Question: You became CEO of Stan- ford Hospital & Clinics in January 2011 during what could certainly be called an uncertain time in healthcare with reform and payment issues. How have you approached your role as CEO in light of those issues? Mr. Rubin: Fundamentally as CEO, I focus on our core mission and vision. Our mission is to care, educate and discover. Our vision is to heal human-ity through science and compassion one patient at a time. While we must be thoughtful with what's going on in the regulatory and payment environ-ment, our core focus needs to always be on provid-ing outstanding care to each and every patient we serve. We constantly focus on that ideal. Stanford's mission and vision guide how I ap- proach my CEO role as well, and all other fac - tors are seen as contributing criteria or factors which we need to address. However, these fac - tors need to be secondary issues to our goal of healing humanity, one patient at a time. While in my role, it is important to be thoughtful and mindful about what's changing in the environ - ment around us, it doesn't fundamentally change who we are or what we do.Q: You mentioned Stanford's longtime mission and vision of healing human-ity one patient at a time. Does Stanford have any other current goals driving its outcomes and care? ADR: Stanford has enjoyed great success. Over the last 50 years, we have had five Nobel prizes, carried out the first heart-lung transplant in the world, and were the first in the world to use a lin-ear accelerator for cancer treatment, among oth-er notable accomplishments. Our big vision now is trying to have as great of an impact on the world of healthcare, if not a greater one, over next 50 years. We are working on sequencing hu-man genomes, conducting innovative stem cell research, and we were one of the earliest adopt-ers of electronic health records in the country. Overall, we are focusing on how to visualize and advance improved, evidence-based healthcare. Q: I imagine that working to produce outcomes to rival the great accomplish - ments Stanford has had in the past can be challenging. How do you encourage an environment conducive to improve-ment and advancement in healthcare treatment, research and technology? ADR: I have learned to try to understand the core operations and processes beneath things, to not just accept them at face value and move on. Often when you do that, you find there isn't a lot of logic to why things are the way they are. So why not change it for the better? Here at Stanford we use the \"Lean\" process improve - ment approach or methodology. It derives from the Toyota Production System. It engages people to improve their performance and the performance of the hospital. You look at the hospital processes and identify which area is adding value, which area is delivering great val-ue and which area is a waste of time. The Lean Process follows the idea that by systematically and continuously improving processes, and by engaging the team, we can develop an organiza-tion that is focused, every day, on being better than it was before. Q: Stanford is currently building a $2 billion hospital facility. A project of that scale must require a lot of hard work and dedication from you, administra-tion and employees. How have you approached your leadership through such a large project?ADR: The administration and I approach the project in a very collaborative and transparent way, with great rigor and discipline. From the beginning, it has been transparent. We welcomed all the neces-sary constituents to be involved in the design. We had teams of physicians, nurses, staff and commu-nity members thinking about the design, workflow and how to make the facility a safe and healing environment. Our project approval process was also very transparent. We probably had 100 open community meetings that presented the design of the new hospital and the key components. We had great participation from all types of constituents. As we move forward and operationalize the design, we are still thinking about the team members, the patients and the families. We also have had a lot of engagement with Sili- con Valley organizations such as Oracle, Hewlett Packard, Apple, Cisco and others. As we think of the future with the new hospital, we wanted it to be a test bed and innovation center. It has been incredible to leverage the expertise and ca-pabilities here in California's Silicon Valley. Q: I imagine with all the involvement of constituents and stakeholders that you received lots of perspectives and vary - ing feedback. How do you work through all those opinions and suggestions? A \"Lean\" Vision Drives Stanford Hospital & Clinics' Performance: Q&A With CEO Amir Dan Rubin By Kathleen Roney 17 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 ADR: First, we sorted and grouped the feed - back based on the different constituent voices. We learned many great things from staff and physicians. Then we tried try to incorporate the ideas into the design itself \u2014 how the facility will flow and how patients and families will in-teract with the facility. We took the feedback, and at the end of the day, it is memorialized in the bricks, in the mortar, in the processes and in the information technology of the new hospital. Q: Stanford has been able to maintain very positive revenues despite a chal-lenging healthcare environment and while building a large new hospital facil-ity. What has helped Stanford to maintain such positive financial management? ADR: We think primarily about patient care. We seek to deliver both leading edge and coor - dinated care \u2014 we seek to deliver the Stanford Edge as we call it. Our focus is on delivering the absolute best care possible in quality and patient satisfaction. We make sure we are delivering the most effective treatments and incorporating the latest insights to ensure the patient's best chance for surgical healing. We consider what the pa- tient's access is like and what our delivery to meet their needs is like. We question whether we are delivering value in demonstrable performance. That is where it all starts. If one doesn't focus on outstanding care, innovative treatments, coordi-nating care for patients and delivering a good care experience, then you are not going to do well financially. If we focused on financial man-agement, I think we wouldn't have our eye on the ball. We have to focus on care and then we are thoughtful about our financial management. Q: What advice would you give other executives who are looking to lead their hospitals and health systems to the standards of care that Stanford has achieved? ADR: I think being a leader in healthcare starts with a love and passion for what you do. Take the opportunity to meet with people \u2014 talk to pa-tients, talk to staff. Understand the world through other people's eyes. Ask questions. Why are things the way they are? How are things from another's perspective? Understand the underlying processes and try to be of help and do so with great respect for others and their work. Ultimately, it is impor - tant to have a passion for what you do. Respect people and be here to serve humanity. Additionally, being a leader of a successful health- care organization means focusing on a vision. The organization and all of its leaders must then model values and approaches that are in line with that vision. It is about setting clear objectives and engaging team members in those efforts. For in-stance, for us at Stanford, it is about having big visions, big aspirations and having significant im-pact in the world. Meeting healthcare demands today means engaging team members, defining best practices, developing those best practices, training team members on them, redesigning processes around them, recognizing performance and then continuously improving. That approach has been effective in my career. n This past September, Weiss Memorial Hos-pital brought in the East Coast-based Jef-frey Steinberg, MD, to lead the Chicago- based facility. Dr. Steinberg, a urological surgeon, came to Weiss Memorial \u2014 which is part of Nashville, Tenn.-based Vanguard Health Systems \u2014 from Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Cen-ter in Hartford, Conn., where he was the senior vice president for health policy and disparity and chairman and director of surgery. Prior to that, he was the chief of surgery at Saint Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Mass., which is the flagship hospital of Vanguard's New England market. During his tenure with those two hospitals, Dr. Steinberg boosted their surgical profiles. At Saint Francis, he recruited 14 employed surgeons that generated $20 million in net patient revenue, and upon leaving, the surgery department had more than 220 active surgeons. While at Saint Vincent Hospital, he helped establish the first da Vinci Sur - gical System program in Central Massachusetts. Surgery \u2014 and the management of it \u2014 is Dr. Steinberg's forte, and he says there are many ways hospitals can help this department improve. Here, he talks about how he plans to lead Weiss Memo-rial, how hospitals can improve their surgical vol-ume and how a strong primary care base and sur - gical specialists are irrevocably linked to success. Question: What are your visions for the new-look of Weiss Memorial Hospital?Surgically Remodeling a Hospital: Q&A With Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, CEO of Vanguard's Weiss Memorial Hospital By Bob Herman I have learned to try to understand the core operations and processes beneath things, to not just accept them at face value and move on. Often when you do that, you find there isn't a lot of logic to why things are the way they are. So why not change it for the better? \u2014 Amir Dan Rubin, CEO, Stanford Hospitals & Clinics 18 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Dr. Steinberg: Weiss has a rich tradition of serving the Uptown commu- nity in Chicago. It's really been serving the diverse community for the past 60 years, and it's a wonderful, caring community hospital with an academic affiliation with the University of Chicago Medical Center. As for initiatives, I was the first physician who has been actively recruited within Vanguard Health Systems, and they recruited me because Weiss is a surgical hospital and a physician-friendly hospital. We want to grow the pri - mary care base as well as the medical and surgical specialists, and we want to create additional centers of excellence in all of the clinical areas. Hav-ing practiced and benefited from major academic centers in Boston and Worcester, Mass., I'm trying to build on my experience in creating centers of excellence at Weiss for physician alignment, physician recruitment and collaborative building programs. We are one of four Vanguard hospitals in the Chicago market, so this is a market-wide strategy. We have to compete in this very competitive Chicago healthcare market. Q: You are a urological surgeon leading a hospital with a lot of prior executive experience. How will your previous experi-ence help you and help to improve the hospital both finan-cially and clinically? JS: I'm a product of the Harvard medical program in general surgery and urology. I practiced at the Cambridge Health Alliance to be chief of surgery. I went to St. Vincent's in Worcester to be chief of surgery, as well as at St. Francis in Hartford. Along the way, my major initiatives were recruiting addi-tional physicians and building centers of excellence. I had many experiences in partnering with physicians and also in retaining practices of physicians who were already on the medical staff. To bring them into active manage - ment of these entities through co-management agreements \u2014 creating mod-els that add value to the hospital \u2014 improves outcomes and encourages physician loyalty while further developing programmatic excellence. As I was building these programs, I was practicing alongside with these physicians. I was right next door to these surgeons. It's very important for hospital leaders to have credibility and to see at a granular level what bar - riers and opportunities there are for physicians to succeed and grow into something larger than themselves. Q: How do you plan to work with CFO Jeff Wright and the entire financial team? JS: Jeff is a wonderful colleague. He was the acting CEO here at Weiss, and he has a wealth of experience as well. We've worked with some of the same folks. He worked at Geisinger Health System \u2014 Geisinger is a very progressive system in Pennsylvania, and it rolled out new models of care that President Barack Obama noted in a previous State of the Union Ad- dress. [Jeff] has been a fabulous partner to help me grow at Weiss, and I've recruited additional executives to help Weiss grow and develop programs of excellence. Our new executive team is positioned for growth. Q: What are some of the short- and long-term financial and clinical objectives? JS: Clinical: recruitment, recruitment, recruitment. We're looking at ad- ditional primary care physicians both in internal medicine and family practice, and we're recruiting additional surgical specialties, particularly in otolaryngology, urology, general surgery and gynecology. For medical spe - cialties, we want to recruit additional cardiologists and gastroenterologists. It's not just recruiting, but also creating programs of excellence in each of those areas. It's not just plopping down those physicians in those areas. It's all part of a coordinated growth initiative by the Vanguard Chicago market. That's my number one imperative. We're there already in orthopedics, and we're going to expand that to sister hospitals, too. Financially, we want to be healthier, and we are. Our volume is growing. We want to reinvest in facilities so we can continue to provide top-notch care. Our medical office buildings are underutilized, so we have plans to provide new ambulatory services there and bring on additional physicians who would like to have ambulatory practices there. Our new facilities master plan will position us for growth to make the hospital comfortable, confidential and technologically advanced for all patients \u2014 inpatient or ambulatory. Ambu- latory is really important because that's where healthcare reform is headed. Q: What are the most effective ways for hospitals to increase their surgical volume? JS: You need to have a strong primary care physician base to feed to your specialists is number one. You need to take care of the primary care physicians and provide a full range and spectrum of things they need for their patients. Number two: How do you increase and make your processes more efficient and easier for patients to navigate? You want to make sure every patient has exceptional service because they are your best ambassadors. Word of mouth still plays a very important role in attracting new patients, and my goal is to delight patients so they tell their neighbors, friends and others. It's making sure existing patients are delighted because they are your best salespeople. We also want to make it easy for patients to physically navigate the hospital. They should know where services are, where they go to get prepared for sur - gery, where to follow up after surgery, nurses calling and giving postoperative directions, primary care physicians knowing what the ongoing care needs are. It's not just episodic care but also aggregating into the complete continuum of care. Other ways are having the latest equipment, operating room availability and having excellent staff who are actively engaged in their service. Co-management agreements \u2014 where the orthopedic surgeons are running the program and have skin in the game to make sure there are good out - comes \u2014 are also a very effective mechanism for engaging physicians in hospital operations because they are the content experts of providing the best care. That's one of our ways we align interests of physicians with the hospital and ultimately gives the patients the best care. n Connecting People to Healthcar e \"Sheridan\" includes Sheridan Healthcare, Inc., its subsidiaries, af liates and managed entities.For more information on our industry-leading Anesthesiology Services, visit us at HFMA ANI 2012, booth #1357 in June. 877-707-4545 sheridanhealthcare.comThe power behind high-performance hospitals. 20 Special Compensation Section Sponsored by 1. Total compensation is increasing slightly. One trend is that hospital executive compensation is increasing by approximately 3 percent per year, according to David A. Bjork, PhD, senior vice president and se - nior advisor of the executive compensation and governance practice at Integrated Healthcare Strategies. IHS' Spring 2012 Salary Increase, Incen - tive and Benefit Updates Survey found that the average budgeted salary increases for hospital and health system executives in 2012 are 2.5 percent. Some healthcare executives, however, are choosing to forgo compensation increases or bonuses. \"Despite the odds against many of the C-suite execu - tives and the fact that they are leading their organizations through unparal - leled economic times, we are seeing more and more of these executives take a voluntary pay cut,\" says David Gillan, vice president of purchased services at Novation. \"These executives want to lessen the burden on the organizations they are leading and realize the cuts are being felt by all staff.\" In 2011, median and average base salaries for independent hospital CEOs were $467,500 and $482,300, bringing their median and average total annual cash compensation to $496,400 and $539,200, respectively. Independent health system CEOs had a median base salary of $649,900 and an average base salary of $687,900, which brought their median and average total an-nual cash compensation to $790,100 and $861,500, respectively, according to IHS' 2011 National Healthcare Leadership Compensation Survey. 2. Compensation increases are higher at standalone hospitals. Standalone hospitals tend to give higher increases in compensation for their executives than hospitals under a system, according to Paul Esselman, ex- ecutive vice president and managing principal at Cejka Search. \"One of the reasons is standalone hospitals are up against the market and have to perform in order to stay independent. There is so much more pressure on leadership to perform, to deliver quality and safety scores and implement initiatives,\" he says. In comparison, hospitals under a large system have more resources and support at their disposal to meet quality and cost goals. In 2011, total cash compensation for integrated health system CEOs and independent hospital CEOs differed by roughly 3 percentage points: Inte - grated health system CEOs had a 3.1 percent increase while independent hospital CEOs had a 6 percent increase from the previous year, according to Hay Group's 2011 Hospital Prevalence and Planning Report. 3. Boards are more conservative. One new trend in hospital and health system compensation is that the organizations' boards are being more conser -11 Hospital, Health System Executive Compensation Trends (continued from page 1) More info on our Physician Services Scan with your mobile phone 800-327-9335 | www.IHStrategies.com #IHStrategiesPhysician Services Executive Compensation & Governance | Staff and Director Compensation | HR Consulting | Mergers & Acquisitions | Healthcare Surveys | MSA Executive SearchEvery healthcare organization strives to meet the needs of its community.

Their caution is motivated by several reasons, including lower reimbursements, pressure to reduce costs and the pub-lic's perception of executive compensation. \"Boards are also nervous about the future because of healthcare reform,\" Dr. Bjork says. \"They're concerned about the effects of accountable care on the financial health of their institu-tions and the kind of transformation the organizations need to go through in order to thrive in the future. They know that healthcare organizations are going to need to change a lot, and they're in part wondering how those changes will affect the way they deliver pay to the organizations' leaders.\" 4. Boards' focus on reducing costs affects compensation. The pressure to reduce costs in healthcare has caused many hospital and health system boards to be more conservative in adding new components to an executive's compensation package, Dr. Bjork says. \"They are really focused on trimming costs and becoming cost-effective, and it's starting to affect the way they look at executive pay,\" he says. This focus on reducing costs has triggered some boards to raise the thresh- old for awarding executives bonuses for financial improvement. For ex-ample, executives at Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Erlanger Health System did not receive bonuses despite the system's fiscal year 2011 profit because the board of trustees instituted stricter bonus criteria. In FY 2010, Erlanger had an $8.6 million profit and gave $1.9 million in bonuses. In FY 2011, the system made a profit of $5.4 million. Under the new bonus system, Erlanger must have an operating margin of 30 percent, a total profit of $12 million and a 25 percent increase in admissions, among other requirements. 5. Boards' awareness of public perception yields fewer bo- nuses. Hospital and health system boards are also less apt to hand out large bonuses to the organization's leaders because the public tends to portray executive compensation increases negatively. \"They know they're going to have to defend their decision, so they're finding it difficult to be generous even when they are very impressed with the performance they're getting out of their leaders,\" Dr. Bjork says. Boards are awarding bonuses less not due to poor performance, but due to concerns about the public's perception. \"Very few boards really believe that executive pay is too high. But they're acutely attuned to all the criticism they hear and see in print that executive pay is too high. They're really responding to the public relations risk more than they are to their own sense that pay is too high,\" he says. The public's attack on hospital leaders' compensation increases can be par - ticularly harsh when the increases follow layoffs at the organization. For in- stance, there was backlash against Jackson Health System in Miami when it was found that CEO Carlos Migoya earns roughly $850,000 per year while the system made more than 1,100 layoffs. However, if cutting staff is the best solution to poor financial performance, leaders are only being rewarded for doing their job, Dr. Bjork says. Some boards are delaying bonuses to executives until months or a year after the layoffs occurred to avoid the public's perception that the executives are benefiting at the employees' expense. Mr. Esselman suggests consumers' greater awareness of healthcare executives' compensation will force hospitals and health systems to be more transparent with the community and communicate more effectively. Delivering high qual-ity care may also reduce the public's negative viewpoint of healthcare leaders' compensation. \"When patients in the hospital feel like they're getting the best care, the compensation of their executives becomes less of an issue,\" he says. 6. Pay increases for new leaders. One trend that has continued from previous years is that new executives recruited from other organiza - tions are often compensated more than their predecessors. Experienced executives are usually paid well, and it typically takes a good increase to More info on our Physician Services Scan with your mobile phone 800-327-9335 | www.IHStrategies.com #IHStrategiesPhysician Services Executive Compensation & Governance | Staff and Director Compensation | HR Consulting | Mergers & Acquisitions | Healthcare Surveys | MSA Executive SearchQualified medical directors demand competitive pay, but hospitals still need to comply with regulatory guidelines.

This trend may become more important as more hospital and health sys - tem executives reach retirement age, the stresses of healthcare reform spur some executives to retire early and hospitals search for new leaders to transform an organization struggling with healthcare reform regulations. Hospitals increase pay for new executive leaders in part to attract the stron- gest leaders to the organization. \"Committees are very divided,\" Dr. Bjork says. \"They're cautious as they are making their decisions, but they under - stand that they need first rate talent, so they are willing to pay enough to get really good talent and hold onto them.\" 7. Boards are becoming more involved in compensation plans. As boards are becoming more attuned to efforts to reduce the cost of care and more sensitive to the public's view of compensation, they are beginning to take a larger role in developing goals for executives' incentive plans, according to Dr. Bjork. \"In the past, they used to be more willing to let management take the lead in deciding what the measures should be. Boards are now exerting more control over deciding what the measures are, how to weight the measures and what the goals should be,\" he says. The Center for Healthcare Governance noted in a monograph that the Pa- tient Protection and Affordable Care Act's provisions for rewarding high quality and penalizing low quality partly motivated hospital compensation committees to take more responsibility for goal-setting in executive pay. By becoming more involved in establishing targets for incentive payments, boards can ensure the hospital or health system is incentivizing the correct behavior to reach quality and safety goals. Boards are focusing on quality, physician alignment and patient satis-faction metrics, among others. 8. Compensation is based on quality metrics. Hospital and health system executives' bonuses are increasingly based partly on qual-ity and safety performance. This shift is due in part to healthcare reform's emphasis on quality and safety and their relationship to financial rewards or penalties. Regardless of whether the law is deemed unconstitutional or not in June, this trend is likely to continue due to greater transparency, which allows patients to be more selective in choosing healthcare pro - viders, and the benefits of saved costs and saved lives that come with higher quality. \"I believe we're going to con-tinue to see compensation and bonus compensation for healthcare executives not be solely based on financial per - formance of the organiza - tion but on things like quality, safety and service,\" Mr. Es-selman says. 9. Compensation is based on the ability to align physicians. In addi-tion to rewarding healthcare leaders for quality, hospitals and health systems are also rewarding their leaders for success in aligning physicians, as it is also encouraged under the healthcare reform law. \"The leaders that are able to achieve collaboration are highly sought after,\" Mr. Esselman says. \"Those highly sought after leaders, when they're successful in achieving some of these [physician alignment] initia-tives, will be rewarded.\" Leadership's engagement of the community and collaboration with payors and local physician groups can help drive greater quality and cost savings and will be rewarded in leaders' compensation packages. \"Physician alignment strategies will become an increasing piece to a hospital executive's compensation because every hospital wants to have a strong medical staff, and it really falls on the leadership of that hospital to create that environment where physicians want to come to their hospital and admit their patients,\" Mr. Esselman says. In fact, nearly 38 percent of hospitals and health systems will use some type of physician alignment criteria in their incentive plans in 2012, according to IHS' Spring 2012 Salary Increase, Incentive and Benefit Updates Survey. 10. Compensation is based on patient satisfaction. Patient sat - isfaction is also becoming more common in hospital and health system executives' compensation. \"Senior leaders will increasingly be rewarded for overall patient satisfaction with their organization, because each leader has a hand in shaping a patient's experience,\" Mr. Esselman says. \"For example, a CFO who improves the accuracy and efficiency of the patient billing process has a positive impact on patient satisfaction.\" The 2011 Hay Group Healthcare Compensation Study found that 79 percent of providers use patient satisfaction as the primary measure for annual incentives across all executive employee groups of the organization.

Long-term incentives are becoming more prevalent. More hospitals and health systems are including long-term incentives in their ex-ecutives' compensation packages as healthcare reform requires changes that will affect the entire system of delivery over time. \"By and large it's an effort to put into place a program that focuses on transformation. They're recog-nizing that if they focus only on this year's performance, they're not focused on the need to transform how healthcare is delivered,\" Dr. Bjork says. He says long-term incentives, which usually look ahead three years, are also a way to retain leaders because they must wait three years to receive their bonus. In 2001, 39 percent of large non-profit health systems used long-term incentive plans for CEOs. By 2011, this number reached 45 percent, ac-cording to an IHS report. In that same time span, the median long-term incentive opportunities for non-profit health system CEOs increased from 20 percent of salary to 28 percent of salary per year, according to IHS. The 2011 Hay Group Healthcare Compen-sation Study found that only 14 percent of non-profit inte - grated health systems offered long-term incentive plans in 2006, but 25 percent offered these plans in 2011. Similarly, 14 percent of non-prof- it secular integrated health systems had long-term incentive plans in 2006 and 23 percent had them in 2011. Non-profit religious integrated health systems showed the most change, going from 8 percent offering long-term incentive plans in 2006 to 31 percent offering the plans in 2011. Overall, hospital and health system executive compensation trends reflect trends in the industry as a whole: there is a greater focus on transparency, quality, physician alignment, patient satisfaction and long-term change. As the challenges in healthcare today demand strong leadership, hospital and health system executives may continue to see increases in compensation to attract and reward high talent. However, there is likely to also be some restraint in bonuses from the board as the market increases pressure on organizations to reduce costs. nLong-term incentive plans YearLarge non-profit health systems using long-term incentive plans for CEOs Median long-term incentive opportunities for non-profit health system CEOs 2001 39% 20% of salary 2011 45% 28% of salary Source: IHS Compensation of hospital CEOs and other top hospital execu - tives, especially at non-profit organizations, is undergoing mass amounts of scrutiny, thanks in part to the new federal standards that require transparency of all tax-exempt organizations. Kenneth Ackerman, chairman of Integrated Healthcare Strategies and for - mer president of Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pa., spoke at the American College of Healthcare Executives 2012 Congress on Healthcare Leadership in Chicago on March 19. He said that hospital executives and the compensation committee within the board of directors must be on the same page if community members, media and all other interested parties are to understand the methodology behind the salary figures. He explained 11 checklist points for hospital executives and hospital compensation com-mittees to follow in order to reach that level of understanding. 1. Have a dedicated compensation committee. A compensation committee is typically composed of five board members tasked with set - ting the compensation of the hospital CEO and other high-paid executives. That committee wields an extraordinary amount of power when it comes to setting the pay standards for the hospital, so it must be a dedicated group of independent directors who possess the necessary skill sets. Mr. Acker - man emphasized that setting compensation is more than just an accounting task \u2014 it needs to come from a group of people who are willing to show the time commitment and will not have any conflicts of interest.2. Prepare a compensation committee charter. Mr. Ackerman has seen compensation committee charters at hospitals that are three to four sentences, but a charter that is that short will not have much of an impact or detail as to how things are run. \"That's not a charter,\" Mr. Acker - man said of a three- to four-sentence compensation charter. \"You have to spell out in some detail what has been delegated and how the compensa-tion committee is going to govern.\" 3. Adopt a board-approved compensation philosophy. Similar to the charter, a compensation committee must put forth a board-approved philosophy on how compensation is viewed in the hospital. Mr. Ackerman said the philosophy is the bedrock of any good compensation plan, and it helps keep the board and CEO on the same wavelength. 4. Focus on total compensation. A compensation committee cannot only focus on the cash compensation, which includes salary, benefits and other immediate cash incentives. The federal government is looking at the entire spectrum of compensation, which includes de - ferred compensation and retirement plans, and therefore that must be reflected on the Form 990. \"That's what the IRS expects of your orga-nization,\" Mr. Ackerman added. Compensation Manifesto: 11 Steps for Hospital CEOs and Compensation Committees to \"Get it Right\" By Bob Herman 24 Special Compensation Section 5. Establish the Rebuttable Presumption Reasonableness. In- ternal Revenue Code 4958 established many provisions for tax-exempt or - ganizations, including hospitals. Under IRC 4958, a tax-exempt organization can establish RPR, which more or less validates why an executive was paid a certain amount. Mr. Ackerman said every hospital CEO and compensation committee should establish the RPR because it is a safe harbor and provides protection as to the compensation rationale. He said every compensation committee and board meeting should include in their minutes how compen-sation was determined with supporting documentation, such as providing comparability data of other healthcare executive compensation trends. 6. Hold regularly scheduled meetings. Speaking of meetings, ex- ecutives and compensation committees should meet at least two or three times per year as a minimum. \"Holding meetings only once a year is not doing the job,\" Mr. Ackerman said. \"Things are moving too fast. To have [the committee] making informed decisions, doing it in one or even two meetings won't do it justice.\" 7. Ensure adequate time to deliberate and conduct CEO ap- praisal. Because there are so many different factors that affect hospital executive compensation, such as comparability data and hospital revenue size to name a few, Mr. Ackerman said hospitals should allow for enough time to set the right compensation. This is especially true as boards and committees set the compensation for the hospital CEO, which usually re-ceives the most scrutiny. 8. Hold executive sessions. Executive sessions are meeting agenda discussions in which board and compensation committee members debate and question the CEO and other executives on performance and other is- sues that are pertinent to setting their pay. Mr. Ackerman said after board members conduct their inquiries, the executives can be excused for further debate. \"This may take five minutes, or this could take 20 minutes,\" Mr. Ackerman says. \"But it's good governance, and it sets the tone.\" 9. Instill an environment of continuous quality. \"If the board isn't committed to [self-evaluation], who is?\" Mr. Ackerman asked. He said CEO self-evaluation and committee self-evaluations will ensure that com-pensation is justified while also ensuring the right people are being retained for the jobs. 10. Prepare to address media inquiries. Every hospital executive, especially the CEO, should know who the hospital's media spokesperson is and what the simple statement will be regarding his or her salary and ben- efits. Any comments on compensation should be directly attributed to the statement, yet thoughtful enough to answer any potential questions from deadline-pressured reporters. 11. Practice full disclosure to the board using tally sheets. In 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission required that for- profit entities use tally sheets, which describe an executive's current and potential total compensation, retirement income and severance benefits, and what a lump sum severance benefit could be if the executive were let go without cause. These types of compensation sheets are not required of non-profit hospitals, but Mr. Ackerman said it is certainly a best practice. \"The best practices in corporate America should occur in the not-for-prof- it sector,\" he said. n More info on our Physician Services Scan with your mobile phone 800-327-9335 | www.IHStrategies.com #IHStrategiesIntegrated Healthcare Strategies is one of the most widely-used firms for fair market value and commercial reasonableness assessments for healthcare organizations.

Branching out and attracting physi- cians is a core goal of any health organization, especially with the advent of accountable care organizations, but because physicians go through thorough and rigorous medical training to deliver the highest possible care to patients, they must be compensated appropriately. The same certainly applies to nurses, frontline staff and all other members of the health-care delivery system. However, as hospitals continue to purchase physician practices and physician reimbursement hangs in the balance, physician pay rises to the top of the bucket. The same holds true for independent practice physicians, as their declining revenue streams directly impact how much bread they take back to their table. Highest-paid specialties Surgical specialties again lead the pack in high-est salaries and compensation packages. Cardiac and thoracic surgeons, orthopedic noninvasive and invasive cardiologists, urolo - gists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists and many others all had pay figures above $350,000 and as high as $532,000 (cardiac and thoracic surgeons). 1 Neurosurgeons are also among the highest-paid physicians, as their compensation routinely tops $700,000, depending on the em - ployment setting. 2 The highest-earning physicians are most likely to be found in the North Central region of the United States, which comprises Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Da-kota. 3 This could partially be attributed to less competition in smaller communities and sparse-ly-populated rural areas, which generally have to pay more to attract physicians. Lowest-paid specialties It's no surprise the lowest-paid physician special - ties are all branches of primary care, as has been the trend for many years. Family medicine phy - sicians, internists, pediatricians and hospitalists had some of the lowest median salaries. 4 Family medicine physicians had the lowest overall com-pensation at a tick over $208,000, a 1 percent decrease from 2010. The Northeast part of the United States, which mostly includes New England, was the geo-graphic locale most likely to pay physicians least. 5 Although the costs of living are higher on the upper East Coast than many other places, the heavy competition and condensed popula - tions have driven down the compensation levels.Other trends Compensation for men and women across all physician specialties continues to be one of the biggest discrepancies in the healthcare sector. In each of the 21 specialties that were examined, men made more than women. On average, men make 40 percent more than women across all the specialties, although that gap is smaller within the primary care groups and OB/GYN. 6 Physicians that saw the biggest pay bumps be-tween 2010 and 2011 include cardiologists, emergency medicine physicians, endocrinolo - gists and hospitalists \u2014 all of whom saw at least a 5 percent spike in median salary. 7 When asked if they considered themselves to be \"rich,\" radiologists, oncologists and gastroenter - ologists were Inter - nists, pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecolo - gists had the lowest percentage of respondents who thought they were rich. Fifty-four percent of primary care physicians do not think they are fairly compensated, and across all specialties, it's almost a 50/50 split of those who think are and are not fairly compensated. 8 Physician statistics \u2014 2012 Here are 200 statistics on the latest physician compensation figures and trends across 21 spe - cialties, based on the most recent data available from several physician compensation reports and surveys. The main physician compensation statistics covered in the following 21 specialties include median salary, median gross charges, median work relative value units, regional com-pensation, hospital versus multispecialty group practice salary and salary offers. Note: Some of the statistics may seem higher or lower com- pared with others in each specialty. A collection of physician surveys were used to compile information. In addition, every specialty does not contain the same number of statistics, as some data was not available for each specialty.

We Help Hospital-Owned Practices Operate Successfully.28 Special Compensation Section Newly recruited physicians offer a lot of potential for hospitals, especially as the scramble for physician practices en- sues. Physicians are able to support the hospital's mission of providing quality care across a broad spectrum of specialties, and they are able to en-gender financial benefits by creating downward revenue that helps keep service lines profitable while covering any of their practices' losses, if applicable. One of the key cogs that links physicians to hospital revenue is compensation: If a physician brings in more business and enhances the scope of the hospital's care, how are they getting paid? Merritt Hawkins, a physician search and consult - ing firm, conducted a survey in 2010 that showed the net annual revenue generated by physicians in several specialties on behalf of their affiliated hospitals. The 2010 Physician Inpatient/Outpatient Revenue Survey has been a leading benchmark for hospitals to see how physicians impact the rev-enue of different service lines, and Phil Miller, media associate at Merritt Hawkins, says the firm will be conducting a 2012 survey of physi - cian-generated revenue, due out this fall. For the 2010 survey, Merritt Hawkins received responses from 114 hospital and health system CFOs. The CFOs indicated the combined net inpatient and outpatient revenue generated an-nually for their facilities by a single, full-time equivalent physician across several specialties. Revenue was represented by procedures per -formed at the hospital, tests and treatments ordered and other factors. (For primary care physicians, hospital CFOs were asked to de - termine revenue generated from direct admis-sions, procedures performed, lab tests, etc., but not from indirect revenue primary care physi-cians may have generated from patient referrals to specialists utilizing the hospital.) Looking at the physician-generated revenue by specialty and the related salaries for those physi - cians can reveal patterns insight on where em - phasis is being placed on different hospital phy - sician specialties. Out of the 17 specialties in the survey, neuro- surgeons were far ahead in revenue generated, salary and revenue-to-compensation ratio. The median 2010 generated hospital revenue for neurosurgeons was nearly $2.82 million, and they were paid on average $571,000. That means for every $1 neurosurgeons received in compen-sation, they brought in $4.93 of revenue into the hospital. Orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons were the next group of physicians that generated the most revenue for hospitals. Orthopedic surgeons brought in an average of $2.12 million in revenue, while general surgeons were not far behind at $2.11 million. However, their compensation lev-els varied drastically. Orthopedic surgeons made $481,000 in salary, while general surgeons earned $321,000. For every $1 of compensation, ortho-pedic surgeons generated $4.40 in hospital rev-enue. General surgeons, on the other hand, were compensated $1 for every $6.58 of generated revenue, roughly 1.5 times the amount of both neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. General surgeons were not the only set of phy - sicians that had revenue-to-compensation ratios higher than 6.5 to 1. Family practice physicians and internal medicine physicians had ratios of 9.38 to 1 and 9.02 to 1, respectively. Primary care physicians have traditionally been compensated less than surgical specialties, and the data rein-forces this trend even though they bring in a lot of money (each generated more than $1.6 mil-lion on average). Nephrologists and ophthalmologists had the lowest amounts of average generated revenue at an annual average of $696,888 and $842,711, re-spectively. Nephrology is a very specialized field, and ophthalmology is more commonly found in ambulatory surgery centers than hospitals. Be - cause of their low revenue totals, both special - ties saw more personal income per dollar of rev-enue generated ($1 of compensation for every $2.90 in revenue for nephrology and $1 of com-pensation for every $2.99 for ophthalmology).

Lacking an appropriate governance structure where all constituents are at the table. Everyone in an accountable care organization needs to be on the same page. If one party is left out, integration is likely to fail. All partners need to have \"the willingness to re- design the healthcare system,\" says Judy Rich, CEO of Tucson (Ariz.) Medical Center, one of the 27 new CMS ACOs. \"Our physician partners are committed to the success of our ACO.\" Neither a hospital nor physicians should domi- nate an ACO \u2014 it takes effort from both sides of that aisle says Bill Frack, vice president of global healthcare consulting firm L.E.K Consulting. In order to formally encourage input from all par - ties participating in the ACO, the ACO's govern-ing board should include representatives from the hospital, physician groups, any other participating providers, such as post-acute care groups, and patient populations. \"Because you have to have coordination, you need the major players all at the table in relatively equal capacity,\" Mr. Frack says. Maintaining a two-way street between hos-pital and physician groups partaking in an ACO is essential from day one, long before formation. Initial collaboration will lay the groundwork for the shared savings, quality of care measurements and collaboration models to follow. \"Physicians need to be actively involved and as- sume proactive leadership roles for ACO devel - opment from the very outset, rather than being asked to rubber stamp a hospital-driven pro - cess,\" Mr. Frack says. 2. Operating under existing economic incentives incompatible with the intent of an ACO. Accountable care relies on differ - ent payment models to achieve its end result. While CMS' new ACOs maintain aspects of a fee-for-service model, ACOs by definition seek to rid of a system that pays physicians solely for providing services. The purpose of an ACO is to ensure a patient is staying healthy and that the organization is cutting costs associated with car - ing for that patient. Physicians who work in an ACO and respond to that goal should be pro - portionally reimbursed for carrying their weight; it makes sense to offer physicians financial in-centives to spur savings. The purpose and challenge of integrated care is \"to develop a payment system based on the value of work we do based on health outcomes of the patients,\" says John Toussaint, MD, with the ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value in Appleton, Wisc. and author of Potent Medicine: The Collaborative Cure for Healthcare (2012). \"We don't get paid much to prevent,\" says Dr. Toussaint. He says the fee-for-service payment model that has reigned supreme for some time is \"fundamentally flawed right now.\"An ACO could technically have all the measures in place that make it appear destined for success \u2014 integrated care, core measures to assess quality delivery, a competent information technology plan that allows for data sharing \u2014 but if the organiza- tion fails to revolutionize the way it pays physicians, it is in serious jeopardy. A shared savings model that provides physicians with an incentive to go beyond simply providing services for patients will provide an incentive to curb costs, and some form of capitated payment will eventually follow. 3. Failing to address antitrust issues. Potential legal barriers, including antitrust laws, could slow or halt the development of an ACO. Federal law, as well as laws in some states that ad-dress anticompetitive price fixing, has the poten-tial to undermine ACOs. Many providers, includ-ing former competitors, may pool resources to create ACOs to improve quality of care potential, but doing so could spur an antitrust investigation. It's a sort of Catch 22. \"The components criti - cal to the success of ACOs could make them impermissible under federal law and some state laws,\" writes the Coker Group in its new book The Healthcare Executive's Guide to ACO Strategy (2012). In its joint statement on the matter, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice in October 2011 said that \"under certain conditions ACOs could reduce competition and harm con-sumers through higher prices or lower quality care.\" Fortunately for ACOs, FTC and DOJ have embraced so-called \"antitrust safety zones\" for CMS ACOs. Independent ACO participants providing the same service and that provide no more than a combined 30 percent of those ser - vices in what is known as their primary service area \u2014 defined as the lowest number of postal zip codes from which the ACO draws 75 percent of its participants \u2014 are protected under the an- titrust safety zone. They will not be investigated unless under extraordinary circumstances. In addition, rural exceptions exist for ACO par - ticipants in areas with small populations where very few other practices likely to participate in an ACO. Other ACOs that fall outside the safety zone will not raise competitive concerns, so long as they do \"not impede the functioning of a competitive market.\"But there are ways an ACO could do just that. A few things the DOJ and FTC say will raise antitrust flags: Collusion among competing ACOs for services that fall outside the ACO. Preventing private payors from directing or incentivizing patients to choose provid- ers that may fall outside the ACO, or \"anti-steering\" contractual clauses. Tying sales of ACO services to private payor purchase of other services from providers outside the ACO, and vice versa, including providers affiliated with an ACO participant. Contracting on an exclusive basis with ACO physicians, hospitals, ASCs or other providers and discouraging those provid-ers from contracting with private payors outside the ACO. Restricting a private payor's ability to make available to health plan enrollees perfor - mance information that will aid enrollees in evaluating providers in health plan, if the information is similar to measures used in Shared Savings Program. There are other exceptions, and the FTC and DOJ will offer an expedited 90-day review for CMS ACOs to ensure they are not violating an-titrust laws. To be sure though, providers look-ing to form an ACO should consult a competent healthcare lawyer versed in new legal issues sur - rounding accountable care. 4. not making information technology a top priority. ACO data needs to be delivered at the point of care and should be organized in a way that proves outcomes and cost reduction. \"Without the ability to share and exchange in- formation at the point of care, achieving the ob-jectives of an ACO would be extremely limited, if not impossible,\" writes the Coker Group. An efficient IT sharing system could be in place, but it also needs physicians trained to input data into it. Elliot Fisher, MD, and Stephen Shortell, PhD, say, in an article for the Commonwealth Fund, that quality of care information is essen - tial for measuring how well an ACO is working. 8 Biggest Mistakes an ACO Can Make(continued from page 1) \"Physicians need to be actively involved and assume proactive leadership roles for ACO devel- opment from the very outset, rather than being asked to rubber stamp a hospital-driven process.\" \u2014 Bill Frack, Vice President, L.E.K Consulting.31 Physician-Hospital & ACOs While they acknowledge the \"release of provider- and plan-specific pricing information raises issues of contractual commitment and competitive ad-vantages on one hand and antitrust on the other,\" the authors also weigh in on the importance of tracking data over the course of an ACO's histo-ry. \"Without at least some common information on the quality of care, resource use and relative pricing on the part of ACOs, it will be impos-sible to assess their performance,\" Mr. Fisher and Mr. Shortell write. \"And without community-level aggregation, we will be hard-pressed to know whether new payment model is having an impact on what matters: the quality and affordability of care and health of our communities.\" Therefore, information technology and data maintenance is important not only for an indi-vidual ACO but for the future of accountable care organizations as a whole. If each ACO pulls its weight and implements robust, sweeping IT solutions that allow it to effectively measure quality of care, that can then be used by phy - sicians, hospitals, payors and policy makers to make an assessment. They'll know what is and isn't saving money and what is and isn't improv-ing the health of the patient who is supposed to be in the center of accountable care. 5. not establishing a meaningful set of quality measures to rate ACO success. How does your ACO analytically measure its suc- cess beyond cost reductions? CMS reduced its list of ACO quality measures from 65 to 33 in an ef-fort to appeal to more providers, sensitive to con-cerns over administrative burdens. But without thorough quality measurements in place, it will be extremely difficult to gauge how successful an ACO is at accomplishing what it seeks to provide. In order to facilitate quality measurements, ACOs will need to have in place a system available to all parties involved in patient care, and that allows for efficient tracking of patient outcomes. It's in the best interest of the individual ACO and the new organization model as a whole. \"Much will be gained by forging agreement on a set of measures for a core set of ACO capabili-ties,\" write Mr. Fisher and Mr. Shortell. \"With-out this, it will be difficult if not impossible to compare findings across studies and cumulative knowledge will be seriously compromised.\" 6. Failing to involve payors. Mr. Frack says research shows payors and providers don't often share data used in negotiations between the two. They sometimes quell information sharing out of a lack of trust for one another. Providers, for in-stance, concerned that data will be used against them, may hesitate to paint payors a full picture. But for an ACO to be successful, payor collabora- tion with hospitals and physicians will be crucial, Mr. Frack says. \"Payors have a tremendous amount of sophisti- cation in terms of risk management and data,\" he says. \"They have a more longitudinal view of a patient's record.\" For ACOs to be successful, all parties will need to agree upon care metrics and be willing to both share in financial gains and assume financial risks. 7. Failing to realize the patient is at the center of care in an ACO. Ms. Rich, the CEO of Tucson Medical Center, says the goal and expectations of everybody involved with an ACO needs to be very clearly spelled out, and the focus must be on the patient, not the hos-pital. A hospital could be incredibly efficient at gathering patient data and entering it into orga-nized, controlled databases \u2014 but if it doesn't consider data a means to an end \u2014 that end be-ing patient care \u2014 data is a moot point. \"We will fail if we misinterpret the role of the patient,\" she says. Technology is intended to empower care providers, not replace them. As stated above, a strong IT system is an essential element of an ACO, but it leads to the health of a person: the patient. It's not just about show - ing patient improvement through data, though better data will inevitably help ACOs track prog - ress made. Dr. Toussaint calls it a revolutionary change in the delivery model. He says integrated care \"turns the industry on its side. What we're focused on is the patients experience and not on our own experience as a provider.\" 8. underestimating the time it takes to form an ACO. Mr. Frack says this is a glaring issue he observes when consulting with hospi-tal leaders, physicians and others in healthcare looking to start an ACO. He notices adminis-trators and physician group representatives will begin to brainstorm and discover how many elements go into an ACO \u2014 structure of the organization, metrics, reimbursement models, electronic medical records and payor contracts to name a few. And then, six months into ACO discussions, the leaders will be addressing the same issues, but with a list of concerns that has doubled. Mr. Frack says at that point, the ACO decision makers are looking at value-added top-ics such as the future organization's ability to manage post-acute transitions or it's ability to not only integrate systems but actually coordi-nate care effectively. Max Reiboldt, CEO of the Coker Group, agrees with Mr. Frack's assessment that executives and physicians looking to start an ACO underes - timate the time and financial commitment in-volved in form one. \"We are asking everybody to take a dramatic step, make a dramatic change,\" Mr. Reiboldt says. \"There has to be a lot of edu - cational opportunities to pull this together.\" Mr. Frack notes that more than half of all groups who explore an ACO fail to develop one. That be - ing said, he expects to see \u2014 and he is by no means alone \u2014 many more accountable care organizations sprout up in the near future \u2014 he predicts more than 500 will form in the next five to 10 years. Those that avoid common mistakes made during formation will become models that work in the long run. n Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, a Medicare ACO can receive payment for meeting quality metrics and reducing costs. If a Medicare ACO reduces its Medicare expenditures below a benchmark, it is eligible to receive part of the savings from Medicare \u2014 up to 50 percent for ACOs in the shared savings only track and up to 60 per - cent for ACOs in the shared savings/losses track, depending on the ACO's performance score. In the first year, an ACO can collect on this potential shared savings if it reports on all 33 quality measures. Performance require - ments for savings will then be phased in, such that in the second year eli - gibility for savings will depend on the ACO's performance on 25 measures and reporting on eight, and for the third year, performance on 32 measures and reporting on one measure. For the second and third year, the ACO must meet the quality performance standard on 70 percent of the measures in each of four domains to receive savings. The domains are patient/caregiver experience, care coordination/patient safety, preventative health and at risk population. The potential shared savings an ACO can receive incentivize meeting quality and cost benchmarks, as these funds would supplement participants' fee-for-service Medicare payments. Unlike Medicare fee-for-service payments, however, 7 Steps to Navigate Payment Allocation Under ACOs By Sabrina Rodak32 Physician-Hospital Relationships & ACOs which follow specific rules set by CMS, each ACO creates its own system for allocating the shared savings among its participants. Commercial ACOs typically use a similar payment structure, in which partici- pants are compensated based on Medicare's fee-for-service rates or produc - tivity and have the opportunity to receive additional payments by achieving certain quality and cost goals. In contrast to a Medicare ACO, a commercial ACO can create its own set of metrics and thresholds for receiving perfor - mance-based payments. Wade Johannessen, PhD, a director at Sg2, says it is common for commercial ACOs to split potential shared savings between the payor and ACO equally, as is possible under the Medicare ACO program. As in the Medicare ACO model, the commercial ACO also independently decides how to divide its share of the savings among participants. The question of how to allocate payments in an ACO is one of the most difficult questions facing healthcare leaders. Here are seven steps to follow when deciding how to share payments fairly while maintaining a profit. 1. Commit to collaboration and transparency. The premise of an ACO is that different healthcare providers will work together to achieve bet - ter outcomes. As such, it is essential that each participant of the ACO com- mit to being transparent and to negotiating shared payments in a cooperative manner. This negotiation should occur at the very outset, according to Dr. Johannessen, as sharing savings is one of the core features of an ACO. Being honest and open is especially important when forming new relation- ships with physicians, who may mistrust the hospital due to historically weak relations between physicians and hospitals. \"If you're going to have a successful ACO, all parties are going to have to feel that they are recognized for their work and come to some sort of agreement, says Beth Kase, JD, an attorney at Fenton Nelson. Participants of the California Public Employees' Retirement System ACO, which include San Francisco-based Dignity Health, Blue Shield of California and Hill Physicians, collaborate to create a risk share agreement and cost targets. Negotiations related to the risk share agreement began in early 2009, and the ACO launched Jan. 1, 2010. \"A critical element to building trust and collaboration is the agreement that all three parties will share risk in all healthcare service categories,\" says Michael Blaszyk, CFO of Dignity Health. Commitment by senior leadership to work cooperatively and transparently has also been key to successfully working together, he says. 2. Establish non-incentive payment methodology. Under the Medicare ACO model, physicians and other providers will continue to be paid on a fee-for-service basis. In commercial ACOs, the commercial payor may use fee-for-service as the basis, or a different model of compensation. Ms. Kase and Harry Nelson, JD, managing partner of Fenton Nelson, sug - gest commercial payors may use the resource-based relative value scale, which is the method Medicare uses to determine physicians' fees. Under this model, each procedure is assigned a relative value that is based on physician work, practice expense and malpractice expense and adjusted for geography; this relative value unit is then multiplied by a conversion factor. \"Being an early model, we are likely to see a smaller incentive component. There will be some money reserved for incentives linked to outcomes, but the vast majority will inevitably be tied to an RBRVS system or something like it because there is not enough data or infrastructure to set up a [solely] outcome-based system in America at this point,\" Mr. Nelson says.

Assess the population. As part of developing a payment alloca- tion system for shared savings, ACO participants need to assess the pop-ulation mix in their community. The type of population can determine which participants in the ACO will bear more risk, and who should there - fore receive a greater portion of the savings. If a commercial ACO is in a community with a high percentage of Medicare patients, for instance, the hospital may have more expenses compared to an outpatient center because Medicare patients are more likely than non-Medicare patients to require hospitalization. The ACO may thus decide to give a higher share of the savings to hospitals because they would spend more on the patients to meet quality goals. Each ACO's unique mix of population, geography and providers neces - sitate that each organization create a payment structure that is best suited to it. \"ACO partners should consider their market, strategic objectives and the environment as they customize [the ACO] to meet the needs of their respective communities,\" Mr. Blaszyk says. Similarly, under the Medicare ACO model, CMS will set each ACO's cost benchmark by using separate cost categories for different populations, including end-stage renal disease patients; disabled patients; aged/dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries; and aged/non-dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. 4. Designate responsibilities for services. Determining respon- sibilities for providing services is important as it creates accountability for meeting quality and cost metrics and clearly identifies who should get paid for each service. To reduce spending, the ACO should take into account different healthcare settings' costs for providing the same service when designating responsibility for services. For example, it may be less expen-sive to provide imaging in a physician office rather than a hospital. Discussing each provider's costs for services is essential in creating a fair payment distribution model. \"Separate out what the profits are from what the real costs are,\" Mr. Nelson says. \"Have a conversation about who's pro - viding what personnel and what services, and what the costs are, and figure out how to allocate profits based on achieving shared goals.\" 5. Agree on metrics. Each ACO participant's share of savings will be given only if that participant meets the ACO's quality and cost goals. \"There is essentially a savings pool and the ability to achieve that payout is determined by the providers' performance on quality measures,\" Dr. Jo-hannessen says. \"You may be eligible for fifty percent, but that's subject to meeting various quality gates.\" Because payments are partly based on meet - ing quality goals, the ACO needs to agree on the metrics for which each participant will be held accountable. \"Some have a graded approach, some have a threshold approach and others have a complex outcome-based nu-merical grade that determines the percentage of the total dollars allocated to you,\" says Akram Boutros, MD, founder and president of BusinessFirst Healthcare Solutions. The shared savings model has specific metrics Medicare ACOs must meet to receive incentive payments. For example, in the patient/caregiver experi-ence domain, one measure is \"Getting timely care, appointments and infor - mation.\" Performance on each measure is scored; these scores determine what percent of savings the Medicare ACO can receive, which is capped at 50 percent and 60 percent depending on whether the ACO is in the savings only or savings/losses track. 6. Develop other revenue streams. One way to meet cost reduction goals is to lower healthcare utilization of high-cost services, such as by reducing hospital readmissions. Many of hospitals' services are high cost; reducing utilization of these services would thus generate less revenue for the facility. \"If hospital spend is about 50 percent of healthcare dollars and physician spend is about 15 percent, most of the savings are going to come from the fifty percent,\" Dr. Boutros says. Savings from meeting utilization goals will thus be particularly important for hospitals, as reduced utilization will most likely cost hospitals more than other providers. \"A lot of the savings are going to be generated by better coordinating care which should lead to fewer hospitalizations and reducing revenue to the hospital,\" Dr. Johannessen says. Hospitals can recoup some of their lost revenue from the shared savings, but they may not be able to balance out the losses completely. \"Without growing market share, no amount of shared savings will make up for the likely decrease in revenue to the hospital,\" Dr. Johannessen says. This risk necessitates that hospitals create new means of revenue, such as providing more outpatient services, to outweigh this potential loss. For example, some hospitals are providing management services. \"They have been acting as management service organizations, but they will [be] even more so in an ACO structure,\" Ms. Kase says. Other options for hospitals to gain revenue include providing administrative services, such as coordinating information technology and billing services. Hos-pitals may also partner with a physician group to form a surgery center and would receive some profits based on that ownership, according to Ms. Kase. \"Hospitals need to find another model to preserve their profitability and their relevance,\" Mr. Nelson says. \"One of the reasons we see hos-pitals moving to the [medical] foundation model in California and inte - grating with physicians is to find ways to get at physician revenue and provide more outpatient services. They are moving to revenue streams that are not based on hospitalization, but a whole range of outpatient services.\" 7. Determine risk and calculate percentages. After assessing the population, designating service responsibilities and agreeing on metrics, the ACO can estimate the amount of risk each participant bears in meeting benchmarks for shared savings. The ACO can then decide what percentage of savings each participant should receive based on the participant's risk. The CalPERS ACO uses \"a three-way risk-sharing [model] with upside and downside risk for achieving cost and quality targets in five categories: total facility, professional, mental health, pharmacy and ancillary,\" Mr. Blaszyk says. The ACO participants decided to overlay the existing pay - ment terms with the three-way risk agreement to best align incentives. The terms of the risk share agreement are renegotiated by the three ACO participants annually. The payment/reimbursement terms are negotiated independently of the risk share agreement and occur confidentially be - tween Blue Shield of California and Dignity Health and Blue Shield of California and Hill Physicians. Dr. Boutros says payment breakdowns for hospitals and physicians vary the most from one ACO to another, whereas post-acute care organizations typically receive about 10 to 20 percent of savings. An ACO may decide to give physicians and hospitals an equal share, but often physicians end up receiving less, according to Dr. Boutros. For example, an ACO may al-locate 50 percent of savings to the hospital, 40 percent to physicians and 10 percent to post-acute care. The difference in payments for physicians and hospitals depends largely on the integration of physicians with the hospital. \"The biggest deciding factor I've noted is the viewpoint of the most senior leader in the organiza - tion,\" Dr. Boutros says. \"If they see physicians as clear partners, they tend to be more equitable with the share; those who see physicians as a neces - sary 'cog in the wheel' tend to give them less.\" n34 Physician-Hospital Relationships & ACOs Physician strategy is top of mind for many hospital leaders. As Lewis Carroll once wrote, \"If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.\" This is true for hospital and health system strategy and especially true for physician strategy. Physician strategy is the foundation around which health systems are built. Hospitals and health systems without a strong physician strategy aren't going to be able to play a significant role in the marketplace in the future. After all, physicians \u2014 together with their patients \u2014 ultimately control healthcare market share, volume and, as a result, financial success. Today the \"buzz word\" around physician strat - egy is clinical integration. Although a few promi - nent health systems have long been clinically in- tegrated, others are just beginning their efforts to more formally align their hospitals, physicians and other providers. Clinical integration can mean a lot of things, but generally it refers to managing the entire continuum of care for our patients \u2014 from preventing disease, to treating them in the office, and coordinating their care during and after a hospital admission. To me, as a family medicine practitioner for the last 20 years, this is simply what most primary care providers do every day. Now, healthcare leaders are working to make this type of coordi-nation the industry standard. We must formally develop it among all types of providers through truly putting the patient at the center and de - veloping clinical protocols enabled by infra - structure that provide the right care at the right time, in the right setting with the right overall experience for the lowest cost. This, of course, is where healthcare is heading, and it's being directed there by new healthcare practices that prioritize value over volume. Beyond primary care To be successful, physician strategy must con-sider how the hospital will strengthen relation-ships among its organization and among all physicians. Primary care strategy and specialist strategy should be considered holistically. When I hear healthcare leaders ask if they should develop a primary care strategy or a specialist strategy, as a physician, I scratch my head. A primary care physician cannot take care of a patient alone, and neither can a specialist. A health system's physi-cian strategy must find the right balance in the development of primary care and specialty care networks. Focusing on one or the other doesn't fit with the future of healthcare delivery we face. Primary care providers, though, are surely the foundation upon which healthcare delivery is built. They coordinate care among various specialists and facilities to ensure the best care for their patients. Because of this important role, Mercy is develop- ing a medical home model for our primary care practices. Through this, we will help build the sys- tems and infrastructure \u2014 human, technological and structural \u2014 needed to coordinate care. Beyond employment Hospitals and health systems today seem to be in an ongoing race to employ physicians, for rea-sons driven by both the hospitals and physicians. But, there are many ways to achieve integration outside of employment. At Mercy, we anticipate significant growth in the number of physicians we employ in the next two to three years. How - ever, we do not have a mindset of driving physi - cians solely into an employment structure. Rath-er, our goal is to partner with our physicians by providing them options to set them and their pa-tients up for success. Other alternatives that are frequently utilized include but are not limited to: joint ventures, clinical co-management models, shared savings models, and utilization of clinical and practice management tools to name a few. For the physicians we do employ, we are currently implementing a new governance model that gives them even more control over their practice and set - ting strategy for their group. A governing board of representative physicians will oversee all aspects of the operations of the employed physicians, through physician-driven committees tasked with guiding the day-to-day operations, strategy, business devel-opment, quality, IT, finance and leadership develop-ment. When we started this process I really wasn't sure about how we would get physicians excited about participating, but the reality is that more and more physicians are interested in being part of de - signing the solutions to a complex healthcare de - livery model rather than be passive, sitting on the sidelines and reacting to what comes next. We've also launched a clinical integration over - sight group with representation from our hospi- tals, employed and independent physicians, which has been tasked with exploring how we might develop a clinically integrated organization that is capable of adapting to the changing landscape of the new healthcare delivery and payment system. One thing that is important to remember, though, is successful clinical integration is achieved through a lot more than physician employment. An employed physician is not automatically an engaged physician. Physicians also have to be ac - tivated and motivated for the right reasons to play an active role in the creation of the right models of care. Hospitals can't simply hire physicians or contract with them and expect for care to magi-cally be coordinated and value-driven. Instead, organizations must be careful to provide the in-frastructure needed to achieve this. For example, Mercy has invested heavily in implementing an in- tegrated electronic health record that allows for a single chart per patient irrespective of where care is delivered \u2014 be it in a physician office, a hos-pital or an emergency department. This type of information sharing, we hope, will help to break down the silos that can exist among the various sites of care, that reduce duplication, improve quality of care, improve patient safety and lower costs for our patients and the healthcare system overall. We are also exploring the development of technological infrastructure for data mining. We want to be able to provide analytics to our physicians that help them understand their work against certain outcomes and benchmarks and in-form sound high-quality clinical decision making. Linking back to our mission This type of data, reporting and transparency is necessary not only to show the impact we have on our individual patients but also to show our impact on the communities we serve. Have we truly been able to improve care of the diabetic patient? Better controlled hypertension? Reduced the incidences of coronary artery disease? The list goes on and on. At Mercy, our mission is to \"ex-tend the healing ministry of Jesus by improving the health of the communities we serve, with a special emphasis on those who are poor and un-derserved.\" How can we improve the health of our communities without population health man-agement? It's clear a future of value-based, pop-ulation-driven care is where healthcare is headed, and in my opinion, where it must head. Any health system's two most important cus - tomers are their patients and physicians. Any health system's greatest asset is its people who provide care to the patients who seek it from them. We live in interesting times. We have been here before in healthcare. It seems difficult and overwhelming at times, but we are a resilient group. We have come up with innovative ways of facing these challenges before and I am sure that, even though it might seem difficult at times our industry has the intelligence, the drive and the desire to create new solutions that we never thought possible. Our healthcare, and our coun-try, will be better because of it. nPhysician Strategy as the Foundation to Improving Community Health By Imran Andrabi, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Physician Executive Officer, Mercy Today, Sandlot Solutions is helping to manage millions of clinical patient records and has generated millions of dollars of savings for those using this revolutionary health care technology platform.

Hospital credit downgrades are predict - ed to outpace upgrades. The healthcare reform law will impact hospital revenue. Bank letters of credit are shaky. Collections are getting tougher to collect on both the front and backend. This isn't a lightening round on a healthcare finance game show. These issues \u2014 and many more \u2014 are only the tip of the iceberg for what hospital and health system CFOs have to deal with today. However, the panic button does not need to be pressed. Taking a step back to outline and monitor the progress of specific financial challenges that lie ahead is a good first step for hospital and health system CFOs that feel overwhelmed. Here, four hospital and health system CFOs \u2014 Carl Biber of Columbus Regional Healthcare System in White - ville, N.C.; Denis Conroy of Northeast Health System in Beverly, Mass.; Dan Fromm of Fairview Health Services in Minneapolis; and Mark Krieger of Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis \u2014 share how they are dealing with the biggest healthcare financial challenges of the times, ranging from government reimbursement and commercial payor negotiations to ICD-10 and the credit markets. Question: What are some of the biggest issues facing your hospital's or health system's finances today? Carl Biber: There's a number of paradigm shifts happening in the industry right now, one being the emphasis on quality. That's not a new idea as much as it's keeping in mind that the patient is truly at the center of receiving that service. With any indus-try, the customer is always number one. Right or wrong, whatever the customer perceives as \"value\" is what we're trying to understand and provide. Patients know what they want, and it originates from the two basic questions: 1) What's wrong with me? and 2) Am I getting treated? From their perspective, the rest is just processes or sys - tems they have to go through to get to the value. As we continue down the road with various stakeholders, we cannot expect reimbursement to go up in any way, shape or form. We are a low-cost provider, and our charges are some of the lowest in [North Carolina]. From a strategic business perspective, we're in great shape, but the way we see the environment unfolding, we have to continue increasing the value proposi - tion 5 to 10 percent over the next three to four years to remain viable in the community. Denis Conroy: One is as we switch to a budget- based payment system from fee-for-service, we are having to change the way we managed in this en- vironment. We have a physician hospital organiza-tion, and we have been doing [global payments] for commercial contracts, so we have a little bit of a leg up. But with Medicare going to an ACO arrange - ment, we have to get even better at it. Another issue relates to the financial markets, principally the interest rates. We have interest rate swaps and defined benefit pension plans, both of which are negatively affected by the low interest rate environment. There are positive im-pacts of the lower rates as well, but the calcula - tion of pension liabilities and swap market val-ues are very sensitive to interest rates, and they haven't been in our favor recently. Dan Fromm: The list is broad and expanding. However, there are four issues that are high pri-orities as I think of challenges to our financial health. One is the growing strain on all sources of revenue \u2014 commercial and government. Two, we have numerous challenges resulting from new healthcare delivery models, including new payment models. Three, slow economic growth has weakened the macroeconomic environment. There have been lower utilization patterns and in- creased exposure to uncompensated care. Lastly, balance sheet pressures are increasingly driven by continued volatility in markets, swap portfolios, access to capital and liquidity issues. In addition to these four areas, there are also increasing costs in attracting and retaining our workforce, and IT costs are spiraling out of con- trol. A newer trend is the convergence of clinical and financial issues. That's certainly something we're paying close attention to.Hospital CFO Panel: How Are y ou Approaching your Fiscal Strategy Right Now?

Accounts Receivable Management Third Party Billing Insurance Follow-up Self-Pay Billing and Follow-up Flex-Staffing Energize your revenue cycle877-254-9580 www.hbcs.org/energize1 ou need a Krieger: Always at the top of mind is the reimbursement environment. There are chal-lenges over the horizon with healthcare reform, and that makes us think continually, \"How do we deliver high-quality healthcare at a better price point? That challenge begins with our employ - ees. Engaging employees and the medical staff revolves around value proposition of, \"How do we deliver excellent outcomes and excellent service so there's more value for the patient?\" A lot of the conversation is around value, sup-ply costs, capital costs \u2014 better healthcare out - comes at a lower cost. Changing the paradigm is the only way you can change both. Q: How do Medicare and Medicaid fac- tor into your organization's overall fis- cal strategy right now? CB: Medicare is about 50 percent of our patient base, and Medicaid is about 20 percent. Ten per - cent are uninsured. On the Medicare side, an aver - age hospital will barely cover its costs. Medicaid, for an average hospital, gets reimbursed 75 to 80 per - cent of their costs. There isn't any other industry I'm aware of that has that kind of dynamic. That's the healthcare environment we're in right now, and that's our challenge. Part of our strategy plan is marketing and meeting the needs of those who do have insurance. Most hospitals aren't this heavy in Medicare and Medicaid, but it's our mission. DC: They are a high percentage of our business. Between the two, they are roughly 50 percent. Neither of them pays very well. We were on a trajectory to get our expense structure in line to make money on Medicare, but some of the cuts are starting to materialize \u2014 and there are more on the horizon \u2014 so it's hard to get there. We qualify for Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, but it appears that will be going away. And who knows what's going to happen with se - questration. These pressures contributed to us en-tering affiliation discussions with another not-for-profit organization, the Lahey Clinic. Lahey has a wide range of tertiary services, and for a number reasons, they are a very good affiliation candidate for us. We're about 15 miles apart, and we comple - ment one another in services and geography. They are very much an adult specialty, tertiary place, and we have OB, pediatrics, long-term care and behav-ioral health \u2014 it's a good fit that way as well. DF: We have strategies for each. At the federal level, we are trying to play a role in industry re-form. We are one of the 32 organizations par - ticipating in Medicare's Pioneer ACO project. At the state level, there are increasing exposures from a budget perspective. We have been in dis- cussions with lawmakers to develop alternative models of care and payment for these popula - tions as well. Our work began several years ago with various commercial payor partners to de - velop new payment models that reward value created by increased patient satisfaction, higher levels of quality and reduced total cost of care. Now, the state and federal governments are mir - roring what we've done on the commercial side.MK: We're looking at the broader picture of the need for deficit reduction and the challenges the federal and state governments have with their bud-gets. Under any scenario, regardless of what politi-cal environment or legislation there is, there will be less dollars coming from [Medicare and Medicaid]. We've evaluated healthcare reform as it is now on the books, and even if it were to change in the Su-preme Court or in future legislative action, there's going to be less dollars coming our way. Ten years out on the horizon, we are projecting what that impact will be on our organization, and it's signifi - cant. We're looking at decreased [reimbursement]. Medicare is about 35 percent of our payor mix, and Medicaid is about 20 percent. Q: Can you explain how payor and man- aged care negotiations have evolved over the past 12 to 18 months? CB: Even though our hospital is owned by the county, we have a specialty group that manages the payor negotiations with managed care payors. DC: We have three major commercial payors in Massachusetts \u2014 Blue Cross Blue Shield, Har - vard Pilgrim and Tufts Health Plan. We have rel- atively recent contracts with two of the three \u2014 Blue Cross and Tufts. In both cases, we're trying to get away from the fee-for-service arrange - ment to more of a risk-based one. The Blue Cross product is called the Alternative Quality Contract, and that has a budget and quality com-ponent. We're now in our third year, and I think it has the incentives in the right places. There's enough quality money in there so it's not lip ser - vice. Tufts has the same kind of arrangement but more of the focus is efficiency. As a result of the intervention of the state regu - lators, we expect the payment levels are headed toward a fairly narrow range. All three HMOs are not-for-profit and are very much focused on the long term. We're an important provider for all three. It's still a negotiation process, but it's not an acrimonious one. DF: We have four major commercial payors in the Twin Cities that dominate the marketplace. We've done work with all four to develop new payment models. [Negotiations] have become more collaborative and less adversarial. We have been able to find shared goals and objectives as we look to reduce total costs of care and improve quality. Our negotiations have been grounded in principles developed around those goals, and I've found them to be a lot more collaborative and less contentious. It's a much different per - spective today than several years ago. That's not to say all ills have been solved, but I would say in general, the approach is very different. MK: What we see from [commercial and man- aged care payors] is the same challenges that we're seeing from government payors. Man - aged care payors represent employers, who are also having challenges with regards to their cost structures. So we see the same types of focus on value-based purchasing and pay-for-per -formance in those negotiations. It's very much mirroring what we see coming from the govern-ment. The one area not mentioned is self-pay \u2014 we have about 5 to 7 percent who are uninsured. Q: What are some of the major initia - tives you and the hospital are focusing on right now in the revenue cycle, bill - ing and collections departments? DF: We have tactics and strategies across the entire revenue cycle. On the front end, we are looking at how we increase our self-pay conver - sion rate by helping uninsured patients find cov-erage alternatives. Clinical documentation and charge capture are also a major focus in the mid-revenue cycle, and then on the back end, we are continuing to be as efficient and effective with our follow-up collection processes as we can be. Clearly, technology is becoming an important factor as we see higher exposure to patient li-ability expenses, which are costlier to collect, so we're looking to automated workflow solutions to help make the process more efficient. MK: Significant efforts are under way in upgrad - ing our tech platform. It's a BJC HealthCare-wide effort. We're in the process of implementing an entirely new registration and patient accounting system. We're also looking at upgrading our elec - tronic medical records system, so there's a whole effort of upgrading the technology platform. As part of that, we're looking at all of the pro - cesses to make sure we eliminate defects in the registration and scheduling areas and having all the required certifications to assure payors will agree to pay for care you provide. These new systems that are being implemented incorporate tools to allow you to do that in the front end of the process, where it ought to be done. It's a lot of workflow changes for employees as well as the physicians. Q: How has the ICD-10 delay impacted your operational strategy? CB: Even with the announcement of [CMS] de - laying [ICD-10], we are still going forward with it. There's no risk in adopting early. Even if we meet initial deadlines and no one else is ready, we can still submit everything in ICD-9. We're going to meet our milestones and tweak things on the backend so everything is perfect. Is it going to cost any resources? Yep. But we're making sure everyone will be trained because we're expecting a less productive system when it comes to coding \u2014 and that's from everything we've heard from those who have gone from ICD-9 to ICD-10. We're being conservative so we have enough resources and make sure we have everything. DC: We exhaled and said \"phew!\" after hearing about the delay. It's a significant undertaking that we're just getting started to do. The Version 5010 billing requirements that we just got through was rocky enough so we weren't looking forward to ICD-10 following on quickly. www.hbcs.org Why do we consider ourselves a partner?

We started on [ICD-10 conversion] early and built what I think is a very robust, thoughtful plan. We're continuing to move forward, and even with an extra year, there's still a lot of work to do. The delay hasn't deterred us at all, and we hope it won't deter others either. MK: We have our ICD-10 conversion project under way. Despite what looks like an assured 12-month delay, we very much welcome that. It's a significant change for all healthcare organiza-tions and will require significant education of our workforce as well as how we interact with phy - sicians. [The delay] is welcome, but we won't be slowing down our efforts. There's quite a bit of work to do. The delay will just allow us to have excellent execution, but it won't change our focus. Q: What has the hospital bond market been like, and how would you char-acterize your hospital's or health sys-tem's current credit standing? CB: The bond market, with the crash and credit markets of the past three to four years, has re- ally gotten sharp and specialized. It's healthy \u2014 there's capital out there, and hospitals want to use capital to meet needs in the next five to 10 years. We have a strong balance sheet, with an investment-grade rating, but the pressure with any hospital is going to be on the operating side. DC: Our credit rating is OK. We've been con- sistent at Baa2 by Moody's \u2014 which is invest - ment-grade. Moody's just announced a potential downgrade of the short-term credit ratings of some banks, one of which provides credit sup-port for some of our bonds. As such, we're looking at the different options right now in case they are downgraded. It's an immediate concern. Fortunately, we have good enough relationships with the banks and have decent enough credit, so if we need to, we could replace the credit sup-port or restructure the debt in some way. DF: We have A-rated credit, and maintaining that credit worthiness is important to us. We're working hard to make sure we remain fiscally strong and address the issues that markets see as important. It's important to be responsive to the challenges facing our industry and make wise investment decisions in a changing environment. MK: We're part of the BJC HealthCare, and that is really managed at the system level by Kevin Roberts. However, we have a positive relation-ship with the debt markets. We are in very good shape in terms of borrowing, and the environ-ment is favorable in terms of interest rates. Ma - jor facility improvements are on the horizon, and the current environment is conducive with our strong balance sheet.We are in the process of looking at a major campus renewal, but no final decisions have been made. We know we have a campus that has been aging. We still have a very large complement of semi-private rooms \u2014 about 65 percent of our beds are semi-private \u2014 and one of our goals is to move that number in a positive direction, more like 80 per - cent. That's a major facility renewal effort. We also have some of our key programs, like the Siteman Cancer Center, that have been growing significantly. We need to provide some capacity for growth in cancer, transplant programs, heart and vascular services, neurosurgery and neurolo-gy. We've been seeing growth in all of these and need to provide capacity to take on continued growth. This is in the planning stages, but there is nothing definite at this point in time. Q: What are your biggest financial con- cerns in the upcoming year or so? CB: We've got a number of strategic initiatives in a rolling five-year plan. We want to remain nimble yet meet the needs of the community. As much as we want to make sure there's enough cash flow to meet those [initiatives], I can't bet on that. Our goal is to make sure we have every - thing in operations to meet our needs in three to five years. If we're short of that, we may have to go to the market and find alternatives. Sustainability, long-term, will be a serious chal- lenge. For the first time, we hear about institutions talking about hours of cash [on hand]. The normal metric is days cash. I've never heard of that before, and that's very concerning. No community should be put into that position. It's terrible to hear a hos-pital could be hours away from closing its doors. Local communities need healthcare. DC: Our affiliation with the Lahey Clinic closed on April 30. We are focusing on bringing these organizations together. We'll get some savings by combining organizations. We're not closing any campuses because there is not a lot of duplication of services. We're going to focus on capturing market share, doing better under risk [payor] con-tracts, operating efficiently and saving on capital. DF: Pressure on operations is something that's a concern. We see those pressures growing, while our capital appetite is still strong. We want to perform well and create financial capacity for future investment. MK: We're focused on the value proposition, and that is engagement with the medical staff and en- gagement with employees. We have to be able to improve outcomes with lower costs, but the key is engaging our key stakeholders. We spend a lot of time with regards to communicating our em-ployees, internal communications and leadership training at all levels of management. We're also partnering with medical staff on supply costs and are changing relationships with vendors and part - nering with them in different ways to improve ef-ficiencies. In all of this, we've been working with lean principles in the way we do our work. We re - ally have to partner with employees in a different way, and lean methods are how we are doing that. Q: How would you advise other hospi - tal or health system CFOs to reach fi- nancial viability within the next one or two fiscal years? CB: We're trying to keep the community in- volved in strategic planning and what the com- munity sees in the next five to 10 years. We want to stay local. We utilize regional and national re-sources for various reasons, but most healthcare markets are driven by local and regional forces. My advice: Be attuned to what the [local com-munity] market needs are. Keep them first. If I'm not doing something that's adding value to patient, am I adding value? Our focus is really trying to stay on the customer. That's who we are here for, and we have to be nimble. Over the next two to three years, things could easily shift down the road. It's tough right now. DC: We're a relatively large community hospital system, about $375 million in hospital revenue, another $100 million in our senior health unit and behavioral health units. We have decent size, and we're struggling with overhead costs associated with a hospital in today's world. There are regula-tory issues, payment issues, trying to become an insurer as well as hospital \u2014 it's hard for me to believe smaller hospitals will be able to stay inde - pendent. My general advice to my friends at other community hospitals is to dust off those affilia-tion plans and see where there is a good fit be-cause it's going to be awfully difficult to go alone. DF: Make sure you have a strong planning func - tion. We're continuously monitoring and trying to stay abreast of issues that will have an impact on our organization, short and long term. We try to get ahead of those issues, anticipate the potential impact on our organization and proactively de - velop solutions. MK: It's a longer journey than one or two years. I may be repeating myself, but I can't emphasis this enough. You have to engage the workforce. The way they do their jobs and see themselves as part of the improvement effort \u2014 they are on the frontlines where the work is being done. They know where the inefficiencies are. Making them a part of the solution is the only way this will work. There are no silver bullets or quick fixes. It's a long journey, and you have to partner with your stakeholders to provide healthcare at a better price point. n You don't need another vendorI know your business better than you do I make promises I can't keep I tell you what you want to hear I outsource off-shore but promote it as in-house I just got trained last week Contact us today, and start capturing the full value of the services you provide.HBCS is no vendor.

Accounts Receivable Management Third Party Billing Insurance Follow-up Self-Pay Billing and Follow-up Flex-Staffing Energize your cycle877-254-9580 Partner Ads BHR 1 5/7/12 5:54 PM41 Finance & Revenue Cycle Issues CMS issued a proposed rule for hospitals paid under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System that would increase Medicare's oper - ating payments to acute-care hospitals by about 0.9 percent \u2014 or roughly $904 million \u2014 in fiscal year 2013. In addition, CMS looks to boost the emphasis on tying Medicare payments to value-based and quality-driven efforts as it proposed to expand the Val-ue-Based Purchasing Program and Inpatient Quality Reporting Program. \"The proposed rule would implement key elements of the [Patient Protec - tion and] Affordable Care Act's Value-Based Purchasing Program as well as the hospital readmissions reduction program,\" said CMS Acting Admin-istrator Marilyn Tavenner in a news release . \"It also establishes the ground - work for extending Medicare's quality reporting programs beyond general acute-care hospitals to other types of facilities. It is part of a comprehen-sive strategy to use Medicare's payment systems to foster better care and better value in all settings, thereby reducing overall Medicare spending.\" Overall, CMS estimates total Medicare spending on inpatient hospital services will increase by about $175 million next fiscal year. Here are some of the big-gest elements of this year's Medicare IPPS proposed rule, which will affect roughly 3,400 acute-care hospitals and 440 long-term acute-care hospitals. Medicare payments to acute-care hospitals would increase by about 0.9 percent. Medicare payments to LTAC hospitals would increase by 1.9 percent, or about $100 million. Hospitals that successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Qual-ity Reporting Program \u2014 which authorizes CMS to pay hospitals to report certain quality measures to earn a higher update to their Medi-care payments \u2014 would receive a total payment boost of 2.3 percent. Hospitals that do not submit successful quality measure would see a 2 percent decrease in Medicare payments but would still see a 0.3 percent update overall. CMS arrived at its proposed net payment rate of 2.3 percent by com-bining a 3 percent update of the hospital Medicare market basket (which adjusts for inflation, costs and other economic factors) with a -0.9 percent decrease from PPACA requirements and a 0.2 percent increase for documentation and coding updates. In last year's final IPPS rule, CMS finalized the policies of the Hospi-tal Readmissions Reduction Program. These policies included a final definition of \"readmission,\" which refers to a patient admission to an acute-care hospital paid under the IPPS that occurred within 30 days of discharge from the same or another acute-care hospital, and the use of three 30-day readmission measures (acute myocardial infarc-tion, heart failure and pneumonia), among others. In this year's proposed rule, CMS proposed a way to calculate the ratio of a hospital's aggregate dollars for excess readmissions to the hospital's aggregate dollars for all discharges. This methodology, or the readmission adjustment factor, would result in a 0.3 percent Medicare payment decrease for hospitals. CMS proposed several measures for the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program . In order for hospitals to receive the full annual percentage increase, hospitals must report the required data on cer - tain quality measures. In the proposed rule, CMS would reduce the number of measures in the IQR from 72 to 59 for FY 2015 because some of the measures are duplicative from the Hospital Compare website (a full list can be found on pages 659 and 660). Seventeen to-tal measures would be removed, as CMS also plans to add measures. CMS based its recommendations on input from the National Quality Fo-rum. Of the added measures, CMS wants to adopt three claims-based measures and one chart-abstracted measure on perinatal care, a structural measure and more survey-based measures for FY 2015 and beyond. A complete list of the proposed Hospital IQR Program measures for FY 2015 can be found on pages 705 through 708. In addition, because more than 99 percent of sampled hospitals had vali- dated data in the most recent fiscal year, CMS proposed to halve the annual random sample from 800 hospitals to 400 hospitals in FY 2014. On Oct. 1, 2012, CMS will begin making value-based incentive pay - ments under the VBP Program to hospitals. The VBP Program will be funded for FY 2013 through a 1 percent decrease in hospital Medicare payments (in FY 2014, the percentage will be 1.25 percent, and by FY 2017, the percentage will cap at 2 percent). CMS proposed to add two requirements to the VBP Program for FY 2015: the addi-tion of three care/outcomes measures and the addition of \"Medicare spending per beneficiary\" in the efficiency section. The VBP Program for FY 2014 has been finalized (a complete list of clini-cal process of care, patient experience of care and outcome measures for the FY 2014 VBP Program can be found on page 795 of the proposed rule), and CMS began planning for the FY 2015 requirements. CMS pro - posed to retain 12 of the 13 clinical process of care measures from the FY 2014 program and adopt one new clinical process of care measure \u2014 \"AMI-10: Statin Prescribed at Discharge.\" For outcome measures, CMS proposed keeping the three 30-day mortality measures from the FY 2014 program while also adding two additional outcomes measures \u2014 \"PSI-90\" and the \"CLABSI\" (central line-associate blood stream infection measure). Patient experience of care measures will remain the same. CMS also wants to adopt the Medicare spending per beneficiary measure to the efficiency category in FY 2015. CMS just added that measure to its Hospital Compare website. Blair Childs, senior vice president of public affairs for the Premier healthcare alliance, said many within the healthcare setting appreciate CMS' efforts to fine tune the VBP Program, but the new efficiency measure could cause risks to Medicare reimbursements. \"While the [Medicare spending per beneficiary] measure in principle has merit, it still has not been tested and can't be replicated,\" Mr. Childs said. \"The end result is a lack of national data that hospitals can use to verify CMS' calcula - tions, determine the appropriateness of the methodology or analyze true differences in performance.\" In conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CMS proposed adding two new conditions to the hospital-acquired condition payment provision list. The HAC payment provisions im-pact hospital payments for HACs that are high-cost, high-volume or both and could have been prevented through evidence-based mea-sures. The two proposed conditions were surgical site infection fol-lowing cardiac implantable electronic device procedures and pneu-mothorax with venous catheterization Regarding graduate medical education and indirect medical educa - tion, CMS proposed increasing the timeframe for new teaching hos-CMS Releases Fy 2013 IPPS Proposed Rule: 12 Points to Know By Bob Herman42 Finance & Revenue Cycle Issues pitals to establish their caps for new GME and IME programs from three to five years. There are several expiring provisions of the PPACA that will go into effect in FY 2013. The Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program, which awarded extra payments to small, rural hospitals that rely heav-ily on Medicare patients, was extended by the PPACA through the end of FY 2012. Starting Oct. 1, 2012, those rural hospitals will no longer receive the enhanced payments. The PPACA also amended the Low-Volume Hospital Payment Adjust - ment, but starting in FY 2013, hospitals that qualify for this Medicare pay - ment adjustment will be paid on the former qualifications. For FY 2011 and FY 2012, a hospital could be considered a \"low-volume hospital\" if it was more than 15 miles away from another hospital and had less than 1,600 Medicare discharges. Now, hospitals would have to be more than 25 miles away from another hospital and have less than 200 Medicare discharges. These hospitals would receive a 25 percent payment adjustment instead of a payment update on a sliding scale. CMS proposed to postpone the implementation date of the \"services furnished under arrangements\" requirements for cost reporting periods beginning on or after Oct. 1, 2013. Currently, therapeutic and diagnostic services are the only services that can be delivered under arrangement outside of the hospital to Medicare beneficiaries. \"Routine services,\" which include bed, board, nursing and other related services, must be delivered by the hospital. CMS has discovered many affected hospitals need additional time to abide by the requirements that only therapeutic and diagnostic services can be furnished outside their facilities. In order to help low-bed hospitals qualify for the soon-to-expire Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, CMS proposed to include labor and delivery beds in their total bed count. Conse-quently, this would impact indirect medical education payments be-cause it would reduce the resident-to-bed ratio that determines IME adjustments. CMS projects included labor and delivery beds in the available bed day count would decrease IME payments by $170 mil-lion in FY 2013. CMS will continue to update hospitals, payors and other healthcare providers on the conversion of the MS-DRGs from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10 codes. The final version of the ICD-10 MS-DRGs will be implemented at the same time as ICD-10 goes live, which was recently delayed until Oct. 1, 2014. CMS will accept comments on the proposal rule until June 25 and will issue a final rule by August 1. n Moody's: 2012 Shows Even Mix of Hospital Upgrades, Downgrades By Bob Herman In the first quarter of 2012, Moody's Investors Service reported an equal number of upgrades and downgrades in the non-profit hospi-tal sector, but Moody's analysts expect a negative outlook for non- profit healthcare providers for the remainder of 2012. \"While downgrades and upgrades were on par with each other during the first quarter, we expect downgrades to eventually outpace upgrades by the end of the year,\" said Carrie Sheffield, an associate analyst at Moody's and the author of the first quarter report. \"This assumption reflects the pres-sures facing the [non-profit] healthcare sector and the fact that the ma-jority of hospital ratings under review are trending toward downgrade.\" As of March 31, five ratings were under review \u2014 four for possible downgrades and one for possible upgrade. The amount of debt on review for downgrade is $604 million, far greater than the $45 million of debt on review for upgrade. Overall, there were 11 upgrades and 11 downgrades in the first quarter compared with five upgrades and six downgrades in the first quarter of 2011. Upgraded debt equaled $2.75 billion compared with $1.44 billion in downgraded debt, a ratio of 1.91 to 1. Moody's also affirmed 65 ratings, which represented roughly three-quar - ters of all rating activity in the quarter and affected $28 billion of debt. Eight of the affirmations led to positive outlooks, while five led to nega-tive outlooks. nFitch: Patient Admissions, Pricing Trends Mixed at For-Profit Hospitals By Bob Herman Fitch-rated for-profit hospitals experienced varying operating trends over the past year, as urban hospitals saw stronger volume growth but weaker pricing trends than hospitals in rural and sub- urban settings, according to a report from Fitch Ratings . In the fourth quarter of 2011, same-hospital adjusted admissions in-creased 1.6 percent at for-profit hospitals in urban markets compared with the fourth quarter in 2010. In that same period, rural for-profits witnessed a 0.8 percent decline in same-hospital adjusted admissions due to weak activity in obstetrics and less acute service lines. Throughout 2012, Fitch expects for-profit hospitals to receive larger payments from the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive Program. The ratings agency also predicts for-profit opera-tors will remain active in the merger and acquisition market, as the acquired revenue has been a major contributor to adjusted admissions growth. n43 Transaction & Valuation Issues Merger and acquisition activity in healthcare has increased over recent years, driven largely by challenging operating environ - ments and decreasing reimbursements. At the same time, the federal government is encouraging better coordination of care with more advanced technology \u2014 both of which require significant investment \u2014 in order to reduce national healthcare costs. For these reasons, many hospitals and health systems have been considering transactions. Recent uptick in M&A activity has given the Federal Trade Commission more healthcare transactions to review. According to an FTC report in March 2012, the agency has \"redoubled its efforts to prevent hospital mergers that may level insufficient local options for inpatient services, chal-lenging three such mergers in federal court in the past year.\" FTC Chair - man Jon Leibowitz has said the agency challenges anticompetitive hospital mergers in order to control healthcare costs. The \"redoubling of efforts\" by the FTC is evident in challenges over the past few years. Some healthcare professionals view the FTC's renewed focus as aggressive, and many hospitals and health system officials are confused. Since lowering healthcare costs is a major focus, it makes sense that the FTC would want to verify healthcare mergers and acquisitions are not anticompetitive. However, other arms of the federal government are producing regulations and rules that directly and indirectly encourage coordination and integration to decrease healthcare costs. When one way to achieve higher quality, better efficiency and lower costs is through consolidations and partnerships, it is no surprise that hospital executives are confused. \"Some healthcare professionals may feel that healthcare is regulated in ways different than regular commercial industries and therefore, hospitals and health systems should be treated differently by the FTC,\" says Brian Browder, partner at Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis law firm. \"The FTC has not been persuaded by that argument.\" In order to understand whether the FTC's reviews have become more restric - tive or if transactions are just more fervently crossing the anticompetitive line, it is important to review some mergers the FTC has challenged since 2010. 3 Recent FTC Challenges OSF Healthcare & Rockford Health SystemOSF Healthcare in Peoria, Ill., and Rockford (Ill.) Health System recently canceled merger plans due to the prospect of a two-year legal battle with the FTC. The affiliation, which began in February 2011, planned to merge Rockford Memorial Hospital with OSF's Saint Anthony Medical Center. It would have reduced the number of acute-care hospitals in Rockford from three to two. The two entities argued that the consolidation would improve efficiency and quality of care in line with goals set by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The FTC challenged the merger in November 2011 claiming it would substantially reduce competition among hospitals and primary care physicians in the Rockford area, leading to higher costs. This April, a U.S. District judge ordered OSF and Rockford Health to sus - pend the planned merger until the FTC could hold an administrative trial in Washington. Shortly after the ruling, OSF and Rockford Health announced they had canceled the merger rather than pursue a legal battle. St. Luke's Health & ProMedica Health System In the summer of 2010, Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica Health System acquired St. Luke's Hospital in Maumee, Ohio. ProMedica planned to pro -vide capital for St. Luke's to adopt electronic health record adoption to standardize care. In January 2011, the FTC challenged the merger claiming it was anticom- petitive since it reduced the number of competing hospitals in the area from four to three and allegedly would contribute to higher prices. Over a year later, on March 22, 2012, the FTC ruled that ProMedica's acquisi - tion of St. Luke's did lessen competition and increased prices for general inpatient hospital services and inpatient obstetric services in the Toledo area. ProMedica has been given six months to divest St. Luke's to an FTC- approved buyer. However, a month after the FTC's final order, officials from ProMedica and St. Luke's decided to file an appeal in the 6 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Palmyra Medical Center & Phoebe Putney Health SystemThe FTC has waged a long court battle to stop the acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center in Albany, Ga., by the Albany Dougherty Hospital Authority, which owns Palmyra's only competitor, Phoebe Putney Health System, also in Albany. The battle began in April 2011 when the FTC filed a formal complaint against the acquisition. In June 2011, the Georgia District Court heard argu-ments from both sides and a federal judge sided with Palmyra and Phoebe Put - ney. Later in the month, the FTC filed an appeal, and in July 2011, a preliminary injunction on the deal was granted. However, the court of appeals later ruled on the side of the health systems. The FTC then filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. The case is still pending. According to the FTC, the $195 mil-lion acquisition illegally consolidates the market for acute-care hospital services in a six-county area and raises a strong risk for higher healthcare prices. What is causing the confusion? The above-mentioned transactions shed some light on the recent debate over the role of FTC in healthcare M&A. Some have called the FTC's reviews aggressive because they have led to challenges such as the three mentioned above. Mr. Browder understands the rationale behind the FTC's argument \u2014 with fewer hospitals in one market, price increases could po-tentially go unchecked. \"Without competition, a hospital or system could theoretically set a higher price for a service and patients would have no other option for care but to leave the market,\" he explains. \"Moving for - ward, the challenge will be in finding ways to address this concern while establishing new coordinated care models, particularly in markets where hospitals are struggling to survive financially.\" According to the FTC enforcement policy, many hospitals and acquisitions do not present competitive concerns. The agency does not challenge mergers or acquisitions in which one participating hospital has an average of less than 100 licensed beds and an average daily inpatient census of less than 40 patients. These characteristics must be the same over the three most recent years. The FTC includes these parameters because some acute-care hospitals, like rural hospitals, meet these criteria and are unlikely to achieve the efficiencies that larger hospitals \"enjoy\" \u2014 efficiencies needed to integrate and coordinate care. Additionally, the FTC states that the following scenarios are transactions which would not be considered anticompetitive: a merger unlikely to in-crease market power for a participating hospital; a merger that allows a hospital(s) significant cost-savings that would be otherwise unrealized; and a merger that eliminates a hospital likely to fail in its market. An Overview of Recent Challenges to Hospital Transactions: Is the FTC Really More Aggressive? By: Kathleen Roney44 Transaction & Valuation Issues \"While there is not anything new about FTC reviews, in the current health- care landscape the agendas of federal agencies [and departments] are over - lapping,\" says Thomas Jeffry, a partner in the healthcare and life sciences practice groups of Arent Fox, a law firm with emphasis on life sciences, real estate and finance. \"While the FTC is curbing monopolies and antitrust behavior, [CMS] is enforcing regulations to improve quality and reduce cost. CMS is advocating higher quality, better efficiency and lower costs while the FTC is saying you should not combine if the resulting structure is anticompetitive,\" says Mr. Jeffry. The need to bolster quality care, provide capital to adopt electronic medical records and standardize care through clinical protocols were cited as reasons for the St. Luke's and ProMedica merger \u2014 advancements in care and tech-nology that CMS and the federal government support. Similarly, the OSF and Rockford Health officials claimed their planned merger would improve efficiency and quality of care. They even went so far as to cite the PPACA as an instigator of the transaction. Officials from all of the above-mentioned examples did not believe their transactions were anticompetitive. Gary Kaatz, president and CEO of Rockford Health, and Dave Schertz, president and CEO of OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center in Rockford, released a joint statement around the time of the FTC challenge saying they \"have no question that the affiliation is competitively appropriate.\" ProMedica believed the FTC's challenge of its deal went against major themes of healthcare reform. In a statement ProMedica claimed the FTC's antitrust challenge of the merger was \"inconsistent with the integration and coordination that healthcare reform both encourages and requires.\" Lastly, attorneys for the Palmyra and Phoebe Putney transaction, still battling the FTC's challenge, believe they have the right to consolidate Palmyra and Phoe - be Putney due to its public ownership, which exempts the transaction from federal antitrust laws. What can hospitals, health systems do? According to Mr. Jeffry, beyond just following FTC regulations very closely, another way to avoid antitrust and anticompetitive challenges by the FTC may be demonstrating community benefit of the merger or acquisition. The benefit for the community has to go beyond the combined financial strength of the entities. While the combined financial strength may be a given, Mr. Jeffry says that should not be the sole reason for a transaction. \"It is more effective to build the case that each facility involved in the merger could not achieve a new service or a new program without the combination of resources because of the transaction,\" says Mr. Jeffry. \"For example, the need to develop a cancer center for the community which has limited oncol-ogy resources makes for a more defensible transaction,\" says Mr. Jeffry. \"Po-sition the merger as, not only would the financial health of the hospital be better, but the hospital will be able to provide better, more cost-effective care to the community through services that are unattainable without a merger.\" Since, the FTC is particularly concerned with mergers that result in only one hospital or health system in an area, the most viable solution may be to avoid \"bread and butter\" mergers that could lessen competition in an area. \"If a merger could maintain competitiveness, the FTC may view it more favorably. However, it may be unrealistic to carve out aspects of a merger just keep the two entities competitive,\" says Mr. Jeffry. \"Other than that, hospital executives just need to understand how to structure a joint venture or a merger so that the result is not anticompetitive.\" Although it may seem that the FTC has become overly aggressive in its reviews of healthcare transactions, antitrust regulations remain largely un-changed. Instead, any perceived increase in scrutiny is more likely a result of the FTC \"redoubling efforts.\" In order for hospital and health systems to see deals come to fruition, they should closely examine FTC rules and regulations before any sort of transaction to avoid anticompetitive ele - ments and proactively make a case for the deal's community benefits. n $19 Billion in federal EMR incentives, but what will it do for the bottom line? It's great to see the clinical side of healthcare becoming more digitized to improve its mission. Now what can be done about its margin? There is hard proof that an operational platform which drives out waste and sustains operational efficiencies can increase your margin. Real-Time Capacity Management gives you tighter operational control, which goes right to the bottom line. So, if you want the patient there as the record arrives, medical devices where you need them, and beds when you need them, give us a call. Because, without a margin, there is no mission. www.teletracking.com / 800.331.3603 / info@teletracking.comReal-Time Capacity Management Beckers 2012 ads v19BLLN.indd 1 1/9/12 12:47 PM45 Legal & Regulatory Issues The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in March 2010 has had a significant impact on the evolving healthcare industry. The PPACA legislation has created a new sense of urgency within the indus-try to discover new care delivery models, increase access for healthcare and challenge the quality of care that is being provided to patients. New pro-grams are being piloted (e.g., the accountable care organizations, bundled payments, etc.) and hos-pitals and physicians alike are critically evaluating their strategic responses to the proposed legisla-tion. Regardless of what happens in Congress or the Supreme Court in 2012, health reform is inevitable, and there are requirements that health-care systems need to understand in order to avoid constant regulatory pressure. Buried within the 2,300 pages of the PPACA are four new requirements for 501(c)(3) hospitals. Specifically, the PPACA imposes new tax re-quirements on 501(c)(3) hospital organizations for tax years beginning after March 23, 2012. The law added two new sections to the Internal Revenue Code documenting the new mandates identified below: 1. Each tax-exempt hospital must adopt and implement written financial assistance and emergency medical care policies. 2. The hospital organization must limit charges for emergency or other necessary medical care. 3. Comply with new billing and collection restrictions. 4. Each tax-exempt hospital is required to conduct a Community Health Needs As-sessment. Arguably the most significant requirement, the Community Health Needs Assessment will ne-cessitate a well defined approach and process from hospitals to ensure a successful completion of this IRS mandate. In its simplest definition, a CHNA is the ongo- ing process for a hospital to evaluate the health needs of a community, which facilitates a priori - tization of needs and strategies to address them. The PPACA legislation uses only one page out of 2,300 pages to define a CHNA. Thankfully the IRS posted a 26-page document in 2011 to provide further clarity on what could be seen as an intentionally ambiguous subject. If a hospital is one of the 2,918 non-govern- ment non-profit hospitals in the U.S and it fits the following requirements, the hospital is sub-ject to the CHNA:1. The organization is required to be li-censed by the state. 2. The IRS determines hospital care as the organization's principal function. 3. State-licensed hospitals operated through a disregarded entity or joint venture \u2014 treated as the activities of the tax exempt partner, multi-hospital systems, critical ac-cess hospitals organized as 501(c)(3). In addition, it is important for multi-hospital sys - tems to understand that each hospital is required to produce its own implementation strategy. Beginning in 2012 the CHNA is required every three years. Hospital organizations not in com-pliance with this mandate will be penalized up to $50,000 per year and can be at risk of los-ing non-profit status. In the past the assessment has been shared with local government agencies and other healthcare entities in order to coor - dinate the allocation of both public and private resources. The IRS also requires a communication of re- sults. Hospital organizations that perform the CHNA must make the report widely available by posting the written results on a website. Hospi-tals must also attach their Form 990 (from the IRS). The IRS plans to add questions reflecting the new reporting requirement for Form 990 in the future. Framing your response As hospitals embark on fulfilling the CHNA mandate, they should consider a well-defined scope and process. The scope can be simplified to three levels (compliance, coordination and coalition) that all meet the requirements of the PPACA and vary in the depth of assessment and the involvement from the community. As a hos-pital moves from compliance to coalition, the assessment shifts from health indicator analysis and individual interviews to detailed population health analysis and community task force. By using the scope to create an end-in-mind mentality and to force an understanding of the objective for the assessment, it is acceptable and realistic to strive for compliance. Compliance avoids any governmental penalties and helps prepare an organization for health reform. The information necessary to become compliant allows each organization to increase coordina - tion, quality and market awareness, while poten-tially decreasing cost. The organization also can use the CHNA to support informed decisions about services, health promotion and preven-tion programs. It is a support tool for managing the health of a population across the episode of care. A hospital organization should take a proactive approach to follow a defined path that leads to a satisfactory response to the CHNA. Once an acceptable scope is created, the hospital organization can analyze quantitative and quali- tative data to assess the community needs of the entities involved and to create the implementa - tion process. The CHNA process The core of the CHNA demonstrates the value each health organization brings to a community. Each organization should be committed to in-volving and informing the community in the process. It is recommended that local govern-ment officials, health agencies and other com-munity leaders be included in the analysis. Data assessment (secondary data). The data assessment performed should include the first requirement: develop a health profile of the county's population. After defining the service area for each hospital organization, analysis is performed on the population distribution. Typi-cally, data is compiled based on the ZIP codes within each service area. The objective is to obtain a distribution of age, sex, household income, payor mix, etc., all of which help to create an understanding of the so-cial and economic condition of the community. The data must be analyzed not only to reform the current state but to recognize if access to care will be a barrier in the future. After analyzing an ex-ternal view of the community, the hospital should review personal inventory. An environmental scan of the critical issues and forces impacting the future of the hospital can be performed (similar to a SWOT analysis). Assessing each hospital's strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities will be identified to build the foundation of an integrated, cohesive organization. Furthermore, a thorough analysis and/or review of existing physician alignment arrangements (if applicable) will be conducted to document the effectiveness of the existing alignment vehicle. Analysis of ex-isting agreements will help optimize the hospital and physician relationships across the organiza-tion. Once this assessment is performed, commu-nity input should be provided. Community input (primary data). Inter - view questionnaires, surveys or focus groups that are customized to various stakeholders (physicians, community, public health, school nurses, business community) will be developed to capture qualitative and quantitative responses including:Community Health Needs Assessment: 5 Phases to Compliance By Edward Stall, Principal, Craig Anderson Jr., Senior Manager, Matthew Fadel, MBA, Associate, Dixon Hughes Goodman 46 Legal & Regulatory Issues 1. Individual objectives regarding hospital and community strategies 2. Critical success factors 3. Barriers to success 4. Underserved and chronic disease populations 5. Measure/indicators for success 6. Baseline data The stakeholders must work together to determine the number of interviews needed to create a strong cross-section of perspectives and personal view - points. The community input should satisfy the second and third require - ments of the PPACA, determine how the community perceives its health status and healthcare needs and enable the identification of the major risk factors and causes of health issues. The interviews must be carefully planned to align with the gaps in the data discussed in the data assessment phase. Implementation strategy. The findings from the data assessment and community input phases will be used to create recommendations and an action plan to achieve success. This includes the development and delivery of an implementation plan to drive execution of the defined strategies. Components include a communication plan, priority initiative work plans, role and responsibility assignments, measure/indicators for success along with baseline data and project timelines. The Implementation Strategy phase will satisfy the last requirement of the PPACA legislation. Reporting. As stated previously, the CHNA must be widely available to the public. The community needs to understand the explicit issues and must be equally invested in the transformation of their healthcare network. Some recommendations include: 1. Secure board approval as the approval step in conducting the CHNA 2. Determine communication report format 3. Hospital website (required) 4. Report to the community 5. Coordinate with community benefits statement 6. Coordinate with Form 990 7. The implementation plan can be used for three fiscal years without revision 8. Post to website prior to end of fiscal year to meet CHNA requirement 9. Leverage implementation strategy to demonstrate value as a tax-exempt organization meeting community needs 10. File 990 Schedule H Monitoring. Through the implementation of each strategy, constant monitoring and updates must be performed to measure success. Demon-strated improvement is equally or even more valuable than performing the assessment. Performance indicators tied to community priorities will help the hospital organization monitor success on an annual basis. How do I get started? 1. Determine hospital leadership of the CHNA. Proper sponsorship is critical to the success of any project with organization-wide implica-tions. Key stakeholders would include: the CEO, the CFO, the head of planning and development, government officials, hospital board members, marketing officials, etc. 2. Confirm timing requirements and a high-level implementation plan for your organization. The project plan can be based off of the confirmed fiscal year end, which includes a reasonable timeline and established milestones. Anticipate approximately six to nine months to perform an adequate CHNA.3. Review service area definition for the hospital organization. A rec - ommendation would be to review the Stark II Area Definition, Met - ropolitan Service Area or the 990 Definition. A hospital organiza - tion can create a primary and secondary service area based on ZIP code and/or county discharge analysis. 4. Compile starting elements of a preliminary assessment using a web search of key sites to identify issues and challenges that can be de - tected early. 5. Guidance of potential model (compliance, coordination, coalition). Compliance and coordination can be hospital-led; coalition is much broader. 6. Determine strategy for internal or external partnering and evaluate benefits of a shared approach (community building, market percep- tion, cost sharing). Also consider the response if a competitor asks you to collaborate. 7. Determine approach if multiple facilities are collaborating on a CHNA. Confirm common approaches and a tool to comply with federal regulations. Assign a leader for each facility and possible steering committee. 8. Inform the hospital's board on standards, timing and approach. The board should be informed early and their input should be requested. n Dixon Hughes Goodman is the largest accounting firm based in the Southern U.S. and ranks among the nation's top 15.

OIG Claims Georgetown University Hospital Overbilled Medicare by 659K By Molly Gamble A report from the Office of Inspector General claims Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., overbilled Medicare by roughly $659,400 primarily due to misunderstandings of billing requirements. The OIG has recommended the hospital refund the overpayments, which consist of 94 incorrectly billed inpatient claims for short stays and excess charges and 40 incorrectly billed outpatient claims. It also recommended Georgetown strengthen its controls to ensure full compliance with Medi-care requirements. The 609-bed hospital issued comments to the OIG, concurring that the 94 inpatient claims were billed incorrectly. The hospital disagreed with OIG's overpayment amount for the inpatient claims, however, claiming it should be less than $634,653. The hospital said it anticipates lower figures once reimbursements are adjusted for the correct DRG assignments and Part B services provided. The hospital has agreed to refund $24,718 for the outpatient claims billed in error, but for inpatient claims, it \"will process appropriate refunds to the Medicare Administrative Contractor\" pending adjustment to reimburse-ment made for the services provided. nExamining Payments, Prescribing Solutions We're Vantiv.

Becker June 2012.indd 1 5/11/2012 2:32:50 PM48 Executive Briefing: OR Efficiency Sponsored by: Some hospital operating rooms are borrowing a practice from sports teams to boost efficiency: huddles. On the playing field, team mem-bers with different roles huddle to discuss strategies to win the game. In an OR, clinicians and staff can huddle to analyze and optimize the next day's schedule. Daily huddles in the OR can also improve communication and collaboration between physicians and staff, leading to greater employee satisfaction, improved safety and a better patient experience. David Young, MD, managing partner of Surgical Directions and medical director of pre-surgical testing at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Chicago, Nell Panten, DNP(c), MSN, RN, CNOR, NEA-BC, chief Directions, and Cindy Mahal-van Brenk, RN, MS, CNOR, director of opera - tions of surgical and GI services at Advo-cate Lutheran General Hospital, explain the inner workings of a successful daily huddle. What are daily huddles? At Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, a \"HUDDLE\" stands for Healthcare United for Daily Decisions through Leadership Enthusiasm. The huddle includes a group of OR stakeholders who meet every day at 2 p.m. for about 35 minutes to discuss 40 to 60 cases scheduled for the following day. The goal is to review any problems from the current day and prevent them from oc-curring in the future and to actively man-age the surgical schedule for the next day. \"We're trying to use collective intelligence to plan the next day and prevent any delays, cancellations or problems in a proactive way,\" Dr. Young says. What is the agenda? The huddle starts by recapping the day's problems, determining their root causes and planning to prevent the problems from recurring. Then, the team reviews all of the next day's cases. At Advocate Lutheran Gener - al, this is done by projecting the schedule for everyone to see and going through each case separately. Usually the scheduler calls out the case, after which the preanesthesia testing nurse provides the patient's clinical history. The team discusses patients who will need a pain block and those who may need special management, such as patients who have had previous pain issues and diabetic patients. The team also identifies inefficiencies in the schedule, such as a case that is scheduled for too much or not enough time, and rearranges the schedule to avoid delays and cancellations. In addition, the huddle discusses patients who may have antibiotic problems due to multiple allergies. Who participates? The huddle should include a multi-disciplinary team of representatives from different stages of the surgical process \u2014 from schedulers to ma-terials management to anesthesiologists. Including people from each area of the OR drives accountability, as each person plays an important role in creating an efficient process. For the huddle to be successful, everyone needs to be committed to the group; they need to arrive on time each day and understand the expectations. \"You have to identify people who believe in proactive management of problems and are willing to put in the time to make it right,\" Dr. Young says. In addition, the huddle should consist of the same people to create consistency and allow the group members to form a cohe-sive unit, according to Ms. Panten. A critical aspect of the huddle is that deci - sions are made collaboratively. \"Everyone is working in a cohesive manner to do what's best for the patient,\" Ms. Panten says. While nursing management and the anesthesiologist typically lead the group, everyone is expected to contribute. \"We believe in a just culture where everybody has a voice. That's why we involve all the different areas and feel that's really key. Ev-erybody has an opportunity to speak,\" Ms. Mahal-van Brenk says. The following areas should be represented in the huddle: 1. Nurse liaison navigator. The liaison reviews problems that occurred that day to determine the root causes and prevent them from recurring. 2. Scheduling. This person is responsible for knowing the next day's schedule. The scheduling representative will also need to contact surgeons to change the schedule when needed. At Advocate Lutheran General, the scheduling representative calls out each case of the next day to start the patient verification process as the huddle reviews each one. This allows the huddle to change the schedule the day before the surgery to improve efficiency. Calling the patient the evening before surgery also enables the scheduler to confirm the patient will arrive. 3. Preanesthesia testing. This person should know all the patients scheduled for the next day, as he or she provides the patients' clinical history and notes any potential problems from a clinical standpoint. At Advocate Lutheran General, the PAT nurse provides the history after the scheduler announces the case and also confirms the correct procedure is scheduled.

Anesthesia. The anesthesiologist is responsible for identifying pa- tients with histories of adverse reactions and developing plans to manage these patients. The anesthesia representative should also help arrange the schedule to best manage patients with co-morbid diseases. 5. Presurgery. This person is responsible for communicating with staff to alert them of anticipated problems related to the following day's cases. For example, Advocate Lutheran General Hospital identifies all diabetic patients scheduled for the next day. The presurgery representative needs to ensure these patients have their weight, vital signs and blood sugar tested when they come in so the team can begin managing their blood sugar as soon as possible. 6. Materials management/sterile processing. This person is re- sponsible for contacting the appropriate vendors when a device is needed for the next day's case and for ensuring the correct trays of materials are in sterile processing to be prepared for the next day. For example, if a total hip case is scheduled for the next day, the materials management represen-tative would verify the implant trays have arrived. Dr. Young says, \"It is essential to include materials management and sterile processing in the huddle to communicate the importance of this role in the surgical process. If the correct materials are not prepared for each case, there can be delays, which decrease surgeon and patient satisfaction and create inefficiencies.\" 7. Surgical leadership. The surgeon, who may participate by phone, is alerted to changes in the next day's schedule. Surgeons need to be aware of any schedule changes so they arrive on time for each case. The process is also audited by the executive director on a weekly basis to make sure that they have the tools they need to be successful and to remove recurring barriers.How can daily huddles drive efficiency? Dr. Young provides several examples of ways daily huddles can prevent delays and streamline processes. Scenario 1 A patient scheduled for the next day has been on chronic pain medication and may have issues related to postoperative pain management. The pre-surgery representative in the daily huddle would notify the anesthesiologist caring for that patient. The anesthesiologist would then develop a pain plan that may include a regional block, according to Dr. Young. The huddle participants would also notify the advanced practice nurse in pain about the patient so he or she could plan to visit the patient in recovery and ensure the patient has an appropriate pain management plan. The huddle thus avoids a delay that may occur if the anesthesi - ologist does not find out about the patient's pain history until the day of surgery. In addition, the huddle puts in motion processes to ensure the patient's safety. Scenario 2 A patient scheduled for the first case the next day has been on Coumadin and may need an international normalized ra - tio test the morning of surgery. The huddle may re-shuffle the schedule so this patient's procedure is performed later in the day \u2014 the third case, for example, to avoid a first-case delay if the INR is abnormal. Scenario 3 A patient scheduled for the first case the next day is identified as having unreliable transportation to the OR. The huddle may move this case later in the day to prevent a first-case delay or cancellation. Scenario 4A patient scheduled for the afternoon the next day is diabetic. The huddle may want to move this patient earlier in the day to reduce the time clini-cians need to manage the patient's blood sugar. Scheduling a diabetic pa-tient for the morning reduces the chance of changes in blood sugar before surgery, which improves patient safety. Conducting daily huddles in the OR creates a collaborative working rela- tionship between OR team members so they can effectively prepare for the next day's surgical cases. Taking the time beforehand to identify potential delays and patient safety issues can decrease costs and improve efficiency, safety and satisfaction. The huddle \"smoothes\" the daily operating schedule to decrease first-case start delays and decreases cancellations on the morning of surgery. This in turn, leads to increased profitability for the institution by not having an operating room sit empty for greater than 30 minutes or having a three to four hour case that has been cancelled with no case to shift into that operating room. n\"You have to identify people who believe in proactive management of problems and are willing to put in the time to make it right.\" \u2014 David Young, MD, Managing Partner, Surgical Directions Surgical Directions is the nation's premier surgical services consulting firm.

In fact, it has been experimented with since the 1990s and the rise of managed care. In many cases those relationships crashed and burned, and the idea of physicians as hospital employees faded. Then, several years ago, the idea resurfaced, in part because of observations that systems with closely aligned and integrated physicians provided some of the best care at some of the lowest costs. Today, most hospitals employ or at least contract with physicians in some way. Unfortunately, these relationships are often guided first by fear \u2014 fear of losing market share \u2014 and second by quality and efficiency objectives. In fact, quality and efficiency goals often aren't specific at the onset of a hospital's relationship with a group of physicians. For example, a hospital doesn't gen-erally employ physicians with a stated goal of re-ducing congestive heart failure readmissions by a specific percentage \u2014 these goals are developed in concert with physicians. However, according to Quint Studer, founder of the Studer Group, there is one goal that should drive future hospital-physician relationships from the onset: breaking even on Medicare. \"When hospitals look at their future, one reality is that they will have to reduce costs by about 20 percent over the next eight or nine years,\" he says. \"But that's not all. A recent article in New England Journal of Medicine argues that low - ering costs is not enough. It's also necessary to increase volume. It's this two-pronged need that is bringing hospitals and physicians together.\" The article Mr. Studer is referencing is The Sav- ings Illusion \u2014 Why Clinical Quality Improvement Fails to Deliver Bottom-Line Results , by Stephen S. Rauh, Eric B. Wadsworth, PhD, and William B. Weeks, MD. According to Mr. Studer, the article is a good starting point for leaders to get familiar with the healthcare system's cost layers \u2014 some - thing that is outlined in the article. \"Understanding that many costs are fixed cer - tainly doesnt mean organizations should give up their efforts to reduce costs and increase quali- ty,\" clarifies Mr. Studer. \"It's essential to do both. Value-based purchasing is a reality, and hospitals want to create great patient experiences so peo- ple will come back and refer others to [them]. But it's also important to work with physicians to put in tactics aimed at increasing volume, like lowering no-show rates and cross-referring oth-er appropriate services.\"Mr. Studer provides four steps for hospital lead-ers to work collaboratively with physicians to-ward this aim. 1. Explain and align goals. Help the physi - cians understand what the goals of the health- care system are and, to the greatest extent pos-sible, align their physician organization's goals with those of the system. This generally means sharing elements of the hospital's strategic plan in a straight forward manner with physicians. \"It may not be necessary for physicians to un- derstand every detail of a balance sheet or how bond ratings work,\" explains Mr. Studer. It is important to help them better understand how great of a profit margin the hospital needs to make in order to reinvest back into the hospital. And it's important that they have a solid grasp of why cost-saving and volume-creating tactics need to co-exist.\" 2. gain physician input. After the physi - cians understand the goals, ask them for their thoughts on how to reach them. It is critically important to take a \"shared governance\" ap-proach rather than expecting physicians to bend to the organization's will. \"The great majority of physicians want the healthcare system to do well,\" explains Mr. Studer. \"They know what the barriers and frus - trations are and can identify some of the first things that can be tackled to make care more ef - ficient and effective. It would be a shame not to tap into their expertise.\" 3. give them feedback. Just as physicians should give input to hospitals, so should hospi- tals give feedback to physicians. According to research by Studer Group, anywhere from 1 in 3 to 1 in 5 physicians don't get good feedback on their performance. Sure, they can look at their own productivity and collections, but in an era of accountable care, physicians need feedback on the quality of the care they provide. \"Physicians want to do well, and they're very good at moving their performance if they can see and understand data on it,\" says Mr. Studer. \"Data must be accurate in order to gain physi - cian trust, though.\" He recommends hospitals commit to mining this data and sharing it through \"data guides.\" In his opinion, referring to such feedback as a \"report card\" could be seen as negative. \"You don't want to punish people; you want to make them better,\" he says4. Watch care improve. Then, once data is shared, hospital leaders should provide resourc- es, as needed, to help physicians make sense of it, and more importantly, gain feedback on any hospital-controlled barriers that may have led to lower scores. Leaders don't necessarily need to formally guide physicians through how they might improve their scores, says Mr. Studer. In fact, they may be surprised to find physicians often get data and run with it. \"Doctors are very self-motivated,\" says Mr. Studer. \"They will seek out other doctors with better outcomes and discover what they could do better.\" While these four steps are just starting points for in-depth and specific clinical process changes, they are the ones that are likely to most closely involve hospital leaders. \"That's because clinical process improvements should be lead by physicians, with support from administrators and not the other way around,\" says Mr. Studer. n The Next Iteration of Hospital-Physician Alignment: Making Medicare Profitable By Lindsey Dunn SUBSCRIBE T ODAy!

I want to say from the get-go that I believe in health reform. Anyone who truly understands the problems in healthcare today knows that re-form is desperately needed. It will have to hap - pen, one way or another, or we will all be sunk. But so-called \"Obamacare\" missed the mark. Something monumental like health reform needed the sign-off of the American people. That never happened. According to the most recent poll, 53 percent of the people oppose Obamacare, and only 39 percent support it -- a reading that hasn't changed that much since the law was passed two years ago. There was never any public debate. The archi- tects of Obamacare cobbled together a bunch of deals with lobbyists who represented every nook and cranny in the healthcare industry. When the law was being drafted in 2009, more than 1,750 organizations and companies hired some 4,525 lobbyists to represent their interests, spending more than $1.2 billion, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity. This year, when the Supreme Court agreed to consider challenges to the law, the big healthcare interests once again made their case, sending in a flurry of amicus briefs to the court. The 130-plus amicus briefs sent in are thought to be a modern record. Because President Obama failed to lead on health reform and failed to forge strong public support, the law became a complicated mess that no one individual can possibly understand. The regulations for the law are said to be 2.1 mil-lion words long, which is about two and a half times the length of the King James Bible. How's that for simplicity and transparency! The degree of self-interest behind the law is ap- propriate to the level of political dialog we see all around us today. That dialog has shrunk to the narrowest of interests: \"What's in it for me?\" Notions of fairness or concerns for the whole just get thrown out the window. In one political debate this year, the audience actually booed the Golden Rule - \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" The rampant self-interest we wallow in today is not limited to any particular party. When the new president began telling the world that he was going to push for a bill to change healthcare in the United States forever, all the special inter - ests came forth. I have to say, some healthcare fiefdoms agreed to take significant hits in exchange for possible future gains. Hospitals, for example, agreed to take $155 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years, but in return they hoped to get more patients because healthcare coverage would expand. And there were some very cynical deals, such as com-pletely stopping the growth of physician-owned hospitals. That group didn't have enough clout to survive the stampede. Even some big players with lots of clout, like the American Medical Association, lost in the deal making. To make up for the new Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will meddle with physician reimbursements, the AMA was assured that the law would get rid of the sustain - able growth rate formula, which sets off auto-matic Medicare cuts that need to be overridden by Congress each time. In the end, however, the SGR fix was removed, because it would have pushed up the price tag, and that would have turned off some very skittish senators. The phy - sicians had to be thrown under the bus. The Supreme Court's decision is expected by late June. If the court touches the law in any way, the cynical deals that were made two years ago will start falling like dominoes. If the court removes the individual mandate, insurers would have to raise rates, because people with preexist - ing conditions wouldn't have to buy insurance until they got sick. The court could save the in-surance industry by striking down the require - ment to cover preexisting conditions. But the coverage mandate would be gone, and with it the extra patient volume that was promised to the hospitals. The house of cards that is Obamacare would fall. However, that might not be so bad. With-out all the special deals, it would then be up to the healthcare industry to save itself. The various constituencies in healthcare don't need incen - tives to understand that things have to change. Every healthcare executive knows that if we don't agree to serious changes, everyone will be hurt. Instead of vying with each other for spe - cial deals, we'd have to accept the simple fact: \"United we stand, divided we fall.\" Healthcare leaders would have to embrace the values they teach within their organizations, which are all about \"breaking down the silos\" and making sure people function in teams in-stead of like a bunch of prima donnas. Also, hospitals are starting to get very serious about efficiency, which will be an absolute requirement in the future. But even as we talk about teamwork and efficien - cy, other values still embraced by the industry are getting in the way of reform. Healthcare is not used to viewing patients as customers, who have to be consulted and catered to. We're the only industry I know that treats customers rather in-differently. We don't make a point of asking pa-tients what they want. And that was a major flaw of Obamacare: the public was never consulted. Americans were told what they should want and -- surprise, surprise -- they didn't like it! Before we decide on any reforms, we need to get feedback from the American people: It's your healthcare system; what do you want it to look like? If Americans can't stomach the individual mandate, which is patently obvious in poll af-ter poll, then what would they agree on? There should be a national debate on the big-picture issues, such as whether healthcare is a right or a privilege, and who should finance it? This could be done in a series of town hall meetings. Americans also need to be educated. If they are ignorant of the challenges in healthcare, they will be stampeded by incendiary terms like \"death panels,\" and they will not see any connection be - tween the mandate to buy insurance and required coverage of preexisting conditions. We don't have to throw out all of Obamacare. There are many parts of it that can be built on, such as account - able care organizations and insurance exchanges.

Whoever wins the presidential election this November needs to step forward and lead. The president needs to call on the American people to help forge a Magna Carta for healthcare. What are our healthcare priori - ties? How do we propose to get there? Next, we need to create a healthcare Marshall Plan. Healthcare reform could be achieved without a lot of subsidies, because there is still a great of waste in the system. We need to identify it and eliminate it. I propose getting hospital supply chain directors involved, because they know where the waste is.For an undertaking as immense as reforming healthcare in the United States, each of us needs to go beyond our own self-interest and look to the whole. President Lincoln said it best: \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" Mr. Lincoln, living in an even more divisive era than our own, asked everyone to respond to \"the better angels of our nature.\" That is what we need to do today. n Chuck Lauer (chuckspeaking@aol.com) was publisher of Modern Healthcare for 33 years.
