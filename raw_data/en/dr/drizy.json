The research laboratory building on UMass Medical School's Worcester campus made its move from design concept to bricks and mortar reality in October2001. The 360,000-square-foot, 10-story facility was officially dedicated duringa ceremony in the building's lobby that not only marked the completion of 30months of construction, but also revealed the promise of the research that willbe conducted there. As part of the schedule of events that took place surrounding the opening of the research building, the Medical School marked the official beginning of theacademic year of its three schools at Convocation ceremonies preceding thededication. State and local government, business and community leadersjoined UMMS as it saluted Aaron Lazare, MD, in his 10th year as chancellor/dean. (See related stories, pages 5 and 9.) The Medical School's research community later hosted a Scientific Symposium, featuring eminent speakers from the fields of genetics, medicine,biochemistry and biophysics. (See story, page 14.) Following the Symposium,many guests toured the research building, gaining a closer look at thelaboratories that will examine the genetic basis of disease, develop improvedtechniques for bone marrow transplantation and innovative approaches tounderstanding prostate, brain and ovarian cancer, and embark on newfrontiers in immunology, drug discovery and drug design. The building willhouse 800 scientists and support staff when fully occupied. Dr. Lazare noted at the dedication that many deserve credit for the research building project, funded without state monies: UMMS researchers, faculty, andadministrative staff; UMass President University'sBoard of clinical partner UMass Memorial Health Care; the City ofWorcester; and the generous donors who made the Medical School's firstcapital campaign, the Campaign for Research, a resounding success. umms dedicates new research building ::Elliot Androphy, Ruiz Soutter Library A nationally recognized dermatologist and virologist,Androphy and his lab are dedicatedto two very diverse areas of research:the viral implications of the humanpapillomavirus (HPV) and theunderlying molecular causes ofSpinal joining research environmentat UMass Medical School andhopeful that its interdisciplinaryspirit and diverse knowledge basewill enrich my lab's growth andfuture success, \" said Androphy, whoalso holds the title of vice chair ofresearch for the Department ofMedicine.

Tenney has participated in two years of WPCmentoring, affecting first gradethrough non-traditional adult students. His efforts included tutoring students in science-and math-related andgeneral studies; providing elementary pupils with hands-onscience experiments; and offeringProjects Fair coaching to students. During the ceremony, Chancellor and Dean Aaron Lazare commended the indispensable role of UMMS educators, comparingtheir patience and understandingwith that of good parents.\"It takes a good and generous heart to teach, and it is such a pleasure to have the faculty that we do, \" he said. \"Their continuing dedication, creativity and passion are the pride of this institution.\" as vitae went to press... Linda Pololi, MBBS, has accepted the new position of ViceChancellor for Education at UMassMedical School, Chancellor andDean Aaron Lazare has announced.Dr. Pololi will come to UMMS fromthe Brody School of Medicine at EastCarolina University in Greenville,North Carolina, where she is directorof the National Center of Leadershipin Academic Medicine and associateprofessor of medicine. In this new position, Pololi will provide general support for alleducational programs at UMMS,with a specific emphasis onundergraduate, graduate andcontinuing medical education.Watch UMass Medical School's 2001Annual Report for more on Pololi. A discussion with Dr .Aaron Lazare reveals how the belief in a mission of excellence grew UMMS into an instution of distinction\u2014wh lessons learned along the way.ExcellenceExpectation of What has surprised you the most as you look back over the decade that you havebeen chancellor/dean? Our continuous growth in our educational, research and community service activities.I thought that our goal should beexcellence in all three areas, but as theyears went by, I saw that we could domore\u2014our goal in many areas should be national distinction. And now I see usexcelling in all areas and achievingnational distinction in several. One constant and dominant effort in achieving national distinction has beenour recruitment at every level of thosewho will settle for nothing less than thevery best. We call upon our leadingfaculty to help us identify and recruitthe very best people. What are the key characteristics this institution looks for in its faculty? People who are going to bring new knowledge and recruit at least three orfour promising young individuals to thefield. We look for people with a sense of passion and excitement, who love theirwork and work hard, because they willsucceed. Those coming on board mustalso be decent people, showing respectand the ability to support those theyrecruit. It's important that this institutionrespects people, supports their growth,and seeks high energy individuals whofeel a passion for our mission ofexcellence and national distinction. Such traits must always be coupled with personal and institutional integrity. About two years ago, the Association of Academic Health Centers sent a consultinggroup here to find out why we were sosuccessful. One of the group's commentswas that it had never seen an institutionin which everyone, from one layer toanother, knows what the mission is\u2014whatwe are here for. We really march as one andI believe that's why we have succeeded. interview by andrea l. badrigian ::Charles Vacanti, MD::Top: Graduate School of Nursing Tara Roy, MaryStanley and Paulette Remijian, membersof the Class of 2002, which received theGSN's Education and Community ServiceAward for initiative and leadership ineducation and community service. ::Bottom: Aaron Lazare, MD, is flanked by Lamar Soutter Award for Excellence in Medical Ed ucation recipients Marjorie Clay, PhD, and Oscar Starobin, MDfall - winter 2001 Vitae 7What makes UMass Medical School so special? If you were to ask the medical students or their parents, they would say theysimply love being here where people areso committed to education and respectfulof each other. If you were to ask ourdepartment chairs, I believe they wouldsay we are providing them with the toolsto recruit, renovate and do the thingsnecessary to achieve national distinction.If you were to ask the faculty, I believethey would say the administration supportstheir creativity and helps them thrive. I am one of three siblings, and each of us thinks that he or she was mother'sspecial child. I hope we give our facultythe same message. No matter what theydo, they are special and supported forthe work they provide the institution. Has the role of chancellor changed over these 10 years? Over the years, as we have recruited extraordinary leadership in administrationand as the Medical School has becomemore prominent in the University system,I have been called on to participate morein University activities, such as my workwith the Amherst campus. I have becomemore involved with the President's Officeand the Board of Trustees. And I havebeen able to dedicate more time sincethe merger to the complex interactionwith the clinical system. What have you learned or discovered from your experience working as chair of the task force that will help guide the search for a new chancellor for theAmherst campus? In anticipation of finding a new chancellor, the president asked me to lead this taskforce with the goal of helping evaluate thecampus and identify opportunities forenhancements to bring Amherst into the 6 Vitae fall - winter 2001 One constant and dominant eort in achieving national distinction has been our recrument at every level of those who will sele for nothing less than the very best. by having a student interview the mother of a diabetic child or an adulthaving trouble taking his or her insulin,then go back and forth from the biologyand physiology to the interview. Theinterview is the ultimate end point\u2014thedoctor and patient sitting together. Wewere chosen to be one of three medicalschools to participate in the Macy grantbecause of my interest in and writingsabout the medical interview. Have you noticed changes in the characteristics of medical students seekingan education? I can tell you about the characteristics of the students we have. We have studentswho are thoughtful, kind, generous andextraordinarily intelligent. They enjoyeach other. And this helps them work in a collegial way, which is part of what aneducation ought to be. Also, I think wehave always had a larger percentage ofwomen than most schools; over the last couple of years, more than 50 percent.All of our students are a joy to teach and are outstanding people in characterand intelligence. When someone in the community or in the state says they like their physician's skills andcompetence, I'm pretty sure that he orshe is a UMass graduate. I regret that I can't do more teaching. How much time are you devoting to teaching now? What I enjoyed several years ago was leading one of the doctor/patient groupsin which I could interview each patient. I really enjoy the medical interview withthe patient in which you can showstudents what you can learn by listeningin a particular way and asking the rightkind of questions. I hope to renew myseminars on the nature of suffering. I think my greatest contribution to the curriculum now is through the CurriculumCommittee. My job is to facilitate theenormous educational creativity of ourfaculty. The faculty understand my interestand commitment to medical education, andknow they always have a sympathetic voiceto speak on their behalf\u2014even while theysee a 10-story research building going up.What interests you most as a physician or scientist? The two books I am close to finishing. One is called Apology, the Power to Heal, the only book on the psychology,structure and function of apology. It isaddressed to an intelligent lay audienceand discusses a range of apologies\u2014international apologies, personalapologies, why apologies fail, apology in the court system, apology/repentencein Jewish and Christian theology, themeaning of apologies which are delayedby decades and even centuries. The second book is called Doctors Ashamed . It's a compilation of some 350 stories written by physicians in theanswer to the question: \"what was themost shameful or humiliating experiencein your professional career?\" I hope thisbook will be useful to students,physicians and teachers in understandingthe adaptive and maladaptive aspects ofshame, humiliation, embarrassment andguilt in clinical practice. I'd like peoplewho read these books to walk away witha better understanding of themselves; to befriend these emotions, not to avoidthem and pretend they don't exist. If you could bring about a major change in the way physicians areeducated, what would it be? The core and starting point of physician education is the interaction betweendoctor and patient. If I had all the timeand money in the world to implement it, I would start the curriculum with theinterview and then go back to the diseasesas they are diagnosed and learn abouttheir chemistry and physiology. Forexample, when I teach the phenomena of depression and suicide, instead ofgiving a lecture, I would give the studentsa handout with all the data, and then I would role-play a suicidal patient. Iwould ask the students to interview me,with the goal to establish a relationshipto assess how seriously ill I was and tocome to a decision at the end of a half-hour. That would motivate them to learnabout the psychology, biology andtreatment of suicide or depression. To study diabetes, I would like to start first tier of flagship campuses in the United States. In doing so, I haveinterviewed over 100 people at the campus.The interviews were fascinating, duringwhich I not only gathered information,but also challenged\u2014and was challengedback. As a result, I have developed anenormous respect for the faculty, who are impassioned and dedicated people,and I have been trying to analyze whatsome of the impediments have been tothem realizing their full potential. One of the reasons I imagine the president wanted me to go to Amherst isthat UMass Medical School faced a crisiswhen I took office in 1991. We've workedout of that crisis and now have become ahighly regarded campus in the Universitysystem. Could we bring to bear some ofthe things we learned to assist our oldersister campus? One of the things welearned here was that a campus musthave a clear mission, a diversification ofrevenue, generate its own dollars, becomeentrepreneurial. At the Medical School,we established Commonwealth Medicineand successful development andcommercial ventures offices. UMassAmherst has been embarking on many of these activities. The state gives ourcampus approximately $40 million andthe Medical School budget is over $300million. That's the sort of \"leverage\" thatmedical schools have learned to adopt. How have you adapted your expertise in psychiatry to your role as chancellor? I've learned much more from raising eight children. As a father, you must learnhow to meet each of your child's needs,learn how to be fair, provide stimulationand reward success. I think psychiatryhelps one learn how to listen. The peopleon the Amherst campus, I believe, feltlistened to in a special way. They saw meas representing the president, and feltthey had a liaison to the President's Office. Leading by Examplecompiled by sandra l. gray fall - winter 2001 Vitae 9 8 Vitae fall - winter 2001How does it feel to look at the completed research building? I don't believe it has really happened\u2014 it seems like yesterday it was a pictureon a drawing board. But, it is state-of-the-art and as a result, we are able to recruitworld-distinguished leaders to add to theranks of the world-distinguished leaderswe already have. Why even bother with this building? You cannot have an outstanding medicalschool without outstanding research:outstanding research and outstandingteaching go hand-in-hand, as dooutstanding research and outstandingclinical care. Several years ago, we wereat a crossroads in our research directionbecause of the limited facilities we hadand the gaps in some of the areas inwhich we wanted to achieve excellence.We had the choice of facing a decline and stagnation or making a commitmentto growth. It wasn't a hard decision. Theresearch leadership and the administrationdetermined that we were going to go aheadand be one of the major national centersin research. This is something NIH wantsof medical schools, something our trusteeswant of their campuses and something wewelcomed. It took a 360,000-square-footbuilding to meet those needs. The process of selecting the design, particularly the laboratories, reflected the way we like to operate, with creativeteamwork that isn't bogged down inbureaucracy. A team of leading researchers,architects, builders, administrators andmyself traveled around the country tolook at the best research institutions. We interviewed the researchers andasked them what they didn't like about their buildings. We stayed overnight inmotels and talked about what we saw that day. We came back with a plan we announced to the faculty rather than taking a year to develop a furtherconsensus. We had to act in an expeditiousway, but in a way inclusive enough togenerate the best ideas. We got the right administrative people in touch with theright faculty representatives to engageand evolve and synthesize the best ideas.There is always that balance in managing an academic health center. I think ithappened with the research building. I told the architects that this building should be the signature building of thecampus. I wanted it to be a symbol oftechnology and research for Worcesterand Central Massachusetts. I told them I would be disappointed if any institutionin New England, or even nationally, built a research building and didn't come herefirst to visit this facility. And you know,they already are. What would you characterize to date to be the crowning achievements of thethree schools? For the Graduate School of Nursing, one of its major achievements was thedevelopment of the joint PhD programwith UMass Amherst and the quality of education for the students in variousareas that we have here. For theGraduate School of Biomedical Sciences,the significant increase in the overallquality of applicants and the success of trainees. For the School of Medicine,its place among the leaders of Americanmedical education as evidenced by itsranking in U.S.News this year at fourth, and over the last six or seven yearsbetween second and eighth. In retrospect, we were on shaky ground when I became the interim chancellor/dean. The economy in Massachusetts wassinking and the state cut money out ofeducation to a greater degree than anyother state\u201433 percent. Our budgetwent down as did the rest of highereducation. For the first three or four years, we were constantly trying to keep from sliding under these difficult times.We decided to grow out of it. Instead of developing task forces to reduceeverything, we developed task forces to grow everything. Instead of a hunker-down atmosphere, we had an expansiveattitude. And we grew our research, ourclinical activities, and initiated adevelopment office and intellectualproperty office. All of those resourceshave facilitated our journey towardsnational distinction and public service. It is 2011. Describe UMass Medical School. We are an established national leader in medical education, contributing to the best practices. A thriving GraduateSchool of Nursing provides outstandingresearch on patient care, best practicesand the economies of care. A school ofpublic health, or parts of one, exists atthe Medical School. There will be at leastone more research building on campus.We'll be among the top 20 researchinstitutions in the country contributing to the cures of many diseases, not theleast of which are cancer and diabetes,infectious diseases and psychiatricdisorders. Supported by federal fundingand philanthropy, UMass Medical School,in collaboration with the other fourcampuses, will be the national center for adoption research. You seem to be having fun. Are you? I enjoy my work immensely. I doubt thatI've had more than one bad day at a time.Part of the joy is watching the studentslearn and excel, and seeing their parents'pride at graduation. Part of the joy isseeing the growth and achievements ofour faculty. Part of the pleasure of thisjob is being able to continue my academicwork of writing, teaching and lecturing in the U.S. and abroad. Working with sucha talented administrative team committedto a common mission and common valuesis a valuable treat. The respect and supportI have for the Worcester community, theUniversity President's Office and stategovernment has been a special gift forme. I feel more energized than when Ibegan this job and there is so much moreto do. I'm ready for the next 10 years. It is a privilege to work here. During his tenure at UMMS, first as chair of the Departmentof Psychiatry and thenchancellor/dean for the past10 years, Dr. Aaron Lazare has made many friends inWorcester, inside and outsidethe Medical School. In concert with colleagues and collaborators, hisaccomplishments have crossedmany boundaries, built manybridges and touched manylives. Here, just some of thosewho have known and workedwith him over the years offertheir own reminiscences to mark his 10th anniversary as chancellor/dean. In theprocess, they not onlychronicle years of achievement,but also the personal legacyof a unique individual.As Dr. Aaron Lazare marks a decade of leadersh\u00d4 as UMMS chancellor/dean, his \u00cfiends and colleagues remark on his strengths and successes. ::Aaron Lazare, MD, in 1994\"Dr. Lazare is refreshing in that he can translate the philosophy of commitment and service to the public at the highest levels\u2014he's proud to say, 'I am a state employee. ' His fostering of anenvironment of egalitarian partnership makes it a pleasure to do my work here. \" Michele Pugnaire, MD Vice Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education, UMMS \"After I'd take him around to appointments at the State House, people would say to me, 'He's friendly, he's human\u2014and he's noton the make. ' Legislators have told me time and again that Dr.Lazare created a feeling in government that UMass Medical Schoolis not an elitist institution. Because of Aaron's credibility, we havebeen able to do things no other state agency can do. \" Albert Sherman Vice Chancellor for University Relations, UMMS \"Rarely have I met a man as distinguished and learned as Aaron, who radiates such spontaneous humanity and compassion. AaronLazare is that seldom-encountered individual who inspires thedream that, indeed, a better world is possible. I was captivated by him at our first encounter and the experience of knowing himprobably accounts for my involvement at UMass Medical School.\" Irving Brudnick Donor, the Irving S. and Betty Brudnick Chair in Psychiatry and the Irving S. and Betty Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute \"I first met Aaron when he came to a meeting with the Telegram & Gazette editorial board. He was caught in a downpourand arrived soaking wet but apparently unconcerned about hisappearance; I was impressed by his thoughtful manner and politicalskills. After he became chancellor/dean, I knew he was the rightman at the right time. The institution needed a healer with Aaron'scalm demeanor and reassuring presence. Instead of trying tomicromanage, he wisely chose to set the tone and delegate.\" Robert Nemeth Former Editorial Page Editor, Worcester Telegram & Gazette \"As someone who was in the third graduating class of the Medical School, I knew the vision and mood of the founding faculty andstudents. When I became a trustee of the University of Massachusettsin 1988, the Medical School had somewhat strayed from that. Itwas Dr. Lazare in his positions as dean and then chancellor/deanthat brought the school back to its original vision. \" Michael Foley, MD (UMMS '76) Trustee, University of Massachusetts \"In 1997 and 1998, Dr. Lazare and I led the teams that worked out the basis for the merger that created UMass Memorial Health Care.We're now the second largest health care delivery system in thestate. Today, Aaron serves on the UMass Memorial board, and ishelping us to deal with the many facets of the U.S. health care crisis.\" Peter Levine, MD Former President, UMass Memorial Health Care\"Under Aaron's leadership, UMass Medical School has been a catalyst for strong relationships between Worcester institutionsof higher learning and the business community. He wasinstrumental in building the city's economy with biotechnologybusiness development, infrastructure and jobs at a time when they were sorely needed in this region. \" William Short Former President, Worcester Chamber of Commerce and the WorcesterBusiness Development Corporation \"I came to UMass Medical School in 1985 because Aaron recruited me. I ultimately took over the department he had createdfrom scratch, inheriting the wonderful relationships he hadestablished throughout the state. The Department of Psychiatryhas a close partnership with the Department of Mental Health(DMH), resulting in huge benefits for both: the commonwealthreceives a steady stream of well-trained psychiatrists to work inpublic sector psychiatry; in turn, psychiatrists at the MedicalSchool have benefited from the resources to establish the Centerfor Mental Health Services Research, the Brudnick NeuropsychiatricResearch Institute, and a psychiatry residency training programthrough which faculty with primary clinical responsibilities in DMHcontribute to the academic life of the department.\" Paul Appelbaum, MD Arnold F. Zeleznik Professor of Psychiatry and Chair of Psychiatry, UMMS \"A 45-minute interaction with Aaron clinched my decision to be a psychiatrist. When I was a third-year medical student trying to decide on a field, he somehow heard about my dilemma andinvited me to his office. He spent 45 minutes covering a range ofpersonal as well as professional considerations. I'll never forgetthe honesty and generosity he, a department chair, showed me, a third-year student. He grabbed my heart and my soul and myintellect and said, 'You have what it takes to be an excellentpsychiatrist. Welcome aboard, Dr. Foti!' When I see him from timeto time, he goes out of his way to greet me.\" Mary Ellen Foti, MD (UMMS '83) Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, UMMS, and Area Medical Director for theMetro Suburban Region of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health \"In our surveys of medical school student satisfaction, UMass Medical School receives high marks from its graduates for itsinnovative education programs. Graduates feel especially wellprepared in terms of patient relationships, communicating withpatients and patient-centered care\u2014attributes that research has shown individuals seek in their physicians. Dr. Lazare is to be congratulated on fostering a supportive learning environmentthat is producing high quality physicians for Massachusetts.\" Jordan Cohen, MD President and CEO, Association of American Medical Colleges \"Having worked with Dr. Lazare as dean of the Graduate School of Nursing during most of his decade as chancellor, I can attest to the gains made by the GSN under his leadership. He helpedfoster greater visibility for the school on and off campus, and was instrumental in establishing the first doctoral-level nursingprogram in the state university system. \" Lillian Goodman, EdD Dean Emeritus , University of Massachusetts Graduate School of Nursing\"It is gratifying as an educator, who was a former student, to inherit a curriculum through which students receive so muchinteraction. That's largely due to Aaron's vision. In the early 1990s,he wanted to promote more collaboration between departmentsand let educators do what they do best. He gave us our marchingorders, let people work on things that were interesting to them,and gave them the authority and resources they needed. Our curriculum is exciting for students and faculty alike.\" Nancy Fontneau, MD (UMMS '84) Clinical Associate Professor of Neurology, UMMS \"As a Massachusetts citizen, I'm proud of the flagship institution Aaron Lazare and his colleagues have created for us. When pre-medical students ask my advice about the best school to attendfor a career in patient care, I refer them to the admissions office at UMass Medical School.\" Leon Eisenberg, MD Professor of Social Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus, Harvard Medical School \"I first met Aaron in the early 1980s when he was chair of psychiatry and I was an associate dean trying to drum up interest in a researchprogram in neuroscience that would include psychiatry and thebasic sciences. A light came on in his eyes and it was from then on that I realized he had a very strong interest in research. In 10years, he's made enormous efforts and we've made enormousstrides in the research enterprise here. Aaron's innovations havehelped us get where we are today.\" H. Maurice Goodman, PhD Professor and Chair of Physiology, UMMS \"Aaron is a consensus builder, but also has that grit to be able to go off when it's called for and make a decision against a good bitof the thinking in the community.

Dr. Wolfe'slaboratory is trying to create proteinsthat can regulate a single gene ofinterest inside a cell, ultimatelycreating a highly adaptable gene-targeting system so that a proteinspecific for any gene of interest canbe easily made. Such proteins couldbe used as tools to study the functionof any desired gene. To create thisgene-targeting system, Wolfe'slaboratory is using a well-characterized class of DNA-bindingdomain known as \"zinc fingers.\"Proteins employing this domaintypically utilize multiple fingers to \"grab\" the DNA. Because thedeterminants of DNA sequencespecificity for zinc fingers are betterunderstood than for any other typeof DNA-binding domain, it is ideallysuited for the construction of this\"artificial\" gene regulation system.William R.

Accordingto Kobertz, \"Many ion channelproteins have partner proteins, so although they can function alone,they actually don't work bythemselves. I want to understandwhat brings these two proteinstogether at the molecular level, and how this joining changes theelectrical properties of thatparticular ion channel.\" Because the rhythm of the heart beat,maintenance of arterial tone andinsulin release by the pancreas areall physiological processes thatrequire a healthy association betweenion channel and partner protein, thesignificance of this research is evident.Roger Johnson, PhD, assistant professor of cell biology ::Recruited from the Sloan-Kettering Institute While Koh is interested in the implications of a hormone in thedevelopment of cancer, Dr. Johnsonstudies the consequences of genomicinstability in the aberrant increase of cancer cells.

I'm interested in themechanisms by which cells preventthose chromosomal rearrangements.\"Johnson hopes this research willcontribute to other scientists'understanding of the geneticalterations found in cancer cells and the functional mechanisms bywhich these changes contribute tothe growth of tumors.As the research laboratory building grew to become a fixture on campus, the UMMS community focused its attention on the impressive construction project. Now, with the building's dedication, it is the individuals within its laboratories\u2014both UMMS veterans and newly recruited scientists\u2014who demand one's attention. The following young investigators are representative of those who have joined UMMS to be a part of the most exciting developments in genetics, aging,cancer research, human development, neurobiology and biochemistry. ::Drs. Bao, Johnson, Emery, and Kobertz at the laboratory benches of the new research buildingSettlingInPatrick Emery, PhD assistant professor of neurobiology ::Recruited from Brandeis As inconceivable as it may be to many, Dr. Emery understands thatDrosophila, an order of flies that includes the common fruit fly, aremodel organisms for studying thegenetic and molecular basis of animalbehaviors. Particularly interested inresearching Circadian and addictivebehaviors in Drosophila, Emery and colleagues are working on the premisethat their discoveries may play acrucial role in understanding thehuman biological clock. \"I am tryingto understand how organisms,including man, are able to keep trackof time, to determine at the molecularlevel how these biological clocks areworking,\" said Emery. Theodore Joon Koh, MD assistant professor of medicine ::Recruited from Harvard Koh's lab is interested in the role of gastrin\u2014a hormone secreted by themucosal lining of the stomach andintestines that is vital to the regulargrowth and development of thegastrointestinal tract\u2014and its rolein the development of stomach andcolon cancers. Given the widespreaduse of proton pump inhibitors inhuman patients resulting in hyper-gastrinemia (a widespread presenceof gastrin in the blood), it isimportant to better understand howgastrin affects gastrointestinal balance.The lab is also investigating theidentity of gastrin-responsive genesthat may be mediating this effect. Zheng-zheng Bao, PhD assistant professor of medicine and cell biology ::Recruited from Harvard While crucial to a biological and medical comprehension of thehuman body, the understanding of vertebrate development has beenprimitive. However, with the recentadvances in molecular biology andgenomics, researchers like Dr. Baonow have the tools to decipher themolecular mechanisms underlyingthe highly regulated processes thatlead to vertebrate development. Her lab is particularly interested instudying the genetic pathways involvedin the establishment of neuronalconnections and formation of organssuch as the heart and brain. Accordingto Bao, \"because aberrations diseases,and because many developmentalgenes use inadulthood, this research has clearmedical relevance.\"Newly recrued investigators infuse the research laboratory building wh compelling research and unbridled enthusiasm. Heidi Ann Tissenbaum, PhD assistant professor, program in gene function and expression ::Recruited from MIT Although the obsession of a youth-possessed culture, aging, as a biological process, is one of theleast understood. Dr. Tissenbaum is determined to change that.Ultimately concerned with discovering the underlying causes of aging, the Tissenbaum lab has found thenematode worm, C. elegans, to be a model system to investigatemolecular mechanisms of aging dueto its short, reproducible life span.Currently, Tissenbaum is usinggenetic the gene calledSIR2 homologue, sir-2.1can controllife span in the worm with the hopethat the results from these studiesmay reveal universal components to this process.

From the historic mapping of the human genome, to anunderstanding of the structure of the ribosome and the developmentof cholesterol-lowering drugs, to an in-depth comprehension of thecomplex central nervous system, thesymposium's four guest speakers\u2014Francis S. Collins, MD, PhD, JosephL. Goldstein, MD, Thomas A. Steitz,PhD, and Thomas M. Jessell, PhD\u2014represent some of the greatestachievements of 20th centuryscience. As Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at theNational Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, MD, PhD, is a physician-geneticist who hasdistinguished himself as a world-class scientific researcher, adetermined political activist and an accomplished federal programadministrator. In his current role,Collins is responsible for overseeinga 13-year project aimed at mappingand sequencing all of the humanDNA by the year 2003. As of this year,he has directed the successfulcompletion of several of the GenomeProject's goals, and the full ramp-up of the sequencing component is underway. During his fellowship at Yale in human genetics, Collinsworked on methods of crossinglarge stretches of DNA to identifydisease genes. He continued todevelop these ideas after joining thefaculty at the University of Michiganin 1984, and together with colleagues,Lap-Chee Tsui, PhD and JackRiordan, PhD, his research teamidentified the gene for cystic fibrosisusing this strategy in 1989. Nobel Prize winning physician and medical researcher Joseph Goldstein, MD, is internationally recognized for his discoveriesregarding cholesterol. Aftercompleting his medical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, Goldstein conducted research at the National Heart Institute and theUniversity of Washington, beforejoining the faculty of the Universityof Texas in 1972. While at theUniversity of Texas, research byGoldstein and his long-time associate,Michael S. Brown, MD, provided the justification for an entirely newpharmacological approach to thetreatment of artherosclerosis, theleading cause of heart attacks. Thereceptor they identified removesharmful cholesterol from the blood,paving the way for the developmentof now common drugs that work byincreasing the number of cholesterolreceptors. Known as statins, thesedrugs represent a major advance in heart attack prevention. For thisseminal research, which not only led to new treatments for preventingheart attacks, but also revolutionizedour knowledge of genes and cells,Goldstein and Brown receivednumerous awards including the 1985Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. During the summer of 2000, Howard Hughes Medical InstituteInvestigator and Eugene HigginsProfessor of Molecular Biophysicsand Biochemistry Thomas Steitz, PhD, and his team made history by solving the structure ofthe largest part of the cell's protein-making machine. the ribosome, a macromolecularstructure responsible for proteinsynthesis in all living cells.

Most definitely. The UMMS offices of Sci ence Education and Outreach Programs serve as one example, as they gear up for another year of helping local students learn aboutcareer possibilities in the sciences and health care. Last year, over 13,000 students were involved in a variety of activities that are aimed to expand the minds of eager learners. These activities, implemented by a number of Medical School departments and their staffs, include internships, shadowing opportunitie s, tours of our research and clinical facilities and mentoring programs. The Chancellor's Office is proud to support this crucial public service for our communities, joined by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Science Foundation and other instituti ons and organizations. All UMMS employees, no matter what their specialty, have much to offer today's young people. The success yea r after year of this outstanding outreach program attests to that fact. The alumni profiled on the following pages also offer their skills, intellect and compassion to the people they serve. They hav e committed their working days to ensuring the health and well-being of those they come in contact with\u2014and do so with distinctio n. Nicole Faulkner, a new alumna of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, conducted research at UMMS that has had an impact on subsequent study of brain development. Now pursuing a career in genetic testing, Faulkner doesn't underestimate th e impact of counseling future parents as they consider important decisions that will greatly affect their lives. Gerard Cox, School of Medicine class of 1983, has provided doctor's orders to none other than the President of the United States. Encouraging healthful habits on the part of the commander in chief has further enhanced this Naval officer's dedication to the field of medicine and the challenges and opportunities that it offers. Carol Bova, a 1988 alumna of the Graduate School of Nursing, has excelled in a career that has evolved from that of nurse practitioner to researcher. Her care of HIV-positive women has led to her commitment to discovering better methods to treat pat ients who, in many cases, also battle substance abuse and mental illness. The UMMS community deeply mourns the loss of Edward Budnitz, MD, one of the region's first cardiologists, a beloved colleague and mentor. Dr. Budnitz died on August 13, 2001, at 94, leaving a rich legacy of wisdom, generosity and compassionate care. This care was so appreciated that in 1980, Dr. Budnitz's colleagues, friends and patients established the Edward Budnitz Program in Cardiovas cular Research and the Edward Budnitz Professorship in Cardiovascular Medicine. He will be remembered as a cornerstone of this Medica l School and its commitment to humane care informed by science. Aaron Lazare, MDphysiology national institutes of health Daniel L.

Faulkner, PhD, concluded her commencement address to her peers in the GraduateSchool of Biomedical Sciences' (GSBS)class of 2001. Nearly six years afterbeginning her post-graduate studies at UMMS, Dr. Faulkner has shown thatsuch appreciation for the smallestphenomena of science can lead to some of its greatest accomplishments. While the research enterprise at UMMS has grown significantly in the past sixyears, in 1995 it was the smaller size ofthe GSBS that attracted Faulkner to theinstitution. After completing just herfirst rotation in the lab of Richard B.Vallee, PhD, the H. Arthur Smith Chair in Cancer Research, Faulkner knew thatshe had found her ideal environment.Her research under Dr. Vallee'smentoring would prove to have animpact on subsequent study of braindevelopment\u2014and on the lab itself. Studying cytoplasmic dynein, a complex molecular motor, Faulkner, supportedby a fellowship from the FairlawnFoundation, discovered that this tinybio-machine, which continuously runsinformation from the periphery of thecell inward, interacts with the Lis-1 geneproduct. Mutations in this gene haverecently been shown to causelissencephaly, a severe congenitaldisorder resulting in major structuralabnormalities in the fetal brain. Becauselissencephaly occurs at just 12 to 14 weeks gestation, the aim of theresearch is not a cure for the disorderbut rather a more in-depth understandingof brain development. \"We have broughtour expertise and understanding of cell locomotion and applied that todevelopmental processes in the brain, \"she explained. \"I am extremely proudthat this research has evolved intoanother important branch of investigationfor the Vallee lab. \" Additional affirmationof her work came in the form of aninvitation in June 2000 to the prestigiousGordon Research Conference onMolecular and Cellular Neurobiology in Hong Kong, noted for limiting itsattendance to 135 scientists, typicallyprincipal investigators. \"As a graduatestudent, it was a special honor for me tonot only be invited, but also to be askedto make a poster presentation. \" A wife and the mother of a two-year-old daughter, Faulkner recently made thedecision to pursue a career in genetictesting. Sponsored by Genzyme Geneticsin Framingham, she has started herAmerican Board of Medical Geneticstraining, a two-year certification processthat includes both laboratory and clinicalrotations through Harvard MedicalSchool. After training, Faulkner hopes to become a board-certified geneticist,responsible for a wide range of genetictesting and counseling suchafflictions as cystic fibrosis, Huntington'sdisease and Down's syndrome. \"Althoughit is a bit overwhelming when I thinkthat I will be directly influencingsomeone's life decisions, I believe that I have found the perfect job for me in that it combines detailed scientific research with in-depth teaching andhuman interaction.\" \u2014 kabWhether flying at 300 knots above Korea, providing medical care to troopsin the Gulf War or reminding the Presidentof the United States to wash his hands, Gerard R. Cox, MD '83, has enjoyed a unique and fulfilling career as a U.S. Navy doctor. Dr. Cox credits the military with providing him opportunities not open to most civilians, right from the start ofhis medical career. The Armed ForcesHealth Professions Scholarship Program\"allowed me the freedom to choose any medical school, regardless of cost,\"said Cox. \"I came to UMass because I believed in the school's focus onproviding primary care. I sensed thatthe faculty and other students sharedmy values. \" Cox completed his medical internship at the National Naval Medical Centerand was trained as a flight surgeon atthe Naval Aerospace Medical Institute,earning his wings in 1985. From therehe deployed to the Pacific, Central and South America, and Norway beforebeginning his residency program inemergency medicine. Cox was assignedto the Portsmouth Naval Hospital inVirginia beginning August 1, 1990. The very next day, Saddam Husseinmarched into Kuwait; two weeks later,Cox was living in a tent and workingwith Fleet Hospital Five in OperationsDesert Shield and Desert Storm. Perhaps his most unique job was Cox's two-year assignment as the NavyPhysician to the White House, from June1999 to June 2001, serving both theClinton and Bush administrations. Coxwas hand-selected for the 20-memberWhite House Medical Unit and chargedwith providing care for the Presidentand Vice President and their families, as well as White House staff. In additionto crafting detailed contingency plans and securing Level I trauma facilities in advance of official travel, the medicalstaff is also charged with observing the President and Vice President forsigns of stress, fatigue and illness. \"The presidency requires superhumanendurance in the face of incredibledemands, lack of sleep and frequent travel.\" President Clinton was the most-traveled commander in chief in historyand enjoyed shaking hands, kissingbabies and picking up germs. \"Handsanitizer was a must,\" Cox recalled. The White House assignment provided Cox the opportunity to \"watch policymaking and history unfold.\" Remarkably,he had twice declined to be nominatedfor the post, until his wife, Catherine, a commander in the Naval ReserveNurse Corps, encouraged him to takethe once-in-a-lifetime assignment. These days, Cox is chief of the Emergency Medicine Service at theNational Naval Medical Center. Facing his 20-year anniversary and theopportunity to retire from the Navy, Cox is weighing his options, but stillseeking a challenge. \"I've never regrettedchoosing a career in medicine, becauseof the constant challenge and theopportunity to serve.\" \u2014 amd Gerard Cox, MD '83, MHA, FACEP , FACPM; CAPT, MC, USN, with President George W.

Her evolution from nurse practitioner to researcher began when she startedcaring for female patients in the HIVclinic at UMass in 1988. \"At that time,there was so little information aboutwomen and HIV,\" she explained. \"Therewere interventions and programs weneeded to do, but it required educationto write the grants to get the money todo them. So I decided to get my PhD.\" Her dissertation, \"Adjustment to Chronic Illness and Adherence Behaviors AmongHIV-infected Women,\" came directlyfrom her work as a nurse practitioner. It resulted in creation of the Positive LifeSkills Workshop, a Department of PublicHealth-funded clinical program at UMassMemorial Health Care that helps womenwith HIV re-frame their perceptions ofthe infection. Now in its fifth year, theworkshop is one of the achievements ofwhich Bova is most proud. Committed to doing even more to help adults with HIV, Bova currently iscompleting a two-year post-doctoralfellowship at Yale. \"Adults with most stigmatized patientpopulation,\" she said. \"They're oftendealing with mental illness and substanceabuse in addition to the HIV. We need tolearn how to do a better job of caring forpeople with these co-morbid conditions.\"I see patients daily who are on anti-retroviral therapy,\" she continued.\"But their depression and substanceabuse interfere with adherence. Wedon't want them to develop resistanceby going on and off their meds. My jobis to get patients to a place wherethey're ready to begin HIV treatment so that it will work. You can't throwpatients on drugs without addressingthese other issues. This is where researchis needed. We need to do a better job ofproviding care in an integrated fashion,improving coordination among the payersystem, primary care, mental health and substance-abuse resources.\" Bova currently holds a newly created position at UMMS as a nurse residentscholar. With joint appointments in theDepartment of Medicine and GraduateSchool of Nursing, she devotes a largepercentage of her time to research and teaching, but also keeps her HIVclinical practice at the UMass MemorialMedical Center, Memorial Campus. \"Being a nurse-researcher allows me to do so much,\" she said. \"Nursesare permitted in special places ofpatients' lives\u2014birth, illness, death\u2014and they disclose very intimate detailsto us. This helps me as a researcher.And, I love the problem-solving process\u2014thinking about what would help some of the most marginalized people in society, and helping them to live positively with what's been dealt to them.\" \u2014 rj changing behaviors through researchClass Notes: '78 '87 '97 '98'91 '92 '81fall - winter 2001 Vitae 23 22 Vitae fall - winter 2001Spotlight on Medical Education: UMMS Pediatrics Residency Program One month after the School of Medicine graduated its Class of 2001, 170 new physicians arrived at UMass Memorial Medical Center for residency training. These new MDs, who join the school's approximately 350 residents and fellows, work with attending physician s to help provide medical care on campus and at other health facilities around the region, while training in their own individual special ties. These residents are also critical to the Medical School, since they do much of the one-on-one teaching of students during their clini cal years. According to Deborah DeMarco, MD, associate dean for Graduate Medical Education, the majority of the school's residency programs did very well in the 2001 match, the process by which graduates choose where they will begin their medical careers. One such progra m, specifically noted by Dr. DeMarco, was the school's Pediatrics Residency Program. Directed by Professor of Pediatrics Jerry Durbin, MD, the program currently includes 29 residents who are pursuing three-year Pediatrics or four-year Medicine/Pediatrics residencies . \"Pediatrics nationally has gained popularity, and this has definitely benefited our program,\" Dr. Durbin said. \"However, the 30 percent of UMass students from the Class of 2002 who are choosing this specialty\u2014almost three times the national average\u2014can be directly a ttributed to the quality of the program's current residents. In fact, many students have told me that it was the side-by-side, working re lationship with our residents during their clinical rotation that convinced them to pursue pediatrics.\" This fact was most evident during this year's UMMS Educational Achievement Awards ceremony. Of the 20 awards presented by thir d-year medical students to residents for \"excellence in teaching, \" eight were received by pediatrics residents. In addition, of the fo ur presented by fourth-year students, three were awarded to pediatrics residents. The community-based component of the program is a nationally recognized model that complements the caliber of its residents. Co ordinated by Susan Starr, MEd, instructor in pediatrics, and Margaret S. Hunt, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics, the program places residents one day per week in a community physician's office, offering the residents strong student-mentor relationships throughout their tra ining. \"Historically, the focus of the residency was always inpatient pediatrics or, more recently, resident-run outpatient clinics wh ere an attending physician supervises the residents,\" commented Durbin. \"What distinguishes our residency program from others is that our reside nts foster long-term relationships with community pediatricians who commit to a program of rigorous faculty development and who are invest ed in teaching.\" Almost 15 years since its inception, the community-based program appears to be coming full circle. While some of the participat ing community physicians are taking their fifth residents this year, several new physician preceptors, who themselves graduated fro m the Medical School's Pediatrics Residency Program, are taking their first residents. The program also continues its pioneering spirit by leading the country again, this time in a shift toward more community-focus ed pediatric care. According to Starr, \"Nationally, pediatric programs are concentrating more on the social problems facing children, such a s alcohol or child abuse, rather than on measles or mumps. We're now taking the lead in this national effort by encouraging our residents t o think more globally about public health and advocacy for their patients.\"Alumni and Parents Relations Office, University of Massachusetts Medical School I 55 Lake Avenue North I Wor cester, MA 01655 or e-mail charlene.nemeth @umassmed.edu call (508) or (508) 856 3372 fax (508) 856 5490To submit a class note, send your news to: Class of 2001 Commencement Breakfasts Hosted by the UMMS Alumni Association / June 20011 2 3 Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences 1 Jack Leonard, professor of radiology, physiology and anesthesiology (left), with graduate Chris Schonhoff 2 Dean Thomas Miller and 2001 Class Speaker Nicole Faulkner (See related story on page 18). 3 Graduates Andrea Femino, Chris Schonhoff, Stanley Stachelek and Nicole Faulkner with Dean Miller Graduate School of Nursing 1 Lauren Danserean '02 (right), the first recipient of the Lucie D.

Withover 6,500 walkers donating their time,energy and money, approximately$700,000 was raised to construct cancerresearch facilities within the researchlaboratory building at UMMS. The LaborDay event was not only an inspiringdemonstration of the community'sdedication to finding a cure for cancer,but also an expression of its compassionfor those who have lost loved ones to the disease, for those who have lost theirown courageous battles, and for thosewho have survived. While this year's walk saw many familiar faces traversing the five-mile course aroundLake Quinsigamond, the enthusiasticparticipation of the City of Worcestermarked a special milestone in the event'shistory. According to Stephen Willand,PhD, the director of the City Manager'sOffice of Employment and Training, City Manager Thomas Hoover made it a priority to support the walk. \"Theinvolvement of the city in an event likethis is rare, but we truly believe in thiscause. Worcester is in a unique position.Research is being conducted in the citythat could ultimately be the key to a curefor cancer, and we wanted to be a part ofthat, \" said W illand. \"The Medical School is something that we are very proud of and we wish to demonstrate that ourpartnership with it is mutual and strong.\" continued next pagethe promise of the future realized Recognizing the importance of medical research to both patient care and medical education, the University of Massachusetts Medical School, under the direction ofChancellor and Dean Aaron Lazare, MD, has targeted the growth of its researchenterprise as one of its highest priorities. To stimulate this growth, the school brokeground in December 1999 on a new, state-of-the-art, 360,000-square-foot researchlaboratory building. Just 21 months later, our new r esearch facility is open and a new chapter in the history of the Medical School has begun. Built in part with the generous support of many donors, and without state funding, this impressive, 10-story building has eight floors dedicated to advanced research in theareas of cancer, neuroscience, genetics and biochemistry. Each floor consists of 144laboratory benches with workstations configured in an open space plan, a core area with shared equipment, conference space and faculty offices. We are grateful to our many generous donors who have contributed to the construction and outfitting of this building through our $38 million Campaign for Research. All donors of $10,000 or more to the Campaign will be recognized on a plaque in the entrancepavilion of the research building. In addition, many leadership gifts have enabled us to name major portions of the building. They include: Massachusetts AFL-CIO Cancer Research Center - Massachusetts AFL-CIO The Blais Pavilion - Jack and Shelley Blais John H. Pierce Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratories - Jack and Shelley Blais The DeFeudis Atrium - Gene and Mary DeFeudis The Bruce Pollak Atrium - Martin and Ellen Pollak The David L. and Goldie C.

Because of their commitment to me, my desire toadvocate for research is stronger thanever,\" she said. Commenting on theimpressive crowds of people that walkedfor the cause, Hargrove was overwhelmed.\"When you are diagnosed with cancer, it can be so isolating. But seeing all ofthese people walking in support makes it that much easier to cope.

This year's special ceremony recognized the achievements of therecipients, and the generosity of thedonors who made this year's newlyendowed professorships a reality. As thesecond recipient of the Celia and IsaacHaidak Professorship in MedicalEducation, Aaron Lazare, MD, UMMSchancellor/dean, was recognized for hiscontributions to undergraduate medicaleducation and health communications.Made possible by the generosity of thelate Richard M. Haidack, a successfulbusinessman whose $3 million gift toUMMS provided for three endowments,the professorship is named in honor of his parents. A second professorship,another beneficiary of the Haidack gift,was also invested at the ceremony.made possible through the H. Arthur Smith Foundation. The chair was named in honor of Mr. Smith's cousin, BarbaraSmith of Worcester. In another first for the Medical School, Ira Ockene, MD, UMMS professor ofmedicine and husband of Dr. JudithOckene, was invested as the David J. and Barbara D. Milliken Professor ofPreventive Cardiology, marking the firsttime a married couple was invested atthe institution. Barbara Milliken, alongwith additional donors including TheEllison Foundation, D onald and Mary Melville of Worcester and Bruce andCarolyn Phillips of Chatham, establishedthe endowment in David Miliken's nameto support the exemplary research of theDivision of Cardiovascular Medicine. Endowments create an environment where the very best scientists andscholars can flourish, define the highquality of the research and educationalenterprises at UMMS, and providegenerous donors with the opportunity to see their philanthropy provide betteroutcomes for others. UMMS currently has22 endowed positions; all but four havebeen established since 1997. The June Investiture ceremony also recognized the establishment of the Lambi and SarahCancer Research Laboratories in the research building, recruit new scientistsand support the Ali Pierce EndowmentFund, Blais has demonstrated his totalcommitment to the advancement of cancer investigations at UMMS. Mr. Blais, a native of Burlington, Massachusetts, and a mechanicalengineer, in 1998 co-founded NetOptix of Natick, which quickly became the leaderin the rapidly growing field of multilayerinfrared optical interference filters. As a result, NetOptix was purchased by Corning, Inc. in May 2000 and nowemploys more than 2,000 people. Mostrecently, Mr. Blais founded Blais Co., a holding company that presently ownsfour businesses, and is an active partnerin a worldwide management consultingfirm located in Framingham. In his address to the Commencement audience, Chancellor and Dean AaronLazare noted that Blais' personalcontribution \"will have a direct impact on the Medical School's mission of curingdisease and alleviating suffering throughmedical research for generations to come.[His] many strengths and beliefs serve asboth model and inspiration for those herewho share [his] commitment to servingthe greater good.\" in tara ' s memory At once tragic and inspiring, the story of the Bean family of Shrewsbury is a lesson incourage and determination. A vibrant and happy girl with a passion for the BackstreetBoys and American Girl dolls, Tara Katherine Bean was just 9 years old when complicationsfrom brain tumor surgery took her life the day after Valentine's Day last year. As theystruggled to cope with their daughter's death, Karen and Robert Bean have channeledtheir grief into action, motivated by two equally important go als: to help children with brain tumors and to keep Tara's memory alive. The Bean family wanted to ensure that Tara's legacy would be one of compassion and hope. After her death, the family made the decision to donate Tara's organs, givingseven people new life or the promise of a better one. And still, they wanted to do more to make a difference. Supported by their son Alex and their community, the Beans haveestablished the Tara Bean Foundation to raise money for pediatric cancer research atUMass Medical School. Funds raised through the Tara Bean Brain Cancer Research Fundwill be used to establish a fellowship in neuroscience at UMMS, with an emphasis on thetreatment of brain tumors. The fellow will work under the direction of Lawrence D. Recht,MD, UMMS professor of neurology. In addition, the foundation will honor Tara's memorywith the naming of the Tara Katherine Bean Conference Room on the neurobiology floorof the research laboratory building.tournaments support numerous causes From Worcester County to Boston's suburbs, at private clubs and publiccourses, an astonishing 21 golftournaments will be sponsored this yearto benefit educational, clinical and researchprograms at UMass Medical School andUMass Memorial Health Care through the UMass Memorial Foundation Fromcancer to pediatric immunology, from theChildren's Medical Center to the UMassCancer Center, these golf tournamentsencourage area residents to hit thegreens the great causes. Held this July at the Mt. Pleasant Country Club in Boylston, the Flagship CancerClassic benefits research at the UMassCancer Center. Sponsored by FlagshipBank, the event was held in memory ofMichael J. Toomey, the late Flagshippresident and CEO who dedicated himselfselflessly to the Worcester community.Mr. Toomey lost his own battle withcancer in October 2000. Proceeds from the Cancer Classic will benefit severalUMMS scientists and clinicians who areworking in a number of areas to discoverthe causes of cancer and to find newmethods of treatment and prevention. On August 7, the first Diabetes Classic benefiting diabetes research and patientcare at UMMS was held at SterlingCountry Club. Golf enthusiast Aldo A. Rossini, MD, the William and Doris Krupp Professor of Medicine and Directorof the UMMS Division of Diabetes, wason hand to encourage the essentialsupport of diabetes research. Hisresearch team is embarking on humanclinical trials in the transplantation ofhealthy, insulin-producing islet cells intopeople with diabetes. The treatment mayprove to be an effective cure for Type 1diabetes, and its methodology maybenefit all patients in need of organ or tissue transplants. The Townsend Ridge Country Club hosted the third annual CJ ValleyMemorial Tournament in September. Oneof the most popular of the tournaments,the inspiration for the event was thememory of Charles Matthew \"CJ\" Valley,the infant son of Charles and Patty Valley.A happy, healthy baby, CJ diedunexpectedly when he was 2 months old from a common bacterial infection,pneumococcus. Bacterial infection is the leading cause of death for childrenunder 2 years of age, and the CJ Valley Memorial Fund is dedicated tounderstanding the development of theinfant immune system and its responseto disease. Advancing both research andoutreach, the fund will support a post-doctoral fellowship and an annuallectureship. Taking action was a responseto shock and grief, explained Mr. Valley.\"It changes your life and your outlook on everything.\" The couple has beensupported by their faith, their family and friends, and their efforts in memoryof CJ, which they plan to continue. \"We'velearned so much over the past year. We know it may be unrealistic, but wewant to make sure this never happens to anyone again.\" Assistance is available from the UMMF for companies, organizations and foundations that wish to organize a UMMF benefit tournament.

One such course directly encouraged by Dr. Lazare's advocacy and research, isthe Physician, Patient and Society (PPS)course. One of the first medical schoolcourses of its kind, PPS teaches medicalstudents to talk and listen empatheticallywith their patients. Since the inception ofPPS in 1995, UMMS has used its significantbase of ambulatory care and community-based physicians to expand this importantwork, encouraging first-and second-yearmedical students to practice their clinicalscience and patient relationship skillsearly in their medical school experience. Dr. Lazare has placed UMMS in a national leadership position for its contribution to preparing the nation's future primarycare providers, educators and researchers.Graduating physicians from UMMS, whoare surveyed one to two years aftercompleting the school's Interclerkships,have rated themselves \"far more satisfied\"with the preparation they received inpatient-physician relationships. During his tenure at UMMS, Dr. Lazare has both encouraged the development of programs to benefit students, andworked diligently to ensure that the faculty is given the opportunity to succeed with academic research. With theThe Last Word: establishment of the Office of Medical Education, a center of advocacy, supportand oversight of undergraduate medicalcurricula across all years and across all disciplines and departments, Dr. Lazarehas created an infrastructure upon whichfaculty can assess their progress inmeeting these goals. Finally, it is the humanism and generous spirit of Dr. Lazare that isimbued in the UMMS culture. As students, parents and faculty recognize, he is a person who allows everyone tofeel free to explore, express and dream.He has fostered an environment wherecreativity and unique contributions of individuals are recognized and valuedand where interdisciplinary teamwork is encouraged. This investment andleadership in medical education isattested to by the success of faculty, staff and alumni who are nationallyrecognized for their work.Since he became chancellor/dean 10 years ago, Dr. Aaron Lazare hasserved to enhance the quality ofmedical education at the Universityof Massachusetts Medical School.Under his leadership, the MedicalSchool has achieved objectivelyranked academic prominence andunprecedented research growth. Ithas proved itself a model of student-centered, faculty-guided training ofthe nation's future physicians. Coming into his position at a time of great institutional instability, Dr. Lazareused the same sensibilities he developedin his career as a psychiatrist\u2014analysis,empathy, intellectual curiosity andvision\u2014to lead the campus in a variety of innovative and interdisciplinarycurriculum and cultural changes.
