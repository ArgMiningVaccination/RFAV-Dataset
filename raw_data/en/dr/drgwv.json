This Environmental Assessment (EA) documents the analysis of any potential effects on the environment resulting from the Proposed Action. This EA is being coordinated with stakeholders and the public for information and comment, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as outlined in 40 CFR Parts 1500- 1508 and DHS Directive 023- Manual 023- 01-001-01, Rev.01, implementing NEPA . Recent changes to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500- 1508) became effective on September 14, 2020. As stated in 40 CFR Part 1506.13, the new regulatory changes apply to any NEPA process begun after September 14, 2020. This EA commenced after that date; therefore, this EA conforms to the new CEQ NEPA implementing regulations. The Proposed Action would take place between September 2021 and May 2022 and involves the release of particle and gas tracer materials directed into the open- air space in several pre - determined locations within NYC . The Proposed Action would include the release of low concentrations of safe particle and gas tracer materials as part of two programs - the Urban Threat Dispersion (UTD) program and the Chemical and Bi o-defense Testbed (CBT) program . The Proposed Action and the No Action Alternatives are considered in this EA. The UTD program is a follow -on to the Underground Transportation Restoration [UTR] project/test event , conducted in 2016, in which safe particle and gas tracers were released in the MTA NYC Transit (NYCT) subway system. In this study, the dispersion of materials through the system was studied. The results of the UTR project helped first responders and cri tical stakeholders better understand how biological particles would disseminate after a potential release. The UTR test event also raised several additional questions, including the relationship between tracer materials released in the subway and t he aboveground urban environment. These follow -on questions are the focus of the proposed upcoming UTD test. Additionally, further evaluation of the propagation of tracer materials to transit and outdoor sites in the greater NYC metro area, and Northeastern Seaboard is of interest. The goal of the CBT program is to increase resilience against potential chemical or biological agent attacks by testing and evaluating detection technologies and mitigation (or response) strategies to reduce agent propagation in several locations within the NYC subway system . In order to evaluate the performance of both sensor technologies and response strategies , DHS S&T proposes to disseminate safe simulant or tracer materials that mimic key properties of biological and chemical agents of concern. Performance data would be gathered regarding the ii performance of newly installed sensors (e.g., maintenance costs, frequency of false alarms, and probability and time to detect a potential threat) after the testing events. In order to understand how tracer dispersion and sensor performance are affected by train car and passenger movement much of the testing must be conducted during operational hours . As such, t he public may be present during testing . The proposed testing schedules for UTD and CBT are as follows: UTD: Particle and gas tracer releases would occur within a defined two- week timeframe between September and December 2021 . There would be five separate testing days scheduled within this two -week timeframe. NYC Stakeholders were recently updated on the UTD program in May 2021 and have initially concurred with October 17-30, 2021 as the desired release window. CBT: Particle and gas tracer releases would occur on a rolling basis between September 2021 and May 2022, with the speci fic schedule dependent on the pace of technology installation. Testing would occur up to 10 days per month, with a maximum of four test events per day. Several particle (P) and gas (G) test options may be used in the Proposed Action to meet the scientific objectives of both the CBT and UTD programs , these safe tracer materials are being considered in this EA . Table 1. summarizes proposed usage of the safe tracer materials across the two programs . Table 1. Safe Tracer Materials Being Considered for U se in CBT and UTD Test Option Description Planned use in CBT Planned use in UTD P1 DNATrax -OB cargoes Yes DNA liquid mixture Yes No P5 Visolite Yes No G1 Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) Yes Yes G2 SF6 and Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) Yes Yes Five particle options (P1-P5) are considered within this EA . The proposed particles would meet various purposes and needs of the CBT and UTD projects, while the sixth represents the No Action Alternative. Option P1 (DNATrax an aerosol release using DNA oligonucleotides . The oligonucleotides enable specific and sensitive measurement of particle spread in the environment, and detection by some biosensor technologies . iii Options P1 and P2 contain DNATrax, which is a maltodextrin- based particle. DNATrax was developed for food labeling purposes and has been classified by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) . Option P2 uses amorphous silica as a carrier to enable production of larger particles . Options P1 and P2 are proposed for use solely in UTD. Option P3 uses alginate, a safe polysaccharide isolated from algae as the particle carrier. The resulting particles are not water -soluble, enabling improved investigation of environmental persistence, and can be functionalized to enable detection by different sensors . Option P3 is proposed for use in both CBT and UTD . Option P4 contains many of the same components as Option P1-P3 but is released as a liquid mixture that rapidly evaporates to form droplet nuclei . Option P4 is proposed for use in CBT an d is included in this analysis due to its ease of production compared to the other safe tracer materials . Option P5 (Visolite) is a commercially -available fluorescent powder commonly used in HVAC testing . Option P4 is proposed for use in CBT , and would partially meet program needs ( enabling testing of mitigation /response strategies and some, but not all, sensor technologies). Option P1, P2, and P4 have all been safely used in prior tracer tests1,2. Option s P1-P5 would be aerosolized in particle sizes that are respirable. As a result, existing airborne exposure limits were considered regarding the usage of all safe tracer materials discussed here. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has developed eight -hour time- weighted average Per missible Exposure Limits and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established 8- hour Threshold Limit Values for workers in occupational settings for a range of materials . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) h as also established limits for specific criteria pollutants known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health, including the health of sensitive immune- compromised populations . Based on safe particulate composition and very low concentrations, t here would be no anticipated adverse effects to the public from any of the tracer materials being released since the materials are safe at the testing levels being proposed. No appreciable risk to passengers, residents of NYC or the greater regional area, tourists, transit workers, or field test personnel would occur . The Proposed Action is shown to be well within all established exposure limits and guidelines set by OSHA , ACGIH, and the EPA . Two gas test options (G1 -G2) are consider ed. The gas tracer materials would be released in very low concentrations (ppt or lower) . Option G1 consists of releasing sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas . SF6 is a perfluorocarbon and is not known to cause adverse health effects, even at high concentrations . iv Option G2 consists of SF 6 gas and up to six Due to the safety of the proposed test materials and the relatively small quantity of materials to be released (<10 g for the aerosol options, and <500 g for the gas options ), and the temporary nature of the Proposed Action , no effects are anticipated on noise, hazardous materials, water resources, vegetation , or land use and infrastructure . Negligible effects are anticipated on biological resources , cultural resources and his toric properties, environmental justice communities, and air quality . A beneficial impact on public health and safety is anticipated as the results of the Proposed Action would significantly improve public safety and increase resiliency in the face of a potential biological or chemical agent attack . It is worth noting that UTD and CBT test events would not occur simultaneously, so there are no anticipated synergistic effects. Based on this analysis, there would be no significant effects due to implementation of the Proposed Action. There would be no significant effects due to the incremental effects of the Proposed Action in consideration of other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable actions within the affected area. The No Action Alternative would not involve the release of any particle or gas tracer materials . It would not enable testing of gas sensor technologies in CBT and would not enable collection of highly specific real -time concentration data in UTD, which is difficult to achieve with particulates alone. The No Action Alternative would not meet the need or purpose of the Proposed Action. DHS S&T will post th is EA with an email address for the public to comment over a 30 -day period following publication. Public input submitted will be discussed and considered with respect to conclusions of the EA. During testing, signs would be posted near the tracer release locations for public awareness and would provide instructions for accessing more detailed information. A public relations campaign will occur in New York and New Jersey based on input from the New York Police Department (NYPD), MTA, and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ).v TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ............................................................................................................. i TABLE OF CONTENTS .............................................................................................................. v LIST OF FIGURES ................................................................................................................... vii LIST OF TABLES .................................................................................................................... viii LIST OF ACRONYMS ............................................................................................................... ix Section 1.

Purpose and Need of the Proposed Action A strategic objective of the United States ( U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent, disrupt, detect, and recover from biological attacks3. Protecting and remediating critical infrastructure from the effects of biological weapons is a key element to achieving this goal . Early warning detection systems, rapid response strategies, and post -attack remediation strategies are constantly being examined for urban areas to minimize casualties and economic impact . Dispersion models of both the subway systems and aboveground urban canyons have been created to help in these endeavors and are critically important for homeland defense. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), in support of these goals, is proposing two efforts occurring in NYC between September 2021 and May 2022. The first effort, the Chemical and Bio- Defense Testbed (CBT) program se eks to evaluate detection technologies for chemical and biological agents and mitigation strategies to reduce agent spread . Specific program objectives include creating an enduring testbed in the NYC subway system to vet current and emerging chemical and biological agent sensing technologies as well as response strategies to mitigate the spread of contamination, and to g ather realistic performance, operations and maintenance , and cost data. As one component of the CBT program, DHS S&T proposes to evaluate s ensor technology and mitigation action effectiveness by conducting open- air releases of safe tracer materials that mimic key properties of biological and chemical agents of concern. Safe particle and gas materials would be disseminated in several subway st ations where sensing and mitigation technologies have been installed, and the effectiveness of these technologies in detecting and reducing the concentrations of the dispersed materials would be evaluated. Measurements would also be collected during testing to characterize the background environment (for example, temperature, humidity, background particle and gas constituents, etc) . Testing would be ongoing between September 2021 and May 2022, dependent on the pace of technology installation . Upper limits to testing frequency are provided below in Section 2.1.2 . The Urban Threat Dispersion (UTD) program seeks to provide quantitative evidence that is needed to validate, refine, and integrate urban dispersion models to ensure their accuracy . Several tracer studies dating back to the 1960s have been conducted, but many of these efforts focused on dispersion of gases and liquid aerosols 1. These types of measurements lack information on reaerosolization, train car mechanical filtration, and fomite transport (i.e., attachment and subsequent resuspension of particulate materials on passengers and their personal effects) . Solid particulate measurements that did exist lacked the spatial and temporal resolution desired for model validation. A 2016 effort, called Underground Transportation Restoration (UTR) , in which temporal air and surface measurements of gas and particle tracer dispersion were collected throughout Manhattan, represented a significant increase in our understanding of particulate dispersion . However, UTR focused primarily on tracer dispersion within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority New York City Transit (MTA NYCT) subway system and was generally limited to sites in Manhattan . The proposed testing action evaluated in this EA would build upon the earlier 2016 UTR test to better understand the coupling of dispersion between the subway and aboveground environment and the broader geographic 2 extent of dispersion to the outer boroughs . Small quantities of safe particle and gas tracers that can be quantitatively and sensitively tracked in the environment would be released from up to six aboveground or subway locations in NYC . Five test events are proposed to occur over an approximately two- week window between September - December 2021. Recent engagements with NYC Stakeholders inc luding NYPD, PANYNJ, MTA, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJ T), Metro -North, Amtrak, NYC Department of Health, and New Jersey Department of Health have initially concurred with October 17-30, 2021 as the desired test window. It should be noted that the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic has altered many fundamental aspects of daily life in NYC and across the globe. Among these changes are reduced train frequency, reduced ridership and commuter population, reduced numbers of people moving throughout the city, and increased frequency of cleaning in the transit systems and generally throughout the city. These changes would be expected to impact the data collected during this Proposed Action and could impact its interpretation and applicability . Impacts due to COVID -19 are being closely monitored and discussed with key stakeholders , although as vaccines become available, it is anticipated that ridership and pattern of life will approach a \"new normal.\" A COVID -19 protocol may be put in place for test per sonnel based on conversations with NYC stakeholders and CDC guidance at the time of the UTD and CBT test events. This protocol would address concerns such as mask usage and periodic COVID -19 testing for test personnel. Any change in test timing due to COV ID-19 conditions would be subject to approval from relevant stakeholders and agencies, would result in an edited publication of the EA, and would be clearly communicated to the public. 3 Section 2. Proposed Action and Alternatives This section discusses the Proposed Action as well as the No Action Alternative. The Proposed Action includes several testing options, which are presented below. The analysis of the alternatives is in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as outlined in 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Parts 1500- 1508 and DHS Directive 023 -01, Rev. Manual 023- 01-001-01, Rev.01, implementing NEPA . Recent changes to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500- 1508) became effective on September 14, 2020 . 2.1 Tracer Testing Location and Particle and Gas Tracers (Proposed Action ) The Proposed Action would require both a location to perform testing as well as the use of gas and/or particle tracers to safely mimic dispersion of biological and/or chemical threat agents . A range of particle and gas tracer test options is being considered to fully meet the purposes and need of the Proposed Action. The Proposed Action includes these two components and i s further discussed below . 2.1.1 Testing Location s The proposed locations for tracer releases have been coordinated with stakeholders in NYC based on their priorities and program needs. The optimum condition for executing a bio- terror attack would be during rush hour, when a large number of commuters are in the transit system, trains are running at peak number and speed, and population density in downtown areas is highest . Because the movements of trains and people are important drivers of particle dispersion , airflow, and sensor performance, the most accurate reflection of material transport would involve testing during near -peak operational hours . Therefore, release of particle and gas test options are generally proposed during revenue hours (i.e., during normal operations while passengers are present within stations) . In some cases, e fforts would be made to conduct testing during off -peak or non- operational hours if possible (primarily applicable to CBT activities) . Cones and security tape would be used to secure a 10- foot area around the release point. Field test personnel (including MTA and NYPD personnel) would control access to the immediate area. 2.1.1.1 Chemical and Bio -defense Testbed ( CBT) Releases of the particle and gas test options would occur from platforms in either the Times Square or Grand Central stations in NYC. These platforms are the sites of current and future planned technology installations for the CBT program . Sensor placement and installation is occurring in coordination with the MTA . Initial tracer testing is anticipated to begin at Grand Central station and expand to Times Square station later as technology installations proceed. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of sensor architectures for different release scenarios, release ev ents are proposed to be conducted from different locations on the station platforms over the course of testing . The planned test schedule and proposed amounts of particle and gas materials released per release event are discussed in the next few sections . The Grand Central and Times Square stations were identified as sites for CBT program performance because of their strategic importance. Both stations are located in midtown 4 Manhattan . Grand Central station is the second most frequently used station in the MTA NYCT subway system, with over 155,000 riders on an average weekday (numbers based on pre- COVID -19 ridership data) . The Times Square station is the most frequently used station in the MTA NYCT subway system with over 203,000 riders on an average weekday . The Grand Central 456 platform is connected by a long passageway to the Grand Central Shuttle platform . The S line is a 0.5 -mile track connecting Grand Central station to Times Square station. The S line receives over 100,000 riders on an average weekday and, unlike the rest of the system under normal operating conditions, shuts down at night between midnight and 6:00 a .m. The Shuttle tunnel connecting Times Square to Grand Central station offers an excel lent opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation or response technologies as part of the Proposed Action. Technologies designed to reduce (or mitigate) tracer dispersion can be installed in the tunnel, tracer releases can be conducted at one of the stations, and the effectiveness of these mitigation measures in limiting tracer dispersion to the neighboring station can be evaluated. 2.1.1.2 Urban Threat Dispersion ( UTD) Proposed particulate and gas tracer release locations for the UTD test were identified based on discussions with stakeholders regarding key goals of the Proposed Action, to address uncertainty due to wind direction during the test, and to enable comparison of results with those of past dispersion tests . Based on these criteria, subway platforms at Times Squar e and Union Square station, indoor and outdoor locations near the Oculus Transit Hub as well as aboveground locations at Times Square and Union Square Par k were identified. Each of these locations have potential strategic impac t (i.e., multiple subway lines converge, high passenger and pedestrian traffic, significant cultural and economic importance, etc.) . Depending on the wind direction on any given day and to ensure that particle and gas tracer materials disperse towards areas equipped with measurement equipment, tracer releases would occur from a subset of the proposed sites on each day (two subway/indoor and two aboveground locations on each day) . Specific locations are subject to revision based on discussions with stakehold ers. Measurement equipment would be broadly distributed through the greater NYC metro area (see Figure 2 for more details ). 2.1.2 Timing and Release Amounts 2.1.2.1 Chemical and Bio -defense Testbed ( CBT) Testing would be conducted between the period of September 2021 and May 2022. Up to 10 days of testing may occur each month, with no more than four tests per day . Testing may occur on consecutive days . Each test event would be expected to last for 3- 4 hours . Release and measurement equipment would be deployed, and a 30- minute period of background measurements would be collected. Each test event would involve the release of one particle material and/or one gas material over the c ourse of less than 10 minutes . The tracer release would occur, and then measurements would be collected from CBT sensors and environmental monitoring devices for a period of 2- 3 hours, depending on whether multiple subway platforms are involved. CBT testin g would not occur during the planned UTD test window; CBT sensors would be leveraged to provide information about the UTD releases during this time. 5 Release amounts would be determined based on sensor limits of detection, distance of sensor from the chosen release site, and the approximate volume of the release area. Efforts would be made to use the smallest quantities necessary . Maximum anticipated release amounts are shown for each test option in Table 2. Test options P1 and P2 are not proposed for use in CBT . Based on these release amounts, and assuming a maximum of four releases per day, the maximum release amounts over a 24- hour period are also shown. Table 2. Likely Maximum Parameters for CBT Particle and Gas Release Amounts Test Option Release Format Amount per Release (g) Max Release Amount over 24 hours (g) P3: STAMP Liquid or powder 1 4 P4: DNA -Silica liquid mixture Liquid 5 20 P5: Visolite Powder 10 40 G1: SF 6 NA 500 2000 G2: PFTs NA 500 2.1.2.2 Urban Threat Dispersion ( UTD) A \"release event\" involves simultaneous particle and gas tracer releases from two of the subway platform /indoor selected location s and the two of the selected aboveground locations . Release locations would be identified ahead of each test day based on meteorological conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) . A total of five release events are proposed over a two- week period. The long test -window is designed to address weather -related risks since test events cannot be conducted in the rain . Tracer releases would last for 10 - 20 minutes . Each release event would be separated by a minimum of 5 hours, with no more than 3 release events in a 24- hour period. Table 3 is an example of what the release schedule would look like . Test options P4 and P5 are not proposed for use in UTD. The particle and tracer dissemination method would be short dry bursts every 30 - 60 seconds for 10 - 20 minutes . The maximum amount of particle tracer material released at a particular location over fifteen minutes, 8 hours, and 24 hours is 20, 40, and 60 grams, respectiv ely (Table 3). The particulate release amount has been chosen because it provides enough tracer material for sampling measurements to take place at sites a significant distance away from the release location but should not create a visible plume or substantially add to the visible background (see Section 3.6.2). Gas tracers would be released simultaneously with the particle tracers . Releases would be continuous during the 10 - 20-minute particle release period. The release rates and amounts are listed in Table 4. 6 Table 3. Tentative UTD Release Schedule (Subject to Revision) * Specific release locations would be selected based on predicted wind conditions 12- 24 hours ahead of a release event. Each release location would include both a subway platform and a nearby aboveground location (selected from the following three options: Times Square Station/Times Square Aboveground; Union Square Station/Union Square Park; Inside and outside Oculus Transportation Hub). 7 Table 4.

The upper bound is set at 2 gas release events per business day and 3 gas release events over 24-hours. One PFT gas would be released from each particulate release location. ** The primary release events would rely on PDCB, PMCH, mPDCH, and PMCP. The iPPCH and PTCH tracers would be used for additional small scale tracer testing at sites within the Oculus Transit Hub. 2.1.3 Release Devices and Measurement Equipment Two mechanisms would be used to release p article tracer materials in short bursts for UTD and CBT: a device called an \"eductor\" as well as a filter cassette ( Figure 1). In the case of the eductor , particulate tracer material is stored in a plastic tube that fits into the bottom of the eductor . Compressed air would be passed over a small opening in the top of the tube which aerosolizes the particulates . Alternatively, particulate tracer material wo uld be loaded into a plastic cassette on top of a support filter . Compressed air is then passed through the filter resulting in dispersion of the tracer material . Pictures of both dispersion mechanisms are shown in Figure 1. The particle tracer material would be weighed and pre- filled into the eductor plastic tube or filter cassette in a laboratory . The filled containers would be placed in a shatter resistant, leak -proof sealed secondary container for transport to the test site. Additionally, for CBT, a nebulizer may be used to release liquid formulations of STAMP (P3) or DNA -Silica liquid mixtures (P4). A nebulizer is a small device that turns a liquid into a fine aerosolized mist. For release of the gas tracer , test options that are liquid at room temperature (such as the PFTs, Option G2), would be released by evaporation via metering onto a low -temperature hot plate/blower dissemination device as shown in Figure 1. Gas tracer s which are gaseous at room temperature (such as SF 6, Option G1) would be released from a low-pressure cylinder through a flow meter to monitor its r elease rate or pre -filled mylar bags (not shown) . None of the release devices are particularly large but many do require electrical power . Release locations would be identified that do not interfere with pedestrian traffic and would be approved with MTA NYCT beforehand. 8 Figure 1. Possible tracer release devices . The reverse filter aerosol generator or eductor would be used for powder tracer like Option s P1, P2, and P3 . A nebulizer might be used for liquid suspensions of P3 and P4. PFTs (G2) would be released using a hot plate dissemination device. For both CBT and UTD, a variety of portable measurement devices would be installed during the testing periods to collect measurements of tracer dispersion following releases . In the case of CBT, measurement equipment would be installed on the Times Square and Grand Central platforms in close vicinity to the CBT sensors being evaluated. This additional measurement equipment would only be in place for the duration of the tracer releases and would be removed once testing is completed. Locations would be identified where equipment can be secured and would not impede pedestrian movement . Photographs of locations would be supplied to MTA NYCT for approval ahead of the testing . For UTD , measurement equipment would be located throughout the greater NYC metro area (Figure 2). Equipment would be temporarily located within subway stations, near station entrances and vents, and at aboveground sites (including within/near critical infrastructure) during the several -week period encompassing testing . Locations have been identified where power is available. In all cases, measurement devices can be locked in place using a chain, and pedestrian traffic would remain unimpeded. Units would be put into position before testing begins and removed after testing concludes . No permanent physical changes would take plac e to stations or outdoor locations from the use of measurement equipment. 9 Figure 2: Map of release and sampling locations during dispersion measurements ( some listed sites may be excluded) . Red stars indicate potential tracer release locations and each represent both a subway platform site and a nearby co -located aboveground site. Mobile equipment and samplers would be used to collect particle measurements . Images of all equipment is provided in Figure 3. Portable Sampling Units (PSUs) weigh 113 pounds ( lbs), are approximately 5' \u00d7 25\" \u00d7 16\" size and require electrical power (110 Volts) . Approximately 40- 60 devices are planned for use across both CBT and UTD programs . Dry Filter Units approximately 15\" \u00d7 13\" \u00d7 in size and require electrical power (110 Volts) . Approximately 60 devices are planned for use across both CBT and UTD programs . The DFUs may be outfitted with a custom modification to enable automated sequential collection of samples . The E -SEQ -FRM is a commercially -available sequential are approximately 30\" \u00d7 25\" \u00d7 24\" in size, and requires electrical power . Up to three devices are planned for use. 10 Figure 3. Photographs of particle tracer measurement equipment . A Portable Sampling Unit (PSU) is shown on the top left . A standard Dry Filter Unit (DFU) is shown on the top right . Inserts show the filter housings in both cases . A commercial sequential sampling unit, the E -SEQ - FRM, is shown on the bottom left . A custom DFU modified to collect sequential filter samples is shown on the bottom right. Other equipment, including up to 25 portable particle counters and 10 cascade impactors may be placed near the release sites for real -time particle counts . Particle counters and cascade impactors would be locked in place and plugged into outlets for power . Aluminum coupons and collection wafers would be plac ed on the ground at 25 - 50 locations both in the subway and at aboveground sites . Equipment would be put in position the day of testing and removed at the end of each day of testing . No physical changes would take place to station or outdoor locations where materials are located. Mobile equipment would be used to collect gas samples . Images of all equipment is provided in Figure 4. Approximately 100- 150 gas samplers would be temporarily located at measurement locations during testing . In the case of UTD, t he gas samplers can be locked in place using a chain (and may be mounted onto fences or lightpoles ) and pedestrian traffic would remain unimpeded. No permanent physi cal changes would take place to stations or outdoor locations from the use of gas bag samplers . The majority of gas samples would be collected from the air 11 using gas bag or sorption tube samplers (Brookhaven Atmospheric Transport Samplers, BATS II, Figure 4). The gas bag samplers are custom made portable devices that weigh approximately 15 lbs, are 16\" \u00d7 10\" \u00d7 12\" in size, and are battery powered. The sorption tube sampl ers are custom made portable devices that weigh approximately 20.5 lbs, are 16\" \u00d7 8\" \u00d7 12.6\" in size, and are battery powered. The LESS -I devices are also small sequential sorption tube sampling devices and would be used primarily for CBT. In addition, approximately 10 portable gas sensors would be placed in stations near the release for real -time gas concentration measurements . Gas sensors would be locked in place and plugged into outlets for power . Units would be put into position the day of testing and removed at the end of each day of testing . No physical changes would take place to station or outdoor locations where gas sensors are located. Figure 4. Photographs of gas tracer measurement equipment . The Brookha ven Atmospheric Transport Samplers (BATS II) are shown on the left, and a gas bag sampler is shown in the center, and a LESS- I sequential sorption tube sampler is shown on the right. 2.1.4 Particle Tracer Test Options Six particle tracer test options (P1-P6) are being considered to complete the Proposed Action. A combination of test options P1-P5 would be needed to meet the objectives and need of the Proposed Action. There are regulations in place regarding occupational exposure to respirable material over an 8-hour work day (i.e., set by OSHA and other international occupational safety organizations), environmental air pollution (i.e., set by the EPA), minimum concentrations resulting in observed health impacts (i.e., set by the ACGIH), and ingestion (i.e., set by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). These guidelines and regulatory limits were assessed for comparison purposes in order to contextualize the relative safety and risk of using these materials in the described amounts . More details are provided in S ection 3.4 of this EA . 12 2.1.4.1 DNATrax -OB (P1) The first particle option (P1) is to aerosolize DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) encapsulated in maltodextrin particles (referred to as \"DNATrax\") and tagged with an Optical Brightener (OB) . DNATrax (i.e., DNA oligos encapsulated inside maltodextrin) was developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for food labeling and has been classified by the FDA as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) . DNATrax -OB was previously used as a particulate tracer in the MTA NYCT subway system during revenue hours as part of the 2016 UTR program with no reported adverse effects (see Section 3.4 of this EA ). The primary component, maltodextrin , is already used in food and drink products including beer, protein shakes, and sweeteners such as Splenda. The optical brightener, Fluorescent Brightener 220, is used in several consumer products such as laundry detergent and paper production . The DNA oligo sequences, although selected from natural sources, are very short (<200 base- pairs in length) do not produce proteins and are considered to be safe (See Appendix A) . In addition, DNA is already ubiquitous in the environment and is produced by all li ving matter . P1 would enable direct comparison of the results of the Proposed Action with results from the 2016 UTR test. 2.1.4.2 DNATrax -Silica (P2) The second particulate test (P2) is to aerosolize P1 attached to amorphous silica particles (without optic al brightener added) . Particulate be referred to as DNATrax -Silica . DNATrax -Silica was previously used as a particle tracer in the MTA NYCT subway system during revenue hours as part of the 2016 UTR program with no reported adverse effects (see Section 3.4 of this EA ). Amorphous silica , the primary component in P 2, is used as an anti -caking agent and a carrier for liquid active ingredients in human and animal nutrition. P2 would enable direct comparison of the results of the Proposed Action with results from the 2016 UTR test. 2.1.4.3 STAMP (P3) The third parti cle test option (P3) is to DNA oligos encapsulated in calcium alginate particles . STAMP ( Safe Tunable Alginate Microparticle) . STAMP was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) for use as an advanced partic le simulant in tracer studies . An SDS for STAMP is provided in Appendix A . The surface of the STAMP particles can be functionalized in order to modify particle properties to better mimic biological agents of concern, or to enable detection of the particles by diverse sensor technologies . For the Proposed Action, STAMP particles may by functionalized with fluorescent dyes such as CFDye -amines or a protein such an antibody . In this case, the antibody recognizes a mouse protein. Based on the small quantities being used, none of these components present a significant risk to human health. Sodium alginate, the primary precursor of test option P3, is a polysaccharide isolated from brown algae that is used as a thickening agent in the food industry (e.g., in ice cream and jellies), as a wound dressing, as an inactive ingredient in pharmaceutical products, and as an impression- making material for prosthetics or in dentistry4. Sodium alginate for ms a hydrogel in the presence 13 of calcium, so STAMP particles do not dissolve in water (although they are biodegradable)4. This property of the STAMP particles enhances the ability to track and measure their persistence in the environment over time, an important goal of this development effort and test . The primary goal of P3 is to enable simultaneous challenge of different sensor technologies in the C BT program (for example, fluorescence- based sensors, antigen- based sensors, and DNA - based sensors) . This enables end- to-end evaluation of sensor architectures, which is critical to achieve the goals of the CBT program . Use of P3 is also planned during UTD testing in a more limited scope, with the goal being to evaluate the properties and effectiveness of STAMP relative to the better -characterized test options P1 and P2 and to better understand particle persistence in the environment. 2.1.4.4 DNA- Silica Liquid Mixture (P4) The DNA -Silica liquid mixture consists of many of the same components present in test options P1-P3, but involves aerosolization of these components as a liquid mixture using a nebulizer . P4 would consist , and the same antibody discussed for P3 . A key difference in P4 compared to P1- P3 is tha t the different components are not physically coupled to one another, with no defined geometry between the components . Rapid evaporation of the aerosolized liquid results in production of dry droplet nuclei that contain the different components . P4 accompl ishes many of the same testing objectives for the Proposed Action as P3, but is less preferred since the components are not physically coupled. P4 is being considered in this EA to provide flexibility due to its relative ease of production and scalability. 2.1.4.5 Visolite (P5) Visolite is a polydisperse, commercially -available fluorescent powder commonly used as an air tracer in leak tests . The powder consists primarily of calcium carbonate with an associated propriety fluorescent resin. Because of the fluorescent resin , Visolite can be detected specifically and in real -time in the background environment using UV -laser induced fluorescence (UV -LIF). Since some of the sensor technologies being evaluated in CBT are UV -LIF sensors, Visolite would enable testing of a subset of sensors under evaluation , thereby meeting only some of the purpose and need of the Proposed Action . Visolite could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigat ion/response strategies that rely on filtration or removal of particulates from the air . Use of P5 in combination with Options P1-P4 would be required to meet the full scope of the Proposed Action. 2.1.5 Gas Tracer Test Options Three gas tracer test options (G1-G3) are being considered to complete the Proposed Action . G2 meets the purpose and need of the Proposed Action. 2.1.5.1 Sulfur Hexafluoride (G1) 14 The first gas test option (G1) is to use sulfur hexafluoride alone . Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF 6) is a biologically inert, colorless, odorles s gas . It has been widely used as an airflow tracer for several decades in indoor and outdoor studies alike, including subway releases in Washington, DC (2007, 2008)5 and Boston, MA (2009, 2010, and 2012)6 as well as aboveground releases in mid- town Manhat tan during UDP (2005)7. Because of its stability and high dielectric constant , SF6 is primarily used as an insulating gas by the electric power industry . Due to its use in electric substations, urban areas in the U.S. have considerable fugitive emission sources . An unfortunate consequence of the fugitive emissions is that elevated background levels of SF 6 may compromise the tracer measurements . The value of using SF 6 as a tracer is that its infrared signature permits detection in real time using portable infrared gas analyzers . Even in the presence of significant background levels, the real -time measurement capability would be invaluable for monitoring the concentration levels in stations near the release point during the tests and for obtaining high time- resolution data. 2.1.5.2 Perfluorocarbon Tracers ( G2) The second gas test option (G2) is to use up to six PFTs in addition to SF 6. used for the bulk of the testing, while iPPCH and PTCH may be used for additional smaller -scale testing . All PFTs are inert, odorless, and colorless . They are fully fluorinated (saturated with fluorine), and are extremely stable, chemically and physically . One result of their extreme stability is that they have few commercial uses and therefore their background concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low8. This permits very small amounts of the tracers to be detected. Because of this low background, PFTs have been used as airflow tracers for decades9, including subway studies in Washington, DC, Boston, MA, and NYC. 2.2 No Action Alternative Under the No Action Alternative the proposed testing of bio- and chemical detection and mitigation /response technology and measurements of tracer dispersion would not happen. The No Action A lternative would not help to increase the resilience of urban areas and transportation networks against chemical and biological threats and thus does not meet the purpose and need of the Pr oposed Action. The No Action Alternative is carried forward for analysis in this EA to provide a comparison of baseline conditions to the Proposed Action, as required by the CEQ NEPA implementing regulations . 15 Section 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences This chapter describes the existing environment for resource areas that may be affected by the Proposed Action and the No Action Alternative, and the potential environmental consequences associated with these alternatives . Resource areas analyzed include soil resources; water resources; biological resources; hazardous waste and materials; cultural and historic resources; air quality; noise; human health and safety; socioeconomics; environmental justice; and land use and infr astructure. The affected environment summarizes the current physical, biological, social, and economic environments of the area within and surrounding the Proposed Action. For each resource area, the bounds of the area for analysis that could be impacted by the Proposed Action and No Action Alternative are broadly defined, and the elements or components of the resource area that may be potentially affected are described . For many of the resource areas potentially affected by the alternatives, the area of an alysis is confined to the test area. The analysis of environmental consequences for each resource area begins by explaining the methodology used to characterize potential impacts, including any assumptions made. The impacts analysis considers how the condi tion of a resource area would change as a result of implementing each of the alternatives and describes the types of impacts that would occur ( e.g., direct, indirect, beneficial, adverse) . The EA analysis also considers environmental trends and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities relevant to the Proposed Action area. The terms \"impacts\" and \"effects\" are used interchangeably in this chapter . 3.1 Test Site Overview Particle and gas test options P1-P5 and G1- G2 would be disseminated in open- air releases in several locations in the MTA NYCT subway system and several aboveground locations in Manhattan . Because a key goal of the Proposed Action is to evaluate sensor and mitigation /response technology perf ormance under realistic operational conditions with train and passenger movement, the public would be present for some of the testing. 3.2 Geology, Soils, Topography and Geological Hazards Geological resources consist of the surface and subsurface materials that make up the Earth's crust . Within a land area, these resources are described with the study of geology, soils, and topography . In the U.S., geologists separate geologically similar areas into physiographic provinces . Provinces are grouped based on sim ilarities between landforms' physical features and processes, and their relation to geologic structures, terrain, sediment, history, and rock types . Information about an area's physical features and processes can identify important aspects of the land's st ructural integrity, capacity for construction, and potential for geologic hazards . The prevalence of geologic hazards is based on the forces that act on geological resources . These hazards pose a threat to human safety and the built environment; examples include erosion, earthquakes, landslides, and sinkholes. 16 NYC is located on the eastern Atlantic coast, at the mouth of the Hudson River . It is made of five boroughs separated by various waterways . Brooklyn and Queens occupy the western portion of Long Islan d, while Staten Island and Manhattan are completely on their own land mass . Bronx, to the north, remains attached to the New York State mainland. The geological history of NYC is long and includes several formations, most notably those of bedrock and remna nts of glacial activity . The soil as described by the Natural Resource Conservation Service is primarily a fine- loamy, mixed, active mesic Glossic Hapludalfs . The topography of New York City is very diverse but has been substantial ly altered through construction activity . Several fault lines reside under NYC and sedimentation and erosion are present . The test options P1-P5 and G1- G2 would have no impact on these resources as activities would occur in an already -existing transit location and urban area with no potential to disturb existing topography or geology . Therefore, there would be no significant effects to topography or geology as a result of the Proposed Action. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no changes to these resources and no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.3 Land Use and Planning Land use refers to classifications that indicate the types of human activity occurring on a parcel of land. A predominant factor affecting land use is compliance with local zoning ordinances. Other relevant factors include existing land use and the types of land use on adjacent properties. Land use changes occur regularly throughout the U.S. and have potential negative impac ts to the human environment depending on its classification change and scope. In some cases, land use may have positive impacts to the human environment, such as habitat restoration or reclaiming previously contaminated lands for development. Utilities and infrastructure are crucial components of the human environment. This section describes the potable water supply, sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment, stormwater management, electricity and natural gas supply, waste management, and fencing and security features at the site. NYC is an urban environment comprised of residential, commercial, and industrial land use classifications with recreational areas such as parks and playgrounds located throughout. The area has been heavy impacted by construction activities and maintains an infrastructure to support more than 8 million people. As the Proposed Project is utilizing existing transportation infrastructure , a change of land use is not expected. The Proposed Action would occur during operational hours and the public may be present, but would not impact public transportation access or use. While testing may require the use of an electrical outlet, there would be no appreciable increase on the city's electric system or capacity. Use of potable water, sanity sewer and wastewater infrastructure, natural gas, waste management, or additional security would not be required. Therefore, there would be no significant effects to land use or infrastructure overall under the Proposed Action. 17 Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no changes to these resources. There would be no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.4 Public Health and Safety Public health and safety are largely a matter of adherence to regulatory requirements outlined by the OSHA and local police, fire, and medical services. The OSHA standards specify the amount and type of safety training and education required for industrial workers, the use of protective equipment and clothing, engineering controls, and maximum permissible exposure limits to contaminants, with respect to workplace stressors like air, noise, and spilled pollutants (29 C.F.R. Part 1910). In order to adhere to OSHA regulations, employers typically have internal proces ses and procedures in place to protect the safety of employees, contractors, and the public. Employers must review potentially hazardous workplace conditions; monitor exposure to workplace chemical, physical, and biological agents, and ergonomic stressors; and recommend and evaluate controls to ensure exposure to personnel is eliminated or adequately controlled. Additionally, employers are responsible for ensuring a medical surveillance program is in place to perform occupational health physicals for those workers subject to the use of respiratory protection, engaged in work that involves hazardous waste, asbestos, lead, or other activities requiring medical monitoring. This section discusses the evaluation for all human health and safety effects related to the Proposed Action. The public would be exposed to very low concentrations of particulate and gas associated with the test options . Exposures may include inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact . Additional contact may occur following testing due to the potential for re- aerosolization of the particulate material due to air movement within the subway station. The population during rush hours is expected to be largely comprised of healthy working adults, but young, aged or immune- deficient or immune -compromised riders are also expected to be present during testing (perhaps at higher frequencies than usual due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic). A discussion of the anticipated maximum concentration of tracer exposure will first be di scussed . The individual environmental consequences of each individual gas and particulate will then be discussed . Impacts to the overall public human health and safety from the Proposed Action would be less than significant. Both particulate test options P1 and P2 were previously released in the MTA NYCT subway system during revenue hours in 2016 as part of the UTR program. Release amounts were similar to those proposed for use in the upcoming Proposed Action. MTA NYCT records absenteeism information for t heir Rapid Transit Operations (RTO) which include those who work on or near trains as they operate in the system. Figure 5 shows absenteeism data from January 1, 2016 to October ober 1, 2016, a period which includes the 2016 UTR tracer releases. The vertical dashed lines indicate the week of tracer testing. There were no significant increases in the total amount of RTO absenteeism the week of tracer testing (or in the following weeks after). There were also no reported health complaints from MTA NYCT employees during this period. This anecdotal data suggests that release of DNATrax -OB, DNATrax -Silica, or PFTs (P1 and P2 and gas test option G2) did not have negative heal th impacts on workers in the transit system. 18 Figure 5. Total occurrences of Rapid Transit Operations worker absences due to individual categories (i.e., cold, diarrhea, fever, flu, nausea, and virus) . Vertical dashed lines have been provided to indicate the first and last days of the UTR tracer test in May 2016. The tracers released included DNATrax -OB and DNATrax -Silica -OB (P1 and gas tracers PDCB, PMCH, and mPDCH (G2). A particle tracer very similar to P4 was released in transit vehicles while test personnel were present as part of the 2021 Viral Phenomenology program2. There were no reports of advers e effects during this test event. 3.4.1 Particulate Test Options (P1 -P5) The evaluation of public health and safety consequences of each individual gas and particle test option is discussed below. Based on the maximum release amounts described in Section 2 for UTD, the maximum amount of particle tracer material released (either within a station or aboveground) over fifteen minutes, 8 hours, and 24 hours is 20, 40, and 60 grams, respectively. Maximum release amounts for the CBT effort over these same durations ar e expected to be lower, even given the possibility of four releases per day ( Table 2). The majority of released material would be in the respirable particle range of 1 - 10 \u00b5m. For all particulate test options , a 10 foot radius controlled zone would be established around the release site using construction cones and security tape. The release sites would be manned by test personnel, but no access for the general public wo uld be permitted within this zone while the release occurs . The material would be directed into the airspace to be rapidly mixed, minimizing exposure of any one individual to tracer materials . Table 5 presents measurements from previous similar test efforts as well as computer modeling results using the ANL Below Ground Model (BGM) in order to predict the particle concentrations near the release site . Several OSHA and ACGIH exposure limits are also provided for reference. Measurements from previous releases and modeling results updated for the current Proposed Action indicate particle concentrations that are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower t han the established permissible exposure limits (for an 8- hour average exposure) . 19 Table 5.

DNATrax was developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for food labeling and has been classified by the FDA as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) . DNATrax is listed as a nuisance dust on its SDS (provided in Appendix A). The DNA oligos enable sensitive and specific detection and quantification of the particles in the environment using molecular biology techniques. The Optical Brightener has been added to make tracer discrimination easier for real - time biological trigger sensors utilizing fluorescence techniques. Safety information for DNATrax - OB components is summarized below. DNATrax, and specifically DNATrax -OB, has been used for tracer testing in public spaces, including the MTA NYCT subway system, previously with no recorded negative health impacts ( Figure 5). Maltodextrin (CAS # 9050- 36-6) is a polysaccharide produced from starch that is often used as a food additive and has FD A Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) approval for ingestion. The maltodextrin SDS lists the OSHA PEL as 5 mg/m3 (respirable fraction)10. Maltodextrin is characterized as a nuisance dust and is not known to have adverse effects on the lungs10. The incorporated DNA sequences originate from harmless bacteria that live near hot springs. The DNA sequences are inert , non-living , and have been verified as dissimilar from other known biological sequences. Environmental DNA is already ubiquitous in byproducts (e.g., skin, hair, urine) from all organisms ; therefore there is no additional impact or burden placed on the environment from use of the material . Seve ral toxicology studies have been performed on Fluorescent Brightener 220 (CAS # 16470- 24-9) and related optical brighteners 11,12. These materials are generally not irritating to skin and eyes . Toxicity studies of this brightener and a related compound in rats and other mammals observed no fatalities or signs of toxicity via ingestion at a range of doses 13,14,15. Several inhalation toxicity studies have also been conducted in rats using closely related Fluorescent Brighteners. No mortality was observed, although temporary reductions in overall health were observed at the highest attainable concentrations 16,17. Animals appeared healthy during the 14 days following exposure and had normal weight gains . Finally, a review of toxicity studies for three optical brighteners, including CI Fluorescent Brightener 220, carried out by the German Institute for Consumer Health Protection and Veterinary Medicine18 also concluded that they pose no risk to consum ers. The DNATrax -OB particles would have a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) between 1 - 10 \u00b5m, which is considered res pirable. The DNATrax -OB particles (including the primary component maltodextrin) are not listed explicitly by OSHA; therefore, it is assumed classified as \"Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated. \" At a minimum, it would be required to remain under the designated 8- hour PEL of 5 mg/m3. The ACGIH recently established a Threshold Limit Value of 3 mg/m3 for respirable particles. The ACGIH designation applies only to particles that do not dissolve in water (maltodextrin readily dissolves in water), but to be conservative, the lower 21 ACGIH mass concentration is in full compliance. As shown in Table 5, the maximum concentrations encountered after particle releases are significantly lower than the established limits by OSHA and ACGIH for particles not otherwise regulated. Option P1, consisting of maltodextrin, CI Fluorescent Brightener 220 and the DNA oligos is not anticipated to present a significant risk to human health and safety. 3.4.1.2 DNATrax -Silica (P2) The second particulate test option (P2) is to aerosolize P1 attached to amorphous silica particles (but without addition of optical brightener). Particulate P 2 will be referred to as DNATrax -Silica. Safety information for DNATrax -Silica is summarized below . P2 has been used for tracer testing in public spaces, including the MTA NYCT subway system, prev iously with no recorded negative health impacts ( Figure 5). Amorphous silica , (CAS # 007631869) the primary component in P 2, is used as an anti -caking agent (e.g., dried eggs), filler for the rubber industry, and a carrier for liquid active ingredients in human and animal nutrition. Amorphous silica is found naturally in dust from mic roscopic marine plant fossil skeletons (i.e., diatomaceous earth). One of the major problems with assessing the health effects from amorphous silica is contamination from crystalline silica19. Crystalline silica can cause several negative human health effec ts such as silicosis, tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. However, all amorphous silica that is proposed for use would be synthetically manufactured, avoiding contamination with crystalline silica. No silicosis has been found in the epidemiological studies involving workers with long -term exposure to intentionally manufactured Synthetic Amorphous Silica (SAS)19. In addition, long -term animal inhalation experiments exposed to high concentrations of amorphous silica (> 10 mg/m3) showed no obvious pathology19. No adverse changes were observed in Wistar rats exposed to three different types of respirable SAS particles20. A variety of products containing silica are considered safe. Silica gels are considered GRAS when used as anti -foaming agents21. Silicon dioxides are considered GRAS as substances migrating from paper and paperboard products used in food packaging22. In 2018, the FDA updated silicon dioxide as a food additive permitted for direct additi on to food for human consumption23. As discussed above, maltodextrin is a polysaccharide produced from starch that is often used as a food additive and has FDA Generally Recognized as Saf e (GRAS) approval for ingestion. The maltodextrin SDS (provided in Appendix A) lists the OSHA PEL as 5 mg/m3 (respirable fraction)10. Maltodextrin is characterized as a nuisance dust and is not known to have adverse effects on the lungs10. The incorporated DNA sequences originate from a harmless bacteria that are found near hot springs. The DNA sequences are inert , non-living , and verified as dissimilar from other known biological sequences. Environmental DNA is already ubiquitous in byproducts (e.g., skin, hair, 22 urine) from all organisms ; theref ore, there is no additional impact or burden placed on the environment from use of the material . Amorphous silica is regulated by OSHA and would be required to remain under the designated 8-hour respirable PEL of 0.8 mg/m3. Amorphous silica is not listed b y the ACGIH; therefore, it is assumed designated as \"particles not otherwise specified (PNOS) \" and would need to remain under the established Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 3 mg/m3 for respirable particles . As shown in Table 5, the maximum concentrations encountered after particle releases would be well below the established limits by OSHA and ACGIH . Amorphous silica and the DNA oligos are not anticipated to present a significant risk to human health and safety. 3.4.1.3 STAMP (P3) The third particulate test option (P3) is to aerosolize DNA oligos encapsulated in calcium alginate particles (referred to as STAMP). The STAMP particles may also be functionalized with fluorescent dyes ( such as CFDye -amines) and/or a protein such as an antibody. The fluorescent dyes are being used to allow detection of the particles by fluorescence- based biosensors, while the antibody may be used to enable detection by a different class of sensor t echnology that may be included in the CBT testing. STAMP was developed by MIT LL for use as an advanced particle simulant in tracer studies. This particle has not been used in previous tracer tests and is proposed for use in a more limited scope relative to P1 and P2. Maximum amounts of STAMP to be released during UTD testing from a particular location over twenty minutes, 8 hours and 24 hours are 10, 20, and 30 grams, respectively. Maximum amounts are expected to be less than this for CBT ( Table 2). Safety information for STAMP is summarized below, and an SDS is provided in Appendix A. The precursor for STAMP particles is sodium alginate, which is a polysaccharide isolated from brown algae (SDS provided in Appendix A). Sodium alginate is a particularly useful material because it forms a gel under mild conditions in the presence of calcium, independent of temperature. As a result, it is a common additive to food products as a thickener and emulsion stabilizer. Alginate is also used in pharmaceutical applications because of its ability to encapsulate and increase the stability of cargoes4. Both calcium alginate and sodium alginate (CAS # 9005 -35-0 and 9005- 38-3, respectively) are classified as GRAS by the FDA for oral administration in a variety of food products 24,25. A number of studies have concluded that there are no adverse toxicological effects from oral administration of alginates 26,27,28. Alginate also has excellent biocompatibility, especially in the case of highly purified preparations. Studies evaluating the impact of alginate injections or implants in mammals show little to no evidence of inflammatory responses, especially when highly purified preparations are used29,30. Highly purified, food- grade alginate is commercially available and is being used for STAMP production. Because gelation of STAMP particles is achieved using calcium, the particles are expected to dissolve in the presence of molecules that bind to calcium, many of which are present in the body29. Because of its biocompatibility, alginate is used in a variety of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Alginate -encapsulation of drugs and therapeutics can increase 23 the stability of these compounds in the body, and chemical modification of the alginate can be used to modify gel stability and regulate the timing of drug release30,31. Of note, alginate itself does not inherently interact w ith mammalian cells, and mammalian cells do not have specific receptors for alginate. Modification of the alginate with specific functional groups is required to enable efficient interaction of particles with human cells29. The ability to modify the properties of alginate particles to confer new properties is also a key advantage of STAMP as a particle tracer, since it enables functionalization of the particles to enable detection by different sensor modalities. As mentioned above, in addition to encapsulating non- coding DNA oligonucleotides, the STAMP particles may be modified with fluorescent dyes ( such as CFDye -amines ) and/or a protein such as an antibody . The safety of non-coding DNA sequences in particle air tracers was discussed above for P1 and P2. As was the case for P1 and P2, the DNA sequences included in STAMP (P3) do not encode a functional product. In this case, the DNA sequences are randomly generated and screened to ensure that they are inert and dissimilar from other DNA sequences in publicly available databases such as Genbank. The fluorescent tags chosen for inclusion (CFdye- amines or related functionalized CFdyes ) are considered safe and are commonly used in fluorescent labeling studies. The antibody selected for use is commercially available, recognizes a mouse protein, and is produced in goats. The antibody would be coupled to the STAMP particles via a biotin- streptavidin connection. Highly purified biotinylated versions of the antibody are commercially - available. The STAMP particles would have a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) between 1 - 10 \u00b5m, which is considered res pirable. None of the components of STAMP are listed explicitly by OSHA or by ACGIH, and would therefore be required to remain under the requirements for \"Particulates not Otherwise Regulated\" (an 8- hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m 3 for OSHA and a TLV of 3 mg/m3 for ACGIH ). The SDS also mentions an aspiration hazard due to the potential for sodium alginate crosslinking following respiration. This hazard is alleviated for the STAMP particles since the alginate is already in a crosslinked form. In any case, at the release am ounts proposed in Table 3, the maximum concentration of STAMP encountered after a release would be well below the most conservative exposure of 3 mg/m3 set by ACGIH. 3.4.1.4 DNA -Silica Liquid Mixture (P4) Test option P4 contains many of the same constituents as discussed above, including amorphous silica, short non- coding DNA , salt, glycerol , and the same antibody discussed for P3. As discussed above, planned maximum amounts would remain well below OSHA limits for amorphous silica and ACGIH limits for PNOS. Salt and glycerol may be added to Option P4 in order to tune the size of evaporated droplet nuclei after release. Both salt and glycerol are common ingredients in many food products and have received a GRAS rating from the FDA. 3.4.1.5 Visolite (P5) There are no major health concerns related to open air releases of Visolite (P5). Visolite is commonly used for HVAC testing and leak testing and is commercially available. The primary 24 constituents of Visolite include calcium carbonate (0- 100% by by weight), (0.1- 5% by weight), and a proprietary copolymer resin (10- 30% by weight). According to the ACGIH, Visolite is characterized as a Particle Not Otherwise Specified with a 3 mg/m3 8-hour TWA threshold limit value (TLV) . OSHA has specific 8 -hour TWA limits for one of the minor components of Visolite (magnesium carbonate), with a PEL of 15 mg/m3. As shown in Table 5, maximum release amounts would be well below these limits . 3.4.2 Gas Test Options (G1 -G2) As stated earlier, the maximum amount of gas to be released from a particular location over te n minutes, 8 hours, and 24 hours are 1, 2 , and 3 kilograms, respectively for SF 6, and 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kilograms for the PFTs (Table 4). Based on the concentrations observed during previous tracer release tests (for example, during subway testing in Boston AND during the S -SAFE test in NYC)1, the expected concentrations in NYC for the proposed upcoming tracer test would be well within the established limits. Table 6 provides gas concentrations measured near the release points during the 2016 UTR test. The PFTs shown in Table 6 are not always exactly the same as those considered in this EA but provide a useful indicator of the likely maximum PFT concentrations immediately at the release point. Results have been adjusted based on the release amounts proposed in Table 4. The Acceptable Air Concentration (AAC) for PFTs are indicated as appropriate. Measured tracer concentrations were generally well below the established limits in all cases. Average PFT concentrations at aboveground release points would be expected to be significantly lower than those reported for subway platforms due to more rapid dilution in the surrounding environment. Table 6. Observed Gas Tracer Concentrations during UTR Study (MTA NYCT) Tracer Gas Average ppm Average ppm v (8-hr*) PMCH 3.1 2.1 0.01 PDCB 1.9 1.3 Not measured mPMCH 1.8 1.1 Not measured AAC Limit 9.0 Not applicable 3.0 *Based on 3- hour exposure measurements 3.4.2.1 Sulfur hexafluoride (G1) Gas test option G1 involves the release of SF 6 alone (CAS # 2551- 62-4). The OSHA PEL and the ACGIH TLV for SF 6 are 1,000 ppm for an 8- hour TWA. These limits were established to prevent oxygen displacement (i.e., to prevent asphyxia) rather than because of chemical toxicity. It is evident from Table 6 that the maximum concentrations likely to be encountered in this study 25 are far below the established limits. In addition, SF 6 has been released in subways in Washington, DC, and Boston, MA, many times without adverse effects. SF6 is a potent greenhouse gas in comparison to carbon dioxide. See discussion below. 3.4.2.2 Perfluorocarbon tracers (G2) The second gas test option (G2) is to use up to six PFTs in addition to SF 6. used for the bulk of the testing, while iPPCH and PTCH may be used for additional smaller -scale testing. The CAS numbers for all gas tracers are provided in Table 4. All PFTs are inert, odorless, and colorless , are extremely chemically stable, and have been used as airflow tracers for decades 9. Their background concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low 32. This permits very small amounts of the tracers to be detected. Being extremely stable chemically also makes perfluorocarbon compounds biologically inert and therefore suitable for a wide range of medical applications such as blood extenders or blood substitutes33, wound healing34, eye surgery35,36, equipment sterilization, imaging37, liquid breathing38,39,40,41, and organ storage. Both SF 6 and the PFTs are potent greenhouse gases compared to carbon dioxide. However, the relative contributions to global warming are small compared to the primary anthropogenic sources: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxide due to the very low amount of SF 6 and PFTs in the atmosphere42. The relative contribution to global warming potential from the tracer gases described in this document is often measured in terms of Greenhouse Warming Potential (GWP) . This is defined as the t ime-integrated radiative forcing of a tracer substance relative to the same mass of reference gas (usually taken as CO 2)43. The GWP of SF 6 is 23,600 9. The GWP of the particular PFTs proposed for this study are not published, but can be conservatively estimated as 10,000 based on the acceptance range of GWP for PFTs as 1,000 - 10,000 44. Using these GWPs for the tracers, the upper bound is estimated at 268 MTCDE (Metric Tons Carbon Dioxide Equivalent) . The release mechanisms (metered cylinder or metered evaporation, Figure 1) enable accurate quantification and control of release amounts. The amount of PFTs that would be released in this study ( PFTs: 10 kg) is a minuscule fraction of the industrial emissions of these gases. Assuming the maximum release amounts considered in Table 3 the tracers have a GWP of only 0.0005% (1 out of 200,000) of the total PFTs and SF 6 released in the U.S . in 2008 and only 0.008% of the GWP from fugitive SF 6 emissions in NYC in 2008 alone 9. Because perfluorocarbons are not known to cause adverse health effects, even at high concentrations, no OSHA PEL, ACGIH TLV, or Acute Exposure Guideline Level (AEGL) have been established . For S -SAFE, a 15 -min Acceptable Air Concentration (AAC) limit of 9 ppm and an 8- hr limit of 3 ppm were established 45 for the PFTs . These thresholds were based on the known toxicity profile of cyclohexane, which is an industrial solvent, not an inert perfluorocarbon compound. Nevertheless, based on the maximum observed concentrations near the PFT release locations in prior Boston , MA, and NYC subway tests, the concentrations near the PFT 26 release locations in this study should be below the 15- min AAC limit, a nd 1- 2 orders of magnitude lower than the AAC 8- hr limit 1. 3.5 Socioeconomics The analysis of socioeconomic impacts identifies those aspects of the social and economic environment that are sensitive to changes and that may be affected by activities associated with the Proposed Action. Socioeconomic factors describe the local demographics, income characteristics, and employment of the region of influence. 3.5.1 Executive Order 12898, Environmental Justice The EPA defines environmental justice with a goal of \"fair treatment\" to identify potential disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority communities and low -income communities and identify alternatives to address any adverse impacts as defined in EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low -Income Populations . For purposes of assessing environmental justice under NEPA, the CEQ defines a minority population as one in which the percentage of minorities exceeds 50 percent or is substantially higher than t he percentage of minorities in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis (CEQ, 1997) . A low -income population is defined as a Census tract (CT) with a median household income lower than the poverty threshold . A CT usually covers a contiguous area, and its boundaries usually follow visible and identifiable features (e.g., road, river) . CTs were designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living condition. According to the U.S . Census Bureau, the estimated population of NYC in 2014 was 8. 1 million people. Based on data from 2014, land usage is a mixture of single- and multi -family residential use (39%), There are 1,585,873 people living in Manhattan, 48% non- Hispanic White, 25.4% Hispanic, 12.9% Hispanic Asian, and 0.1% non- Hispanic American Indian47. The average New Yorkers is female (52%) and b etween the ages of 19 -64 (61%) . The majority (68%) of people in NYC rent their homes, with the median household income being $60,762 and 19% of the population living in poverty . Areas in and around NYC do contain areas with potential envi ronmental indicators according to the EPA's Environmental Justice Screening Tool EJSCREEN. These indicators are not necessarily surprising for a dense urban area and include diesel exposure, cancer risk, respiratory hazard, traffic proximity, lead paint ex posure, superfund proximity, hazardous waste proximity, and wastewater discharge indicators. Importantly, many of these areas are distributed throughout the city and would not be expected to be disproportionately affected by any of the activities in the Pr oposed Action. With respect to health effects from particulate tracers , the small quantity of material proposed for release in the Proposed Action would result in upper bound concentrations (i.e., next to release site) that are well under the established l imits by OSHA and ACGIH (See Section 3.4). In general, however, testing in the greater NYC area m eans testing in an environment that is 27 extremely diverse in terms of land use and demographics. Of note, the results of this test have the potential to positively impact and increase the safety of all public transit riders. While environmental justice communities may be present or reside within the proposed project area, no disproportionately high or adverse impacts on low -income populations or minority populations are anticipated from the Option s P1-P5 and G1- G2. Therefore, there would be no significant effects to environmental justice communities under the Proposed Action. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no changes to the existing socioeconomic environment or any disproportionate high and adverse impacts on environmental justice communities . There would be no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.6 Air Quality This section describes the ambient NYC outdoor, mass transit bus, and subway air quality. The Proposed Action is anticipated to have little to no additional impact on air quality, which is already characterized by high particulate concentrations. Therefore, impacts to air quality from the Proposed Action would be less than significant. A brief summary is provided below, with more details provided in two prior EAs 1,2. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed test ing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no effect on air quality. There would be no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.6.1 NYC Metropolitan Outdoor Air Quality Outdoor air quality in NYC has historically been poor and the city estimates that 6 percent of the city's annual deaths are attributable to air pollution48. The Clean Air Act, last amended in 1990, required the EPA to develop National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with a diameter below 10 \u00b5m (PM 10) and 2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5). NAAQS define primary standards, which protect the health of \"sensitive\" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly . In addition, NAAQS define secondary standards which protect against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings . The NYC Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) reported annual average PM 2.5 concentrations for 2016 that range from 4.5 - 16.8 \u00b5g/m3 depending on the measurement location, with the highest concentrations recorded in Manhattan. These 2016 levels represent an average 28 percent decline in PM 2.5 levels compared to 2009, but still remain above the primary and secondary NAAQS standards49. Outdoor PM 10 levels in NYC have remained steady for the same time period, averaging 60 \u00b5g/m3 for 2005 - 201150 and are well below NAAQS standards. NYC continues to work towards reduc ing particulate emissions and meeting national standards. 3.6.2 Subway Indoor Air Quality This section describes the characteristic background particulate matter found in air/surface samples in several transit environments. It should be emphasized that passenger entrances, ventilation shafts, and tunnels allow for a large exchange of air with the outside environment. 28 Airborne particulate mass concentrations have been previously measured at several subway systems around the world. Airborne particulate mass concentrations were almost always significantly higher inside subway stations than ambient air outside of the stations51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70; generally by at least a factor of four. Significant mass concentration variations were measured between different subway systems, and between stations 71, seasons53,57,72,73, and time of day73,70 for the same city . Real-time background particle concentration data gathered as a part of the 2016 UTR study indicated high background levels of particles in the Grand Central (>100,000 ppl for particles 0.52 - 2.13 \u00b5m diameter) and Times Square (>50,000 ppl for particles 0.52 - 2.13 \u00b5m diameter) stations in NYC74. The elevated mass conc entration values in the subway are thought to be influenced by passenger activity, floor cleaning, station depth, date of construction, ventilation rate, proportion of frictional to regenerative braking, train frequency, wheel type (rubber vs . steel), and the presence or absence of platform -edge doors and/or air -conditioning in subway cars and stations59,63. Analysis has been conducted on collected particulate samples to determine the constituent materials . Iron oxides (e.g., Fe 3O4, Fe 2O3) make up the majority of subway particulate mass (e.g., 64 - 71 percent in London subway 54). Airborne iron is primarily attributed to wear debris from the subway car wheel -rail interface and braking (contributed 15 percent total mass 75). Other metals found in elevated percentages to the outdoors were chromium (present in steel), manganese (present in steel), copper (present in current collector shoes rubbing against conductor rail), zinc (vehicular traffic), and barium (present in some brakes 51). Steel, manganese and chromium were found to be more than 100 times higher in the NYC subway system than outdoors 61. Carbon- rich particles are generally found, attributed to carbon inclusion in steel, oils, and human debris (e.g., clothes fibers, hair, skin) 62,55,51. Other non -metals found were silica quartz (e.g., 7.2 percent in Washington, DC), attributed to concrete (i.e., construction, degradation) 62, and chlorides 55,64,73 attributed to the use of road salts for de- icing. Fluorescent particles have been reported at <1 percent of total particle counts 64. A 2015 NYC subway system sampling campaign examined the types of microorganisms found within stations76. The findings suggest a rich and diverse background of microorganisms in the subway environment. Hundreds of organisms classified as bacterial, viral, archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa were found in the subway; however, most organisms were considered harmless. There were several Bacillus species found within the subways, with the most abundant being B . cereus (some strains of which can cause foodborne illness). 3.7 Noise Noise can be transmitted or continuous, steady or impulsive, and can involve any number of sources and frequencies . It can be easily identifiable or generally nondescript . Although human response to noise varies, measurements can be calculated with instruments that record instantaneous sound levels in decibels (dB) . The dB is a logarithmic unit that expresses the ratio of a sound pressure level to a standard reference level . A-weighted decibels (dBA) characterize 29 sound levels that can be sensed by the human ear . \"A-weighted\" denotes the adjustment of the frequency range to what the average human ear can sense when experiencing an audible event . The threshold of audibility is generally within the range of 10 to 25 dBA for normal hearing . The threshold of pain normally occurs in the region of 135 dBA (USEPA, 1981) . Existing noise within NYC results from ongoing construction activities, vehicular traffic, and air traffic. None of the equipment or personnel due to implementation of the Proposed Action would generate loud noises that would increase existing noise levels. Noise due to equipment would not exceed 82 dBA at any test site and would be well -below this level for any release site not requiring gener ator power . Therefore, the Proposed Action would result in no significant impact to the existing noise environment. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no effect on the existing noise environment. There would be no significant effects under the No Action Alternative . 3.8 Hydrology and Water Resources Hydrology is the study of how water naturally distributes and circulates . Water resources consist of the use and quality of both groundwater and surface water, floodplains, and wetlands . Water quality refers to the chemical and physical composition of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose, such as drinking . NYC is located within the 02030201 and 02030202 hydrological unit c odes and contains many jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the Clean Water Act. Areas determined to be floodplains and coastal zone exist within NYC, especially along waterfront and coastal areas. According to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC), the Long Island Aquifers under the city are among the most productive aquifers in the U.S. Additionally, NYC drinking water supply system is the largest unfiltered water supply in the United States . It provides approximately 1.2 billion gallons of high -quality drinking water to nearly one- half the population of New York State every day . Test options P1- P5 and G1 -G2 would have no impact on these resources as activities would occur in an already existing transit location and urban area ; therefore, there would be no significant impacts associated with the Proposed Action . Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no changes to these resources and no significant effects under the No Action Alternative . 3.9 Biological Resources 3.9.1 Threatened or Endangered Species Biological resources at the proposed Project Site may include vegetation, wildlife, and special status species . The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA) (16 U.S.C . \u00a7 703 et seq.) protects migratory birds . Other laws that protect terrestrial and avian special status species include the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C . \u00a7 1531 et seq. ), the Bald and Golden Eagle 30 Protection Act of 1940 (BGEPA) (16 U.S.C . \u00a7 668 et se q.) and species protected by the State of New York . Together, these resources form the ecological character of a given site. Four threatened and endangered species (piping plover, red knot, roseate tern, and seabeach amaranth) reside within the county but are all coastal species, and are not anticipated to be present in the subway system or in midtown Manhattan close to the planned release locations, as the appropriate habitat does not exist in these areas. Any tracer materials that disseminate to appropriate habitats would be expected to be at vanishingly low concentrations. Therefore, there would be no effect on threatened and endangered species from the proposed testing and consultation with the USFWS is not required. There would be no significant effects to threatened or endangered species under the No Action Alternative. 3.9.2 Vegetation, Wildlife, and Aquatic Resources Other urban wildlife including birds, coyotes, deer, rodents, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are present in NYC. While urban wildlife and their habitat may be present in the proposed project area, no effect is anticipated on wildlife, given the relatively low quantities and non- toxicity of the materials. New York is home to many animal and plant species and their habitat . The potential for exposure of terrestrial wildlife to the particulate materials was evaluated due to movement of the material with the air vented from the station, or due to aboveground releases . DNATrax -OB (P1) would not impact the su rrounding environment . The primary component, maltodextrin, is already used extensively in several food and drink products commonly found in Manhattan . The DNA oligos are safe and are comprised of the same four nucleotides as all other DNA (uniqueness comes from differences in sequence) 77. The specific sequences being used do not code for functional products and would be made to look distinctly different from known pathogens that are searched for within the DHS BioWatch air sampling program . The fluorescent brightener used with DNATrax (i.e., fluorescent brightener 220) is used in several commercial products found commonly in Manhattan ( paper , clothing) . It has been tested extensively on animals and has presented little to no risk . The OB is soluble in water and is removed by >75% to >95% through adsorption from sewage with direct photolysis a second elimination process (half-life for the OB on surface water is 3.9 - 5.2 hours) 78. OB acute toxicity levels are known for fish ( Brachydanio rerio; ; 96 h- EC50 > 1,000 mg/L) . There would be less than 100 g of OB released over the duration of all proposed tests . Toxicity levels for daphnia (the lowest toxicity level) would only be exceeded if the entire OB supply were deposited in a water reservoir containing 601.8 liters (~ 4 bathtubs of water). DNATrax -Silica (P2) would not impact the surrounding environment . The primary component, amorphous silica, is found natural ly in marine plant fossil skeletons and is already used extensively in several products commonly found in Manhattan such as toothpaste, anti -caking agents (e.g., dried eggs) and carriers for liquid active ingredients in human and animal nutrition. 31 STAMP (P3) would not impact the surrounding environment . The primary component, alginate, is found in algae and used as a thickening agent in the food industry (e.g., in ice cream and jellies), as a wound dressing, as an ingredient in pharmaceutical products, and as an impression- making material for prosthetics or in dentistry . Extensive toxicity studies have been conducted on different salt forms of alginate in a variety of different animal and human models, resulting in an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) designatio n of \"Not Specified,\" which is reserved for very low toxicity materials 79. While particles are not readily soluble in water, they are biodegradable and dissolve in the presence of molecules that remove the calcium ions from the alginate matrix and are expected to break down in the environment over time. The components of P4 (DNA -Silica liquid mixture) have already been discussed above and are not expect ed to have an impact on wildlife. Visolite (P5) would also not affect the surrounding environment . The major constituents of Visolite are inorganic salts . Ecotoxicity studies conducted using rainbow trout, water fleas, and green algae did not observe any e ffects of these constituents at the highest dosages tested80. Likewise, release of both SF 6 (G1) and PFT s (G2) in the amounts detailed earlier would have no discernable impacts on wildlife due to the low concentrations that would be observed and the absenc e of toxic effects from the gas tracers . With respect to the gas test options , SF 6 is currently present at appreciable levels within the NYC environment from electric power substations . The proposed perfluorocarbons are not known to cause adverse health ef fects, even at high concentrations as discussed earlier . Based on the discussion above, t here would be no significant effects to wildlife or special -status species under the Proposed Action. Test Options P1 -P5 and G1 -G2 would similarly have no effect on v egetation or special plant species as testing would occur in an existing transit location in an urban area. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur. Therefore, there would be no changes to these resources and no significant ef fects under the No Action Alternative. 3.9.3 Areas with Special Designation According to the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Information for Planning and Consultation, there is no critical habitat in the proposed project area. Therefore, there would be no impact and no significant effects to areas with special designation from implementation of the Proposed Action. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur. Therefore, there would be no changes to thes e resources and no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 32 3.10 Cultural Resources 3.10.1 Historic Properties This section describes the current setting for cultural resources and evaluates the potential effects to cultural resources as a result of the P roposed Action. Cultural resources, while not defined in statute or regulation, are generally inclusive of historic properties as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) (54 U.S.C . \u00a7 300101 et seq.) cultural items as defined by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) (25 U.S.C . \u00a7 3001 et seq .); archaeological resources as defined by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) (16 U.S.C . \u00a7 470aa et seq .); sacred sites as defined by E xecutive Order 13007, Indian Sacred Sites ; and collections and associated records as defined by 36 C.F.R . Part 79. Cultural resources are associated with human use of an area. They may include archaeological sites, historic properties, or locations of ethnographic interest associated with past and present use of an area. A cultural resource can be physical remains, intangible traditional use areas, or an entire landscape encompassing past cultures or present, modern- day cultures. Physical remains of cultural resources are usually referred to as archaeological sites or historic properties. Cultural resources of significance to Native American tribes can include archaeological resources, structures, prominent topographic features, vegetation, animal species, and minerals that Native Americans consider essential for the preservation of traditional culture. Cultural resources that are listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are known as historic properties. Almost 7,00 0 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed properties and 116 National Historic Landmarks as reported by the National Park Service and one World Heritage Site as designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization are present within NYC . Additionally, the NYC vicinity and surrounding area has been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years and many sites remain which may have cultural significance. Consideration was given to the potential effects of the Proposed Action on any known cultural resources or historic properties . Many of the stations in the NYC subway system are listed on the NRHP. Of the specific stations mentioned previously, the Times Square subway station and Union Square subway station are both listed in the NRHP. The Grand Central subway station is not listed, although the aboveground terminal is listed . On August 6, DHS S&T presented this finding in a consultation letter to the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) consistent with Section 106 of the Nati onal Historic Preservation Act and 36 CFR Part 800. On August 12, 2021, the New York SHPO issued written concurrence. A copy of the correspondence is provided in Appendix B and C, respectively. For the reasons discussed below, the Proposed Action would h ave no effect on these historical locations. There would be no ground disturbing activities or need to permanently affix equipment to any structures or walls within subway stations. The placement and use of testing equipment would not result in visual or audible impacts given the temporary nature of the activity . The tracer 33 materials used for testing would also have no direct or indirect effect to any contributing features of any historic properties. As such, the Options P1-P5 and G1 -G2 would have no effect on historic properties. Therefore, there would be no significant effects to historic properties under these Options . Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no effects on existing cultural resources or historic properties and there would be no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.11 Hazardous Materials and Wastes Hazardous materials and wastes are physically hazardous and include combustible and flammable substances, compressed gases, and oxidizers . Health hazards are associated with materials that cause acute or chronic reactions, including toxic agents, carcinogens, and irritants . In addition to being a threat to humans, the improper release or storage of hazardous mat erials, hazardous wastes, and petroleum products can threaten the health and well -being of wildlife species, habitats, soil and land use, and water resources. For this analysis, the terms hazardous waste, hazardous materials and toxic substances include those substances defined as hazardous by the Comprehensible Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) (i.e., superfund) , Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ), and the Spill, Prevention, Control and Countermeasures ( SPCC ) Rule under the C lean Water Act . In general, they include substances that, because of their quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical or toxic characteristics, may present a danger to public health or welfare or the environment when released into the environment . Regulated substances include the storage, transportation, handling, and use of hazardous materials, as well as the generation, storage, transportation, handling, and disposal of hazardous wastes . The purpose of CERCLA, often referred to as Superfund , is to clean up contaminated sites so that public health and welfare are not compromised. RCRA provides for \"cradle to grave\" regulation of hazardous wastes . An SPCC Plan can be developed, if required, to outline the methods and procedures established to minimize the potential for spills and discharges into waterways from the facility . NYC is home to sites subject to C ERCLA and RCRA and contains many areas where hazardous materials and waste are present . Equipment used to generate releases and collect samples during the Proposed Action would be properly stored before and during use before being returned to the laboratory where they would be cleaned and evaluated for reuse . All sampling waste generated during sample collection (e.g., gloves, filters) would b e disposed of according to regulations . Release amounts are so small that no large amount of visible residual material is anticipated to be present after test events . Test sites would be cleaned to remove any visible residual material, if present . Real-time measurement equipment would enable confirmation that aerosol levels have returned to baseline following each test . None of the materials brought to the stations are RCRA regulated hazardous waste. Test Options P1-P5 and G1- G2 would have no impact on thes e resources as activities would occur in an existing transit location and urban area. As a result, there would be no significant 34 effects from the Proposed Action due to hazardous materials and waste. Under the No Action Alternative, the proposed testing would not occur . Therefore, there would be no effects on these resources and no significant effects under the No Action Alternative. 3.12 Impacts from Past, Present , and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions This section analyzes the impact to the human environment which results from the incremental impact of the Proposed Action Alternative and No Action Alternative when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions . These impacts can result from individually minor, but collectively significant, actions taking place over a period of time. There are numerous projects occurring in NYC that may require environmental analysis and public input . Past, ongoing and r easonably foreseeable actions in the area would be primarily associated with the maintenance of supporting infrastructure such as roadways and utility systems as well as residential housing and commercial districts . It is assumed these actions, in addition to a myriad of others including scientific research, development, testing, and evaluation, would continue in the future. Unless within the DHS S&T mission and determined to be a major federal action, DHS S&T has no ability to prevent future non-federal foreseeable actions due to its limited statutory authority for projects that would occur regardless of the Proposed Action. The impact on the environment which would result from the incremental impact of the Proposed Action, when added to other past, prese nt, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have been considered. Resource areas analyzed include soil resources; water resources; biological resources; hazardous waste and materials; cultural and historic resources; air quality; noise; human health and safety; socioeconomics and environmental justice; and land use and infrastructure . Due to the selection of preferred test materials, the relatively limited quantity of materials to be released, and temporary nature of the Proposed Action, no effects are anticipated on noise, water resources (surface water, ground water, floodplains, wetlands), geology, soils or topography, vegetation, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources and historic properties, socioeconomic; and environmental justice comm unities ; therefore no significant effects would occ ur. Land use and the infrastructure would not be significantly affected as the proposed testing would not alter any existing land use designations and test sites would not be accessible to the public . By aiding in evaluation and testing of chemical and biological defense technologies , the Proposed Action would have a beneficial impact on human health and safety . The Proposed Action Alternative would result in no significant effects when considered with other recent past, ongoing, or reasonably foreseeable future actions in the project area. Under the No Action Alternative, the Proposed Action would not occur; therefore; there would be no significant impacts of the No Action Alternative in combination wit h other past, present or reasonably foreseeable actions in the proposed project area. 35 Section 4. Conclusions and Identification of the Proposed Action As a result of the information presented within the EA, DHS S&T has determined there would be no significant impacts on the environment or human health , nor would there be any significant additive effects . The Proposed Action (Testing Location , Particle Option s P1-P5, and Gas Option s G1-G2) would enable realistic simulant /tracer dispersion and highly sensitive and specific measurements . The Proposed Action would allow for an evaluation of the effectiveness of different measures at reducing tracer levels in the air . Selection was based on the ease of material production, safety, and prior experience with similar materials . The No Action Alternative w ould not help to validate current particulate models and therefore does not meet the purpose and need of the Proposed Action. 36 Section 5.
