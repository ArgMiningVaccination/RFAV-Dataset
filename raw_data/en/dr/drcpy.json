Taking responsibility by becoming an active participant in public health efforts is a service to our community both on- and off-campus. For students participating in face-to-face campus activities and for those taking part in face-to-face community service, getting tested and vaccinated is an easy but incredibly consequential way to make sure we're each doing our part to keep our community safe and healthy. Students are eligible to earn up to 3 hours of off-campus community service per aid year by completing COVID-19 testing. Please submit 1 hour per test, repeatable up to a total of 3 hours. For vaccinations, submit 1 hour per vaccination dose as \"individual hours\" following [the process explained here](https://galaxydigital.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/36000040970-logging-your-volunteer-hours#logging_individual_hours). You should use your own name and email address as the person who can verify your hours. Find more information about Hamilton County testing options provided by The Health Collaborative, including locations close to campus like the Corryville Recreation Center here: https://healthcollab.org/testandprotect/ Check with University Health Services or your local public health department for more information on testing and vaccination. Additional details: - Depending on your activities and exposure, it may be appropriate or necessary for you to complete more than 3 tests in an aid year. In order for you and our community to get the most out of your community service experience, you can only earn scholarship renewable community service hours for 3 tests (3 off-campus hours of service, 1 hour of service per test). - Testing sites are available on campus and within walking distance of campus, as well as in localities across the country and internationally. - Most health insurance providers cover the cost of COVID-19 testing. Many testing sites do not require you to submit health insurance information. "}
