The idea behind it is that we need to periodically clearthe \"toxic waste\" from our body in order to stay healthy. Inparticular, we might be tempted to detox after over-indulginga little, for example at Christmas. Some of the claims made in relation to detox diets include: magical weight loss; improved digestion; immune system; banishment of cellulite. Detox diets can last from around one day to around onemonth and may involve: \u0084Fasting for short periods of time \u0084Consuming only fruits and vegetables \u0084Cutting out wheat and dairy foods \u0084Consuming a limited range of foods \u0084Avoiding caffeine and alcohol Exploding the Myths If the human body really accumulated lots of toxins, then we would feel ill. The concept of detox diets is irrational andunscientific. In actual fact, when you starve your body ofcalories your body will ultimately start to build up chemicalscalled ketones. These chemicals can result in nausea,dehydration, weakness, light-headedness and irritability.Further, a prolonged lack of protein causes your body tobreak down its own muscles and can compromise yourimmune system. The Virtues Of Fruit And Veg Proponents of the detox diets often promote the virtues of fruits and vegetables. Of course fruits and vegetables are animportant part of a balanced diet and we should all eat atleast five portions a day - with meals, as snacks and fordesserts. They provide vitamins, minerals, antioxidants anddietary fibre, but no one fruit or vegetable can providenutritional nirvana - it's the variety that counts. Allergy to Wheat and Milk? Those promoting detox diets often claim that to 'detoxify', the body needs to exclude foods such as wheat and dairyproducts. The reality is that these foods provide us withimportant nutrients. It is unnecessary and potentially harmfulto exclude them from the diet. For those people who suspectthey have a true allergy to milk, wheat, or any other food, thecondition should be diagnosed by a qualified medicalpractitioner and, once diagnosed, managed under thesupervision of a registered dietitian. The Facts Fasting, or severely restricting food consumption, limits intake of energy and important nutrients that are needed forhealth and well-being. Rapid weight loss occurs whenfasting or severely restricting dietary intake, but this weightloss is water, glycogen (the body's carbohydrate stores) andmuscle, rather than fat. You may feel fatigued and dizzy and it's likely you'll have less energy while you are following adetox programme that involves fasting. Further, if you arefasting your body won't have the proper fuels available tocarry out sustained exercise and activity - an importantaspect of general well-being and healthy weightmanagement. At the end the programme, when you returnto your old eating habits, any weight lost is likely to go backon! A Balanced Diet It does make sense to avoid excessive intakes of caffeine, alcohol and high-fat, high-sugar foods. However, if you wantto maintain optimal health then the best approach is abalanced diet, with at least five portions of different fruit andvegetables a day; plenty of wholegrain cereals; lean meat,fish and alternatives and low fat dairy products. If you arelooking to lose weight then consider reducing portion sizes,and don't forget to take plenty of exercise.
