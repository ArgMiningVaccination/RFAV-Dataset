Management of Grahani (Diseases of digestion and metabolism)", "sitename": "Charak Samhita", "date": "2023-03-06", "cleaned_text": "[10.47468/CSNE.2020.e01.s06.016](https://doi.org/10.47468/CSNE.2020.e01.s06.016) Abstract [Grahani Chikitsa] consists of three parts. The first part explains the concept of normal digestion process. The second part describes the abnormal digestion and third part is about diseases caused by abnormality of digestive factors and its interaction with proximal intestine or grahani. These disorders are called grahanidosha. [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) (digestive and metabolic agents), based on their specific functions of conversion of food into biological elements of the body are classified into thirteen types. First, the jatharagni is most important because it is the initiator of digestive process and it strengthens the digestive ability of other twelve agnis. Five bhutagnis transform the panchmahabhauika components of ahara rasa created by jatharagni into different structures of the body. Seven dhatvagnis create seven tissues elements( [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)). Jatharagni initiates the first phase of digestion process by conversion of food into nutrient fluid (ahara rasa). This nutrient fluid is further trifurcated into three biological substances [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) stages awastha paka respectively. This biofluid is into excretable waste or impure products by samana vata in grahani (middle part of GI Tract) and useful, pure circulable products. Samana vata analyzes and separates the useful products (prasada) and waste (kitta). Useful products get absorbed by rasayani (villi) of the intestine, sent to the micro channels (srotas) by vyanvata, simutaneouly, to the entire body. Waste products are excreted out by apana vayu through urine, feces and sweat. Now second and third phase of digestion process occur simultaneously in the srotas (microchannels). Five bhutagnis work on the formation of anatomical structure of the body from respective [panchamahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Panchamahabhuta) in the form of micro channels, by digesting needful components present in biofluid. Each gross and subtle particle of body is [panchabhautika](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Panchabhautika&action=edit&redlink=1), but each one is having different proportion of [mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mahabhuta). Now the third phase of digestion is processed in seven micro channels (srotas) specified for seven body tissues ( [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)) for the formation of body tissues by their specific seven tissue transformers (dhatvagnis) Excreable waste products are carried out by three excreatory channels as feces, urine and sweat, along with sub tissues and sub excreta of sensory organs. Second part of this chapter explains the etiopathology of abnormal digestion, and formation of intermediate products as seed cause of various diseases in the form of ama, shukta and amavisha. Third part explicates the etiopathology, types, symptoms and treatments of grahanidosha as a syndrome of various digestive disorders. The chapter sums up in defining abnormal dietary habits. Keywords: Digestion in one of the most important chapters of this compendium because most of the diseases originate from disorders of digestion. This chapter is described after arsha roga (hemorrhoids) because pathophysiology of roga influences pandu roga. The initial portion of this chapter discusses the details of the physiological process of digestion and metabolism in human body. [Agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni), being the fundamental factor in maintaining health and in producing diseases, has been described in detail. The chapter begins with explanation of importance of normally functioning [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) and then goes on to explain the various aspects of digestion, metabolism and tissue nourishment. Different theories of tissue nourishment as explained by the commentators play a crucial role in the entire process. The concept of [upadhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Upadhatu&action=edit&redlink=1) and dhatumala has also been dealt with. These descriptions are followed by the pathophysiology of grahanidosha syndrome and its management. This chapter underscores that the knowledge of physiology is crucial in understanding the pathophysiology and therapeutics of a disease. Protection of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is very essential in treatment of all diseases.[Chakrapani,Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana ](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana)14/244-246 be paraspara [hetu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Hetu) which means one disease becomes cause for another disease[Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana ](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana)14/244] e.g. in patients with chronic colitis, intestinal polyps are seen, in patients suffering from diarrhea colitis is observed. Therefore, one finds interrelation between these disorders and as explained earlier, special precaution should be taken with respect to agni bala. Certain drugs like chitraka (Plumbago been used in combinations with other drugs for the treatment of arsha considering the concept of agnibala vriddhi and vata anulomanam (facilitating passage of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)) and the same drugs have been used in grahani chikitsa with the same concept. Charak explains that all the above three diseases are caused by agnimandya and if increase in [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is done then relief in the disease takes place. [Chakrapani Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 14/244-246] Further, [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) depends on [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata). Vatakshaya or prakopa results in agnimandya. anna, pana and aushadha which bring about vata anulomana are very useful in treatment of diseases like arsha and grahani dosha. Vata anulomanam means to facilitate the gati (motion) of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) downwards to anus. Among five types of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), samana and apana have major role in diseases like arsha, atisara and grahanidosha. Obstruction to movement of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) diarrhea (atisaraa) leads to is the cause for vibandha (constipation), malavibandha (obstruction to feces) along with pravahana (urge to defecate) which increases the intra-lumen pressure leading to incompetency of valves in rectal veins leading to their varicosity which causes hemorrhoids where as atisarana (diarrhea) causes increased motility of intestine. Hence vata anulomanam should not be understood as [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana) or laxation but regularization of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) gati so that there is no avarodha or atisarana. The same concept of vata mentioned in [Grahani Chikitsa].[Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 14/247] Therefore, the line of treatment used in arsha with regard to agni bala and vata anulomanam is basically similar to that of grahanidosha the name of chapter to [Grahani Chikitsa] i.e. treatment of the avayava grahani whereas he has increased the scope of chapter by using the word grahanidosha.[Chakrapani, Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 15/1]. There is always an inter-relationship avayava (organ) and avayavi (part of organ) or ashraya(seat) and ashrayi (seated). Either of the one has an impact on the other, hence if grahaniavayava is in normal state then [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) the avayavi functions normally and vice versa also holds true, whereas if dusti of grahani takes place agni vaishamyata (imbalance) is seen e.g. ileitis, wherein digestion is hampered. Grahani is the seat for jatharagni. [Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 15 (strength), [swasthya](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Swasthya) (enthusiasm), and [oja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Oja) (core energy). Prakrita [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) (normal digestive power) is essential for long and healthy life while, vitiated [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is responsible for roga avastha(disease).[Cha. Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 15/3-4] In this chapter, Charak describes formation of body tissues in detail with the role of [ahara](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ahara) which is supplied continuously to maintain homeostasis. Vyana vata [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) throughout body continuously and as per metabolic demand. This explanation shows that closed circulation in human was known to Charak. Grahani is prime place where digestion and absorption of ahara rasa takes place. Ahara rasa in individual, a common predisposing factor of psychiatric disorders for e.g. alpa sattva vataja grahanivyadhishanka (feeling disease) manifests in patients with alpa sattva. Homeostasis at cellular level and gross level is maintained by [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) in which digestive and metabolic contributions are due to [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). This chapter has been dedicated to [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) to understand the manner in which it gets vitiated by [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) and accordingly the line of treatment for the agni dosha is explained. As the functions of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) take place in grahani hence disease related to grahani has been given the name. Secondly, pandu roga is due to alpata Cha. Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 16/3-7] and, one of the main causes of this alpata is mal-digestion and mal-absorption which takes place in grahani. It is well known fact, that various contributory factors for blood formation have their absorption in gastrointestinal tract such as folic acid, vitamin B12, iron, etc which if not absorbed causes anemia this is the reason why Charak has placed this chapter in between arsha and pandu roga. Sanskrit expound the chapter \"Grahani Chikitsa\" (Management of diseases of digestion and metabolism). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2] Importance entities in the body that are responsible for digestion and metabolism) is the fundamental causative agent for longevity, normal complexion, normal strength, good health, motivation, normal growth, normal luster, normal [ojas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ojas), normal body temperature and various other forms of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Even the existence of an individual is said to be because of the individual dies; if the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) functions normally, the individual can lead a healthy and long life. Similarly, if the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) becomes abnormal, the individual suffers from various diseases; and hence, the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is said to be the root cause of health one consumes becomes capable of nourishing the body tissues and of promoting the [ojas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ojas) (vital essence), strength, complexion etc., only in the presence of normally functioning [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). In the absence of normal digestion (and metabolism), the normal body tissues such as [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) cannot be formed nor nourished [5] Process of digestion-first phase | |||| | by prana vata. The food disintegrates because of the liquids, and further it becomes soft because of the fatty substances. The samana vata, that has an inherent ability to intensify the agni, intensifies the digestive enzymes and properly digests the food that one consumes timely and in an appropriate quantity, thus leading to longevity. This process of digestion by [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) in the gut which leads to the formation of [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) and [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) is comparable to the process of cooking of the raw rice kept in an earthen vessel containing water on a fire [6-8] Three states of digestion and provoking [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) soon as the food that has all the six tastes is consumed, it undergoes the first stage of digestion known as madhura (sweet) state during which [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) is produced which is like froth. Afterwards, while the food undergoing digestion is in its partially digested form, it attains amla (sour) state. When the semi-digested food leaves the stomach, the release of liquid form of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) known as accha-pitta occurs. When the pakva part (the non-absorbable remnant part after the absorption of the nutrients), reaches the pakvashaya (the colon), the drying effect of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) converts it into a solid mass. There also occurs the release of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) which is katu (pungent) state [9-11] Second phase possesses pleasant smell (taste, appearance, consistency,) etc., nourishes the similar entities in the body such as the sensory organs of smell by gandha etc (e.g. taste, vision, touch etc senses by agneya, vayavya and are one of each [mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mahabhuta) transform/metabolize those components of the food that are homologous to them in their composition of structure of human organism. (such as parthiva, apya of entities in the body having specific attributes can be nourished by only those substances that belong to the same category having those same attributes. This means that parthiva entities in the body (one that is dominated by [prithvi mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Prithvi_mahabhuta) in its composition) can be nourished only by the parthiva substances in the food and so on. The same rule applies to the whole body [14] Third phase of digestion and metabolism at level components that sustain the body, known as [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) (tissues), are metabolized/transformed into two kinds of products known as sara (nutrition) and kitta (waste). This process is the function of seven specific entities known as dhatvagni; each dhatvagni is specific for its corresponding After [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa) the [medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Medas) is formed and then [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) is produced. After [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) the [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) is derived and then [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) is produced and finally fine [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) leads are derived after rasa. Kandara (tendon) and sira(vein) are derived after [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta). Vasa(muscle fat) and the six layers of tvacha (skin) are derived after [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa) (muscle) and snayu(ligament) are derived after [medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Medas) (adipose tissue) [17] [Mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) kitta (non-nutrient portion/waste portion/byproduct) [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta). Kha-mala (the wastes accumulated in the hollow structures of the body such as external ears and nostrils) are the kitta of [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa). Sweda (sweat) is the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) of [medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Medas). Kesha (hairs on the head) and loma (body hair) are the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) of [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi). The [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) of [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) is the oily excretion of the eye and the skin (sebum). Thus, the [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) continuously undergo two kinds of transformation: prasada (nutrient portion) and kitta (non-nutrient portion). This entire sequence of transformation and metabolism of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) is thus inter dependent [18-19\u00bd] promotes sexual vigor) nourishes the [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) immediately due to its specific the conversion of [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) up to [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) occurs in a span of six days and six nights. This process of transformation of nourishing portion of the digested food is continuous similar to rotating wheel [21] Note: Adulterated Verses: Verses from 22 to 35 are available in the text in bracket and Chakrapani has also not offered the commentary on these verses, hence these verses are considered as adulterated. ( | |||| | to the above explanation by his teacher, the student asked the following doubt: How is it that [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) is formed in the body out of [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa), though being different from it? [Rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) is in fact colorless, and how does it attain the red color of [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta)? How is it that a solid structure such as [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa) is formed out of [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) which is a fluid by its nature? How is it that, again, from the [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa), which is solid, a fluid substance such as [meda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda) is formed? How is it that a rough [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) is formed out of smooth structures such as [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa) and [meda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda)? How does the soft and fatty [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) form out of rough structures such as [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi)? If at all [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra), which is present everywhere in the body is formed out of [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) that is located inside the [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi), how does it come out as one cannot see pores on [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi)? [22-26] Formation of [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) and listening to the query raised by the student, the teacher replied as follows: The nourishment fluid formed, known as [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa), undergoes transformation by the ushma (heat) of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and gets converted into the red colored tissue known as [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) [27-28] action of heat along with the [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), ambu (water) and [tejas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Teja&action=edit&redlink=1), the [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) is converted into stable [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa), after being acted upon by its own [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) Because of the action of medo-dhatvagni on the excessively dominant snigdha attribute of abu, the [meda dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda_dhatu) is the aggregation of [prithvi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Prithvi), [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) and anila, roughness is attained during the formation of the [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) and after which, these hollow cavities get filled up by fatty tissue which is known as [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) [31] Formation The porosity in the [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) is produced because of the factors such as [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) and akasha. [Shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) comes out of [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) through these pores just as the water comes out of a new earthen vessel. Through the channels known as shukravaha srotamsi, this [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) spreads all over the body. This [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) is discharged through the urethra (which is connected to the urinary bladder) because of several factors such as sexual excitation, reflex activities (vega), and mental determination (samkalpa). Just as the ghee moves out with ease when heated, the [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) too, is discharged due to the heat liberated during the sexual activity. This process of seminal discharge is comparable with the movement of water from a place of lower altitude to a place of higher altitude) [32-35] Continuous circulation of [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) all over being forcefully propelled (out of the heart) by the action of vyana vata, the [rasa dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu) spreads all over the body simultaneously, continuously and for the entire life [36] Significance of Kha-Vaigunya (abnormality in body system) in due to abnormality in srotas, [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) readily produces disease in that very same location. This process is comparable with that of the clouds producing rainfall in a localized region that is favorable for rainfall [37] | dmapi caiva sydkadaprakpaam | doShANAmapi caivaM syAdekadeshaprakopaNam [13] This applicable even in case of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha), where ekadesha prakopa (abnormal increase at a local bhautikadhtvannapaktr karma bhitam||38|| iti physiological of bhutagni, dhatvagni as the King among all the forms of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). The intensification and diminution of all other forms of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is in fact dependent take utmost care to maintain the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) by providing fuel in the form of food and drinks which should be taken as per the rules mentioned, because life and strength of an individual depends on [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) [40] Initiation of If an individual indulges in food without following the rules and regulation of diet intake, then he quickly suffers from diseases caused by the vitiation of grahani because of his greedy habits. Such diseases are being described henceforth [41] Causes of vitiation of Excessive in food intake although there is indigestion, overeating, irregular habit of eating, eating unwholesome food, indulging in food which is heavy to digest or having excessive nutritional value, food which is having cold qualities or eating chilled or frozen items, food which is dry in nature or food which brings about emaciation, contaminated food, perversion of procedures like [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana), [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana) and sneha, emaciation of body due to disease, sudden migration to unsuitable place and of time and of season, suppression of natural urges are causes for vitiation of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Thus, vitiated [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is unable to digest even the light food. [42-43] This vitiated digestive agent forms an intermediate substance called ama, which turns sour (shukta) during fermentation and finally turns in poisonous substance (amavisha) [44] Signs and symptoms substance (amavisha) manifests clinical features like flatulence, uncomfortable physical and mental miseries, headache, altered consciousness, giddiness, stiffness of back and lumbar region, yawning, body-ache, malaise, morbid thirst, fever, vomiting, tenesmus, anorexia and indigestion and it is similar to antigenic poison. [45-46] | |||| morbid thirst, oral diseases, amlapitta (acid peptic disorders) and various other [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) related disorders. The same annavisha when gets associated with [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) it leads to condition like yakshma (pthiasis), peenas (coryza) and prameha (20 types of diabetes) and various other [kaphaja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) disorders, whereas several vatika disease are caused by association of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) with the annavisha. The annavisha when enters renal system, urine related disorders occur; similarly, kukshigata roga (ailments related to abdomen) have their origin when sakrita (feces) is involved. Rasadi pradoshaja vikara (tissue related ailments) occur when rasadi [47-49] Effects in digestion and therefore defective formation of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) takes place whereas, tikshanagni (excessive [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)) when associated with little quantity of fuel (in the form of food) causes depletion of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) (tissue elements) i.e. in balanced condition and correct diet regimen (as explained in [Cha.Sa.

The patient feels better on consuming the food but feels worn out along with blackouts when food is digested. Morbid thirst, dyspnea, burning sensation, fainting etc are observed in disease caused due to atyagni. Digestive power can be pacified by taking foods and drinks which are heavy to digest, unctuous, cold, sweet and liquid same way as fire is extinguishes by water in nature. The patient should be administered food at regular interval although previously eaten meal is undigested so that atyagni due to lack of fuel does not digest the tissues [220-222] Management of atyagni of rice and lentils), snigdha (unctuous), paiika (resembling flour paste), various jaggery products, meat of aquatic animals or marshy area especially fish which is mainly in smooth (not salty) and stable water and roasted meat of sheep may be given to pacify the atyagni with bee wax or ghrita should be given whenever patient feels hungry. Mantha prepared from wheat flour or venesection may be advised. Milk medicated with jeevaniya group of drugs along with sugar and ghrita may be given substances containing oil like tila (sesame seeds) with sugar and meat soup with ghee pacifies the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) [227] should take ghrita with beeswax along with cold water as anupana. Patient may take wheat flour with milk and ghee. Patient may be advised to take three sneha i.e. ghee, abinal fat, bone-marrow fortified with meat soup of animals residing in marshy areas. Milk mixed with wheat flour and curd along with three sneha (ghrita, vasa, majja) may be given. Bark of udumbara mixed with human milk and milk pudding prepared from udumbara and human milk helps in pacifying the atyagni may be advised for [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana) for alleviating the [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) followed by diet of milk pudding. Expert physician should follow the line of treatment after proper examination of patient [231] |||| in taste, fatty, increases [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) and heavy to digest should be given. All food items are good for atyagni and sleeping after meals during day time is beneficial in atyagni. Patient who takes fatty diet even though he is not hungry does not succumb to death. If he is suffering from atyagni on the other hand such diet pattern is nutritional. Whenever due to medication and diet, [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) is increased; it subdues [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) and normalizes the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). When [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) are in equilibrium anna gets digested resulting in increase in nutrition, longevity and strength [232-234] Improper dietary habits - Taking of wholesome and unwholesome foods together in diet is known as samashana. Vishamashana is defined as taking food either in excess quantity or very little quantity and also if taken before or after appropriate time. Adhyashana is having food even though previously eaten food is not yet digested. All the above three are causes for death or give rise to serious disorders [235-236] Variation in digestion as per day-night cycle morning eaten food is undigested and still if anyone takes evening food it may not be more vitiative since in day time all the srotas (channels) are dilated and heart is active similar to the lotus which blossoms with sunrise. During daytime, exercise, other physical and mental activities (cause heart to pump blood properly to) prevent the genesis of kleda (excess moisture) in various [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) [237-239] when mixed with fresh milk, the mixture does not get spoiled and will get uniformly mixed, so is the condition when in daytime previously eaten food although not digested still a person can digest another meal [240] | |||| night, the channels are closed, so is the heart which functions at slow rate as demand is less, the apakva ahara rasa increases in viscosity; thus ama adheres to the [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) and if another food is taken the indigestion causes more apakva ahara rasa causing disease. The condition resembles, wherein uncooked milk mixed with warm milk gets spoiled. Therefore, a wise person should not take meals if food taken at night is not digested; this will surely effect strength and life of a person [241-243] Summary - | |||| | |||| | conclude, this chapter has addressed the following points: - Qualities of antaragni, - Manner in which [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)does dharana (sustenance) of the body, - Manner in which food is digested, - How digested food functions? - How different types of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)does nutrition after digesting the fuel? - Development of [rasadi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)and their associated waste products after digestions at [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)level (tissue level) - How aphrodisiacs act instantly and time taken for the [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)formation and order of development? - Reason why diseases are located in one part of the body and role of antaragni in disease formation, - Diseases caused by abnormal [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) - Definition of grahani and sign and symptoms of grahani dosha, - Premonitory symptoms along with four types of grahani dosha their signs and symptoms with treatment as per various condition, - How condition of atyagni is generated and as part of [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) of Agnivesha Tantra supplemented by Dridhabala (15). Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) - Dehagni (all the entities in the body that are responsible for digestion and metabolism) is the fundamental causative agent for longevity, normal complexion, normal strength, good health, motivation, normal growth, normal luster, normal [ojas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ojas), normal body temperature and various other forms of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Even the existence of an individual is said to be because of dehagni (3). - When the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)stops functioning, the individual dies; if the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)functions normally, the individual can lead a healthy and long life. Similarly, if the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)becomes abnormal, the individual suffers from various diseases; and hence, the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)is said to be the root cause of health and longevity (4). - Normal functioning of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)is essential to make the consumed food capable of nourishing the body tissues and of promoting the [ojas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ojas)(vital essence), strength, complexion etc. In the absence of normal digestion (and metabolism), the normal body tissues such as [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa)cannot be formed nor nourished (5). [Vata dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata_dosha), specifically prana vata and samana vata play significant role in process of digestion and metabolism. - Three [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)are produced in three consequent stages of digestion after consumption of food. [Kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)is produced in first stage of madhura avasthapaka; pitta in second stage of amla avasthapaka and [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)is produced in third stage of katu avasthapaka. The site of production and time of production of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)is in sequence as the process of digestion proceeds. Increase or decrease in quantity of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)depends upon similarity or dis-similarity of basic composition of food consumed. - The first phase of digestion is carried out by jatharagni, second phase by bhutagni and third phase by dhatvagni. These are different levels of action of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)where various digestive and metabolic processes take place. - During the processing by dhatvagni, stanya (breast milk) and the menstrual blood are derived after [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa). Kandara (tendon) and sira(vein) are derived after [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta). Vasa(fat) and the six layers of tvacha (skin) are derived after [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa)(muscle) and snayu(ligament) are derived after [medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda)(adipose tissue) (17). - The feces and the urine are the kitta (non-nutrient portion/waste portion/byproduct) is the kitta of [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta). Kha-mala (the wastes accumulated in the hollow structures of the body such as external ears and nostrils) are the kitta of [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa). Sweda (sweat) is the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala)of [medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Medas). Kesha (hairs on the head) and loma (body hair) are the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala)of [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi). The [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala)of [majja]] is the oily excretion of the eye and the skin (sebum). Thus, the [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)continuously undergo two kinds of transformation: prasada (nutrient portion) and kitta (non-nutrient portion). This entire sequence of transformation and metabolism of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)is thus inter dependent (18-19\u00bd ). - Disorders of various factors mentioned above shall be treated after considering the original [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)from which the factor is derived. - Vyana vata forcefully propels the [rasa dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu)out of the heart and spreads it all over the body simultaneously, continuously and for the entire life (36). - Disease is produced only at the site of abnormality of body systems. - Life and strength of an individual depends on [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)hence one should take utmost care to maintain the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)by providing fuel in the form of food and drinks which should be taken as per the rules mentioned. (40) - If the rules of diet and dietary habits are not followed due to greed, then disease of grahani occurs. - The anna-visha (toxins) produced due to improper digestion and metabolism causes diseases at the sites of affliction. - The vishamagni (improper [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)) causes irregularity in digestion and therefore defective formation of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)takes place. Whereas, teekshnagni (excessive [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)) when associated with little quantity of fuel (in the form of food) causes depletion of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)(tissue elements) (50). - The digestive disorder of grahani can lead to secondary disorders related with other body systems along with digestive system. - Grahani disease is classified into four types viz [vataja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pittaja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta), [kaphaja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)and sannipataja depending upon the dominance of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)and on the basis of the classification, etiological factors, symptoms and signs are varied. - When the [doshas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)are located in grahani and are associated with incomplete digested food then [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana)(emetic therapy) is advised. - If the ama is in pakvashaya and in anutklishta (stuck, not ready to come out) condition, then stravana (increasing secretion) with [deepana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Deepana)dravyas should be administered. - If ama gets absorbed along with [rasa dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu)and if it pervades throughout the body then [langhana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Langhana)and [pachana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pachana)should be advised. - Various purification procedures are advised as per the state of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha)aggravation and site of affliction in disease. Ghee processed with digestive stimulant drugs,sour media like buttermilk is advised. - Patient should be evaluated for amadosha whether samata or niramta is present or not and then appropriately treated with [pachana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pachana)etc. treatment (95). - Buttermilk due to its [deepana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Deepana), grahi (substances which increases appetite and digestive power and absorb fluid from the stool) and easy to digest actions is very useful in grahanidosha. [Vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)dominant grahani shall be treated with [basti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Basti), [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana)and unctuous preparations. - If [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)is dominant in its own place then [virechana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Virechana)or [vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana)should be administered for removal of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)(122). - rasa shall be [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)(digestive power) (141). - In tridoshaja grahani, [Panchakarma](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Panchakarma)should be carried out as per predominance of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha). Various ghee, kshara, asava and arishta preparation useful in stimulation of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)should be administered. - Sneha is the best among the [deepana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Deepana)dravya which helps in stimulating the inefficient [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni)(201) - Fasting or over eating doesn't stimulate [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Proper intake of sneha, followed by eating proper food preparations as well as appropriate use of various churna, arishta, sura and asava along with proper medication as per condition, enhances the power of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). - Atyagni is caused by diminished [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), aggravated [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)and associated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata). This leads to emaciation if proper food is not consumed. Excessively increased digestive power can be pacified by taking foods and drinks which are heavy to digest, unctuous, cold, sweet and liquid. - Samashana is taking wholesome and unwholesome foods together in diet. Vishamashana is taking food either in excess quantity or very little quantity and also if taken before or after appropriate time. Adhyashana is having food even though previously eaten food is not yet digested. All the above three are causes for death or give rise to serious disorders (235-236). - If morning eaten food is undigested and still if anyone takes evening food, it may not be more vitiative since in day time all the srotas (channels) are dilated and heart is active similar to the lotus which blossoms with sunrise. During daytime, exercise, other physical and mental activities (cause heart to pump blood properly to) prevent the genesis of kleda (excess moisture) in various [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu). In the night, the channels are closed, so is the heart which functions at slow rate as demand is less, the apakva ahara rasa increases in viscosity; thus ama adheres to the [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu)and if another food is taken in the morning the indigestion causes more apakva ahara rasa causing disease. Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences ) Importance of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) The functions of gut are vital for maintenance and preservation of health. Grahani is the seat of jatharagni, which is the initiator of digestive process and strengthens the other 12 agnis. Jatharagni transforms food into biological substance (ahara rasa) trifurcated into madhura, amla and katu avastha paka which into three biological energies [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) respectively. From the physiological point of view, the jatharagni or the active form of pachaka pitta is responsible for the digestion of all kinds of foods in the gut. Therefore, this should include all amylolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes secreted by various kinds of exocrine glands in the gut, which actually cause digestion, i.e., breaking down of different macromolecules into their constituent units. There are five bhutagnis and their function is to metabolize panchabhautic components of the food that are homologous to them in their composition. For instance, bhauma agni acts on the component that is bhauma or parthiva in its composition. Bhutagnis act on the products of digestion (jatharagni paka), hence, must be acting after the absorption of the nutrients, but before the action of dhatvagni. The major site where the absorbed nutrients undergo biochemical transformation is in the liver, which plays an important role in metabolism, wherein several processes such as trans-amination, de-amination, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis etc. take place. Therefore, the overall intermediary metabolism (involving fats, carbohydrates and proteins) can be understood as the functioning of the bhutagni. Dhatvagni acts at tissue-level (in fact, at cellular level) upon the products of bhutagni paka and are responsible for the building of the respective [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu). In other words, the bio-energetic processes of a cell seem to be under the regulation of dhatvagni. For instance, the common product of intermediary metabolism (involving fats, carbohydrates and proteins) is Acetyl-Co-A, which enters into Kreb's cycle in the mitochondria of a cell. This is followed by electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. [[1]](#cite_note-1) It is interesting to note that the Kreb's cycle is also known as the 'final common pathway' in the process of catabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. However, for the entry of amino acids, glucose and fatty acids into the cell, certain other factors such as hormones too are needed. For instance, insulin promotes the transportation of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids into the cell. Therefore, all these hormones (such as insulin, growth hormone, thyroid hormones, testosterone etc.) that promote the transportation of various nutrients into the cells, along with the enzymes participating in the Kreb's cycle are to be included under the term dhatvagni. Thus, the three major stages of the catabolism (involving fats, carbohydrates and proteins) i.e. digestion, intermediary metabolism and Kreb's cycle - seem to represent the three sets of agnis, viz., jatharagni, bhutagni and dhatvagni part from ahara rasa. Nutritive part is circulated to entire body after absorption through rasayini (villi) by vyana vayu. Waste part is excreted as feces, urine and sweat through their excretory channels by apana vata. Absorbed nutritive substances circulate all over the body through seven specific micro channels of each of the seven [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu). Dhatvagni Each [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) has its own transforming [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) and srotas. Srotas or micro channels have two functions of carrying and transforming the tissues with the help of their specific dhatvagni. Five bhutagnis, one for each [mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mahabhuta), transform five bhautic elements into the body tissues and organs. Seven dhatvagni or tissue transformers, form the tissue elements of seven [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) by their needed nutrients. After formation of [[dhatu], the microchannels permeates them into the organs for functioning. During this transformation process, upadhatu or subtissues and dhatumala or waste products are formed. Updhatus of [rasa dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa_dhatu) is breast milk; menstrual blood is upadhatu of [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta); tendons and six layers of skin are upadhatu of [mamsa dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa_dhatu) etc. Apart from digestion, the gut performs various other significant functions as well. The gut has its own protective mechanism in the form of gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which prevents the entry of pathogens into the bloodstream. The micro-biota in the gut serves vital functions related to various aspects of health. The enteric nervous system of the gut has its own functional significance and has been proven to be very closely associated with the central nervous system functions. The gut secretes several hormone-like substances that are helpful in regulating long-term energy balance. All the factors mentioned are either directly or indirectly dependent on these functional domains of the gut. [[2]](#cite_note-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3) Other forms of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) in this context are indicative of bhutagni and dhatvagni, which in turn, are functionally dependent on jatharagni. Prana in this context may stand for all types of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) as well. Three stages of digestion There are three stages of digestion in the gut. The first stage (madhura) takes place in the upper gastro-intestinal tract, i.e., inside the esophagus and stomach; the second stage (amla) takes place in the middle portion of the gut, i.e., in the small intestine; and the last stage (katu) takes place in the colon. The froth-like [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) seems to be the thick mucus that covers the entire stomach, providing a protective coating that prevents the gastric mucosa being digested and damaged due to the acid-pepsin mixture. Accha [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) is 'liquid' in nature, released in duodenum and can be correlated with bile. Pachaka pitta has the functional site between amashaya (stomach) and pakvashaya (colon), which is indicative of small intestine. It is composed of five [mahabhutas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mahabhuta) but the [agni mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni_mahabhuta) is predominant; and hence, it becomes devoid of fluidity and therefore is also known as [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). It splits the food into sra (nutritive) and kitta (non-nutritive) portions. [[4]](#cite_note-4) Sara of the food is the minutest fraction (parama sukshma). This portion reaches the heart in the form of ahara rasa. From the heart, it then gets re-distributed into 24 pulsatile vessels to be carried into the whole body. [[5]](#cite_note-5) The portion that reaches the colon is the one that is designated as kitta. During the third stage of digestion, there occurs the solidification of fecal matter and formation of certain pungent gases such as ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide etc. The term pakva in this context indicates pakva mala; not pakva [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) and [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) are the seven fundamental entities that sustain the human body. These can be called 'tissues' for the sake of convenience, though some of them are not tissues in a strict sense. It will be pertinent to look into these individual entities at this stage to understand what they really are in terms of anatomy. [[6]](#cite_note-6) [Rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa): A colorless fluid that gets ejected out of the heart and nourishes the entire body. [Rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta): The red colored fraction that is formed in liver and spleen after the action of ranjaka pitta on [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa). It is essential for life and its function is to supply the life principle (jeeva). [Rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) and [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) together form what is generally known as blood: [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta) being the red fraction (red blood corpuscles) and [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) being the colorless fluid (plasma). [Mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa): The correct translation of this term would be 'flesh'. Flesh generally means all kinds of muscles and also the parenchyma of the different viscera such as thyroid, liver, spleen, kidneys etc. [Medas](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Medas): This generally stands for fatty tissue, however, it is to be noted that it is of two types: Baddha (bound, stable, fixed, stored) and abaddha (free, unbound). The baddha form, therefore, must include the stored fat in the form of adipose tissue; and the abaddha form must include the circulating lipids such as cholesterol, LDL, HDL etc. [Asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi): Though the term [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) generally stands for bony tissue, it may in some contexts, include all such relatively hard structures that resist easy decaying, viz., teeth, nails and hair. [Majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja): Generally, the substance that fills all the bony cavities is called [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja). However, the brain substance that fills the cranial cavity too, must be included in [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja). Therefore, [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) of two (cranial). [Shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra): The term [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) has been described to be of two forms in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) textbooks: - The one that is ejaculated during the process of mating, which is responsible for fertilization of ovum and thus embryogenesis. - The one that is formed from [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja)(the tissue that fills the bony cavities) which in turn circulates all over the body both in males and females. Reproduction is the function of this second form of [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra)too. Therefore, on careful examination, it seems that the first form of [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra)stands for the semen in general and for sperms in particular; and, the second form of [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra)stands for hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis of hormones that circulate all over the body. The process of nourishment of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) The process of nourishment of [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) is explained by three analogies: Ksheera-dadhi (milk curdling analogy), khalekapota (analogy of pigeons picking up the choicest grains) and kedari-kulya (irrigation analogy). Ksheera-dadhi nyaya (milk curdling analogy) According to this analogy, the nourishment of a [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) takes place according to the rule of conversion (of one substance into another). Just as the milk is converted into different forms (from milk to curd, curd to butter, butter to ghee) successively, the preceding [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) too is converted into the next one. The sequence of this conversion is as follows: [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa), [rakta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rakta), [mamsa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mamsa), [meda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda), [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi), [majja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Majja) and [shukra](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shukra) in the same order. The transformation of various substances that takes place due to various biochemical reactions could be one way of understanding this analogy. For instance, the process of glycolysis involves different enzymes acting on different substrates at different steps and converting them from one to another. The ability of one kind of stem cell derived from one tissue in giving rise to different forms of cell types of different tissues is known. The response of mesenchymal stem cells to certain stimuli such as hypoxia in the form of migration and tissue regeneration is also known, which can further support this analogy. Khalekapota nyaya (analogy of pigeons picking up the choicest grains) According to this analogy, the nourishment of different [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) takes place according to the rule of selectivity. Just as the pigeons coming from far off places, picking up the grains of their choice from the granary (a storehouse for thrashed grain, khala) and flying back to their destination, the different [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) too, pick up the required nourishment from the common nutrient pool known as [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa). The [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) that is situated nearer to [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) is nourished first and the remaining later, just as the pigeon from a nearer place gets a chance to pick up grains quickly in the given analogy. In this analogy, the choice that the pigeons have in picking up the grain (selectivity) and the energy they spend in the process of obtaining grains (actively) are the vital features. The tissue metabolism can influence the extent of vasodilatation and thus its own perfusion. This is known as auto-regulation of blood supply. Similarly, the specific kind of tissue has affinity for specific nutrient and other substances. For example, the calcium gets deposited normally in bones, but not in the mucous membranes. Similarly, vitamin B-12 is stored in liver and not in other tissues. Kedari-kulya nyaya (analogy of irrigation) According to this analogy, the nourishment of [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) takes place according to the rule of irrigation. Just as the kulyas (small canals / trenches / channels) receive water from the kedarika (the bigger water reservoir) and then irrigate the nearest field first, the [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) too, nourishes the [dhatus](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu) in a sequential fashion depending on the location of the [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu). The anatomical location of a cell in the body can influence the amount of perfusion it receives. For instance, the apical regions of the lungs are less perfused than the other areas of the lung, and hence, are susceptible to be affected in some infectious conditions such as tuberculosis. Similarly, the hepatocytes that surround the central vein in a hepatic lobule are more susceptible to hypoxic injury than those situated in the periphery. Sub-endocardial region of the heart is, in the same manner, is more susceptible to ischemia than the epicardial region. Another important feature to be noted in this analogy is the passive flow of water from higher altitude to lower altitude, where no external energy is spent. This is in contrast to the pigeons expending their energy to pick up the grains of their choice actively. It is interesting to note the process of transportation of substances across the cell membrane, which has been divided into two major types: active transport and passive transport (Verse-16). Bilirubin is a metabolic byproduct of heme portion of the hemoglobin. This is secreted into bile juice in the liver which is in turn released during the process of digestion. Features of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) vriddhi therefore, are yellowish discoloration of sclera, skin, urine and feces. Mucous is rich in water that is derived from extracellular fluid while it is being formed. The cerumen, sebum, and other similar external secretions perform some functions such as providing a waxy protective layer. Sweat and urine share similarities in function as well as composition. Therefore, vrikka mentioned as the site of origin of medavaha srotas makes sense when one considers sweda as the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) of [meda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Meda). Hair and bones share similarity when it comes to the power to resist easy biodegradation. They also grow weaker in old age. Therefore, hair are the [mala](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Mala) of [asthi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Asthi) (Verse 19). Circulating provoked [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) settles in a tissue whose channels are defective (kha-vaigunya) and perfuce the lesion. This pathogenesis has been compared with rain production. The obstruction to the moving [rasa](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Rasa) by the abnormality of srotas, results in causation of disease, just as the obstruction to the cloud laden monsoon winds by the tall mountains results in the causation of rainfall (Verse 37). Causes of grahani disorder Abhojana (starvation) leads to increase in [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) and in turn agnimandya.[Cha. Sa. [Vimana Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vimana_Sthana) 2/7] Starvation and protein malnutrition disrupts normal indigenous gastrointestinal tract micro-flora and impairs host antibacterial defenses. Both starvation and protein malnutrition increases the cecal levels of gram negative enteric bacilli and decrease the level of lactobacillus and promote growth of anaerobes that in turn disturb the gut flora. Gut flora also known as gut microbiome has a unique role in digestion and absorption. Once the gut microbiome gets vitiated it leads to indigestion and malabsorption. Atibhojana (excessive intake) causes provocation of all the [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) and thereby causing agnimandya. Protein rich diet or fat laden diet or excessive diet takes longer time for emptying of stomach. Longer stay of food explains increase of acidic pH. Therefore, whenever such chyme enters the duodenum the liver and pancreas need to increase secretion of alkali pH. Repeated, such dietary habits lead to indigestion. Further increase of alkali pH causes reduced transit time in small intestine leading to the symptoms like diarrhea. Diet which is atiguru (heavy) and indulging vishamashana( irregular food habit) will have similar effect. Atiruksha ahara or diet has low protein value. Protein malnutrition leads to decrease of enzyme secretion as proteins are the building blocks of enzymes. Asatmya desha, kala, ritu only explain the dietary changes which dramatically alter the balance of bacteria in the gut on daily basis. Research shows that these fluctuations could lead to various digestive and absorptive problems. Dushita bhojana or contaminated food reacts directly with intestinal flora disturbing their quantitative and qualitative growth causing indigestion. Intake of unctuous substances in sama [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) condition leads to grahani Cha. Sa. [Sutra Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) 13/76] Emaciation due to disease also has its own impact on digestion. Mandagni is a causative factor for all diseases but if patient continuously indulges in apathya then complications may increase or the prognosis turns bad. Suppression of manifested natural urges may have impact on nervous system resulting in effect either on enzymatic secretion or on the hormonal secretion. These factors have role in digestion and absorption as may be understood in case of adhovata (accumulation of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) in rectum and pelvic region) and [purisha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Purisha) vegadharana (suppression of urge of defecation), wherein regular urge suppression disturbs the intestinal pro-kinetic movement.[Cha. Sa. [Sutra Sthana ](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) 7/ 6,8,12] Disturbed pro-kinesia increases the transit time leading to the change in pH which further has its impact on electrolytes and enzymatic secretion leading to reduced digestive power (agnimandya). Further kshudha vegadharana (avoiding sense of hunger) effect will be similar to abhojana (not eating). It may also be noted that repeated kshudha vegadharana leads to atrophy of the stomach which further weakens the perception of hunger which is controlled by the percentage of the stomach that remains empty similar to the explanation given by Charak that excessive fasting leads to diminution in [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni).[Cha.Sa. [Sutra Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) 22/37] Trishna vegadharana (avoiding thirst) leads to reduced fluid balance in the body. Nearly seven liters of water is secreted during various gastrointestinal secretions. Reduced water intake in long term will reduce gastrointestinal secretion leading to impaired digestion. Abnormal digestion is from faulty food habits and unwholesome diet, that causes jatharagni dushti or vitiation of digestive power. The improperly digested food turns into toxic substance called aamavisha, basic cause of most diseases. If amavisha associates with any balanced [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) or healthy [dhatu](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dhatu), they turn pathogenic. Grahanidosha is an important example of amavisha and agnidushti. Grahanidosha is of four types. It starts with inflammation of elementary canal at different places and is called by different names e.g gastritis, duodenitis and colitis. In the second stage erosions and ulcers develop. In third stage mental symptoms like anxiety, illusions, fear, and IBS like symptoms. Fourth stage is sannipatic with clinical features resembling ulcerative colitis. Treatment of grahanidosha is to enhance jatharagni, bhutagni and dhatvagni which encompasses the whole digestive process. Food and drinks are also medicated depending upon the patient and the stage of disease, for extended period of time. Effect on immunity Prayatna (effort), urja (energy) and bala (strength) are the role played by [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) in building up of immunity. When the [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) gets vitiated prayatna, urja and bala are hampered leading to suppression of immunity. Exogenous and endogenous factors vitiate the [doha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Do%E1%B9%A3ha&action=edit&redlink=1) which when associated with ama produce either local or systemic disorders. Tridosha play role in impairing immunity and depending on the dominance of a particular [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) they are classified as [vataja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) or samagni. Digestive enzyme by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve supply. Samagni may be compared with balanced state of sympathetic/ parasympathetic activity which explains the role of balanced or samana vata. It may also be noted that prana vata and apana vata also have impact on balancing the normal status of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Acidic and alkaline pH of digestive secretions explains the balanced [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta). Modern science explains specific range of pH of digestive secretions e.g. pancreatic juice has pH in range of 7.1 - 8.2 that buffers acidic gastric juice in chyme, stops the action of pepsin from the stomach and creates proper pH for action of digestive enzymes in small intestine. Specific pH of gastric juice is essential to convert pepsinogen into pepsin, an active form of proteolytic enzyme thus improper pH will cause variation in digestion. Mucosal resistance explains role of [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) in maintaining samagni. Intact mucosal lining is present in stomach and small intestine. Breach in mucosal lining causes gastritis, burning sensation etc whereas increased size of mucosal cells alters the pH thereby a balanced [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) plays essential role in samagni. Role of prostaglandins to maintain gastric mucosal resistance to prevent the action of HCl in gastric mucosa is to be considered as part of kledaka kapha as sodium bicarbonate and mucus is secreted by Drugs which inhibit prostaglandins e.g. aspirin, impairs gastric mucosal barriers leading to gastritis, duodenitis and peptic Clinical Arochaka (aversion vairasya (distaste), praseka (excessive salivation) are general gastrointestinal manifestations of indigestion. Tamaka or blackout occurs due to nutritional deficiency. Mal-absorption causes diarrhea which leads to decrease in circulating liquid, a cause of hypo-tension a reason for blackout. Impaired absorption of iron, folate, vit. B12 leads to anemia which may be the cause for blackout (tamakanvitah). Resulting anemia and electrolyte depletion (particularly K+) leads to weakness. - Peripheral neuropathy due to Vit. B12 and thiamine deficiency - Dermatitis due to deficiency of Vit. A, Zinc and essential fatty acid - Night Blindness/Xeropthalmia due to Vit A mal-absorption. - Bleeding due to Vit K malabsorption and hypo prothrombinemia - Anemia impaired absorption of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 - Amenorrhea, decreased libido due to protein depletion decreased calories and secondary hypo-pituitarism. - Tetany, paresthesia due to calcium and magnesium mal-absorption - Glossitis, stomatitis due to deficiency of iron, Vit B12, folate and Vit A (Verse 52-54). Spices are basically a combination of acids. When too much of these acids are introduced in gastrointestinal tract which has its own acidic contents it starts damaging the mucosal lining of walls of gastrointestinal tract. It also reduces the pH thus activation of enzyme is hampered leading to indigestion. Etiological factors as mentioned in the text have impact mainly on the neural stimulation of digestive secretions affecting the flow of gastrointestinal secretions into the gastrointestinal tract thereby hampering the digestion. Hence it is explained that aggravated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) encompasses the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni). Altered canalicular functions hampers digestion, easily understood in primary biliary cirrhosis wherein biliary secretion is restricted. Atrophy of reduces HCl secretion causing indigestion. The gastric gland contains three types of exocrine gland cells that secrete their products into stomach lumen.Srotasam kharatvam (hardness in channels) quality of tikta rasa destroys the exocrine gland cell reducing their secretions. Gastric glands include a type of enteroendocrine cell, the G cell which is located mainly in the pyloric antrum and secretes the hormone gastrin into the blood stream which stimulates parietal cells to secrete HCl and chief cells to secrete pepsinogen, it also contracts the lower esophageal sphincter, increases motility of the stomach and relaxes pyloric sphincter. G cells when get destroyed the above action of [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha), in turn, [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) is hampered so also contraction and relaxation karma of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) is vitiated. Further kashaya rasa reduces peristaltic movements called as mixing waves which reduces the maceration and mixing of food with secretions of gastric glands, thus improper chyme is formed. Deficiency of gastrointestinal secretions due to damage to the glands or canaliculi or intestine may be mostly considered as having [vataja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) origin. Loss of pravartana karma is to be understood where the transport of secretions is hampered (except in obstructive pathology where [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) to be considered). Hartnup's syndrome a defect in neutral amino acid transport and cystinuria a defect in dibasic amino acid transport explain the rare genetic disorders (Bija Dusti) involved in protein digestion absorption. Further due to [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) prakopa, intestinal activity is increased which is manifested as malabsorption. For e.g. lactose intolerance is related to rate of gastric emptying. Symptoms are more likely when gastric emptying is rapid than when gastric emptying is slower. Therefore it is more likely that skim milk will be associated with symptoms of lactose intolerance than with whole milk as rate of gastric emptying is more rapid in skim milk. Milk proteins, particularly caseins have appropriate amino acids composition for growth and development of young. Caseins are highly digestible in intestine and high quality source of amino acids. Most of whey proteins are relatively less digestible in intestine, although all of them are digested to some degree. When substantial whey proteins are not digested fully, some of intact protein may stimulate a localized intestinal or systemic immune response this is due to beta lactoglobullin referred to milk protein allergy. Similarly, diarrhea observed following subtotal gastrectomy is often a result of lactose intolerance as gastric emptying is accelerated in patients with gastrojejunostomy, rapid small intestinal transit time develops symptoms of lactose intolerance. Kanthasya-shosah (dryness of mouth also known as xerostomia) occurs due to diminish salivary gland secretion. Primary cause being fluid loss through diarrhea secondarily it may be association of Sjogren's syndrome with autoimmune disease like primary biliary cirrhosis ~ a secondary Sjogrens syndrome. In this syndrome involvement of other exocrine glands occur leading to diminished secretion of exocrine glands of the gastrointestinal tract, atrophic gastritis and subclinical pancreatitis. Increased appetite (Kshudha) is seen because of a negative feedback due to malabsorption or it may be understood under rasasheshajeerna. Trishna is manifested due to increased ruksha [guna](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Guna) of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) and decreased jaladi ansha due to diarrhea and low fluid intake. Timira (blurred vision) results from vitamin A malabsorption and anemia. Tinnitus is a symptom also found in Pandu (anemia)[Cha. Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 15/61], which is observed due to malabsorption of essential elements like vitamin B12. Pain in flanks, thigh, pelvis, cervical area occurs due to calcium and Vitamin D malabsorption. Pain is also contributed by protein deficiency due to low nutritional diet, osteoporosis, anemia and decrease lactic acid neutralization due to reduce peripheral circulation. Whipple's disease is chronic multisystem disease associated with diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, arthralgia and CNS and cardiac problems caused due to tropheryma whipple. Hritpeedha is chest discomfort or chest pain which may be resultant of anemia but most probably due to gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Malabsorption may be for single entity or for various minerals and vitamins and may lead to emaciation and weakness. Vairasyam (distaste) is probably because of taste projections to the hypothalamus and limbic system, there is a strong link between the taste and pleasant and unpleasant emotions. Parikartika (cutting pain) is due to shushka-mala pravritti (pellet stools) which causes pressure and rupture of anal-mucosal lining that may lead to cutting pain. Craving for all types of food (griddhih sarvarasanam) is seen due to malabsorption of various elements, mineral and vitamins causing deficiency of the essential requirements of elements. The negative feedback system creates the craving for essential elements which is presented in the form of craving for all six rasa. Rasa should be understood for food which will fulfill the requirements. Mood disorders are observed due to depletion of essential vitamins, mineral and other elements. Electrolyte difference creates confusion which may be the cause for mano avasada. Bloating of abdomen is manifested while digestion is in process or after digestion is completed because of indigestion that causes abnormal growth of gut microbiome. Bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates leads to flatus. Carbohydrates metabolism occurs in small and large intestine therefore the symptom occurs during Jeerne jeeryati chadhmanam i.e. during and after the process of digestion. Once the patient takes food, circulation towards stomach is increased and digestive activity in the colon is reduced thus carbohydrate metabolism is depressed reducing the formation of flatus in rectum thereby reducing the bloating of abdomen. Patient doubts as if he may be suffering from following of the disorders like vatavikara, gulma, hridroga and pleeha. Due to formation of flatus and later on bloating of abdomen makes the patient feel he is suffering from vatika disorders related to gastrointestinal tract. Especially gulma since the patient feels the movement of flatus, so doubts about gulma. Ushna and teekshna [guna](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Guna) of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) trigger inflammatory response by irritating the intestinal mucosa. Indigestion causes depletion of beneficial gut bacteria thus breakdown in the balance between the putative protective and harmful intestinal bacteria leads to chronic inflammation. Antigenic nature of endogenous factors can be understood when helpful bacteria and ushna, teekshna [guna](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Guna) of [pitta dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta_dosha) trigger inflammatory response leading to autoimmune pathogenesis. In case of hypersecretion of gastrin in gastrinoma (Zollingers - Ellison Syndrome) stimulate the parietal cells of the stomach to secrete acid to their maximal capacity and increase the parietal cell mass three to six fold. The acid output may be so great that it reaches the upper small intestine reducing the luminal pH to two or less. Pancreatic lipase is inactivated and bile acids are precipitated. It results in diarrhea and steatorrhea. Subtotal villous atrophy occurs due to Excessive gastrointestinal secretions cause derangement in fluid and electrolyte transport across the entero-colonic mucosa leading to diarrhea. They are characterized clinically by watery, large volume fecal outputs that are typically painless and persist with fasting because there is no malabsorbed solute; stool osmolalirity is accounted for normal endogenous electrolytes with no fecal osmotic gap. Other than excessive secretion, condition like ileal dysfunction caused by either Crohn's disease or surgical resection results in a decrease in bile acid re absorption in the ileum and an increase in the delivery of bile acids to the large intestine. The resultant is a diarrhea with or without steatorrhea. It becomes a cause for mal-absorption syndrome. Inflammatory Bowel Disease needs consideration in [pittaja](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) grahani. Exogenous factors trigger inflammatory response that the mucosal immune system may fail to control. With mild inflammation the mucosa is erythematous and in severe condition the mucosa becomes hemorrhagic, edematous and ulcerated (Verse 65). Loose motions (Drava Mala Pravritti) are mainly due to excessive juice (Drava [guna](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Guna) of [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)). Excessive secretion may be due excessive formation in liver or decrease absorption in the intestine. Bile acids are not present in the diet but are synthesized in the liver by a series of enzymatic steps that also include cholesterol catabolism. Bile acids are either primary or secondary. Primary bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and secondary bile acids are synthesized from primary bile acids in the intestine by colonic bacterial enzymes. Bile acids are primarily absorbed by active, sodium dependent process that is located exclusively in the ileum; secondly bile acids can also be absorbed to a lesser extent by non carrier mediated transport processes in the jejunum, ileum and colon. Conjugated bile acids that enter the are de-conjugated by colonic bacterial enzyme to unconjugated bile acids and are rapidly absorbed. Colonic bacterial enzymes also dehydroxylate bile acids to secondary bile acids, thus if exogenous factors like diet as discussed above disturb the colonic bacterial growth than bile acids are not absorbed. A decrease in the amount of bile acids returning to the liver from the intestine is associated with an increase in bile acids synthesis/cholesterol catabolism, which helps keep bile acid pool size relatively constant. Defects in any of the steps of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids can result in decrease in duodenal concentration of conjugated bile acids as a result steatorrhea. Thus steatorrhea can be caused by abnormalities in bile acid synthesis and excretion, their physical state in the intestinal lumen and reabsorption. The bile gives the yellowish nature to the stools (Verse 66). Guru, snigdha and seeta ahara is dominated by [prithvi](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Prithvi) and [jala mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Jala_mahabhuta), these qualities help in reducing the impact of [agni mahabhuta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni_mahabhuta) thus causing jatharagni mandyata resulting in indigestion leading to formation ama. Such ama is responsible for [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) prakopa. adhyashana(over eating) are source for extra calories. Fast foods are defined as any food that contributes little or no nutrient values to the diet, but instead provides excess calories and fat. Common foods include salted snack foods, gum, sweet desserts, fried fast foods, carbonated beverages and candy. Diets rich in trans-fatty acids like deep fried fast food, cake mixes, chips and packed cookies, all have inclusion in guru, pishtanna, vishtambi(causing obstruction) ahara. People consuming snigdha ahara (fatty food) and have sedentary lifestyle with very little energy expenditure, and most fat is stored. The above two concepts explain why agnimandya and ajeerna have been mentioned after taking heavy food. Excessive heavy food (guru ahara) slows down emptying of stomach (samana vata karma is hampered) and enzymes are not secreted into lumen (pitta action hampered) causing agnimandya. reducing [stambhana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Stambhana)) of juices thus hampering lipase activity therefore leading to steatorrhea. Further heavy meals increase the transit time causing functional stasis which may cause bacterial overgrowth syndrome. Sleeping just after meals may also lead to functional stasis (further study required). Peristalses are also reduced with heavy meals and sleeping after meals causes bacterial overgrowth. Bacteria deconjugate conjugated bile acids and as a result intraduodenal concentration of bile acids will be reduced resulting in steatorrhoea and macrocytic anemia. Bacterial overgrowth also occurs with stasis from a blind loop, small bowel diverticulum or dysmotility. Postmucosal lymphatic obstruction- The pathophysiology of this condition which is due to the rare congenital intestinal lymphangectasia or due to acquired lymphatic obstruction secondary to trauma, tumor or infections, leads to the unique constellation of fat malabsorption with enteric loss of protein (often causing edema) and lymphocytopenia. Carbohydrates and amino acid absorption are preserved (Verse 67). Nausea and vomiting are both caused by stimulation at one of the four sites: the gastrointestinal tract, the vestibular system, the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the cerebral cortex. Nausea and vomiting occurs due to disturbed gastric motility caused by heavy meal and delayed gastric emptying. The same is the cause for heavy abdomen and eructation with foul smell and sweet taste. As the food stays for long time in gastrointestinal tract blood flow increases centrally and reduces the enthusiasm and decrease in libido. The sluggish activity of gastrointestinal tract causes symptoms such as absence of movement in the abdomen (udaram stimitam guru). The heavy abdomen puts pressure on the diaphragm causing symptoms of heaviness in chest (hridayam manyate styanam). increased stool is not observed instead bhinnamashleshma-samsrishta varcha(loose stools with ama and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)) is seen; which is also cause for heaviness of stools (guru-varchah-pravartanam) Due to diet pattern and sedentary lifestyle there is accumulation of fat (obesity) but due to decrease protein absorption and malabsorption of essential elements patient feels weakness and laziness without weight loss (Verse 68-70). Normalcy of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) keeps the [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) in balanced condition, it means that a specific pH is maintained ( [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta)); secretion, transportation and villi movement are normal ( [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)) and mucosal bed secretes normal mucus and is healthy ( [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha)), thus maintains samagni or a normal digestive process (Verse 71). Protein losing enteropathy is increased protein loss into the gastrointestinal tract which is classified into three groups. - Mucosal ulceration; there is protein loss by exudation across damaged mucosa e.g. Ulcerative colitis, peptic ulcer, gastro intestinal carcinoma. In such cases dominance of [pitta dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta_dosha)needs to be considered. - Non ulcerated mucosa but evidence of mucosal damage; Protein loss primarily represents loss across epithelia with altered permeability e.g. celiac sprue and menetrier's disease small intestine and stomach respectively, [vata dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata_dosha)and/or [kapha dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha_dosha)dominance should be considered. - Lymphatic dysfunction, represents either primary lymphatic disease or secondary to partial lymphatic obstruction that may occur as a result of enlarged lymph nodes or cardiac disease. Patient with increased protein loss into gastrointestinal tract due to lymphatic obstruction often have steatorrhea and diarrhea. The steatorrhea is a result of altered lymphatic flow as lipid containing chylomicrons exit from intestinal epithelial cells via intestinal lymphatic's which may be compared with flow of ahara rasa and/ or presence of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata)and [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha). all patients sprue express the HLA-DQ2 allele. Environmental factor, gliadin a component of gluten that is present in wheat, barley and rye contributes to the disease. Immunologic component (prayatna, bala and urja of [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata), [kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) respectively), serum antibodies - IgA antigliadin, IgA antiendomyasial and IgA antibodies and IgG antibodies are present. In addition, gliadin peptides may interact with gliadin specific T cells that may either mediate tissue injury or induce the release of one or more cytokines that cause tissue injury (Verse 72). Further research shows that incase of uncontrolled growth of gut microbiome, flushing of gut reduces both psycho-somatic symptoms. [Shodhana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Shodhana) therapy not only flushes the vitiated gut microbiome but also flushes out the substrata due to which growth of microbiome is controlled (Verse 73-74). Kshara has been advised along with tilvaka sneha; kshara has alkaline pH. In duodenum and alkaline pH are secreted. Ushna, teekshna 1/17 ] i.e. secretion are first increased and later on absorbed is very essential in grahani dosha. Both these actions help in secretion of digestive enzymes thereby increasing [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) and by absorption correct the malabsorption. Therefore use of kshara is more in grahani Fermented liquids contain probiotic organisms. Probiotic foods are produced by chemical action of lactic acid, bacteria, yeast or combination of both. These useful microorganisms help in breaking down carbohydrates, sugars making them easily digestible. Probiotics improves absorption of nutrients; improve synthesis of vitamins, essential fatty acids and enhance nutritional qualities of food grains. Fermented foods increase the absorption of vital minerals from gastrointestinal tract thus preventing mineral deficiencies and also treat the diarrhea. It explains the role of helpful gut microbiome (Verse 82-86). Use of fermented products explains the concept of gut microbiome and use of kshara and amla drug for maintaining pH (Verse 88-93). [Vamana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vamana) (medicated emesis) reduces gastro-paresis by emptying the gastrointestinal contents (Verse 101-102). Fermented liquids are rich source of gut microbiome which will help to replace the unhealthy microbiome. These fermented liquids also help to balance the pH of the gastrointestinal tract. Further study is required to decide impact of above mentioned liquid diet on pH and specific enzymes (Verse 115-116). One cup of buttermilk contains 152 calories and 8.11 grams of fat, of which 4.65 grams are saturated, 282 milligrams of calcium and 127 international units of vitamin D. The vitamin also helps to maintain normal phosphorus levels. Phosphorus is another nutrient that contributes to bone (Verse 117-119). Samana vata regularizes the secretion of pancreatic and intestinal the enzymes are in zymogens (inactive form). Samana vata helps in conversion of zymogens into active enzymes so all the factors which help in stimulating exocytosis can be considered as functional components of samana vata. Once samana vata is stimulated efficiently the digestive process becomes intact to digest all types of nutrients (Verse 202-203 -1/2). Hyperthyroidism is one of the causes for hypermetabolic disorders but extra thyroidal causes are also important. Hypermetabolism typically occurs after significant injury to the body. Infections, sepsis, burns, multiple traumas, fever, long bone fractures, prolonged steroid therapy, pheocromocytoma, surgery and bone marrow transplants. Hypermetabolism may occur particularly in the brain after traumatic brain injury (Verse 217-219). Hypermetabolism is accompanied by a variety of internal and external symptoms most notably extreme weight loss. External symptoms of hypermetabolism may include anemia, fatigue, elevated heart rate, irregular heartbeat, insomnia, shortness of breath, dysautonomia, muscle weakness, excessive sweating while internal symptoms include peripheral insulin resistance, elevated catabolism of proteins, carbohydrates triglycerides and negative nitrogen in the body. In this context there is increased function due to excess secretion of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones act as catabolic hormones and promote calorigenesis and develops hypermetabolic state which may result in gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and glycogenolysis causing decreased muscle mass and weight loss. Metabolic rate is enhanced, because of vitiated [pitta](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pitta) and associated [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata). This is the condition where increased appetite with weight loss is seen due to insufficient supply of nutrients in relation to agnibala. Thyroid storm/ thyroid-toxic crisis is rare and life threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, accompanied by fever, delirium, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and jaundice. Death may occur due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia and hyperthermia. Management requires intensive monitoring, supportive care, identification of the precipitating causes (stroke, infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis, surgery and radio iodine treatment), and measures that reduce thyroid hormone synthesis (Verse 220-222\u00bd). Kleda can also be considered as inter-mediory product of metabolism like ketones, pyruvate, lactate which are well utilized in active/healthy persons as fuel and therefore does not cause inflammation/disease process (Verse 237-239).
