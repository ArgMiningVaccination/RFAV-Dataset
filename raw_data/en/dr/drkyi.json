Health is about jobs and employment, education, the environment, and all those things that go into making us healthy.\" -Joycelyn Elders Did you know that an imbalance in your mind, body or spirit can foster an environment that creates disease? This is one of the base philosophies of holistic medicine. Holistic healing therefore seeks to address the whole person by considering physical, emotional, and spiritual symptoms and their causes. A holistic healer uses all the tools available to restore balance in a person. They use modern medicine and procedures as well as complementary and alternative therapies to bring a holistic balance that paves way to healing. Among others, a holistic healer will use aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, reflexology and more to achieve the optimal balance for wellness. Q&A Interview With a Professional Holistic Healer To get expert insight on this topic, Organic Aromas spoke to Holistic Healer Maura Farragher. Maura Farragher (RGN, is a holistic healer, medium, Transformational Complementary Therapist, and founder of [Enigma Wellness Clinic](https://maurafarragher.com/) which is a virtual and in-personal holistic wellness clinic founded in Galway, Ireland. She uses aromatherapy both in her practice and as a treatment for clients. Organic Aromas: You are a holistic healer, please tell us what that means and what exactly you do Holistic healing offers a depth and breadth of support encompassing body, mind and spirit. Holistic medicine views the person as a whole. It takes into consideration Western and Ancient Medicine to achieve the best outcome with patients always at the core. What specific therapies and treatments do you avail to your clients? I am a Registered General Nurse and a Registered Midwife. I'm practicing acupuncturist, herbalist, energy healer, life coach/mentorship, reflexology, focusing on stress and anxiety, spiritual awakening through bespoke programs and workshops, I also focus on Inflammatory conditions/autoimmune issues and women's gynecology issues with infertility, pregnancy and menopause. Tell us how you incorporate aromatherapy in your holistic therapies I use aromatherapy oils in my practice and cater the oil depending on the issue at hand. My favorite essential oil is [Frankincense](https://organicaromas.com/products/benefits-and-uses-of-frankincense-essential-oil/) (king of oils from Biblical times). I use this for stress and anxiety, I also use rose and bergamot. For body aches and pains including back pain, I use Frankincense and Myrrh blended with refractured coconut oil. For gynecology issues such as pmt period or menstruation discomfort I often use [ylang ylang](https://organicaromas.com/products/ylang-ylang-essential-oil/) and geranium. I sometimes use oils neat on acupoints or blended and diluted and I often use them on reflex points on feet as well! On your website, there is a quote by you that says 'true healing requires both patience and nuance' please explain to us what you mean As a Healer and Health Care Practitioner, patience is a definite requirement. A client can only heal at their own level of energy physically, emotionally, and spiritually depending on their awareness and overall health. Picking up on nuance is having the awareness and intuition to pick up on subtle things or issues that clients feel are small, which can be very informative for me. Also, I can sense when their energy field is out of balance intuitively, either online or in person and gently rebalance it again if needed. As a Licensed Acupuncturist, how does aromatherapy marry into the practice? It can marry very well! I had a client today with sinusitis and I gave her acupuncture treatment. During the treatment I put some essential oils into the diffuser, which included some peppermint. I also gave her a herbal prescription for sinusitis to continue the treatment at home. I sometimes press essential oils neat but mainly blended and diluted into acupoints (acupuncture points using pressure or massaged rather than needled) and reflex points in feet as a reflexologist. Please give our audiences 3 top tips on how they can tap into holistic healing as a parting shot Develop your intuition and awareness and learn to \"LISTEN TO YOUR BODY\" and ascertain what your body needs at the moment. Is it walking out in fresh air in nature? Or does your body need to rest and some quiet down time? Practice meditation and visualization (just 10 to 15 mins), learn to rebalance your body and quieten the mind, this takes time but follow the recorded version until you can do it instinctively. Gain knowledge about eating right for your body and nourishing your body and soul with good nutrition. It is a very powerful tool keeping your energy, mood levels high and balanced, good food should be about enjoyment and balance! Organic Aromas Holistic Healing Survey To find out whether people are tapping into holistic healing, Organic Aromas surveyed a group of 200 American adults. We asked them several questions and the feedback was interesting to say the least. At least 33% of people polled stated that they had visited a holistic healer because of a physical condition. 35% and 28% sought these services for emotional and spiritual reasons respectively. Over 50% of respondents were treated with aromatherapy and more than 60% were happy with the results. Nearly 65% of people surveyed will seek holistic healing services in the future. Conclusion Holistic health should be the pursuit of every individual. Every aspect of your life will affect how you feel in terms of wellness. The good news is that holistic health is well within reach as more knowledge on the topic is uncovered through varied research. As Joycelyn Elders put it, \"Health is more than the absence of disease. Health is about jobs and employment, education, the environment, and all those things that go into making "}
