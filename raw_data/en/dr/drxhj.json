I practice Integrative Functional Medicine, which relies on the newest science for testing to unravel fundamental imbalances, which can then be addressed through nutrition, movement and building resiliency, informed by an understanding of many ancient healing systems. My practice is Patient Centered, seeing you as an individual and working together with you to achieve optimal vitality. Functional Medicine Conventional medicine often sees you as a collection of body parts, each assigned to a different specialist, who often are not communicating. No wonder care can be fragmented and superficial. Using Functional Medicine as our base, we look at imbalances in the body's systems and how they are communicating with each other. This allows us to correct the situation at the root cause level. Botanical Medicine Dr Warner is also a trained herbalist, and uses this background in a way unique among functional medicine practitioners. Her training encompassed some diagnostic techniques familiar to Traditional Chinese Medicine, and she is capable of formulating an herbal medicine blend unique to your situation, if need be. High Tech/ High Touch We use the best of diagnostic tools from the conventional medicine world as well as the newest testing from the functional medicine world. We come up with detailed plans to move forward, then work closely with you to make that plan fit into your lifestyle. We use our brains, our hearts and our energy to help you find your path back to health. Medicine in Balance provides a variety of services to assist you on your path to health and wellness.

You simply can't take enough supplements to make up for a poor diet. We'll help you find a way to make eating carefully become second nature. My Time in Medical School In this interview for the project \"Integrative Wisdom\", I talk about my life path and share advice for anyone else considering a life of service in the health professions. Testimonials You'll notice all the nature shots and photos of medicine plants; this area means a lot to me, as it's the home of trainings that I did with Lisa Weikel, and the site where my mesa was created. The energy of the area is lovely and it feels like home. "}
