Testimonials: Vedina, mother of Aiko Where to start? My heart is so full and I feel so blessed to have connected with such an incredibly generous, loving and divine teacher such as Laurence. She created an amazing, heartfelt and magical ceremony to celebrate my daughter's first period that was also a very healing moment for myself and the other adults present. It felt so right to take the time to acknowledge this important milestone. In ancient cultures our elders were responsible for initiating young people into the \"mysteries\" of life and in modern times so much of this has been lost and that is a shame. It was an emotional experience to reconnect with this ancestral wisdom. My daughter and I felt empowered, honoured and held in such a profound and special way. I know we will cherish these memories forever. Afua, mother of Naya I chose to hold a First Moon Flow ceremony for my daughter to induct her into her power as she grows into womanhood. I also recognised this as an important way of healing the intergenerational trauma that previous generations of women in my family have experienced in colonised and colonising societies that don't honour our body and spirit in this way. I have learned so much of this power and healing from Laurence, it was a dream to witness her holding this space for my daughter profound and special way. I know we will cherish these memories forever. "}
