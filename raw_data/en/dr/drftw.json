Crystals have been used for thousands of years in many cultures. They are believed to hold energetic properties that can be harnessed and used for healing purposes. Crystals cannot cure cancer. It is important to remember that crystals cannot cure cancer. They are not a substitute for medical treatment, and they should not be used as such. Crystals can help with the healing process if you have been diagnosed with cancer or if you have lost someone to the disease, but they cannot replace chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If you want to use crystals in conjunction with your medical treatment, talk to your doctor about using them as complementary therapies. The American Cancer Society states that \"there is no good scientific evidence at this time that alternative therapies alone can cure cancer or its side effects\" (American Cancer Society 2019). However, studies do show that some alternative therapies can help relieve stress during treatment and improve quality of life (Lamont 2014). Crystals can also be used as an additional tool for managing stress and anxiety associated with being diagnosed with cancer or losing someone close to you who died from the disease. Some people find that certain stones ground them while others help them relax\u2014it depends on personal preference (American Gem Trade Association 2019). 5 Crystals and Stones to Support Cancer Patients Kyanite Kyanite is a crystal that works well with healing cancer, soothing the lungs, and treating anxiety and depression.
