But, after pregnancy, you, as a mother, have to face demands from both your body and your baby. In looking after the baby, you may often tend to neglect her own health. And then, the visits to the gynaecologist just become more frequent. But, apart from popping pills, there's so much more you can do for your mind and body. Quite similar to acupuncture, Reiki healing is becoming popular for its amazing pain and stress-reduction benefits. But, first of all, let's understand what this healing mechanism is. What is Reiki Healing? Centuries ago, the Japanese discovered that one would recover from an ailment eventually, even without taking any medication. Reiki (pronounced ray-key) is an alternative therapy that focuses on the human body's self-healing mechanism. It was founded by Dr Mikao Usui and comes from the Japanese words rei meaning \"universal\" and ki meaning \"life energy\". According to this healing method, the human body has seven chakras, and life energy (known as prana in India) flows through each of them. At times, chakras tend to get blocked, thus stopping the life energy and leading to various health problems, big or small. The goal of Reiki is to open up these chakras, relax the body and reduce pain. A study [1 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821642/?ref=interlink)was conducted to find out whether Reiki really benefitted people with chronic illnesses. It was seen that Reiki had immediate effects on heart rate variability, cortisol levels, and body temperature. The Five Principles of Reiki Healing Reiki is based on a set of five principles. Anybody who opts for this type of alternative healing has to practise them in their daily lives. If you're wondering how long you'll be able to keep up, there's some good news. You make a promise just for today. Health Benefits of Reiki Reiki has immense health benefits. Some of them are: 1.
