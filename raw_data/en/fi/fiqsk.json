Design/methodology/approach Remote engagement is the biggest challenge that is faced by many organisations with their employees working remotely. This paper examines the relevance of mindfulness amidst all distractions that obstruct the employees to stay focussed in their work assignments while performing remotely. Therefore, a thorough literature survey has been made to analyse the conceptual relationship among mindfulness, remote engagement and employee morale. Based on the conceptual analysis, a set of possible frameworks linking the three constructs has been stated for future research. Findings This conceptual paper has come up with few possible frameworks to model the assertions by investigating and corroborating it with quantitative or qualitative studies by the future researchers. Research limitations/implications This paper has tried to advocate the linkage of the three constructs, which is the need of the hour for setting the organisation to the new normal way of work. Practical implications The current paper suggests that the organisations can deal with the toughest challenge of engaging people remotely by practising mindfulness technique, and thereby, it would result in high morale leading to improved performance. This approach paves the way for leading a \"new normal\" even post-pandemic. Originality/value Due to the prevalence of the unforeseen situation of pandemic, organisations have no other way but to resort to remote work. Through the practice of mindfulness, the engagement of employees can be adhered to an extent, which results in enhanced employee morale, which can help the organisation to achieve its business objectives amidst this turbulent time and gradually resorts to function in the new normal.
