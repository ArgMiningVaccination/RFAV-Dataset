Supports multiple plate sizes Versatile instrument capable of gently removing liquid from any SBS format, 96- 384- 1536-well plates. Low residual volume Unmatched washing efficiency with residual volumes <0.1 \u00b5l reduces the number of washing cycles required. Fast and automated Fully automated and stand-alone operation makes it possible to complete 1 wash cycle in 96- or 384-well plates in under 1 minute. Product Details Discover what you can do Liquid removal The C.WASH uses non-contact centrifugal forces to remove liquids from well plates in seconds, eliminating the risk of carryover and cross contamination Dispensing Dispense the plate with liquid connected to one of the 4 liquid input channels with auto priming function. The angle dispensing allows aiming at the well walls to preserve growing cells, bound capture antibodies. Washing efficiency Featuring a residual volume of <0.1 uL/well, the C.WASH dramatically reduces the number of wash cycles required and results in faster, more reproducible assays. Software The intuitive nature of the software allows for guidance through each step of your protocol. The creation of customized protocol allows the user to choose a variety of option, including pause time, skipping columns and shaking Automation Well-documented communication via the Standardization in Laboratory Automation interface (SiLA20) allows integration with Automation Programming Interface (API) and is compatible with third-party control software. Waste system Waste is discarded through an active pump, which prevents clogging in the internal tubing. It also reduces the instrument's footprint, making it easy to integrate into any lab configuration. Tip Consumption Calculator The dependency on pipette and liquid handler tips is costly on the wallet as well as the environment. Use the Tip Consumption Calculator to see how many tips you are using in a year and how long it will take you to recover the cost of a C.WASH using only pipette tip savings. G.STATION The C.WASH is also included in the G.STATION - the ultimate solution for automated Next Generation Sequencing Library construction. Enabling scientists worldwide SiLA Compliant We've successfully integrated the SiLA 2 communication protocol into several instruments in our portfolio, including C.WASH and G.PURE. This implementation of an industry automation standard enables seamless integration into automated workflows across multiple different instruments and data exchange with LIMS and other services. Product Applications Accelerate your research Cell-based assay C.WASH automates all the washing and dispensing steps in a typical screening workflow, making it an essential device for drug discovery or gene editing in HTS environments. Immunoassays ELISAs are very sensitive immunoassays, therefore cross contamination and/or pipetting inaccuracies may result in high coefficient of variation (CV). The accurate non-contact dispensing limits both cross contamination and therefore reduces CV. Moreover, the lower residual volume after washing enables better washing efficiency and reduces the number of washes required. Cell in suspension Use the C.WASH as a simple and reproducible method to wash suspension cells. Following centrifugation of the plate to pellet cells, the liquid supernatant is then evacuating using the C.WASH, resulting in washes with consistent low residual volume and with maximal cell retention as compared to manual workflow. Plate coating Coating wells with proteins or peptides maximizes cell adhesion in your microplates. Streamline the coating process in your laboratory using the C.WASH. Dispense the coating solution, choose your incubation time and wash and dry the plates for optimum and reproducible coating of your plates.
