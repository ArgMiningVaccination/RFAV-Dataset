An allergist is an MD who specializes in treating allergic conditions. An allergist can tell you what you're allergic to and how to avoid your triggers. You may want to make an appointment if: - You have symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, cough, or watery eyes that last for more than 3 months and make it hard for you to work or sleep. - You've tried over-the-counter drugs and still need more relief. - You get a lot of sinus infections, headaches, stuffy nose, or ear infections. - You snore or have trouble staying asleep. - You have other health problems such as [heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/default.htm), thyroid disease, [diabetes](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm), [glaucoma](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes), high blood pressure, [enlarged prostate](https://men.webmd.com/prostate-enlargement-bph/), liver disease, or [kidney disease](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-kidney-disease-basic-information).

If you know what you're allergic to and what things trigger a reaction, you can take steps to avoid those things. An allergist will give you tests to help you identify specifically what triggers your allergies. Make a treatment plan. A treatment plan will help you know what you need to do. It should include what kind of medicine to take and when to take it, what things you need to avoid because of your allergies, and how to be ready for and what to do if you have a serious [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergic-reaction-causes). Check that you have the right medicine. Over-the-counter drugs can often help with allergies. Some people, though, also need prescription medicine to handle the symptoms.
