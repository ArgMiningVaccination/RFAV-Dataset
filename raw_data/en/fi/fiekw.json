Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is created, stemming from their applications in distinct areas. Huge sensor nodes are deployed in geographically isolated regions in WSN. As a result of uninterrupted transmission, the energy level of the nodes gets rapidly depleted. Sensor node batteries cannot be replaced or recharged often and maintaining the energy level is a crucial issue. Thus energy efficiency is the significant factor to be consider in WSN. This paper focuses to implement an efficient clustering and routing protocols for maximized network lifetime. Clustering has been confirmed as a successful approach in network organization. The fundamental responsibilities of the clustering mechanism include improved energy efficiency and extended network lifespan. In this work, energy efficiency is improved to maximize lifespan of the WSN by proposing a novel method known as the Populated Cluster aware Routing Protocol (PCRP). The proposed method comprises three different steps: cluster formation, cluster head selection, and multi-hop data transmission. All sensor nodes are joined to a Cluster Head in a single hop in the cluster formation phase. Node distance is calculated and from which cluster head is selected. Then, cluster head aggregates the data from sensor nodes and transfer to the Base Station (BS). The shortest pathway is estimated by the Energy Route Request Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (ERRAODV) algorithm. The proposed method considers the residual energy involved to attain high energy efficiency and network stability. The experimental analysis is demonstrated to validate the proposed method with existing, which improves the network lifespan. Vital parameters are validated using Network Simulator (NS2).
