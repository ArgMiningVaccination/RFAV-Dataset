Research conducted by Fabio led to the filing of several patents as well as publications on various human pathogens published in important peer-reviewed journals. He has served as editor of several publications and is the coordinator of an industrial-academic effort on human organotypic models. He holds a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Microbiology from the University of Padova and conducted post-doctoral studies at Stanford University under the guidance of Dr. Stanley Falkow and Dr. Manuel Amieva. Rino Rappuoli is Chief Scientist and Head External R&D at GSK Vaccines, based in Siena, Italy and Professor of Vaccinology at Imperial College, London. Prior positions: head of Vaccine R&D at Novartis, CSO of Chiron Corporation, head for R&D at Sclavo. He earned his PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of Siena, Italy, and was visiting scientist at Rockefeller University and Harvard Medical School. He is elected member of US National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), and the Royal Society of London. Awards received: Gold Medal by the Italian President, Albert B Sabin Gold Medal, Canada Gairdner International Award, European Inventor Award for Lifetime Achievement, and Robert Koch Award. He was nominated third most influential person worldwide in the field of vaccines (Terrapin). He has published more than 700 works in peer-reviewed journals. He introduced novel scientific concepts: genetic detoxification; cellular microbiology; reverse vaccinology; pangenome. Developed licensed vaccines: acellular pertussis containing a non-toxic mutant of pertussis toxin; first conjugate vaccine against meningococcus C; MF59, the first vaccine adjuvant after aluminium salts; meningococcus B; CRM 197 used as carrier in many conjugate vaccines.Dr. Rappuoli is among the world scientific leaders dedicated to the sustainability of global health.
