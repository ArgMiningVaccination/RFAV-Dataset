As with all health care professionals, clinical psychologists are regularly faced with the challenge of integrating CAM within conventional forms of treatment to ensure safe and effective care is delivered. As such, they are required to be in a position to provide reliable advice to patients; Barnett et al. provide them with a comprehensive, reliable guide that will allow them to provide such advice in an informed manner. Its easy-to-access format will help inform important ethical decisions about the integration of CAM. \u2014PsycCRITIQUES\u00ae [Clinical Resources](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/browse?query=subject:Clinical Resources)and [Health Psychology](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/browse?query=subject:Health Psychology) "}
