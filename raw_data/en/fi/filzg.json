Reducing pain with heavy metal detox? Chemical sensitivity Chemical sensitivity testing is another option and can be done at the same time or separately. Chemical sensitivity is a sign of immune toxicity. It is associated with health problems like increase in hypertension, respiratory problems (asthma, hay fever), histamine reactions, fibromyalgia, EMF sensitivity, overweight, auto immunity, infertility, headache and mental health. Lab testing: Several tests could help understand the exposure and the body ability to detoxify and toxicity exposure DNA Methylation testing, Heavy Metal urine test, Organic Acid Test, Mycotoxin test (mold). Heavy metal testing is none-invasive and affordable and necessary for a full evaluation. No test shows the total body burden of heavy metal it just shows the amount leaving the body and give a glue of the possible over all exposure. Candidate for testing: anyone (non invasive). How does affect your health? Toxic metals and mold have been found to disrupt hormones, neurotransmitters, and decrease the immunity leading to cancer. Elevated level of heavy metal and mold is correlated with low health. Metal toxicity is correlated with overgrowth of candida (especially with high Mercury). Chemical sensitivity impacts the hormone balance and play a direct role in the endocrine function. Detox: After an analysis of a level of exposure to environmental toxins is determining a personalized approach. The detox is personalized based on lab results, age, medical history, sensitivity and patient preferences. An important role in the elimination of heavy metals is played by each individual genetics especially methylation. Good methylation leads to proper detoxification and elimination of toxins. The heavy metal detox combines sauna, colonics, dietary changes and nutritional support. Protocol includes a natural detox process through stimulation of the liver ability to detox, support through the kidney and colon elimination. The protocol may include a package of antioxidants, nutrients, plant extracts, enzymes. How to protect oneself? The most important is understanding the sources and protecting oneself from re exposure by reducing the food and environmental toxins. Some sources of heavy metals particular mercury is found: large fish (swordfish, shark, tuna, halibut, orange roughy) Other environmental pollutants are in scented candles, fabric softners, pesticides, air freshners, cleaning supplies, paints, tabacco smoke, indoor and outdoor pollution, water supplies, inorganic foods, dry cleaning, and fragrances, etc. Health issues and environmental toxins Enviromental toxins: to environmental toxins: - Gastrointestinal issues - Kidney dysfunction - Cancer - Skin lesions - Birth defects - High blood pressure - Allergies - Hormonal dysfunction - Parkinson disease - Depression - Anxiety - Autoimmune - Memory and concentration issues - Fertility Sample Tests References: Mason, L.
