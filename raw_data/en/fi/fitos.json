Accord-ingly, this features a prominent role for expanded partnerships between the faith-based andpublic health sectors. Such an agenda would revise the current status quo for the SurgeonGeneral, whose celebrated bully pulpit is currently focused more on encouraging''downstream'' compliance with federal guidelines related to lifestyle behavior modica-tion. A new faith-based agenda, by contrast, could more effectively advocate for corefeatures of the traditional public health ethic, including primary prevention, the multipledeterminants of population health, communitarianism and social justice, and a globalperspective, supported by the historic prophetic role of the faith traditions. Keywords Religion /C1Faith /C1Surgeon General /C1Public health /C1Prevention Introduction A recent article in this journal advocated an expanded role for faith-based initiatives and resources in furthering the operational mission of the U.S. Ofce of the Surgeon General(Levin 2012a ). Religious institutions and organizations, it was shown, actually have a long history of engagement within the healthcare and public health sectors, dating back manycenturies. In order to address contemporary public health issues, including many pressing concerns, the article offered ve specic recommendations tied to respective domains of public health action, including community health education (''informing the public, raisingrisk awareness, and changing behavior''), vital statistics (''identifying public health needsand eliminating health disparities in underserved populations''), community-based primarycare (''delivering preventive healthcare''), public health policy (''strengthening the nationalresolve to bolster the public health infrastructure''), and disease prevention and J. Levin (&) Institute for Studies of Religion, Baylor University, One Bear Place #97236, global health responsibilities'') (pp. 65-67). The present paper continues this discussion, with an emphasis on laying out a tangible faith-based agenda for the Surgeon General of the United States (SGUS), whether the current ora future one, and whether serving in the Obama Administration or in that of the nextPresident. The goal of this agenda, as stated in the paper's title, is to draw a roadmap thatwill advocate for the nation's public health preparedness. Note that the title of this paper does not call for ''embracing'' the faith community or faith-based values; that may be too much to ask for many readers, perhaps with good reason. Moreover, it is of little consequence for population health whether or not anyone working in the public health sector chooses to embrace such a perspective or not. Rather,the call here is for one agency within the federal public health infrastructure, namely theOfce of the Surgeon General (OSG), to begin ''engaging'' partnerships with faith-basedorganizations and institutions for very pragmatic reasons. These include, above all, thepotential for such partnerships to be directed toward positive population-health-impactingsocial and institutional change that can engender actions and responses that in turn serve toalleviate health disparities. This perspective was succinctly stated in remarks by Dr. Howard K. Koh, the U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH), on the occasion of the launch of the federal gov-ernment's Healthy People 2020 initiative in 2010: Faith-based organizations are a tremendous example of the social determinant's [sic] approach at work. Where people worship and pray is often a place where people alsohave strongest social networks, and often receive information that can be of value tothe health of their families and their neighborhoods .... So we have viewed that partnership as a very valuable one (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services2012c , p. 14). The presence of such partnerships in public health, as noted, is not novel. Religious institutions have been a radix or font (perhaps thefont) of hospital formation, establish- ment of physicians' guilds, and organized efforts to professionalize healing for millennia,across the major faith traditions (see Marty and Vaux 1982 ; Numbers and Amundsen 1986 ; Sullivan 1989 ) and especially within Christianity (Kelsey 1995 ), Judaism (Berger 1995 ), and Islam (Rahman 1987 ). Religious congregations in the USA have sponsored commu- nity-oriented public health interventions for the past ve decades, notably within African-American communities in the urban north and rural south (see, e.g., Levin 1984 ; Eng et al. 1985 ). The idea of partnerships between the public health establishment and associated agencies, on the one hand, and religious institutions and organizations, on the other, mayseem unlikely or counterintuitive. But in theory, as well as historically, public healthleaders' solicitation of faith-based partnerships is consonant with both the longstandingprophetic role of religious institutions, at least ideally, and historic principles of publichealth practice. These include the public health eld's communitarian ethos (Barry 1975 ), afrmation of mutual responsibility (Turoldo 2009 ), and reference to social justice in advocating redress of socioeconomic disparities that lead to disparities in morbidity and mortality (Callahan and Jennings 2002 ). Indeed, one noted public health expert has stated, ''The purpose of public health is to promote social justice'' (Foege 2011 , pp. 186-187). Accordingly, since 1996, the American Public Health Association (APHA) has sponsored aCaucus on Public Health and the Faith Community, and a past president of the APHA hasendorsed such partnerships as ''one example of how we can practice public health crea-tively using existing relationships to advantage'' (Evans 1995 , p. 2).J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 369 123The impetus for the present paper is the recent appearance of two important documents and a renewed federal initiative, each focused on public health, disease prevention, andhealth promotion. The documents are the National Prevention Strategy , issued by the OSG's National Prevention Council ( 2011 ), and the three-volume report entitled, For the Public's Health , issued by the Institute of Medicine ( 2011a ,b,2012 ). The former is a government report presenting an idealized look at how the present administration intendsto address the health of the American people; the latter series is a detailed and scholarlyassessment of current public health needs and the tangible and nancial resources required to enable the public health infrastructure to meet those needs, along with legal and policy challenges. These two documents present distinctive and only partly overlapping per-spectives on what is required to resolve the most pressing public health concerns in theUSA. A detailed analysis of the political reasons for and repercussions of the disparitybetween these two documents is not the focus of the present paper, other than a few briefcomments to follow. Rather, these important statements will be referenced, alongside thenew federal Healthy People 2020 initiative (U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-vices 2010a ), in order to make the case for an expanded faith-based role in public health. Such a development would open up a large sector of personal and institutional resourcesfor meeting the nation's public health needs. The Public Health Sector in the USA The general public's understanding of public health\u2014what it is, what it does, who is involved, who is in charge\u2014much less its history and the scope and organization of currentfederal efforts\u2014is probably close to nil. That judgment is not based on a statistical analysisof national opinion data, of course, but rather on over 30 years of involvement in publichealth. It is hard to imagine a veteran public health professional or academic who wouldsharply disagree. More concerning is that similar, though not as pronounced, lacunae ofunderstanding seem to be present among our nation's legislators and policymakers and among the medical profession. These misunderstandings of the nature and contribution of public health have reinforced an ongoing undervaluing of the public health sector as, say,something vaguely health-related mainly involving sanitarians and the like, maybeessential for poor folks but not all that relevant to anyone else, and mostly a kind of homelystepchild of the medical profession. What public health is not, then, may be as important topoint out as what public health is. What public health is not, to begin, is a branch of medicine. While physicians and other clinicians, such as nurses and dentists, may obtain graduate degrees in public health andmay practice in public health settings, the public health eld itself constitutes a distinctprofession or eld with its own historical narrative and conceptual and theoretical foun-dations (see Holland et al. 1991 ; Tulchinsky and Varavikova 2009 ). More correctly, public health could be thought of as a meta-eld, involving several distinct professions, scientic disciplines, and substantive emphases. An effective illustration of this is the list of the vecore ''areas of knowledge'' required for accreditation of new schools of public health orgraduate public health programs (see Council on Education for Public Health 2011 ). These include biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, health servicesadministration (including health planning, organization, administration, management,evaluation, and policy analysis), and the social and behavioral sciences (including com-munity health education). Many schools and programs also have units focused on maternaland child health, parasitology, global health, community mental health, and nutrition,370 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 123among other subjects and elds. Individuals can obtain the standard professional degree (the M.P.H.) or study for a Ph.D. in a particular discipline and go onto an academic,research, or administrative career. Another illustration of the identity and scope of the public health eld can be found in the table of contents of its leading textbook, Maxcy -Rosenau -Last Public Health and Preventive Medicine (Wallace 2008 ), rst published a century ago, in 1913, and currently in its fteenth edition. Its 1,416 pages contain nearly 150 chapters organized in sevensections: public health principles and methods; communicable diseases; environmental health; behavioral factors affecting health; non-communicable and chronic disabling conditions; healthcare planning, organization, and evaluation; and injury and violence. Thecommunicable diseases section alone contains over 65 chapters on control of communi-cable diseases, diseases controlled primarily by vaccination, sexually transmitted diseases,HIV/AIDS, infections spread by close personal contact, infections spread by food andwater, healthcare-associated infections, viral diseases transmitted primarily by arthropodvectors, diseases transmitted primarily from animals to humans (zoonoses), opportunisticfungal infections, and other infection-related diseases of public health import. Still another illustration of the scope of public health is a list of the established Ofces that constitute the federal U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), under direction of theASH, who reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (SHHS) (see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012b ). The ASH oversees a sprawling enterprise that, besides the Ofce of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), comprisesnearly a dozen agencies: the OSG, the National Vaccine Program Ofce, the Ofce ofAdolescent Health, the Ofce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Ofce ofHealthcare Quality, the Ofce of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy, the Ofce forHuman Research Protections, the Ofce of Minority Health, the Ofce of PopulationAffairs, the Ofce of Research Integrity, and the Ofce on Women's Health. Taken together, these three lists are as good a way as any to summarize the scope and breadth of public health as it exists and is practiced in the USA today. The public healthsector, in turn, is a term used to encompass the various people, professions, institutions,and organizations that are involved in public health work, whether federally, in state or local agencies, in multinational non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in the private or philanthropic sector, or in academia. A key component of the public health sector is theCommissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHSCC), under the operationalcommand of the SGUS and the administrative oversight of the ASH. The PHSCC is one ofthe nation's seven uniformed services, and its 6,500-plus commissioned ofcers functionas deployable public health assets who ''protect, promote, and advance the health andsafety of the Nation'' through a mission encompassing three components: ''Rapid andeffective response to public health needs,'' ''Leadership and excellence in public healthpractices,'' and ''Advancement of public health science'' (see U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services 2011 ). Respective ofcers, in both the Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps, serve in one of about a dozen career paths, including physicians, nurses, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, public health educators and administrators, behavioral health professionals, engineers, environmental health ofcers, allied health practitioners,and research scientists, including biostatisticians and, most famously, a cadre of epidem-iologists. This list is yet another illustration of the range of content encompassed by thephrase ''public health.'' Besides serving as operational commander of the PHSCC, the SGUS has no other statutory responsibilities (see Commissioned Ofcers Association 2009 ) and few other formal roles, mostly related to serving an advisory function to the President and on federalJ Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 371 123panels (see Wright 1998 ). Indeed, the position has a complex and varied history, its formal job description and its location in the federal public health organizational chart havingchanged signicantly more than once over its century-plus existence (see Levin 2012a ). Precisely who is eligible to serve as SGUS and what the job is about are not widelyunderstood, even by members of Congress and, it must be said, by prospective nomineesfor the ofce (see Mullan 2004 , p. 181). Legislation is occasionally proposed to reboot the job's responsibilities and prerequisites, yet again, but the most recent efforts failed (U.S.House of Representatives 2007 ; U.S. Senate 2007 ). A common public misperception is that the SGUS must be a physician (see, e.g., Gutner 2003 ). This has been proposed, but at present, the statute simply requires eligibility to serve in the PHSCC Regular Corps,regardless of profession, and to have ''specialized training or signicant experience inpublic health programs'' (U.S. House of Representatives Ofce of the Law RevisionCounsel 2011 ). At present, the SGUS directs the OSG, but answers to the ASH and does not lead the entire USPHS, something else commonly misperceived. Besides various formal andinformal advisory functions, the position's major role\u2014and most publicly visible\u2014is as''the nation's health educator,'' a not quite accurate professional description but one thatdoes depict the bully pulpit that provides the SGUS with a ready-made platform to speakout on important public health issues. Each SGUS typically has been identied with a particular issue that has come to dene his or her tenure, such as smoking, AIDS, immunization, and childhood obesity. The newest role for the SGUS is as Chair of the new National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council (a.k.a. National Prevention Council, or NPC).Established by a presidential Executive Order in 2010, the NPC consists of over a dozencabinet secretaries and executive department or agency heads and, along with a nationalAdvisory Board, is charged with overseeing federal efforts at health promotion, diseaseprevention, public health, and integrative healthcare, including administrative, scientic,and policymaking roles (see Obama 2010 ). The NPC's underlying perspective is laid out clearly in the Executive Order: its recommendations will be ''lifestyle-based'' (p. 33984)and concomitant national priorities will entail ''lifestyle behavior modication'' (p. 33985). This represents a departure from the historic perspective of public health policy and programming that emphasizes socioeconomic, environmental, and other structural deter-minants of population health, consonant with the eld's communitarian and social-justiceorientations, as described earlier. The NPC has its origins, in part, in the famous Malone-Heckler Report (see Heckler 1985 ), issued by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1985. A product of the Reagan Administration, the report ''emphasized the importance of health education,research, and ...lifestyle changes'' for minority populations in poor health (Dell and Whitman 2011 , p. 18). According to critics, ''the report blamed the victim's lack of knowledge about health, instead of questioning whether the nation really had the will toaddress the systemic issues that limit health equity, such as unequal access, limited eco- nomic opportunity, racial discrimination, and cultural incompetency'' (Dell and Whitman 2011 , p. 18). Current National Agenda Statements for Public Health Two recent reports issued by the federal government and a current federal initiative, noted above, together offer a look at what different constituencies see as a national agenda for the372 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 123public health sector. These are the NPC's National Prevention Strategy ; the three-volume Institute of Medicine (IOM) proceedings on the future of public health entitled, For the Public's Health ; and the most recent version of the Healthy People program of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), an every-decade initiative rst rolledout in 1979. The NPC report comprehensively does what its title promises: it lays out a detailed national prevention policy focused on four ''strategic directions'' and seven ''priorities''(National Prevention Council 2011 ). The strategic directions serve as ''the foundation for all prevention efforts and form the basis for a prevention-oriented society'' (p. 11). Accordingly, they entail collective action and reflect traditional public health values:Healthy and Safe Community Environments, Clinical and Community Preventive Services,Empowered People, and Elimination of Health Disparities. The priorities, by contrast,which are ''designed to improve health and wellness for the entire U.S. population'' (p. 12),are mostly about changing discrete behaviors of individuals in several categories: TobaccoFree Living, Preventing Drug Abuse and Excessive Alcohol Use, Healthy Eating, ActiveLiving, Injury and Violence Free Living, Reproductive and Sexual Health, and Mental andEmotional Well-Being. Each is a pressing health concern, for sure, but the individual levelof focus of these priorities, in keeping with the intention to craft national public healthpriorities around ''lifestyle behavior modication,'' seems at odds with the report's more visionary strategic recognition of the importance of structural determinants of health disparities, unsafe communities and environments, and political disempowerment. TheNational Prevention Strategy thus reads like two separate reports: one effectively identi- fying societal sources of population-wide health disparities and another targeting dis-crete personal lifestyle behaviors for modication. To be fair, in both categories, the reportdoes an outstanding job of proposing substantive actions to be taken by the federal gov-ernment and by various partners, including state and local governments and the business,healthcare, educational, and non-prot sectors, as well as by individuals and families, sothe multilevel approach characteristic of public health intervention is apparent. Still, the NPC report is a mixed bag: in one sense, a prodigious, commendable, and unprecedented effort to tackle an enormous topic; in another sense, a bit of a disap- pointment for the public health community, both supporters of the Obama Administration and those who while not initially supporters were at least optimistic that public healthissues would be well taken care of under this administration. While the report's strategicdirections are on-target, the prioritization of individual behavior change as a primarystrategy to address the nation's health disparities seems somewhat regressive. It wouldappear to t more with the stereotyped depiction of an ultra-conservative politicalagenda\u2014pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps, glossing over structural injustices orinequalities, blaming the victim, and so on. Yet the NPC report is the product of apolitically progressive administration, which makes some of its content, notably its iden-tied priorities, appear counterintuitive. The concern voiced here is not explicitly political or ideological. Rather, the NPC report's priorities represent a limited vision of what public health is about, an incomplete approach according to other contemporary vision statements that identify the determinantsof population health and how we might go about addressing them. For example, the highlyadmired Dr. David Satcher, a former SGUS under President Clinton, has called for anational public health strategy that increases our investment in preventive efforts targetingthree levels of action: upstream , focused on ''policies that support prevention''; midstream , focused on ''community and institutions within communities''; and downstream , focused on ''the individual and his or her lifestyle or behavior'' onto the multilevel empowerment process entailing ''individual involvement, organizational development, and community change'' familiar to communityorganizers (see Checkoway 1995 , p. 4). A comprehensive, population-wide preventive strategy that omits or deemphasizes one or two of these foci will necessarily be com-promising its effectiveness. Moreover, the determinants of population health themselvesencompass various such levels or categories, including biological, psychological, andbehavioral characteristics of individuals, on the one hand, and physical, biological, social,cultural-ideological (including political) dimensions of the environment, on the other, any or all of which may impact on the natural history of disease in people and populations (see Jenkins 1985 ). Accordingly, a national public health vision that does not prioritize addressing environmental and population-wide determinants of health, such as socioeco-nomic disparities and the unmet needs of underserved and less advantaged populations, is''unlikely to improve public health'' (Goldberg 2009 , p. 70). A focus on proximal or downstream factors ''may temporarily reduce disparities, but differences will likely ree-merge as new mechanisms emerge. Breaking the cycle requires affecting the metamech-anism itself'' (Diez Roux 2012 , p. 48). While the NPC report thus advances a mostly, but not entirely, ''downstream'' vision of public health and prevention, the IOM report, by contrast, is a strongly ''upstream'' doc-ument. In the three reports issued by the specially convened IOM Committee on Public Health Strategies to Improve Health, the members have made the case for increased accountability of all sectors that affect health\u2014including the clinical care delivery system, the business sector, academe, nongovernmentorganizations, communities, the mass media, and various government agencies\u2014with coordination, wherever possible, by the governmental public health agency thatis leading or coordinating activities and sectors (Institute of Medicine 2012 , p. xv). In support of their work, the committee's members developed a couple of conceptual models that lay out their perspective on maximizing the capacity of the public healthinfrastructure to achieve its mission and meet public health needs. Their model of ''thehealth system'' includes the governmental public health infrastructure at the federal, state, and local levels in relationship with the educational, media, and business sectors, the clinical care delivery system, non-public-health government agencies, and the community.The public health infrastructure, they note, is an integral though ''relatively small'' part ofthis overall system (Institute of Medicine 2012 , p. 154). The committee also proposed a logic model in order to identify the steps required to link inputs and resources to population-health outcomes. Their model identies and denespublic health resources; capacities; processes, interventions, and policies; and intermediateand health outcomes explicitly and solely in the context of the social and environmentaldeterminants of health. Further, it emphasizes ''the broader systemic context'' that exists''[a]cross different geographic levels and including public health agencies and stake-holders'' and calls for ''attention to equity and disparities among population groups'' (Institute of Medicine 2012 , p. 155). Improvements in population health, according to the IOM report, will require a ''determinants-of-health perspective'' characterized by a ''multiple-determinantsapproach'' that it describes as ''a broader view of how population health is created(including but going well beyond clinical care)'' (Institute of Medicine 2011b , p. 38). This ''ecologic-multiple-determinants perspective'' thus contrasts with the traditional clinicalapproach. These two approaches differ dramatically in their respective determinants/domains, measures, and stakeholders, and the report exemplies this in great detail for374 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 123infant mortality, a key marker of population health. While the clinical (and, associated with it, lifestyle behavior change) approach focuses primarily on access to prenatal care, thepopulation-health approach acknowledges a plethora of putative determinant factors(behavior, clinical care, education, nutrition, income, social support, and environment)along with respective measured indicators (e.g., teen pregnancy data, quality of careinformation, presence of early intervention programs in the schools, school nutritionstandards and policies, income and unemployment statistics, community programs, pres-ence of public transportation) and institutional stakeholders (e.g., public health agencies, medical care providers, school boards, retailers, employers, community organizations, environmental planners) (p. 39). Clearly, this is a broader perspective and implementationagenda than is highlighted in the NPC report, although features of this type of approach canbe discerned in places in the latter document. Nonetheless, the IOM report, too, is a limited statement in that its focus is primarily upstream and focused on scal and structural issues. It represents a mirror image, in asense, of the NPC report. To be clear, neither report is ''wrong'' or in error; both areexceptional efforts and they do what they set out to do: the NPC report, to lay out abehavioral agenda for disease prevention and health promotion; the IOM report, to identifythe nancial and organizational resources required to secure the nation's public healthfuture. But each report sees the solution to public health problems through a particular lens, and the respective lenses focus on different domains of the public health sector. One ongoing initiative has managed to attain a balance of recognizing individual, social, and environmental determinants of health and of advocating a full plate of actions andinterventions, from self-improvement to policy change and all points in between, in orderto improve the nation's health. Healthy People 2020, under direction of the USPHS'sOfce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), is more consonant with thevision of Dr. Satcher and the historic public health ethic, described earlier. Whereas theNPC is mostly about advancing a downstream mission, reflecting its status as a publicdocument prepared with political considerations in mind, and the IOM report is mostly anupstream-focused document, prepared by academics and targeting policymakers and leg-islators, Healthy People 2020 is a practical action-oriented initiative prepared by public health professionals for public health professionals and consumers. Accordingly, it includes both upstream and downstream foci, along with a healthy dose of midstreamcontent, strongly emphasizing and advocating the involvement of community organiza-tions and other public and private institutions. The other reports do, too, but only inHealthy People 2020 is this midstream component consistently fleshed out. In addition,among the over 40 substantive Topic Areas of the report are not only major causes ofdisease at the top of the nation's mortality statistics (e.g., cancer, heart disease and stroke,HIV, diabetes, accidents), but decidedly upstream and societally constructed issues such associal determinants of health, preparedness, public health infrastructure, global health,environmental health, and access to health services. Healthy People 2020 recognizes, alongwith experts on health equity, that a focus on ''health behavioral change'' is ideally a component part of a broader community-based educational approach targeting population- health disparities (Campbell and Wallace 2008 , p. 498). The stated aim of the Healthy People program is to provide ''science-based, 10-year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans.'' Its four Overarching Goalsinclude among them, ''Achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the healthof all groups,'' and ''Create social and physical environments that promote good health forall.'' Its monitored benchmarks are intended both to ''[e]mpower individuals towardmaking informed health decisions'' and to Health (2013) 52:368-385 375 123and (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2012a ). Early in its ofcial Framework statement, there is a section entitled, ''The Importance of an Ecological andDeterminants Approach to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention,'' which states: Health and health behaviors are determined by influences at multiple levels, including personal (i.e., biological, psychological), organizational/institutional,environmental (i.e., both social and physical), and policy levels. Because signicantand dynamic inter-relationships exist among these different levels of health deter- minants, interventions are most likely to be effective when they address determinants at all levels. Historically, many health elds have focused on individual-level healthdeterminants and interventions. Healthy People 2020 should therefore expand itsfocus to emphasize health-enhancing social and physical environments. Integratingprevention into the continuum of education\u2014from the earliest ages on\u2014is an inte-gral part of this ecological and determinants approach (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services 2010b , p. 2). Healthy People 2020 thus comes closest to being an integrated and holistic mission statement for the next decade of work among the public health sector in the USA. Theother two reports are exemplary in their own right, but more limited in scope. Only HealthyPeople 2020 appears to check all the boxes, as far as Dr. Satcher's vision of public health in action, and is most consistent with the traditional perspective that guides the public health sector. But there is one element that is mostly missing from this initiative and its sup-porting documents: a delineated role for faith-based resources in achieving national healthgoals and objectives. Engaging the Faith Community The SGUS is the most publicly visible star in the public health rmament, and the OSG provides a ready-made platform and audience for public health communication. The Surgeon General thus is the best person to advance a new and more focused public health agenda grounded in a multiple-determinants approach to population health that emphasizesupstream efforts and midstream partnerships with voluntary sector institutions includingfaith-based organizations. The SGUS is best positioned, among USPHS leadership, to givevoice to such an agenda and to advocate for it to the general public and the media, toCongress, and within the DHHS and Executive Branch. Despite the consonance of such anagenda with traditional public health thinking and with public health practice, this mayrequire a bit of a vision adjustment for the OSG, as what is being proposed diverges fromits longstanding orientation. A helpful indicator of this orientation may be gleaned from the content of the ''Surgeon General's Perspectives'' column featured in Public Health Reports , the ofcial peer- reviewed journal of the USPHS. The subject matter of the column is a good marker of the ongoing foci of the OSG in recent years, of what is currently on the radar of the SGUS, ifyou will, and thus presumably of most pressing national public health import. These are thecommuniques that dene the celebrated bully pulpit of the Surgeon General, and theyreveal the values and perspective of the Ofce. Since 2008, the content of these ''Per-spectives'' has included the following, in chronological order: childhood obesity, deep veinthrombosis and pulmonary embolism, preterm birth, HIV testing, underage drinking,mental health, breastfeeding, healthy aging, physical activity, oral health, osteoporosis,multiple chronic conditions, health literacy, preventive services, tobacco smoke, dietary376 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 123guidelines, breastfeeding (again), medical adherence/compliance, oral health in AIDS, viral hepatitis testing, adolescent tobacco use, and heart attacks and strokes. To be clear,these are all vitally important issues which unresolved are responsible for suffering andmorbidity and, thus, are appropriate concerns of the OSG and USPHS. But note how mostof these topics concern a respective disease entity or clinical medical care issue or aremeant to be resolved by lifestyle behavior modication. Less evident, if at all, is a communal or societal perspective on issues requiring col- lective action and social, institutional, or policy-related change to address decits of justice or equality that are at the root of so many observed population-health disparities. The solution, as typically given in these ''Perspectives,'' is instead for individual people tocomply with their physician or with federal edicts or expert recommendations, with littlereference to the contextual barriers, especially socioeconomic, that may constrain theirbehavior. Such a hierarchical top-down vision is antithetical to the longstanding historicethos of public health. Again, it is not that this approach is not a signicant element of anidealized public health strategy\u2014it is and should be\u2014but rather that it threatens to becomethe overwhelming focus of such a strategy, reinforcing status quo structural realities,including poverty and disempowerment, that contribute to disease and suffering throughoutsegments of the population (see, e.g., Farmer 2005 ). That this approach has continued and was enlarged upon in the Obama Administration is disheartening, and points to an apparent disconnect between progressive rhetoric and regressive policy. It also constitutes a squandering of the OSG's national platform. With some refocusing, the Surgeon Generalcould become a voice for social justice and a spokesperson for upstream and midstreamefforts to address socioeconomic and environmental determinants of morbidity and mor-tality in order to combat population-health disparities. These realities underscore how challenging it may be to promote a faith-based agenda\u2014 or a more midstream or upstream agenda in general\u2014within the culture of the OSG. Thatthis broader agenda has already found acceptance within the larger USPHS culture,including the ODPHP, as indicated by Healthy People 2020, is encouraging, as is thepresence of a Center for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships (CFBNP) withinDHHS. The ''t'' between the faith-based sector and the public health sector ''appears to be a natural one'' (Rowland and Chappel-Aiken 2012 ), for historical and theoretical reasons elaborated earlier, and this is at least acknowledged within DHHS and the USPHS. But,still, this partnership is mostly constructed to achieve downstream objectives. For example,inPartnerships for the Common Good , a recent report from the White House Ofce of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships ( 2011 ), in conjunction with CFBNP, the entirety of the report's health content was illustrated by a pitch for the Affordable Care Actand how to le for benets, a similar pitch to enroll children in Medicaid, an advert for theFirst Lady's initiative to combat childhood obesity through lifestyle change, and mentionsof a free texting service for pregnant moms and newborns and the National HIV/AIDSStrategy. All worthy efforts, for sure, but not a particularly ambitious agenda for a putativepartnership between these two large sectors of society. A ''healthy'' corrective is available. Healthy People 2020 could serve as a template to help delineate and organize a full range of public health activities that involve faith-basedresources, both people and institutions, in various types of partnerships across the deter-minants of population health (i.e., social, environmental, behavioral), across the levels ofpublic health action (i.e., upstream, midstream, downstream), and across particular publichealth issues. Faith-based resources may contribute to needs assessment, program plan-ning, health education, evaluation, community development and organization, politicalaction, and engagement in the policy-making process, whether locally, nationally, orJ Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 377 123globally. It would be foolish to ignore such resources, especially in a time of federal resource scarcity. The SGUS could be a signicant player in making this case and couldmake such linkages a centerpiece of his or her bully pulpit. This would be in keeping withthe statutory functions of the ofce, with Dr. Satcher's vision for public health, and withthe longstanding contributions of the faith community to public health and healthcare. For example, let us consider one particular Topic Area: ''Older Adults,'' a new focus for Healthy People with the 2020 initiative. Epidemiologic studies have identied numerousdimensions and indicators of religious participation and spirituality among older adults as a signicant salutary factor in relation to health and illness outcomes, related to both physical health (e.g., functional health, disability, self-rated health, physical symptoms,cancer prevalence, cardiovascular disease, smoking and drinking behavior, mortality/lon-gevity) and mental health and well-being (e.g., depressive symptoms, chronic anxiety,other diagnosed psychiatric disorders, life satisfaction, positive affect, self-esteem, suicide)(see Levin and Chatters 2008 ). That is, greater levels of religiousness, spirituality, or faith, broadly dened, are associated with lower population rates of morbidity or mortality due torespective disease entities and illness behaviors (a protective or preventive effect) and withhigher rates of well-being, physical and psychosocial, according to various indicators (ahealth-promotive effect). Within gerontology and geriatrics, by now hundreds of empiricalstudies have investigated these associations in older adults and/or across the life course, and most have identied positive and signicant effects (see Koenig et al. 2012 ). Likewise, health services research studies, published program evaluations, and public- and private-sector and academic documents have reported on organized congregational anddenominational interventions and other efforts to address the health and well-being needsof older Americans, work that has been ongoing for many decades. A pioneering summaryof ''Aging, Religion, and the Church,'' in the original Handbook of Social Gerontology , published over 50 years ago, identied numerous programs in the USA dating to the 1940s,across denominations, and many operating in co-operation with secular agencies (Maves1960 ). The seminal Religion & Aging: An Annotated Bibliography , published over 30 years ago, contained more than 500 entries, mostly under the categories ''OrganizedReligion in the Service of the Elderly'' and ''Spiritual Ministration to the Elderly'' (Fecher 1982 ). Community health education efforts targeting the health-related needs of older adults have existed throughout communities in the USA for decades. These programs, suchas the Partnerships for Healthy Aging Project in Houston over 20 years ago (Falck andSteele 1994 ), are oftentimes interfaith efforts involving partnerships among congregations, health agencies, local government, community health centers, and the academic sector.Moreover, state and national religious denominations have gotten involved, as well,exemplied by the pioneering Health and Human Services Project of the General BaptistState Convention of North Carolina, which began in the 1970s (Hatch and Jackson 1981 ), and by contributions to the ongoing healthcare reform debate on the part of organizationsfrom across the Jewish denominational spectrum (Levin 2012b ). This exercise could be duplicated with many of the other Topic Areas included within Healthy People 2020. Indeed, an especially helpful effort would be a comprehensive review of evidence\u2014from epidemiology, health services research, community healtheducation, health policy, etc.\u2014that summarizes the impact of faith-based variables,interventions, and organizations on the occurrence, prevention, and amelioration of each ofthe diseases and other pressing public health concerns identied in Healthy People 2020.Such a companion document, fully referenced for researchers and policymakers, alongwith an associated website for the public and for public health agencies, would be atremendous contribution to the nation's public health effort. Aside from being a practical378 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 123summary document, it would provide for the rst time, by documenting faith-based efforts and resources and any evaluative evidence, a complete catalog of historical and ongoingpublic health programs and initiatives with signicant faith-based content. It would alsoprovide a useful baseline for the development of detailed goals, objectives, and imple-mentation plans for federal faith-based efforts related to each Topic Area over the course ofthe Healthy People 2020 implementation period and beyond. The Faith-Based and Public Health Sectors: Toward Partnership As is evident, the faith-based sector can be a signicant ally for the public health sector and already has proven such on a regional and local scale, over and over again. There aremultiple reasons for this: (a) these sectors share mutual concerns, (b) the tenets of manyreligions favor healthy living, (c) congregations provide tangible and emotional resourcesfor health, and (d) religious organizations are able to foster participation among peopleotherwise hard to reach (Goldmon and Roberson 2004 ). Within African-American com- munities, especially, churches are already engaged in primary prevention, preventive healthprogramming, and delivery of social services to at-risk populations (Sutherland et al. 1995 ). Such efforts are consistent with the long history of religious advocacy in policymaking, in general, with its emphasis on coalition-building across sectors (den Dulk and Hertzke 2006 ). Still, despite the promise of alliances between the faith-based and public health sectors, there are barriers to expanding this relationship. For one, compared to the burgeoningliterature of thousands of studies on faith-based impacts on population health (see Koeniget al. 2012 ), ''relatively little'' published literature exists on public health and faith part- nerships (Kegler et al. 2010 , p. 666). It has been noted that ''evidence-based health pro- motion interventions in churches remain sporadically implemented'' (Peterson et al. 2002 , p. 408), as do program evaluations and evaluative research of faith-based programs(Johnson 2002 ) and empirical validation of factors associated with effective or efcacious such interventions (Bopp and Fallon 2013 ; Markens et al. 2002 ). This is not to say that such literature is sparse in absolute terms: more has been done and published than most public health leaders may be aware, and mounting evidence does exist for these programs'effectiveness (see DeHaven et al. 2004 ), particularly in African-American churches (Campbell et al. 2007 ). By now, enough of these interventions have been mounted that there is accumulating evidence for successful behavior change and morbidity reduction inrelation to particular disease outcomes within specic populations, such as diabetes amongAfrican Americans (Newlin et al. 2012 ). This work's continued failure to thrive across the board, however, may be due in part to the complexities of these partnerships and concomitant barriers among both the publichealth and faith-based sectors: limited resources, competition/turf protection, racism,internal team conflict, discomfort with faith-based organizations, distrust of health agen- cies, diversity within faith traditions, fear/distrust of faith communities, different agendas, nding a common language, and concerns over separation of church and state (Kegler et al.2010 ). There is also the signicant problem of widespread lack of awareness of the scope and breadth of existing work, something that a faith-based companion piece to HealthyPeople 2020 would rectify. With such barriers, it is a wonder that these partnerships havemoved forward at all, and have flourished, a testament to the passion and commitment ofthe major stakeholders. Yet, to revisit a familiar theme, even where such collaborations are present, the general focus has been more midstream or downstream and less ''about harnessing the potential ofJ Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 379 123faith/health collaborations in tackling broader, systemic determinants of health'' (Kegler et al. 2007 , p. 794). This is a shame and a loss. As Gunderson ( 2000 ) lucidly notes, Something is sacred when it is the locus of ultimate value. For public health, epi- demiological data confer ultimate value on community-scale determinants of health.For most religious groups, it is scripture afrmed by worship and expressed in thesocial relationships in family and community that is sacred. The common groundbetween public health and religious groups is regarded as sacred by both (p. 257). An important contributor to expanding such efforts is recognizing the diversity of partnership strategies and resources that are possible and available for faith-based orga-nizations and public health agencies. The conceptual model of Barnes and Curtis ( 2009 ) helpfully depicts a continuum of such strategies, from low-level to high-level partnerships:from networking to coordination to cooperation to collaboration. While, they report, mostlocal health departments in the USA ''have independent (decentralized) system relation-ships between state health departments,'' this is not necessarily a detriment, as it thusprovides ''more opportunities to determine priorities on the basis of community need''(p. 255). Depending upon the size and demographics of respective communities, thereligious resources available may be much broader and deeper than public health leadersrealize. These include congregations, connectional systems such as denominations, inter- faith and ecumenical systems, structures owned directly and indirectly by religious groups, structures influenced by religious values, and the membership itself (Gunderson 2000 ). With the creative and prudent utilization of these resources and relationships, the con-clusion is plain: ''Faith-based programs can improve health outcomes'' (DeHaven et al.2004 , p. 1030). An unspoken cornerstone of these efforts, current and idealized, is the identity of pop- ulation health as a religious value. Notwithstanding the reservations of some in public healthwho view potential faith-health partnerships as intrinsically al.1998 , p. 692), the faith-based and public health sectors share a set of ''[d]istinctive values and orientations'' (Chatters 2000 , p. 352), such as service to others, community empow- erment, and social responsibility. More specically, the consonance of the public health ethic and the communal and social-justice ethos of the major faith traditions, as noted earlier, supports the ideas proposed here and resonates with core elements of the publicheath worldview. These include (a) primary prevention, (b) the multiple determinants ofpopulation health, (c) communitarianism and social justice, and (d) a global perspective.Faith traditions most exemplify their prophetic role when they call people (and govern-ments) out of their complacency and neglect, especially regarding disadvantaged or dis-empowered populations. They are thus potentially vital partners in advocating to theAmerican people, its political representatives, and the federal government for the value inrealigning national public health priorities. Such realignment, according to Gunderson andCochrane ( 2012 ), may require something of a paradigm shift; accordingly they speak of ''religious health assets (pp. 41-58) and their impact on the ''leading causes of life'' (pp. 59-80). Taken up by the Surgeon General, an agenda focused on these four core elements of the public health perspective and highlighting faith-based and other midstream andupstream partnerships and initiatives might especially resonate with constituencies thatcould work together to improve the nation's health, including potential faith-based assets.This could dene, in large part, his or her proverbial bully pulpit. In the context of this perspective, as just described, one could envision substantive starting points for such an agenda. The SGUS might get considerable traction and do a lotof good with an agenda grounded in the following points:380 J Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 1231.Primary prevention . Advocating a substantial redistribution of biomedical research resources more toward preventing morbidity and promoting population health makes goodpublic health sense, as in the old maxim that an ounce (or penny's-worth) of prevention isworth a pound (or dollar's-worth) of cure. The SGUS's advocacy role ought to extendbeyond urging individual people to comply with the behavioral prescriptions and pro-scriptions of physicians and governmental panels. He or she could have a lot of influence inredirecting national priorities and in raising awareness of the social-structural influences onhealth, including systemic poverty, socioeconomic disadvantage, and environmental degradation. 2.The multiple determinants of population heath . The health of human populations is impacted by myriad variables and higher-order systems, from the biochemical to thepsychosocial to the political-economic. Besides poverty, these include the organization ofthe healthcare system and access to healthcare and health-promoting resources\u2014thingsthat when dysfunctional or limited, respectively, may impede the ability of certain pop-ulation groups to maintain their health. While not in a federal-policy-determining roleregarding such issues, the SGUS does have a seat at the table, so to speak, and could be apowerful advocate for the health needs of the underserved and underclasses. 3.Communitarianism and social justice . Emphasizing both primary prevention and a multiple-determinants perspective requires consideration of matters related to justice, individual and social, and reminds us that population health is a collectively dened status and thus a mutual responsibility that requires political decisions regarding allocation ofcommunal resources. This is a larger issue of political philosophy that extends beyondpublic health and has deep religious roots; thus, it may be outside the comfort zone of theSGUS and his or her superiors in the chain of command (i.e., the ASH and the SHHS). Butif this value were consonant with the worldview of the current (or next) administration, theSGUS could give voice to such a perspective in a powerful way that would be much more''applied'' than theoretical. 4.A global perspective . Our nation's public health responsibilities do not end at our borders, as communicable pathogens, for example, and other public health risks know nonational boundaries. The ease and rapidity of global transportation and our increased connectivity make this not an ideological position but a statement of fact and public health prudence: all public health is global. The mission of the SGUS would benet from anexpanded collaborative role with other USPHS and federal agencies (e.g., the Ofce ofGlobal Health, the State Department, the military surgeons general) and with internationalNGOs (e.g., WHO, PAHO, UNESCO), and the scope of these organizations' impact onpopulation health would benet in turn. In summary, not only would the faith-based and public health sectors make good partners, but the driving values of public health would seem to resonate with faith-basedvalues. Accordingly, the SGUS could advocate for a rebooting of national public healthpriorities that (a) focuses on issues like poverty, injustice, nativism, and misallocation ofpublic resources as fundamental determinants of population ill health and (b) seeks upstream and midstream solutions in partnership with faith-based and other voluntary- sector organizations. Such an agenda might include items such as systematic anti-povertyinitiatives and policies, greater investment in public education focused on improving publichealth, more coordinated efforts at public health preparedness across governmental andprivate-sector entities, promotion of risk reduction targeting structural disadvantages thatcreate health disparities, and enlargement of the public health infrastructure, such assubstantially expanding the PHSCC and the Medical Reserve Corps, in order to meet therequirements of a renewed national commitment to prevention and preparedness. TheJ Relig Health (2013) 52:368-385 381 123combination of promoting a broader view of what public health can be about and offering a wider take on the potential stakeholders, major players, and partners in public health effortshere and throughout the world would be a powerful vision for ''the nation's health edu-cator'' to communicate and may begin to create some positive momentum. Because we are living in a time of scarce federal resources and economic challenge, as well as severe political polarization, this agenda may not be an easy sell. It is probablymuch easier, and politically more expedient, for the SGUS to maintain the status quo andfocus on lifestyle behavior modication. The perceived cost, for one, and the perceived expansion of government, for another, may present political barriers that the USPHS is not willing to breech. This deduction may be correct, but it is unfortunate: in the end, as publichealth professionals and scientists recognize, it is often less expensive to prevent morbiditythan to try to treat it, after the fact (see, e.g., Messonnier et al. 1999 ). A new agenda for the SGUS, as described here, should not be perceived as a partisan political agenda. All sides and philosophies along the political-economic continuum rec-ognize that poverty and its concomitants are a social problem of the rst magnitude; theydiffer only on solutions. Beltway think-tanks across the political spectrum\u2014e.g., theCenter for American Progress (progressive-socialist), the Brookings Institution (neolib-eral), the Heritage Foundation (movement conservative), the American Enterprise Institute(neoconservative), the Cato Institute (libertarian)\u2014have sponsored antipoverty initiatives, projects, or events in recent years. Recognition of the importance of this issue apparently bridges otherwise divergent ideologies. It thus may not be a difcult leap to communicate that (a) these same social disad- vantages also create health disparities through elevated risk of morbidity and mortality and(b) the situation therefore demands creative efforts at identifying fruitful new partnershipsto extend and enhance the government's and society's efforts to ameliorate these disad-vantages and disparities. This would be the burden of the SGUS and would requiresomeone with strong communication skills and formal training in public health, withspecial expertise in the social determinants of population health and, ideally, in the scopeand promise of public-private partnerships, such as with the faith-based sector, whichcould be utilized to address this serious national issue. As the tenure of each SGUS has come to be identied with a single health-related problem or issue, this present topic is an ideal candidate to serve as the focus of the next Surgeon General.
