The prevalence of food allergies has also been documented to have increased in the last 10-15 yrs, particularly in developed countries. Specifically, studies on peanut allergy in the US and UK indicate that the number of children affected has doubled, with the prevalence now over 1%. [2](#B2), [3](#B3) [4](#B4), [5](#B5)In contrast, only 20% of children with peanut allergy and 9% with tree nut allergy will develop tolerance. [6](#B6), [7](#B7) [8](#B8)Therefore, patients and their families often experience a significant negative impact on their quality of life. [9](#B9)Furthermore, food allergic reactions are potentially life-threatening, [10](#B10)- [12](#B12)with peanuts and tree nuts accounting for 80% of food-induced fatal anaphylaxis cases. Severe reactions can occur both inside and outside of the home, and victims are often not aware that the products they were eating contained the food allergens. TYPES OF FOOD ALLERGY [Table 1](#T1)). IgE-mediated reactions occur within 2 hrs of exposure. Binding of food allergens by specific IgE on effector cells, such as basophils and mast cells, leads to mediator release (i.e. histamine, tryptase, cysteinyl leukotrienes, prostaglandin D2) causing a variety of symptoms that typically affect the cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular systems. Serum IgE and prick skin testing measure allergen-specific IgE, and these provide an indication of the likelihood of allergic reaction with exposure to the food allergen, however the type of reactions that occur are unpredictable in severity. Predictive values for serum food-specific IgE levels and prick skin testing have been published for the major food allergens, and levels above the 95% positive predictive value are highly indicative of clinical reactivity. [13](#B13)- [17](#B17)It has also been shown that the rate of decline in food specific IgE levels over time has predictive value for the development of tolerance. [18](#B18) [19](#B19)The immediate treatment for symptoms includes intravenous fluid hydration. As in other food allergies, food avoidance is important. Periodic re-evaluation with physician-supervised oral food challenges are advised to determine whether the allergy has been outgrown. Food protein-induced proctocolitis is commonly triggered by cow's milk and soy, and symptoms can be triggered by exposure through maternal breast milk. Infants are generally brought to medical attention for evaluation of blood streaked stools. These infants are otherwise well in terms of growth and do not generally suffer adverse effects from blood loss, such as anemia. Symptoms resolve with maternal and infant avoidance of milk, and the majority of children outgrow this allergy by 1 yr of age. [20](#B20) [21](#B21)Removal of culprit foods results in significant improvement in skin symptoms for these children. In an international multicenter study of children with atopic dermatitis, a close association between early-onset, moderate-to-severe eczema sensitization was found. [22](#B22)Children who developed atopic dermatitis after 12 months of age were less likely to have concurrent food allergies. [23](#B23)- [25](#B25)Although the etiology is still unclear, many patients have IgE-mediated food and aeroallergen sensitization. In a series of over 500 people with AEE, the main food triggers were milk, egg, wheat, corn, beef, chicken, barley, oats, rice, and peanuts. [26](#B26)Although the majority of patients responded to elemental diets, only 11 patients experienced resolution of their AEE and eventually resumed an unrestricted diet without medications. Since this is a mixed IgE and cell-mediated process, prick skin testing and serum specific IgE levels may not identify all the allergic triggers. Atopy patch testing has been investigated as an additional diagnostic tool to identify foods that cause delayed symptoms. MECHANISM OF FOOD ALLERGY [27](#B27)Transfer of T cells from the orally fed mice to na\u00efve mice resulted in decreased immune responses as well. Different mechanisms of tolerance can occur depending on the dose of allergen exposure. Studies suggest that \"high dose\" tolerance is due to deletion of effector T cells, whereas \"low dose\" tolerance involves activation of regulatory T cells. [28](#B28) [29](#B29)In addition, higher rates of peanut allergy have been found in children with atopic dermatitis who used topical creams containing peanut oil (OR 6.8). [30](#B30)Respiratory exposures are seen in pollen-food syndrome (PFS), an IgE-mediated allergy that is due to cross-reacting proteins in pollens (the initial sensitizing allergen) and foods, which results in oropharyngeal symptoms to raw fruits and vegetables. [31](#B31) [32](#B32)The importance of T regulatory cells in tolerance was also demonstrated in a study of non-IgE milk allergy. The development of tolerance to milk was associated with higher numbers of circulating CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. [33](#B33) Host factors [34](#B34), [35](#B35)suggesting that genetic predisposition is important. Furthermore, the age of exposure to food allergens can determine whether tolerance or allergy develops. In a murine model, sensitization occurred when mice were orally fed ovalbumin in the first week of life, however, tolerance was induced when the mice were orally exposed to ovalbumin at 2-3 weeks of age. [36](#B36)In humans, epidemiologic studies show a higher rate of food allergies in young children as compared to adults, [1](#B1)suggesting that gut maturity may be a factor in the development of food allergies. On the other hand, population studies suggest that early introduction may be beneficial in some cases. In Israel, where infants are fed peanut proteins starting at an early age, there is a lower incidence of peanut allergy as compared to the UK where peanut is not introduced to children until a much later age. [37](#B37)The Learning Early About Peanut Allergies (LEAP) study is currently exploring the role of timing of peanut allergen exposure in the development of peanut allergy. [38](#B38)In a human study of 152 patients on antacid treatment for dyspepsia, increased food allergen sensitization was seen in 25% after 3 months. [39](#B39)Gastric enzymes can affect allergenicity of food proteins. Specifically, the allergenicity of ovomucoid has been demonstrated to be reduced after gastric digestion. [40](#B40)Additionally, commensal bacterial serve an important role. Mice raised in a germ-free environment do not develop normal tolerance, [41](#B41)and mice treated with antibiotics or those lacking in toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) are more easily sensitized to peanut than wild-type control mice. [42](#B42) [11](#B11)Host factors such as exercise, use of medication (alcohol, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), and concurrent infection may increase the severity of anaphylactic reactions or diminish the efficacy of epinephrine. [43](#B43), [44](#B44)Recently, low serum platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity has been found to be a risk factor for more severe food-induced anaphylaxis. [45](#B45) Food allergen factors [46](#B46), [47](#B47)Recent studies demonstrate that the majority of milk and egg allergic individuals can tolerate extensively heated or baked forms of these foods, [15](#B15)- [18](#B18)indicating that these individuals identify conformational epitopes that are disrupted by heating. Furthermore, studies show that different patterns of epitope recognition or epitope diversity may correlate with clinical manifestations of allergic reactions to peanut and milk. [48](#B48)- [51](#B51) [52](#B52)This finding may explain the differences in prevalence of peanut allergy in the U.S. where peanuts are primarily consumed in the roasted form and China where boiled or fried peanuts predominate. [53](#B53)In contrast, deglycoslyated Ara h 1 did not activate dendritic cells. Recently, peanut proteins were shown to have the ability to induce production of complement (C3a) leading to increased platelet-activating factor and histamine production by macrophages, basophils, approaches to alter allergic response to specific food allergens, whereas allergen non-specific treatments are aimed at modulating the overall allergic response. These non-specific approaches would be particularly beneficial for individuals suffering from multiple food allergies. Allergen specific therapies Allergen Immunotherapy [55](#B55)Food specific immunotherapy has been investigated as a potential treatment for food allergy. [56](#B56), [57](#B57)However, early attempts at using SCIT for food allergies demonstrated unacceptably high rates of severe adverse reactions. [58](#B58), [59](#B59)Since pollen-food syndrome (PFS) occurs due to cross-reactivity with pollens, SCIT would seem to be a logical treatment for PFS as well. Although results demonstrate clinical improvements in many patients, these studies lacked appropriate control groups and relied on self-reported symptoms. [60](#B60), [61](#B61)Furthermore, with difficulties in objective evaluations for improvement in symptoms in PFS and lack of consensus for target doses, SCIT remains an unproven therapeutic approach for PFS. [62](#B62)The first double-blind, placebo-controlled OIT study for food allergy in children was performed by Skripak et al. [63](#B63)for milk allergy. Twelve patients completed 3-4 months of active treatment. Although no significant changes in specific IgE levels or skin prick test results were observed, there was a significant increase in milk-specific IgG and IgG4 in the active group. More importantly, the majority of participants experienced reactions during the post-OIT food challenge, demonstrating that complete protection from allergic reactions due to milk was not achieved. Furthermore, all participants continued daily intake of dairy, therefore, it is unclear whether any OIT participants developed tolerance rather than desensitization to milk. [64](#B64)reported on their experience with OIT in a highly milk allergic population. After 1 year, 36% of the OIT group had unrestricted diets, and more than half (54%) were able to tolerate limited amounts of milk (ranging from 5-150 mL). Adverse reactions were common and occurred in all children on OIT. This study demonstrated that OIT can be effective even for those with the most severe allergies. The authors noted that although adverse events were common, in cases of persistent milk allergy and a high risk of accidental exposures and reactions, the risks of treatment may be acceptable. Staden et al. [65](#B65)reported a case series of 9 high-risk children who successfully underwent a rush oral immunotherapy protocol with milk, suggesting that desensitization can be achieved quickly. Adverse effects were frequent, but generally mild. [66](#B66)reported an open-label peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) study in which desensitization was successful in 93% of patients. The authors assessed several immunological parameters and presented several interesting results about possible mechanisms of OIT. Declines in skin prick tests and peanut-specific IgE levels and increases in peanut-specific IgG4 were observed. A significant decrease in basophil activation was detected, as well as increases in several cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-5, which suggests that OIT does not cause the typical downregulation of Th2 and upregulation of Th1 profiles. In addition, T-cell microarrays demonstrated downregulation of apoptotic genes, indicating a potential for apoptosis in OIT. [67](#B67)published a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating SLIT for hazelnut allergy. Twelve patients with hazelnut allergy (6 with PFS) were treated with SLIT for 5 months using the sublingual-discharge technique. Significant increases in threshold of sensitivity to hazelnut were observed following treatment. There was also an increase in hazelnut-specific IgG4 and IL-10 after treatment in the active group. Local reactions occurred in 7.4% and systemic reactions were low (0.2%). A follow-up report of 7 patients from the active treatment group who resumed SLIT 4 months after discontinuation demonstrated tolerance of significantly increased doses of hazelnut, decreased specific IgE, and increased specific IgG4, thus demonstrating the beneficial effect of SLIT even after treatment interruption. [68](#B68)A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of SLIT for peach allergy also reported promising results of improved allergen tolerance that was associated with decreases in skin test reactivity and significant increases in IgE and IgG4 to Pru p 3. [69](#B69) [70](#B70)Twenty patients with pollen-associated apple allergy received 1 yr of SLIT. Although improvement in nasal provocation scores to birch pollen was seen in 9 patients, there was no significant improvement in their apple-induced oral symptoms. In addition, there was no change in specific IgE or IgG4 to the major apple allergen, Mal d 1, after treatment. The authors concluded that SLIT with birch pollen may have no clinical effect on associated apple allergy. Modified recombinant vaccines [71](#B71), [72](#B72)apple [73](#B73)and fish [74](#B74)allergens have been generated. Modified peanut allergens (Ara h 1, 2, 3), altered using site-directed mutagenesis, can stimulate T cells from peanut allergic individuals to proliferate, but have greatly reduced IgE-binding capacity as compared to wild-type peanut protein. [71](#B71), [72](#B72)Heat-killed E. coli (HKE) producing recombinant peanut proteins have been shown to have protective effects in a murine model of peanut anaphylaxis. [75](#B75)Peanut-sensitized mice treated with HKE containing modified proteins Ara h 1-3 (HKE-MP123) demonstrated reduced symptom scores during peanut challenge as compared to the placebo-treated group. This protection lasted up to 10 weeks post-treatment in the medium and high dose treated groups. The high-dose treated group demonstrated the most significant decrease in IgE levels and decreased production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10, and increased IFN- and TGF- production by splenocytes. The mechanisms are hypothesized to involve Th1 cytokines and/or T regulatory cells suppressing Th2 cell activation and mast cell/basophil mediator release on re-exposure to antigen. [76](#B76), [77](#B77)Clinical trials are planned. [78](#B78)Seven, out of 25 patients on active treatment, reported improvement in their oral symptoms as compared to only 1 of 19 placebo-treated patients. Peptide immunotherapy [79](#B79)In a murine model of peanut allergy, mice receiving immunotherapy with peptides containing IgE epitopes to the major peanut protein Ara h 2 prior to allergen challenge experienced only mild allergic reactions as compared to sham-treated mice, which exhibited severe anaphylactic reactions. [80](#B80)Although these preliminary murine studies are promising, validating the stability and uniformity of peptide mixtures for human use poses a significant challenge. Immunostimulatory sequence-conjugated protein immunotherapy [81](#B81)thus making the proteins less allergenic. Early studies using ragweed allergen showed that immunotherapy with ISS in combination with Amb a 1, the major ragweed allergen, promoted Th1 responses and reduced allergenicity in mice, rabbit and primates. [82](#B82)The mice then underwent a sensitization protocol to beta-gal. Similarly, mice immunized with beta-galactosidase plus an ISS sequence oligodeoxynucleotide were protected from developing fatal anaphylaxis and had lower plasma histamine levels after allergen challenge compared to the group treated with beta-gal protein alone. [83](#B83) [84](#B84)Mice treated with ISS-linked Ara h 2 (a major peanut protein) had lower symptoms scores and lower plasma histamine levels following challenge with Ara h 2 compared to the mice treated with ISS-linked Amb a 1. A significantly higher Ara h 2-specific IgG2a levels in the ISS-linked Ara h 2 treated mice was seen, but there was no significant difference in specific-IgE or IgG1 levels between the two groups. These findings suggest that ISS-conjugated protein immunotherapy may be an effective treatment for food allergy. Plasmid DNA immunotherapy [85](#B85)Immunized mice demonstrated less severe and delayed anaphylactic responses following challenge compared to mice treated with 'naked' DNA or unimmunized mice, and this was associated with decreased IgE levels, lower plasma histamine, and less vascular leakage. Despite promising results in the murine model, concerns regarding use in humans are a potential disadvantage of this technique. Allergen non-specific therapies Anti-IgE [86](#B86)A double-blind, randomized, dose-ranging trial in 84 patients with a history of peanut allergy was the first investigation of this for the management of food allergy. [87](#B87)Patients were randomized to receive either TNX-901 (150, 300, or 450 mg of anti-IgE antibodies) or placebo for 4 months. Patients receiving the highest dose experienced significant decreases in symptoms with peanut challenge as compared to the placebo group. The median threshold of sensitivity to peanut increased from 178 mg peanut protein (the equivalent to one peanut) to almost 9 peanuts (2.8 grams). Although 25% of patients were able to tolerate over 20 peanuts post-treatment, another 25% failed to develop any change in tolerance to peanut indicating that the treatment response can be variable. Investigation of another anti-IgE preparation, omalizumab (Xolair\u00ae, Genentech), for the treatment of peanut allergy was initiated, but discontinued for safety issues related to the protocol. [88](#B88) [89](#B89)No data is currently available regarding the effectiveness of this strategy. Chinese herbal medicine [90](#B90)Peanut-allergic mice treated with FAHF-2 had no signs of anaphylaxis after peanut challenge, but all sham-treated mice had severe symptoms of anaphylaxis, decreased rectal temperatures, elevated plasma histamine, and marked vascular leakage. There were also associated decreases in peanut-specific IgE levels and Th2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). The protective effects of FAHF-2 were demonstrated to last up to 6 months post-therapy, which represents about 25% of the lifespan of the mouse. [91](#B91)Furthermore, these effects are not peanut-specific; treatment has been shown to modulate the allergic response in a murine model of multiple food allergies. [92](#B92) [93](#B93)Recently, the U.S. FDA approved a botanical drug IND for FAHF-2 and a Phase I trial is currently underway. Cytokine/Anti-cytokine [23](#B23)- [25](#B25)Data from murine models of EE and analysis of human esophageal tissue demonstrate the presence of T cells and mast cells along with eosinophils, indicating that a Th2-based inflammatory process is a key feature of EE. [94](#B94), [95](#B95)Since IL-5, a major Th2 cytokine, is a regulator of eosinophil function and survival, anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) has been investigated as a treatment for EE. [96](#B96)Promising results were seen in an open-label phase I/II study of anti-IL-5 in 4 adults with EE. Decreases in peripheral and esophageal eosinophilia and symptomatic improvement were seen after 3 monthly infusions of anti-IL-5 (750 mg intravenously). [97](#B97)A less toxic route of intranasal administration of IL-12 using the non-pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis) as a vehicle has been investigated in a murine model. Pretreatment of mice with L. lactis strains expressing bovine-lactoglobulin (BLG) with an IL-12-producing L. lactis challenge with antigen. [98](#B98) Toll-like receptors [99](#B99)After oral administration, decreased gastrointestinal inflammation and protection from peanut-induced anaphylaxis was observed during or after peanut sensitization. Decreases in IgE and increases in IgG2a levels were also detected. The authors postulated that these effects were due to TLR9 agonist induction of Th1-type immune responses. Additional strategies currently being investigated for other allergic disorders [100](#B100)The same group has also developed a human gamma-allergen fusion protein to achieve the same inhibition in an allergen-specific manner. [101](#B101)The Fc-Fel d 1 fusion protein inhibited Fel d 1-mediated degranulation in purified human basophils from cat allergic patients and blocked the allergic responses in a mouse model. Since many food allergens are already well-characterized, a similar approach can be taken for food allergy. "}
