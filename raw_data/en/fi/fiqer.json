Herbal remedies are those whose active ingredients are derived from plants. Licensed remedies are also often derived from plants (but not exclusively so) and imply that that these are regulated and may contain either approval from a medicines control body or proprietary formulations, or both. The UK government has designed a collection of herbal remedies as 'holding a traditional herbal registration (THR)', which is granted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). These naturally derived formulations are registered to the formulator, typically a health and wellbeing company. The registration means that the formulation has been deemed to be 'acceptably safe'. Since 2009, many of these products and companies have shown their registration through the use of the 'THR' mark, a logo that can act as a guide for consumers. Registration of a formulation means that consumers who purchase these registered products can be assured that they have been assessed for safety. But it does not mean that there are no possible side-effects. It is therefore always important to conduct your own research before using a traditional herbal medicine and to seek advice from qualified individuals if you are in doubt as to their suitability. The list of herbal remedies available on our website and stores is vast. We have worked with the world's leading complementary healthcare manufacturers to source the widest possible range of herbal solutions.
