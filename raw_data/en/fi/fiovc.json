Buller, J.L. (2013). Positive academic leadership: How to stop putting out fires and start making a difference. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. The concept of positive academic leadership emphasizes strengthening what is working well, instead of focusing strictly on problem solving. This new book gives academic leaders new insights and practical tools, as well as language and strategies, for fostering a more constructive leadership style that plays to the strengths rather than the weaknesses of their institutions. Buller, J. L. (2011). Academic leadership day by day: Small steps that lead to great success. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. It can seem at times as though all of academic administration today is focused only on the need for continual change and the endless pursuit of \"the big idea.\" This book takes an entirely different approach to developing your proven academic leadership: It introduces one practical and field-tested idea each day for an entire academic year. Chu, D. (2006). The department chair primer: Leading and managing academic departments. Boston, MA: Anker Publishing Company.

Crooksten, R. K. (2012). Working with problem faculty: A six-step guide for department chairs. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. When asked to name their number one concern and problem, department leaders overwhelmingly said that it was dealing with difficult people. Now R. Kent Crookston draws on the wisdom of seasoned department chairs, the academic literature, and his own experience as a department head and dean to shed new light on this perennial problem. Diamond, Robert M., & Adam, B.E. (2002). Field guide to academic leadership. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. While the last two decades have seen an increase in our knowledge about how students learn, about leadership and change, and about how institutions work, there has been, over the same period, little change in how this information is used. The goal of this book is to help close this gap between research and practice. Donald, J.G. (1997). Improving the environment for learning: Academic leaders talk about what works. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. This book identifies optimal practices or benchmarks for creating a quality learning environment and outlines steps faculty and administrators can take to strengthen student learning on their own campuses. It also integrates the rich literature of teaching and learning with the findings from in-depth interviews with faculty and administrators at four of America's premier research institutions, and offers practical, real-life solutions for meeting student learning challenges. Ginsberg, B. (2011). The fall of the faculty: The rise of the all-administrative university and why it matters. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. The war between the administration and the faculty at colleges and universities across the United States is not unfamiliar, yet many now argue that the administration will soon dominate faculty interests indefinitely. The Fall of the Faculty outlines the rise of the administration and how its growing presence is problematic for faculty members in terms of curriculum plans and research opportunities. Administrators are constantly transforming collegiate academia to include \"life skills\" curriculum, which faculty find less rigorous and depleting. Although seemingly biased in his argument, Benjamin Ginsberg discusses how society can alter the system of higher education so that faculty can regain their voice in curriculum policy. Gmelch, W.H. & Miskin, V.D. (2011). Department chair leadership skills (2nd Ed.) Madison, WI: Atwood Publishing. This book focuses on the specific skills needed by chairs in order to effectively lead their departments. The department chair position is the most critical role in the university, and the most unique management position in America....The search for solutions to academia's leadership dilemma leads us to realize that the academic leader is the least studied and most misunderstood management position in America. Gmelch, Walter H., & Miskin V.D. (1995). Chairing an academic department. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. Based upon their extensive study of the demands on and needs of chairs, the authors have distilled their findings into a practical and highly accessible volume to guide chairs in their growth. Despite the varied paths to the position, the authors state that all chairs find themselves in an environment distinct from their former faculty situation.

Assessing and improving your teaching: Strategies and rubrics for faculty growth and student learning. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. The importance of stopping to assess one's teaching techniques is extremely valuable in the realm of higher education. Faculty members can make appropriate changes to improve student learning by evaluating the extent to which their teaching styles have an impact. This evidence-based guide to self-assessment promotes excellence in teaching and enriched student learning by highlighting the inadequacies of current approaches alongside a new model guided by four-principles: consider the essential elements of effective, excellent teaching; critically self-reflect and document to discover ways to teach better, relying on information from many sources; use evidence from literature on teaching and learning or data you've collected yourself to make decisions about your teaching; use systematic data about your teaching and peer review to inform ways to improve teaching. The author supports this model through a number of case studies of critical reflection rubrics. As a whole, this guide reveals innovative ways to assess teaching that yield the greatest improvement in the long run. Brookhart, S.M. (2008). How to give effective feedback to your students.

(2013). Essential questions: Opening doors to student understanding. Alexandria, VA: ASCD. What are essential questions, and how do they differ from other kinds of questions? What's so great about them? Why should you design and use essential questions in your classroom? Essential questions (EQs) help target standards as you organize curriculum content into coherent units that yield focused and thoughtful learning. In the classroom, EQs are used to stimulate students discussions and promote a deeper understanding of the content. Tommlinson, C.A., & Tighe, J. (2006).

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc. This book poses the core, essential questions of understanding and design, and provides readers with practical solutions for the teacher-designer. The book opens by analyzing the logic of backward design as an alternative to coverage and activity-oriented plans. Though backward from habit, this approach brings more focus and coherence to instruction. The book proposes a multifaceted approach, with the six \"facets\" of understanding. The facets combine with backward design to provide a powerful, expanded array of practical tools and strategies for designing curriculum, instruction, and assessments that lead students at all grade levels to genuine understanding. The authors have successfully put together a text that demonstrates what best practice in the design of learning looks like, enhancing for its audience their capability for creating more engaging and effective learning, whether the student is a third grader, a college freshman, or a faculty member.

This book provides advice from two leading educators on how to engage students creatively and innovatively to prepare for success beyond college. Student engagement techniques outlined in this guide will help students reflect on their learning potential. Engaging Imagination is helpful for higher education faculty eager to prepare students for challenges beyond the classroom. Nosich, G.M. (2001). Learning to think things through: A guide to critical thinking across the curriculum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. This book presents a combination of instruction and exercises that shows the reader how to become active learners rather than passive recipients of information, use critical thinking to more fully appreciate the power of the discipline they are studying, to see its connections to other fields and to their day-to-day lives, and to maintain an overview of the field so they can see the parts in terms of the whole. The model of critical thinking (used throughout the book) is in terms of the elements of reasoning, standards, and critical thinking processes. Olson, R., Barton, D., & Palermo, B. (2013). Connection: Hollywood storytelling meets critical thinking. Los Angeles, CA: Prairie Starfish Productions. This title offers faculty in the sciences a model for effectively teaching research to a diverse audience. By collaborating respective experiences in the academic and experiential sectors, scientist Randy Olson joins story consultant Dorie Barton and improv actor Brian Palermo, to produce a skillful guide to story making.

Clark, C., Brimhall-Vargas, M., & Fasching-Varner, K. (2012). Occupying the Academy: Just How Important is Diversity Work in Higher Education? : Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. In the wake of the election of President Obama, many diversity scholars and practitioners imagined that renewed commitments to educational equity and justice were just around the corner. Unfortunately, the opposite has become the Obama-era reality. Across the country, equity and diversity workers at all levels in university and colleges, but especially Chief Diversity Officers in public institutions, are under assault. Is this assault a result of a pre-meditated and carefully calculated conservative political agenda or the unfortunate consequence of how largely white, politically conservative\u2014and the power bases they represent\u2014are expressing their anger about the changing racial landscape in the United States? This book explores and deconstructs the reasons for this assault from various perspectives. This book also illustrates how the national assault on equity and diversity has resulted in a continuum. At one end are \"diversity-friendly\" institutions that are benignly neglecting equity/diversity efforts because of state budget crises. At the other end of the spectrum are the deliberate efforts being made to systematically dismantle equity and diversity work in especially politically conservative states. Conrad, C., & Gasman, M.

Engaging the \"Race Question\" : Accountability and Equity in U.S. Higher Education. New York, NY: Teachers College Press, Columbia University. Through case studies of college faculty, administrators, and student affairs professionals engaged in inquiry using the Equity Scorecard, the book clarifies the \"muddled conversation\" that colleges and universities are having about equity. \"Engaging the \"Race Question\" illustrates how practitioner inquiry can be used to address the \"race question\" with wisdom and calls on college leaders and educators to change the policies and practices that perpetuate institutional and structural racism\u2014and provides a blueprint for doing so. Fiske, S.T. (2014). Envy up, scorn down: How status divides us. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation. Although the United States prides itself on the principle of equal opportunity for all, equality in many aspects of American society is obscure. With the gap between rich and poor widening in recent years, social class now defines individuals and creates tensions among groups. In Envy Up, Scorn Down, social psychologist Susan Fiske explores the relationships between classes within American society, and analyzes the social consequences of interpersonal and intergroup comparisons in everyday life. Through recent psychological studies as well as her own, Fisk demonstrates how both envy and scorn yield distinctive biological, emotions, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics. Perceived status correlates with race, gender, ethnicity, and education, and all groups and societies rank their members. This book carefully reveals how relieving the effects of envy and scorn can prove important in moving forward in our society. Fiske, S.T., & Markus, H.R. (2012). Facing social class: How societal rank influences interaction. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation. Because Americans believe strongly in the principle of equal opportunity for all, many hold fast to the idea that class and status do not matter. In Facing Social Class, however, social psychologists Susan Fisk and Hazel Markus argue that social class undoubtedly affects how individuals interact with others from casual exchanges to interactions at school, work, and home. These social psychologists reveal an extreme contradiction between the idea of equality and the reality of growing inequality within the United States. Most specifically, it shows how tensions amongst classes are reflected in cultural values, institutional practices, and psychological tendencies. This book reveals these realities, all the while exposing what can be done to alleviate the effects of inequality in a society where social mobility is nearly impossible. Freire, P. (2000). Pedagogy of the oppressed. New York, NY: Bloomsbury. In urban areas in both the United States and Western Europe, a permanent underclass composed of underprivileged peoples and minorities has become an accepted norm. In his book Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire seeks to empower impoverished and illiterate peoples as they struggle in cities across the world. Originally published in Portuguese in 1968, this new edition with an introduction recounting Freire's life and the impact of this book for the past fifty years will inspire and new generation of people. Educators and students will find this book especially interesting, yet the book accessible to anyone interest in the diversity issues. Fried, J. (2016). Of Education, Fishbowls, and Rabbit Holes. Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. This book questions some of our most ingrained assumptions, not only about the nature of teaching and learning, but about what constitutes education, and about the cultural determinants of what is taught. Jane Fried deconstructs the Grand Western Narrative of teaching and learning, describing it is a cultural fishbowl through which we see the world, rarely aware of the fishbowl itself, be it disciplinary constricts or the definition of liberal education. Ginsberg, M.B, & Wlodokowski, R.J. (2009). Diversity & motivation: Culturally responsive teaching in college. (2nd ed.). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Since 1995, this book has served as a leading resource for faculty and administrators looking for effective ways to promote motivation among culturally diverse student groups.

With concrete examples from the experience of the authors, this book outline for educators the norms, practices, and tools necessary for establishing inclusion, developing a positive attitude, enhancing meaning, and engendering competence. The ideas presented in this volume are useful for faculty and staff across disciplines and different secondary education settings. Glaser, J. & Ryan, T. (2013). Changing minds, if not hearts: Political remedies for racial conflict. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press. Changing Minds, If Not Hearts explores political strategies that counteract the impulse of racial majorities to think about racial issues as a zero-sum game, in which a win for one group means a loss for another. James M. Glaser and Timothy J. Ryan argue that, although political processes often inflame racial tensions, the tools of politics also can alleviate conflict. Gonzales, Roberto G. (2016). Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America. Oakland, CA: University of California Press. This book discusses the results of a twelve-year study that followed 150 undocumented young adults in Los Angeles. Gonzales sheds light on the disastrous effects immigration policies have had on more than two million children coming of age in the United States. Lives in Limbo questions the function of a system that integrates children into K-12 schools but ultimately denies them the rewards of their labor. Gordon, E.W., and Bridglall, B.L. (2007). Affirmative development: Cultivating academic ability. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. According to Gordon and Bridglall, the ability to learn is more of a developed human capacity than a fixed aptitude with which one is born. They argue that the emergence of academic ability is associated with exposure to specialized cultures that privilege the attitudes, knowledge, and skills that schools reward. Children who are born to and raised in these cultures tend to do well in school, while those who are not exposed to such cultures tend seldom rise to high levels of academic achievement. Groccia, J.E., (Al-Sudairy), M.A.T.A., & Buskist, W.F. (Eds.). (2012). Handbook of college and university teaching: A global perspective (1st ed.). SAGE Publications, Inc.

Recognizing the importance of diversity as a means of embracing the experiences, perspectives and expertise of other cultures, this book shares what has been most effective in helping institutions to create an atmosphere and a campus culture that not only admits students, faculty and staff of color but accepts and welcomes their presence and participation. This is a landmark reference for every institution concerned with inclusivity and diversity. The successes it presents offers academic leaders much they can learn from, and ideas and procedures they can adapt, as they discuss and develop their own campus policies and initiatives. Hayes, E., & Flannery, D.D. (2000). Women as learners: The significance of gender in adult learning. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. This book explores and analyzes learning as a distinctive experience for women. The authors are all established adult education professionals and recognized authorities on women as adult learners.

(Summer 2014). \"Hidden roads: Nonnative English-speaking international professors in the classroom.\" New Directions for Teaching and Learning, (138), San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. International professors and teaching assistants exist in great numbers in colleges and universities across the country. Nevertheless, many nonnative English speaking academics fail to appear in and contribute to the literature available on higher education practices. This volume of New Directions for Teaching and Learning covers a variety of experiences, such as faculty of color teaching intercultural communication, international teaching assistants' attitudes toward their US students, and the challenges to existing cultural assumptions in the US classroom. These challenges and contributions are insightful for students, faculty, and administrators attempting to close the gap between non-native English speaking academics and students. Hooks, B. (1994). Teaching to transgress: Education as the practice of freedom. New York, NY: Routledge. Bell Hooks--writer, teacher, and insurgent black intellectual--writes about a new kind of education, education as the practice of freedom. Teaching students to \"transgress\" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom is, for hooks, the teacher's most important goal. He speaks to the heart of education today: how can we rethink teaching practices in the age of multiculturalism? What do we do about teachers who do not want to teach, and students who do not want to learn? How should we deal with racism and sexism in the classroom? Howell, A. & Tuitt, F. (2003). Race and higher education. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Educational Review. This book guides educators toward a better understanding of how changes in the student population have resulted in the need for new approaches to classroom instruction. By including voices form inside classrooms along with analyses from scholarly researchers, this volume provides college and university teachers, administrators, students, and scholars with a critical instrument for improving higher education.

Landsman, J., & Lewis, C. (2011). White Teachers/ Diverse Classrooms (2nd Ed.). Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. This book encourages reflection and self-examination, calls for understanding how students can achieve and expecting the most from them. It demonstrates what's involved in terms of recognizing often-unconscious biases, confronting institutional racism where it occurs, surmounting stereotyping, adopting culturally relevant teaching, connecting with parents and the community, and integrating diversity in all activities. This book is replete with examples of practice and telling insights that will engage teachers in practice or in service. Lee, A. (2017). Teaching interculturally. Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. How can I simultaneously support students' critical engagement with course content and develop their intercultural awareness? Most faculty have multiple diversities present in any given classroom or academic program whether from an influx of international students or an increase of students from low-income, first generation, and/or racial/ethnic minority populations and are concerned about how to maintain a rigorous curriculum and ensure that all their students succeed, given disparate backgrounds and varying degrees of prior knowledge. This book provides faculty and instructors with a theoretical foundation, practical tools, and an iterative and reflective process for designing and implementing an intercultural pedagogy. The authors offer a framework that is flexible enough to be responsive to the experience, environment, and particulars of a given teaching and learning situation. The text incorporates narrative text by the authors, as well as first-person reflections, classroom activities, and annotated assignments that illustrate the dynamic process of intention, experiment/implement, critique, and refinement that characterize pedagogy and intercultural interaction. Lee, E. (2016). Class and Campus Life. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. This book illuminates the ways in which the students' and the college's practices interact, rather than evaluating them separately, as seemingly unrelated spheres. It also analyzes underlying moral judgments brought to light through cultural connotations of merit, hard work by individuals, and making it on your own that permeate American higher education. Using students' own descriptions and understandings of their experiences to illustrate the complexity of these issues, Lee shows how the lived experience of socioeconomic difference is often defined in moral, as well as economic, terms, and that tensions, often unspoken, undermine students' senses of belonging. Michigan State School of Journalism (2016). To my professor: What college students really say about their teachers. Canton, MI: Read The Spirit Books This book gives professors a glimpse into what students really think, but will seldom say to their professors directly. The book has perspectives from students who live at the margins, transfer students, students with invisible challenges, and veteran students. Following their statements, professors can find strategies and resources for better college instruction that include teaching a growing variety of students, being flexible and fair, recovering from mistakes, dealing with racial tensions, and using humor. Moody, J. (2012). Faculty diversity: Removing the barriers (2nd Ed.) New York, NY: Routledge. This book explores this important question and provides steps for hastening faculty diversity.

Ouelett, M.L. (2005). Teaching inclusively: Resources for course, department & institutional change in higher education. Stillwater, OK: New Forums. This book brings together a broad array of current \"best practices\" in the design, implementation, and assessment of multicultural change initiatives on college and university campuses. Readers will find that this volume advocates for more transparent connections between change initiatives at individual, departmental, and college-wide levels by highlighting the ways in which such practices and change goals can relate to and support each other, thus addressing a noticeable absence in the current available literature. Page, S.E. (2007). The difference: How the power of diversity creates better groups, firms, schools, and societies. Princeton: Princeton UP. In this book, the author redefines the way we understand ourselves in relation to one another. It is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities. Pasque, P., Ortega, N., Burkhardt, J., & Ting, M. (2016). Transforming understandings of diversity in higher education: Demography, democracy, & discourse. Sterling, VA: Stylus. A distinguished group of diversity scholars explore the latest discourse on diversity and how it is reflected in research and practice. The chapters trace how the discourse on diversity is newly shaped after many of the 20th century concepts of race, ethnicity, gender and class have lost authority. In the academic disciplines and in public discourse, perspectives about diversity have been rapidly shifting in recent years. This is especially true in the United States where demographic changes and political attitudes have prompted new observationssome which will clash with traditional frameworks. Pope, R.L., Reynolds, A.L. & Mueller, J.A. (2004). Multicultural competence in affairs. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, A Wiley Imprint. Today's leaders in higher education are focused on creating multicultural campuses. However, most higher education and student affairs professionals receive limited training for understanding the complexity of multicultural issues. If multiculturalism is to flourish on college campuses, education professionals must develop the sensitivity and awareness in affirming relevant multicultural issues and develop the skills needed to offer meaningful services to all their students. This book is a unique resource that offers student affairs practitioners and faculty a guide that features a model of core competencies that embraces the broad scope of multicultural issues including race, class, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, and abilities. Quina, K. & Bronstein, P. (Eds.). (2003). Teaching gender and multicultural awareness. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association. This book provides information about how to integrate topics of diversity into a variety of psychology courses and programs of study. Because psychology now contains a rich body of knowledge that reaches across gender, social, and cultural lines, a single class about gender or cross-cultural studies is no longer sufficient to teach students about multiculturalism. Instead, such issues need to be incorporated into each part of the psychology curriculum. Rosser, S.V. (1995). Teaching the majority: Breaking the gender barrier in science, mathematics, and engineering. New York: Teachers College. This book represents pioneering work in teaching by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to attract and retain women. Each chapter in this edited volume is written by a teacher who has transformed her or his course to appeal successfully to women students in particular, while retaining its appeal for male students. Sander, R.H., & Taylor Jr., S. (2012). Mismatch: How affirmative action hurts students it's intended to help, and why universities won't admit it. New York, NY: Basic Books. Over the past four decades, opinions on affirmative action have ranged from an effort to ignite integration in higher education, to an unfair quota system. The real question, however, is whether or not affirmative action has actually helped underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in admissions. With the Supreme Court set to reevaluate affirmative action, professors Sander and Taylor argue that affirmative action has in fact harmed underrepresented minorities due to \"mismatch\" - where students of color who are given preference fall behind and never catch up to better prepared classmates. Supported by research and many recommendations, Mismatch calls for an examination of affirmative action and for reforms that will help realize the ultimate goal of racial equality. Sensoy, O. & DiAngelo, R. (2012). Is everyone really equal? New York, NY: Teachers College Press.

This book is based on a qualitative study that integrates a sociological and higher education theoretical framework to examine the impact of mentoring programs on students' acquisition of institutional cultural capital and social capital during their college experience. This book also offers an innovative mentoring model that illuminates how students can navigate the hidden curriculum of higher education. Steele, C. M. (2011). Whistling Vivaldi: How stereotypes affect us and what we can do (Reprint.). New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company. Claude M. Steele, who has been called \"one of the few great social psychologists,\" offers a vivid first-person account of the research that supports his groundbreaking conclusions on stereotypes and identity. He sheds new light on American social phenomena from racial and gender gaps in test scores to the belief in the superior athletic prowess of black men, and lays out a plan for mitigating these \"stereotype threats\" and reshaping American identities. Sue, D.W. (2010). Microaggressions in everyday life: Race, gender, and sexual orientation. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. Microaggression is the use of social norms that produce unintended discrimination. This phenomenon is a very real problem within our culture, yet many individuals do not recognize its occurrence. This book looks at the different types of microaggressions and their psychological effects on both performers and the often targeted members of disadvantaged groups. Dr. Sue suggests psychological means to make our society free of these experiences. Microaggressions in everyday life is a wonderful read for anyone who deals with diversity, as it brings awareness and understanding to the idea. It provides a practical guide with the goal of eventual dissolution Tatum, B.D. (2003). \"Why are a;; the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?\" New York, NY: Basic Books. Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see Black, White, and Latino youth clustered in their own groups. Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, argues that straight talk about our racial identities is essential if we are serious about enabling communication across racial and ethnic divides. These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of race in America. Thompson, A., & Cuseo, J. (2012).

This book addresses the growing awareness of, and need to address, the systemic practices and barriers that contribute to inequitable educational outcomes for racially and ethnically diverse students. This volume illuminates the global relevance of critical and inclusive pedagogies and demonstrates how their application can transform the teaching and learning process and promote more equitable educational outcomes among all students but especially racially minoritized students. Weber, L. (2009). Understanding race, class, gender, and sexuality: A Conceptual Framework (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press, USA. Understanding Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality: A Conceptual Framework, Second Edition, is the only text that develops a theoretical framework for the analysis of intersectionality. Weber argues that these social systems are historically and geographically contextual power relationships that are simultaneously expressed and experienced at both the macro level of social institutions and the micro level of individual lives and small groups. This is also the only text that teaches students how to apply the theory to their own analyses. Wise, T. (2011). White like me: Reflections on race from a privileged son. 2nd Ed. Berkley, CA: Soft Skull. In the second edition of this book, Tim Wise utilizes a series of critical essays alongside his own memoir to explore his privileged experience as a white American. This book examines issues of employment, education, housing, criminal justice, etc., and how racial privilege shapes the lives of Americans, such as Wise. For a society that limits issues of race to just African Americans, Wise argues that racial privilege that white Americans experience is just as detrimental to progressive social change. White Like Me explores how whites can challenge privilege and why it is important to do so. Dialogue and Discussion Brookfield, S., & Preskill, S. (2016).

Berk, R.A. (2013). Top 10 flashpoints in student ratings and the evaluation of teaching: What faculty and administrators must know to protect themselves in employment decisions. Sterling, Virginia: Stylus. The \"flashpoints\" covered are the topics that pop up the most frequently and heatedly on listservs, blogs, and the literature. Each flashpoint is defined succinctly, options are presented, and then evidence-based recommendations for concrete action steps are proffered in an effort to stop the popping. The recommendations are grounded in psychometric, professional, and legal standards. The last-named, in particular, can protect you from costly litigation. Boice, R. (2000). Advice for New Faculty Members. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon. Advice for New Faculty Members: Nihil Nimus is a unique and essential guide to the start of a successful academic career. As its title suggests (nothing in excess), it advocates moderation in ways of working, based on the single-most reliable difference between new faculty who thrive and those who struggle. By following its practical, easy-to-use rules, novice faculty can learn to teach with the highest levels of student approval, involvement, and comprehension, with only modest preparation times and a greater reliance on spontaneity and student participation. Similarly, new faculty can use its rule-based practices to write with ease, increasing productivity, creativity, and publishability through brief, daily sessions of focused and relaxed work. And they can socialize more successfully by learning about often-misunderstood aspects of academic culture, including mentoring. Each rule in Advice for New Faculty Members has been tested on hundreds of new faculty and proven effective over the long run -- even in attaining permanent appointment. Boice, R. (1990). Professors as writers: A self-help guide to productive writing. Stillwater, Okla., U.S.A.: New Forums. This book helps scholars master writing as a productive, enjoyable, and successful experience. The author prepared this self-help manual for professors who want to write more productively, painlessly, and successfully. It reflects the author's two decades of experiences and research with professors as writers -- by compressing a lot of experience into a brief, programmatic framework. Like the actual sessions and workshops in which the author works with writers, this book admonishes and reassures. Brookfield, S. (1995). Becoming a critically reflective teacher. Jossey-Bass. Building on the insights of his highly acclaimed earlier work, The Skillful Teacher, and applying the principles of adult learning, Brookfield thoughtfully guides teachers through the processes of becoming critically reflective about teaching, confronting the contradictions involved in creating democratic classrooms, and using critical reflection as a tool for ongoing personal and professional development. Geller, A.E., Eodice, M. (2013). Working with Faculty Writers. Boulder, CO: University Press of Colorado. The imperative to write and to publish is a relatively new development in the history of academia, yet it is now a significant factor in the culture of higher education. Working with Faculty Writers takes a broad view of faculty writing support, advocating its value for tenure-track professors, adjuncts, senior scholars, and graduate students. The authors in this volume imagine productive campus writing support for faculty and future faculty that allows for new insights about their own disciplinary writing and writing processes, as well as the development of fresh ideas about student writing. Contributors from a variety of institution types and perspectives consider who faculty writers are and who they may be in the future, reveal the range of locations and models of support for faculty writers, explore the ways these might be delivered and assessed, and consider the theoretical, philosophical, political, and pedagogical approaches to faculty writing support, as well as its relationship to student writing support. With the pressure on faculty to be productive researchers and writers greater than ever, this is a must-read volume for administrators, faculty, and others involved in developing models of faculty writing support.

New York, NY: Penguin Random House LLC. In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? Carey's search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday lives\u2014and less of a chore. Cavanagh, S.R. (2016). The Spark of Learning: Energizing the College Classroom with the Science of Emotion. Morgantown, WV: West Virginia University Press.

When it was first published in 1997, this book became the gold standard reference for both new and experienced college faculty. Like the first edition, this book is based on a learner-centered approach. Because faculty members are now deeply committed to engaging students in learning, the syllabus has evolved into a useful, if lengthy, document. Today's syllabus provides details about course objectives, requirements and expectations, and also includes information about teaching philosophies, specific activities and the rationale for their use, and tools essential to student success. Halpern, D. F. & Hakel, M. D. (Eds.). (2002). Applying the science of learning to university teaching and beyond, new directions for teaching and learning, No. 89. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. This issue of New Directions for Teaching and Learning seeks to build on empirically validated learning activities to enhance what and how much is learned and how well and how long it is remembered. Thus, the movement for a real science of learning - the application of scientific principles to the study of learning - has taken hold both under the controlled conditions of the laboratory and in the messy real-world settings where most of us go about the business of teaching and learning.

Laurillard, D. (2012). Teaching as a design science: Building pedagogical patterns for learning and technology. New York, NY: Routledge. This book focuses on the changing dynamics of teaching. It is no longer simply about passing on knowledge to the next generation. Teachers in the twenty-first century, in all educational sectors, have to cope with an ever-changing cultural and technological environment. Teaching is now a design science. Like other design professionals - architects, engineers, programmers - teachers have to work out creative and evidence-based ways of improving what they do. Yet teaching is not treated as a design profession. Little, D, Felten, P. & Berry C. (eds). (Spring 2015). \"Looking and learning: Visual literacy across the disciplines.\" New Directions for Teaching and Learning, (141), San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Although faculty members strive to focus on inclusive teaching practices in the classroom, the authors in this edition of New Directions for Teaching and Learning note that not all students learn in the same way. This volume focuses on the best practices for teaching students with social, economic, gender, or ethnic differences, as well as ways to adjust teaching and learning to focus on inclusion. With the proper techniques of inclusive learning, all students can learn and retain more information.

(2011) Academically adrift: limited learning on college campuses. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. In spite of soaring tuition costs, more and more students go to college every year. A bachelor's degree is now required for entry into a growing number of professions. And some parents begin planning for the expense of sending their kids to college when they're born. Almost everyone strives to go, but almost no one asks the fundamental question posed by Academically Adrift: are undergraduates really learning anything once they get there? The authors answer to that question is a definitive no. Their extensive research draws on survey responses, transcript data, and, for the first time, the state-of-the-art Collegiate Learning Assessment, a standardized test administered to students in their first semester and then again at the end of their second year. Astin, A. (2016). Are you Smart Enough? . Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. This book explores the many ways in which the obsession with \"being smart\" distorts the life of a typical college or university, and how this obsession leads to a higher education that shortchanges the majority of students, and by extension, our society's need for an educated population. Astin calls on his colleagues in higher education to return the focus to the true mission of developing the potential of each student. Bain, K. (2012). What the best college students do.

Bennett, J.B. (2003). Academic life: Hospitality, ethics, and spirituality. Eugene, OR: Ankler Publishing. This guide reveals two modes of leadership. The first accepts academic conflict and advances one agenda over another through heroic leadership. The second encourages transparency with others and highlights contributions that follow. Bennett argues that understanding leadership styles must precede decision-making. Understanding the community that one leads directs decision-making, creates structure, initiates processes, and upholds values. This book is helpful for those looking to understand and build a stronger academic community. Blumenstyk, G. (2015). American higher education in crisis? What everyone needs to know. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Because tuition prices are at an all time high in the United States, administrators are questioning how to decrease costs while proving that American higher education is important to economic mobility. This analysis by Goldie Blumenstyk traces the history of the higher education system, noting the trends that brought education to what it is today. American Higher Education in Crisis focuses on debates involving economic and racial inequalities, faculty tenure, affordability, and more. The recommendations for the future of education as set forth by Blumenstyk give hope that issues of cost, diversity, and academia will be resolved with the rise of alternative-education. Bok, D. (2006). Our underachieving colleges: A candid look at how much students learn and why they should be learning more. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Overall, despite their vastly increased resources, more powerful technology, and hundreds of new courses, colleges cannot be confident that students are learning more than they did fifty years ago. Looking further, Bok finds that many important college courses are left to the least experienced teachers and that most professors continue to teach in ways that have proven to be less effective than other available methods. In reviewing their educational programs, however, faculties typically ignore this evidence. Instead, they spend most of their time discussing what courses to require, although the lasting impact of college will almost certainly depend much more on how the courses are taught.

The great American university: Its rise to preeminence, it indispensable national role, why it must be protected. Philadelphia, PA: Perseus Book Group. Since its inception in the nineteenth century, the American research university has become an enigma. These institutions have discovered some of the most important developments in science and engineering. Nonetheless, this system is now under attack because of the emergence of many conservative policies. This book reveals how the disappearance of this type of institution economically threatens our nation. It is informative for higher education professionals, as well as those generally interested in the fate of higher education institutions. Cranton, P. (2016). Understanding and Promoting Transformative Learning: A Guide to Theory and Practice. (3rd ed.) Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. The third edition of Patricia Cranton's Understanding and Promoting Transformative Learning brings a wealth of new insight from the tremendous growth in the field during the decade since the previous edition.

The first part of the book is dedicated to clarifying transformative learning theory and relating it to other theoretical frameworks. In the second half of the book, the focus is squarely on strategies for promoting transformative learning in a wide variety of adult and higher education contexts. Crow, M.M., & Dabars, W.B. (2015). Designing the new American university. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Although research universities have long been considered the \"gold standard\" for American higher education institutions, they no longer accomplish their purpose. Since the nineteenth century, the research universities existent in the United States have only incrementally evolved. The need for a new model that offers accessibility to an academic platform underpinned by knowledge production is critical to our survival and economic competitiveness. In Designing the New American University, Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University, and coauthor William B. Dabars, a higher education historian, suggest a new model for the public research university, which Crow implemented at ASU. This model is an egalitarian institution committed to academic excellence, inclusiveness to a broad demographic, and maximum societal impact. Both public and private higher education leaders may utilize this model in their respective contexts. Daloz, S.P. (2011).

They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. Fish, S.E. (2008). Save the world on your own time. Oxford England: Oxford UP. In this book, the author, Stanley Fish argues that, however laudable these goals might be, there is but one proper role for the academe in society: to advance bodies of knowledge and to equip students for doing the same. When teachers offer themselves as moralists, political activists, or agents of social change rather than as credentialed experts in a particular subject and the methods used to analyze it, they abdicate their true purpose. Furstenberg, F.F. (2013). Behind the academic curtain: How to find success and happiness with a PhD. Chicago: University of Chicago. In this book the author offers a clear and user-friendly map to this maze. Drawing on decades of experience in academia, he provides a comprehensive, empirically grounded, and, most important of all, practical guide to academic life. Gardner, H., & Davis, K. (2013). The app generation: How today's youth navigate identity, intimacy, and imagination in a digital world. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Yale University Press.

Johansson, C., & Felten, P. (2014). Transforming students: Fulfilling the promise of higher education. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. The modern-day attitude of incoming and current students on American Higher Education greatly varies across colleges and universities nationwide. The majority of students, and parents, believe that going to college provides a chance to mature and grow. As educators at the college level, Charity Jonson and Peter Felten argue against this view, noting that the central purpose of a college or university is to transform the lives of students. Through extensive interviews with students and graduates, Johnson and Felten highlight how students today view the college experience, while simultaneously giving advice for colleges to prepare students for the real world, rather than just a career. Kadison, R. & DiGeronimo, T.F. (2004). College of the overwhelmed. San Francisco, CA: A Wiley Imprint. Kadison and DiGeronimo do a commendable job of outlining the many stresses students face, such as academic pressure, financial problems, and feelings of social inadequacy and, for women, a fear of sexual assault. The authors outline the self-destructive coping mechanisms adopted by those with emotional problems, including easting disorders, drug abuse, cutting, and suicide attempts. Parents will find sensible suggestions for helping their children deal with college life. Knowlton, D.S., & Hagopian, K.J. (eds). (Fall 2013). \"From entitlement to engagement: Affirming millennial students' egos in the higher education classroom.\" New Directions for Teaching and Learning, (135), San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. In this volume of New Directions for Teaching and Learning, the authors address the theories and practices for dealing with the students known as Millennials. Millenials are addicted to technology, demand service more than education, and maintain very narrow perspectives on themselves and others, which is very frustrating for professors. The authors demonstrate how professors can collaborate with Millenials in the learning process, and how to not force all students under this stereotype. Through reevaluating pedagogical practices, relationships with students, and the norms of the college classroom, this volume reveals how new and better educational outcomes can emerge. Knox, E. (2017) Trigger warnings: History, theory, and Littlefield. With \"triggered\" as Google's most searched word of 2016, trigger warnings have become a prevalent yet controversial concept in American higher education and society. As the debate over the value and place of triggering material continues, Trigger Warnings: History, Theory, Context provides the historical context and theoretical analysis of the use of trigger and content warnings in academia. This important edited collection examines the history, theories, and ethics of trigger warnings and presents case studies from instructors and students describing instances when trigger warnings were and were not used. By exploring the issue through several scholarly lenses and providing examples of when trigger warnings may or may not be used effectively, Trigger Warnings provides rigorous analysis of the controversy.

Out of Our Minds answers three vital questions for all organizations that have a serious strategic interest in creativity and innovation. Rockmore, D. (2017). What are the arts and sciences?: A guide for the curious. Lebanon, NH: Dartmouth College Press. What constitutes the study of philosophy or physics? What exactly does an anthropologist do, or a geologist or historian? In short, what are the arts and sciences? While many of us have been to college and many aspire to go, we may still wonder just what the various disciplines represent and how they interact. What are their origins, methods, applications, and unique challenges? What kind of people elect to go into each of these fields, and what are the big issues that motivate them? Curious to explore these questions himself, Dartmouth College professor and mathematician Dan Rockmore asked his colleagues to explain their fields and what it is that they do. The result is an accessible, entertaining, and enlightening survey of the ideas and subjects that contribute to a liberal education. The book offers a doorway to the arts and sciences for anyone intrigued by the vast world of ideas. Rosen, B.C. (1998).

Unlike Millennials, Generation Z students grew up in a recession and are under no illusions about their prospects for employment after college. While skeptical about the cost and value of higher education, they are also entrepreneurial, innovative, and independent learners concerned with effecting social change. Understanding Generation Z's mindset and goals is paramount to supporting, developing, and educating them through higher education. Senge, P., Kleiner, A., Roberts, C., Ross, R., & Smith, B.(1994).

Throughout this book, Brookfield informs teachers of four assumptions under which to operate: that skillful teaching boils down to whatever helps students learn, that the best teachers adopt a critically reflective stance towards their practice, that the most important knowledge we need to do good work is an awareness of how students are experiencing their own learning and our teaching, and that we should always aim to treat students as adults. Brookfield restates many of the insights from previous editions of this book, yet interprets them in new contexts, such as online learning and increasingly diverse classrooms. With six additional chapters, this guide will certainly aid all types of teachers in transforming their respective classrooms. Chism, N.V.N. (1999).

Instead, it is concerned primarily with fostering in students a sense of self-authorship and a notion of knowledge that they can use to respond to complex questions, issues, or problems. Most faculty members have disciplinary terminal degrees, little preparation for teaching, and previous experience learning and teaching solely in disciplinary classroom settings. This collection is designed to assist both new and experienced faculty members who are teaching in interdisciplinary settings and who want to advance integrative learning with their students, as well as administrators who want to encourage integrative and interdisciplinary teaching in their institutions. The contributors offer many intriguing approaches for achieving the goals of the interdisciplinary pedagogy. Eble, K.E. (1988). The craft of teaching: to mastering the professor's art.
