This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. MenQuadfi solution for injection Meningococcal Group A, C, W and Y conjugate vaccine One dose (0.5 mL) contains: | | Neisseria to tetanus toxoid protein | | 10 micrograms 10 micrograms 10 micrograms 10 micrograms 55 micrograms For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. Solution for injection. Clear colourless solution. MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations. Posology Primary vaccination: Individuals 12 months of age and older: One single dose (0.5 mL). Booster vaccination: A single 0.5 mL dose of MenQuadfi may be used to boost subjects who have previously received a meningococcal vaccine containing the same serogroups (see section 5.1). Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with MenQuadfi are available up to 7 years after vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). There are no data available to indicate the need for or timing of a booster dose of MenQuadfi (see section 5.1). Other paediatric population The safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi in individuals under 12 months of age have not yet been established. Method of administration For intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid region or anterolateral thigh depending on the recipient's age and muscle mass. For instructions on handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or after previous administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components. Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. MenQuadfi should not be administered subcutaneously, intravascularly or intradermally. It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical examination. Hypersensitivity As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. Intercurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination. Syncope Syncope (fainting) and other anxietyrelated reactions can occur following or even before any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling or injury and to manage syncope. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders MenQuadfi should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. Protection MenQuadfi will only protect against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y. The vaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. As with any vaccine, vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all vaccine recipients. Waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against serogroup A when using human complement in the assay (hSBA) has been reported for MenQuadfi and other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. However, if an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure to serogroup A and received a dose of MenQuadfi more than approximately one year previously, consideration may be given to administering a booster dose. Lower hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) against serogroup A have been observed after a single dose of MenQuadfi was administered to toddlers who previously received serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM) during infancy. Nevertheless, seroprotection rates were comparable between treatment groups (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. This aspect might be considered for individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM vaccine in their first year of life. Immunodeficiency It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited (see section 4.5). Persons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk of invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with MenQuadfi. No data on immunocompromised patients are available. Tetanus immunisation Immunisation with MenQuadfi vaccine does not substitute for routine tetanus immunisation. Co-administration of MenQuadfi with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine does not impair the response to tetanus toxoid or impact the safety. Sodium content This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. Use with other vaccines Injection sites on separate limbs and separate syringes must be used in the case of concomitant administration. For ages 12-23 months, MenQuadfi can be co-administered with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) and varicella vaccine (V), combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines (HBV), inactivated poliovirus (IPV) or influenzae type toxoid) vaccine 10-17 can be co-administered with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) vaccine (adsorbed, reduced antigen(s) content) (Tdap) and human papillomavirus vaccine (recombinant, adsorbed) (HPV). There was no impact on the immune response to MenQuadfi when a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine was co-administered. MenQuadfi can be administered concomitantly with PCV-13. Lower hSBA GMTs on day 30 post-dose for serogroup A has been observed when given concommitantly. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. As a precaution in children 12-23 months of age at high risk for serogroup A disease, consideration might be given for administration of MenQuadfi and PCV-13 vaccines separately. Meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve children aged 10-17 years had non inferior response for PT and lower antibody responses to FHA, PRN and FIM when Tdap vaccine was administered concomitantly with MenQuadfi and HPV compared to co-administration with HPV vaccine alone. The clinical implications of the observed pertussis antigen responses also observed with the existing quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines are unknown. Concomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably contralateral. Concomitant administration of MenQuadfi and other vaccines than those listed above has not been studied. Use with systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment an adequate immune response may not be elicited (see also section 4.4). Pregnancy There is limited amount of data on the use of MenQuadfi in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). MenQuadfi should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefits for the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those for the foetus. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether MenQuadfi is excreted in human milk. MenQuadfi should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks. Fertility A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rabbits. There were no effects on mating performances or female fertility. No study was conducted on male fertility (see section 5.3). MenQuadfi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \"Undesirable effects\" may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Summary of the safety profile The safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in individuals 12 months of age and older was evaluated in seven randomized, active-controlled, multi-centre pivotal studies. In these studies, 6,308 subjects received either a primary dose (N=5,906) or a booster dose (N=402) of MenQuadfi and were included in the safety analyses. This included 1,389 toddlers aged 12 through 23 months of age, 498 children aged 2 through 9 years, 2,289 adolescents aged 10 through 17 years, 1,684 adults aged 18 through 55 years, 199 older adults aged 56 through 64 years, and 249 elderly aged 65 years and older. Of these, 392 adolescents received MenQuadfi co-administered with Tdap and HPV, (N=200) or PCV-13 (N=200). The most frequently reported adverse reactions within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi alone in toddlers 12 through 23 months of age were irritability (36.7%) and injection site tenderness (30.6%) and in ages 2 years and above were injection site pain (38.7%) and myalgia (30.5%). These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. Rates of adverse reactions after a booster dose of MenQuadfi in adolescents and adults at least 15 years of age were comparable to those seen in adolescents and adults who received a primary dose of MenQuadfi. Rates of adverse reactions within 7 days following vaccination among toddlers were comparable when MMR+V were given concomitantly with or without MenQuadfi, and when DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib was given with or without MenQuadfi. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher in toddlers who received PCV-13 given concomitantly with MenQuadfi (36.5%) than in toddlers who received PCV-13 alone (17.2%). In one additional clinical study, adolescents and adults 13-26 years of age primed with MenQuadfi 3-6 years previously Bexsero (N=92). Rates and intensity of systemic reactions within 7 days following vaccination tended to be higher when MenQuadfi was given concomitantly with MenB vaccine than when MenQuadfi was given alone. The most common solicited systemic reaction was myalgia, of mild intensity, which was experienced more frequently in adolescents and adults who received MenQuadfi and MenB vaccine concomitantly (Trumenba, 65.2%; Bexsero, those who received MenQuadfi alone (32.8%). Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following adverse reactions, as listed below, have been identified from clinical studies conducted with MenQuadfi when given alone to subjects 2 years of age and older. The safety profile observed in toddlers aged 12 through 23 months is presented in the paediatric population section. The adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (1/10); Common (1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Table 1: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions following administration of MenQuadfi from clinical trials in subjects 2 years of age and above | | MedDRA System Organ Class | | Frequency | | Adverse reactions | | Blood and lymphatic system disorders | | Rare | | Lymphadenopathy | | Nervous system disorders | | Very common | | Headache | | Uncommon | | Dizziness | | Gastrointestinal disorders | | Uncommon | | Vomiting, nausea | | Rare | | Diarrhoea, stomach pain | | Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders | | Rare | | Urticaria, pruritus, rash | | Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders | | Very common | | Myalgia | | Rare | | Pain in extremity | | General disorders and administration site conditions | | Very common | | Malaise | | Injection site pain | | Common | | Fever | | At the injection site: swelling, erythema | | Uncommon | | Fatigue | | At the injection site: pruritus, warmth, bruising, rash | | Rare | | Chills, axillary pain | | At the injection site: induration Paediatric population The safety profile of MenQuadfi in children and adolescents 2 through 17 years of age was generally comparable to that in adults. Injection site erythema and swelling at the MenQuadfi injection site were reported more frequently in children 2 through 9 years of age (very common) than in the older age groups. In toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, injection site erythema and swelling (very common) at the MenQuadfi injection site, vomiting (common) and diarrhoea (common), were reported more frequently than in the older age groups. The following additional reactions, as listed below in Table 2, have been reported very commonly or commonly following administration of MenQuadfi in toddlers during clinical trials: Table 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions following administration of MenQuadfi from clinical trials in subjects 12 months through 23 months | | MedDRA System Organ Class | | Frequency | | Adverse reactions | | Metabolic and nutrition disorders | | Very common | | Appetite lost | | Psychiatric disorders | | Very common | | Irritability | | Uncommon | | Insomnia | | Nervous system disorders | | Very common | | Drowsiness | | Gastrointestinal disorders | | Common | | Vomiting, diarrhoea | | Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders | | Uncommon | | Urticaria | | General disorders and administration site conditions | | Very Common | | Abnormal crying | | At the injection site: tenderness/pain, erythema, swelling | | Common | | Fever | | Uncommon | | At the injection site: pruritus, induration, bruising, rash Older population Overall, within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi, the same injection site and systemic adverse reactions were observed in older (56 years of age) and younger adults (18 through 55 years old) but at lower frequencies; except for injection site pruritus, which was more frequent (common) in older adults. These adverse reactions mostly were mild or moderate in intensity. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Yellow Card Scheme at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. Overdose with MenQuadfi is unlikely due to its presentation as a single dose vial. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. Pharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines ATC code: J07AH08 Mechanism of action Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal diseases via complement mediated bactericidal activity. MenQuadfi induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for primary vaccination in toddlers (12-23 months of age), children and adolescents (2-17 years of age), adults (18-55 years of age) and older adults (56 years and above) was assessed in six pivotal studies and in one additional study in toddlers (12-23 months of age). The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for booster vaccination (subjects 15-55 years of age) was assessed in one pivotal study. In addition, antibody persistence after primary vaccination and immunogenicity of a booster dose was assessed in three studies in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults (59 years of age). Primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted by measuring serum bactericidal activity (SBA) using human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). Rabbit complement (rSBA) data are available in subsets in all age groups and generally follows the trends observed with human complement (hSBA) data. In addition, all subjects were assessed for primary immunogenicity measured by hSBA and rSBA for serogroup C in MEDQ00065 study [NCT03890367]. Clinical data on the persistence of antibody response 3 years after primary vaccination with MenQuadfi in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults ( 59 years of age) are available. Clinical data on booster vaccination with MenQuadfi in those subjects are also available. Immunogenicity in toddlers 12 to 23 month of age Immunogenicity in subjects 12 through 23 months of age was evaluated in three clinical studies (MET51 [NCT02955797], MET57 [NCT03205371] and MEQ00065 [NCT03890367]). MET51 subjects who were either meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve or had been primed with monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccines in their first year of life (see table 3). Table 3: Comparison of bactericidal antibody responses to MenQuadfi and MenACWY-TT vaccine 30 days after vaccination of meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve subjects only or combined (na\u00efve + MenC primed) subjects 12 through 23 months of age (study MET51*) | | Endpoint by Serogroup | | MenQuadfi MenC | | MenACWY-TT (95% CI) Combined (Na\u00efve + MenC Primed) | | A | | N=293 | | N=295 | | N=490 | | N=393-394 | % | 28.0 33.2) | (30.5; 39.0) | | C | | N=293 | | N=295 | | N=489 | | N=393-394 | | % 1:8 (Seroprotection)** | | 99.3 (97.6; | | 81.4 (97.9; 99.8) | | | | 26.4 (22.5; 31.0) | | 880 (748; 1035) | | 77.1 (60.7; 98.0) | | W | | N=293 | | N=296 | | N=489 | | N=393-394 | | % 1:8 (Seroprotection)** | | 83.6 (78.9; 87.7) | | 83.4 (78.7; 87.5) | | 84.9 (81.4; 87.9) | | 84.0 (80.0; 87.5) | | % Seroresponse | | 67.6 (61.9; 72.9) | | 66.6 | 22.0 (18.9; 25.5) | | 16.4 (14.4; 18.6) | | 24.4 (21.8; 27.5) | | 17.7 (15.8; 19.8) | | Y | | N=293 | | N=296 | | N=488-490 | | N=394-395 | | % 1:8 (Seroprotection)** | | 93.2 (89.7; (37.5; 46.5) | * Clinical identifier NCT02955797 N: number of subjects in the per-protocol analysis set with valid serology results.

Post-vaccination seroprotection rates were comparable between MenQuadfi and MenACWY-TT for all serogroups regardless of the priming background. In MenC-CRM primed subjects the GMTs for serogroup A were lower in the MenQuadfi group (n=49) than in the MenACWY-TT group (n=25) [12.0 rates (hSBA titres 1:8) for subjects primed with MenC-CRM were lower but still comparable for serogroups A and W compared with those in the for serogroup Y were higher but still comparable with those in the MenACWY-TT group [95.8% (85.7; 99.5) vs 80.0% (59.3; 93.2)]. The rates for serogroup C were comparable both groups [95.7% (85.5; 99.5) vs 92.0% (74.0; 99.0)]. The clinical relevance of these results is unknown. This aspect might/ be considered for individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM vaccine in their first year of life. MET57 (NCT03205371) was conducted in meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve toddlers 12 through 23 months of age to assess the immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with paediatric DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib or PCV-13). Overall, hSBA seroprotection rates in subjects who received MenQuadfi was high for all serogroups (between 88.9% and 100%). Seroresponse and seroprotection rates for A were comparable MenQuadfi was with A when MenQuadfi was 36.8; 65.3]).) The clinical relevance of these results is unknown but this observation might be taken into consideration for individuals at high risk for MenA infection and consequently vaccinations with MenQuadfi and PCV13 might be performed separately. MEQ00065 (NCT03890367) study was conducted in meningococcal vaccine na\u00efve toddlers 12 through 23 months of age to assess the immunogenicity of serogroup C using hSBA and rSBA assays following administration of a single dose of MenQuadfi compared to MenACWY-TT or to MenC-TT. Superiority of MenQuadfi was demonstrated in comparison to MenACWY-TT vaccine for the hSBA seroprotection rate GMTs seroprotection rate to meningococcal serogroup C. Superiority of MenQuadfi was also demonstrated in comparison to MenC-TT vaccine for the rSBA and hSBA GMTs to meningococcal serogroup C rSBA and hSBA seroprotection rates to meningococcal serogroup C (see table 4).

Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response Antibody persistence after primary vaccination and immunogenicity of a MenQuadfi booster dose was assessed in three studies in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults (59 years of age). Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response in children 4 through 5 years of age MET62 (NCT03476135) evaluated the antibody persistence of a primary dose, immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of MenQuadfi in children 4 through 5 years of age. These children were primed with a single dose of MenQuadfi or MenACWY-TT 3 years before as part of the phase II study MET54 when they were 12 through 23 months old. The antibody persistence prior to the MenQuadfi booster dose and the booster immune response were assessed according to the vaccine (MenQuadfi or MenACWY-TT) children had received 3 years ago (see table 10). For all serogroups, hSBA GMTs were higher at D30 post-primary dose for MenQuadfi MenACWY-TT. The pre-booster GMTs were higher than the pre-primary dose, indicative of long-term persistence of immune response. After the booster dose, seroprotection rates were nearly 100% for all serogroups in children primed with MenQuadfi.

Booster response in adolescents and adults at least 15 years of age primed with other MenACWY vaccines Study MET56 (NCT02752906) compared the immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenQuadfi with a booster dose of MenACWY-DT in subjects at least 15 years of age. These subjects were primed with a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM (11.3%) or with MenACWY-DT 10 years earlier. At baseline, hSBA seroprotection and GMT were similar for serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies within one or more subsets of the paediatric population under 12 months of age (see 4.2 for information on paediatric use). No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. Non-clinical safety data revealed no special risks for humans based on a developmental and reproductive toxicity study in female rabbits. The administration of MenQuadfi to female rabbits at a full human dose showed no effects on mating performance, female fertility, no teratogenic potential, and no effect on pre- or post-natal development.
