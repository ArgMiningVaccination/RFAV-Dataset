I-1- INTRODUCTION In many regions throughout the world the lack of immunization capabilities causes otherwise curable diseases to become a serious threat to human life. One of the obstacles preventing widespread immunization has been the virtual nonexistence of reliable, low maintenance refrigeration systems for storage of vaccines in remote locations. In an effort to fulfill the need for such a refrigeration system, NASA and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) began investigating various system designs. When it became apparent that photovoltaics could possibly supply the energy required to the compressor of the refrigerator, NASA is: ^d a Req..est for Proposal (RFP No. 3-142887) to several firms involved in ,:he manufacture of photovoltaic devices. The Statement of Work (SOW) in the RFP outlined the development and testing of a photovoltaic powered medical refrigeration system. These tests were to be conducted by an independent test laboratory according to the standard test procedures of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and modified World Health Organi- zation (WHO) test procedures. Solar Power Corporation, located in Woburn, Massachusetts was selected by NASA to carry out the terms of the SOW (see .Appendix A). The purpose of this report to describe the work done by Solar Power Corporation and Adler -Barbour Marine Systems in fulfillment of the require- ments of the Statement of Work. Included are the general descriptions of the SPC developed refrigeration system, SPC -RF103, its design and analysis, the test procedures and the results of those tests on the first SPC-RF103 photovoltaic refrigerator / freezer (RF) for medical applications. Tne Solar Power Corporation photovoltaic powered medical refrigeration system, SPC-RF103, is a stand alone refrigerator /freezer designed for high reliability. The system used to perform the qualification and acceptance tests consists of the following components: I. PHOTOVOLTAIC ARRAY A.Two parallel. B.Battery voltage regulator -2- III. REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER A.Separate refrigerator compartments. B.High reliability, high efficiency compressor, evaporator. C.Thick insulated walls for low heat transfer. D.Top opening. E.Separate interior hinged lids for refrigerator and freezer. F.Rugged corrosion resistant construction. G.Battery storage compartment. IV. INSTRUMENTATION AND MONITORING A.Seven (7) day recording temperature indicator. B.Freezer temperature/thermostat indicator. C.SPC instrumentation package (described later). V. SAFETY A.Audible alarm for high temperature B.Current surge protection C.Low battery voltage disconnect The system consists of a photovoltaic array and an integrated refrigerator/ freezer - electrical energy storage unit. The array converts sunlight directly into useful DC electricity with no moving parts. The photovol- taic array supplies electrical energy to the load which may be either the batteries (electrical energy storage) or the RF compressor. The heavily insulated RF assembly is top opening with separate hinged lids for the refrigerator and freezer. A conventional compressor/evaporator provides for heat removal from within the RF unit. Batteries supply the load with energy required when the array output is not sufficient. A detailed system description is presented later in the report. An illustration of the SPC-RF1O3 unit is presented in Figure 1. A system schematic is given later (Figure 6).}fa[t tl0. M!a+l -3- ORMIMAL SPC RF-I03 REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER ^'lIt -4- SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN System Analysis The systems analysis and conceptual design concentrate upon what SPC interprets as design - performance requirements. Normally, this includes computer sizing using SPC data, but NASA has obviated the need for SPC data with the supply of its own nominal insolation regime. SPC has incorporated the NASA data into the SPC sizing program to perform a sizing analysis, a relatively straight/forward procedure when loads are known. In this case, the load is uncertain but boundable. The systems analysis concentrates upon the two major design drivers from a performance or operational point of view. These are the array size and determining energy requirements. Arraying The need for a universal arraying system (as specified in the RFP) for latitudes ranging from 40'S to 40'N in increments of 10' of latitude that is also easy to set-up in the field requires ingenuity in design. This requirement is increased by the need for an array with an adjustable tilt angle which is also simple and easy to vary in the field. Using Cooper's equation to estimate the angle of declination of the sun: 284 + n d - 23.45 Sin ( 360 X \u20143-65 ) , where n is the day of the year and north is positive and south negative. The declination angles for the first and fifteenth days of each month at 0' latitude are: January 1-23.0' 1523.3' 15-23.3'-5- In order to develop the universal array with variable tilt, some observa- tions, conventions and assumptions are required. It is less expensive to develop the array if the design places the tilt bearing in the center of the array rather than at the north or south ends. Figure 2 depicts such. a scheme. Assume that the array in this figure is placed at the equator. On June 21, the sun is 23.45' above the equator and on December 21, the MM is 23.45' below the equator. On March 21 and September 21, the sun would be directly above the equator. If the convention is adopted that tilting the array so that it faces north for June is a north tilt of the array, tilting the array so that it faces south for December is a south tilt and having the array flat for the equinoxes is 0; then it is possible to develop a table of adjustment settings for the array for the equator. To simplify the mechanics, adjustments will be made in increments of +5'. If another convention is adopted that adjustments will be made on the first day of the month, then the array settings for the equator can be developed by rounding off to the nearest 5' setting for the average of the first and last days of the month since that is a-reasonable estimate of the average declination angle for the entire month. The first step in this proc ois is to round off the solar declination angles calculated from Cooper's .,uation. These rounded angles are: ROUNDED SOLAR DECLINATION ANGLES -20' July -20'June 25' December -25' For the equator, it is a simple task to use the declination angles to develop the table of array settings based on the conventions discussed above. For example, since the average declination angle is -20' for January, the array should be rotated 20' in the south direction. The RFP also stated that the array would be used for many other areas from 40'S to 40'N latitude. Table 1 shows the array tilt indicator settings that will be incorporated into the training and instruction manuals for field use to the nearest 5' of latitude. This table can be used between 40 0S and 400N. The user need only know the latitude of the location where the refrig- erator is being used. For example if the location were 14 6N latitude, the user would find the indicator settings for each month under the column for 15'N latitude. The array tilt lock bolt will be simple to use and also serves as a shear bolt holding the array in place as will be discussed in the array design section.00 O r- AC' r, r ^^ CorporationARRAY CENTER HEARING ARRAY TILT ASSF14BLY CENTER BEARING ARRAY TILT lA- i M N 109i -f.1- .

Since there is no fluid flow other than air at low velocities, convection is not significant in this refrigerator problem. Film coefficients are on the order of 1000 and this coefficient is used in the form of 1/1000 and so is insignificant as an additive term (see below). Radiation is also insignificant compared to conduction. The basic Fourier conduction law for isotropic material is: q= -kvt where q is the heat transferred, k is the thermal conductivity of the material which varies with the temperature of the material, and t repre- sents temperature. Thus, an arithmetic mean is often used for k. The primary meano of heat transfer is through the walls of the refriger- ator compartments (see Figure 3). For this situation, Fourier's equation becomes. q = _ to ti 1 + A_ + 1 h i A i kAm hoAo where hi and ho are film coefficients, k is the thermal conductivity of the walls, Ai, Am and Ao are equal and are the wall areas, to and ti are outside and inside temperatures and X is the wall thickness. The units for q are watts (BTU/hr). Since the film coefficients for water are approximately 1000, it is obvious that the convection and radiation coefficients disappear compared to k which is less than 1. Thus the equation reduces to q to-ti MMt0 HOTti COLD-9- OF POOR!T I WALL h0 hi FIGURE 3 HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH A WALL t0. ti a temperatures outside and inside vall, respectivly h0. hi = film coefficients outside and !aside wall. respectivly-10- ORIGINAL PAGE 9 OF POOR Q UALITY where to is the ambient temperature, ti is the inside temperature, I is the thickness, k is the thermal conductivity of the wall and Am is the wall area. For this refrigerator, there are six heat shielding walls to consider. The dimensions are: 0.381m X 0.356m; 0.762m and 30\" X 1511). The total area of these walls is 1.394m2 (15 ft2). Using the Fourier equation as an approximation, the heat penetration can be estimated as a function of wall thickness. If k is averaged to 2.44 X 10 -2 W/m-'C (0.013 BTU/Ft 2-Hr-F'/Ft), to equals 43.0'C (109.4*F) and ti equals 6 .0'C (42.8'F), then the function for q and i is: 4 s 109.4 - 42.8 12.99 A t (0.013) (15) The unit for t is in meters (feet). The values of q for various thick- nesses of insulation are shown in Figure 4. For various values of A up to 0.305m (1 foot) q penetration through walls is esti- mated to be 8.3W (26 BTU/hr). The base load of the refrigerator at 6.0% (42.80F) in a 43.0'C (109.47) approxi- mately 16.6 A-hr per day at 12 volts. Increasing insulation beyond 0.152m (6\") thus has very little cost effectiveness and will probably increase operational problems and would exceed the design height limitation. It would require 0.305m (1 ft) of insulation on each side to make a signifi- cant difference in the energy requirement. Maintaining the freezer cavity at lower temperatures than 6.0% (42.87) would increase the 3zD .a a ia50 45 40 35 30 BEAT GAIN 25 (WATTS) 20 15 10 5 0 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 INSULATION THICKNESS (m)W. tT, -12- meets by up to 3 or 4 A-hr if -15 *C (57) is desired in the freezer. Thus a 20 A-hr daily requirement to maintain the inside temperature is not unreasonable with a 43.0'C (109.47) ambient. Edge and corner losses will not greatly change this estimate as can be seen from the following calculations. Conduction shape factors are derived from the Fourier equation in the form: q=kSAT for various geometries. Figure 5 is a sketch illustrating dimensions for use in calculating three dimensional shape factors. The relationships are obtained from any text on heat transfer and are: S = Sal + Sedge + Scorner A Swall = L Sedge = 0.54D Scorner = 0.15L where A is area of a wall, L is the wall thickness and D is the length of an edge. For Swalls i Ai/L i - 30 Sedges = 0.54 D i - 10.6 Scorners = 0.15 L i - 0.6 then S = 12.6m (41.2 ft) and q = 11.37W (35.7 BTU/hr). The edge and corner losses combined with the additional requirements to maintain -15% (50F) for the freezer still puts the A-hr delivered on the order of 20 per day as an estimate. This estimate must then be increased to allow for the true Carnot efficiency of the compressor. NASA also required that 2.0 kg of ice (or about 7 trays of ice cubes) be made per day by the refrigerator. This is 4.4 pounds of water. Since the heat of fusion of water is 334.9kJ/kg (144 BTU/lb) and it is presumed the ice will be chilled to around -20 0C (-47), the energy requirement is about 1055 kJ (1000 BTU) or approximately 26 A-hr per day if ambient is 43'C (109.4'F). The total requirement specified is thus 46 A-hr per day before derating and allowing for opening and closing. Allowing for Carrot efficiency, battery efficiency and instrumentation draw could increase this to over 60 A-hr per day. Actual experimental values recorded during the testing of the SPC-RF103 are presented later. If the 60'C cell temperature requirement is met, the module max power current is 2.164 amps at 100 mW/6m 2 and AM 1.5. This requirement will determine the number of photovoltaic modules needed to operate the refrig- erator/freezer. The procedure used to select the number of modules will be described later in this report.f^Or ^'[-13- OF t oCm Q,,AL, TYItl FIGURE 5 DIMENSIONS USED TO CALCULATE 3-DIMENSIONAL SHAPE FACTORS-14- After performing the previous energy analysis independently of Adler- Barbour, the manufacturers of the refrigerator/ freezer unit, SPC obtained the following Adler-Barbour calculations for 430C ambient: No load steady state 21.62 A-hr/day Loaded steady state 53.42 A-hr/day Steady state with ice 63.12 A-hr/day These values match quite well with the estimates obtained from the analy- sis performed by SPC. CONCEPTUAL DESIGI4 The photovoltaic plant design integrates the site, the load, and the human interfaces wit,: the system hardware. Figure 6 shows the connec- tior:s between major hardware elements. Components and subsystems have been designed or chosen according to product availability and maturity, efficiency, reliability, safety, and cost criteria as well as site and human interface requirements. Sub- systems are interdependent also. The design of the subarrays and their wiring arrangement was, in turn, determined by these limits as well as the practical limits on the physical size that can be adjusted and serviced with hand-operated equipment. The design criteria and parameters for each component and subsystem are given in later sections along with full descriptions of the selected designs. The photovoltaic plant must operate over all possible environmental conditions and must behave predictably during outages or human inter- vention. To satisfy these requirements, operational modes have been defined. Operational motes are startup, operation, shutdown, and emergency shut- down. These occur as normal operating modes or degraded operating modes. Additional operating modes also considered are maintenance/diagnostic modes. Normal operating modes occur with the system full-up with all sub- systems operating at their rated capacity. Degraded operating modes occur with the system operating below its rated capacity due to partial outages of subsystems and/or components.IDeus 12- 30Current - . - - 1 storage 1 -- -J Array Bylten Yoi meterCurrent _.. 410\u2014 Meter /1 1 ^laaperlssor 1 1'+7 1 11 01 1 1 'Ptah I eat - SUM4 soot resew lapeed an V ,.. n n.... .. . :.-hrcw,... ^ ^ FIGURE 6 A a D 47 SPC - RF103 PHOTOVOLTAIC POWERED BLOCK %2J -16- Characteristics of the operating modes are steady-state and transient operational conditions. Conditions characteristic of the operating modes are: 1. Steams State Conditions a.Daylight Power delivered to load at 12 Vdc. Excess power, if any, is shorted through the array. b.Nighttime or Very Heaver Cloud Cover Operation from batteries with voltage monitoring from BVR to activate signal alarm for low voltage. 2. Transient Conditions a.Startup and Shutdown Output is automatically connected to battery-load circuit. Transient suppression controls voltage spikes and limits array current to battery and load. b.Clouds or Partial Moving Shadows Array output follows insolation. The BVR controls voltage and current to the battery and load. Partial shadowing affects output of only those strings shadowed. c.Surge Surge protection devices in the BVR are activated at input and output. 3. Maintenance/Diagnostic Modes a.Monitoring Metering exists for battery voltage, array string current and set voltages for testing. Visual indication is obtained from the instruments. b.Manual Shutdown or Backup Activities If the PV generator is off-line, the system will go to the battery. If the battery is disconnected, the system will shut-down. Emergency shut- down is through the master switch to the loads and disconnection of subsystems.X -17- Performance Analysis and Sizing The input parameters for the performance analysis are shown in Table 2. The insolation data were taken from the RFP. The SPC Model G361 module output characteristics including efficiency and insolation coefficients, are well documented through SPC's own testing and JPL Block III module procurements. The results of the sizing analysis are shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5 for 8, 9, and 10 module arrays respectively. The results indicate that the nine module array (Table 4) will provide sufficient energy to operate the RF unit at the specified conditions. The conceptual design results from the system analysis and consists of the following: Array A variable tilt angle array and inttrgral mount easily operated by indivi- duals in a medical clinic in a developing country is the basic requirement. The array is divided into two sections, each allowing up to 5 modules. The initial design point recommendation by SPC is nine modules in two sections (5-4). If the tests indicate a need for 10, 8, or 7, SPC can alter the section sizes to 5-5, 4-4 or 4-3. The wiring from the sectional arrays leads to a junction box which feeds into the regulator and battery and then to the load. The sizing analysis was performed using the basic design drivers from the RFP and the analysis developed by SPC. The SPC sizing program does not allow a monthly variation of tilt angle and so it was necessary to make multiple runs of the program at various tilt angles and then combine the information. The next section includes the development of the conceptual design into a preliminary design of subsystems and component specifications.-18- TABLE 2 SIMULATION MODEL INPUT VALUES*MJ Weather Module Packing Factor Cell Efficiency at 28\u00b0C Efficiency Temperature Coefficient Cell Temperature Insolation Coefficient Average Wiring and Parasitic Losses Data 72% 0.325'C/mW/cm2 2% 0 60 A-hr/day @ 12 Vdc-19- ORIGINAL PAGE W OF POOR QUALITY TABLE 3 SIZING ANALYSIS 8 G12-361 MODULES 322 145.7 NOTES 1.Tilt corresponds to convention developed previously. 2.Current specified is for each module. 3.Daily load and daily output are given in Amp-Hours per day. 4.Monthly deficit and monthly surplus are given in Amp-Hours per month. srNw%qrol -20- TABLE OaaUNAL PAGC 33 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JL'N JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC FLT LANGLEYS 280 310 320 350 300 240 250 280 320 280 250 280 DAILY DAILY MONTHLY MONTHLY MONTH TILTCURRENT LNGLYS LOADOUTPUT 647.9^r p\",-22- ORIGINAL PAGE IS OF POOR QUALITY SYSTEM DESIGN VARIABLE TILT ARRAY The arraying scheme utilized by SPC is shown in Figure 7. The array conforms to the specifications stated previously. The tilt angle adjust- ment bolt holds the array in place. The tilt indicator is shown in Figure 7 and will allow tilting from 60 0S to 60'N in increments of 10'. ARRAY WIRING The design objectives that the wiring scheme must meet were defined as follows: 1.Parasitic and DC wiring losses should be less than 2 percent. 2.Voltage and current levels should be compatible with the BVR (Battery Voltage Regulator) input requirements. 3.The installations should be free from electrical hazards to operating personnel and as safe as possible to anyone working on the systems. Electrical reliability was not compromised in achieving these objectives. Wiring power losses are kept low by selecting wire sizes by resistance criteria rather than normal capacity ratings. The additional cost of larger wire is justified by the relatively high cost of the solar modules. The wire from each module is ITT Cannon Type SJO 18/2 or equivalent. Each 12 volt module is integrated in a parallel connection to a junction box for each array with SJO 18/2 wire. The size of wires from the junc- tion box to the BVR is #6 or #4 wire. The junction boxes' terminal links allow up to 10 modules. The junction boxes are mounted on the arrays. They are weatherproof and custom made by Solar Power. The two wires from the junctions boxes are connected in parallel in a terminal junction box and a #4 wire from the terminal junction box leads to the refrigerator/ freezer unit.1w -23- ORIGINAL PAGE 19 OF POOR QUALITY FIGURE 7 SAMPLE ARRAY SCHEME AND ARRAY TILT INDICATOR 406 1196W A- AM-24- PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULE The photovoltaic module used in the array is a Solar Power Corporation Module G-361. This 36 cell superstrate type module shown in Figure 8, features a hard glass cover combined with a rugged solar cell mounting and termination technique that provides a practical and economic solution for a wide range of power requirements. The rationale for this choice of the G -361 module for this application is a combination of characteristics. These characteristics, in order of decreasing importance, are: 1.Proven, reliable design with proven component history. 2.Ability to meet electrical insulation and local site hail impact requirements. 3.Ease of cleaning and maintenance. 4.Low cost. The tempered water-white glass superstrate provides stiffness as well as a self-cleaning surface that is resistant to environmental loadings such as snow, ice, rain and hail. The module consists of a sandwich of the following items: glass superstrate, cells, interconnects, terminals, ,junction box, encapsulant, and back sheet. The superstrate is a tempered, water-white, anti-reflective glass which is highly resistant to breakage. The design wind load of the module is 78.2 m/s (175 mph), which exceeds the wind loadings specified for this proposal. The design torsional flexibility of the modules is 0.006m per meter (1/4\" per foot) along the long dimension of the module. The cell configuration (4 rows of 9 cells each) allows the glass size to be consistent with low glass stress levels. The superstrate also provides mechanical protection for the cells from hail impact. The superstrate/encapsulant used in the G-361 module is designed to provide resistance to hail-stones up to 0.051m (211) in diameter. The silicone rubber encapsulant used in this module is the most reliable material available and has superior weathering characteristics with respect to optical and mechanical properties. The white back sheet provides a hard surface for the soft encapsulant to reduce the chance of cell damage from foreign objects hitting the surface, and the white color provides power enhancement due to increased internal reflection. The superstrate/encapsulant/back sheet assembly provides electrical insulation between the cell strings and the mounting frame. The design level of electrical insulation in G -361 modules is 2000 V, considerably higher than any expected operating voltage.1IN H Of S'..MI/ON .. _ i i\" -ir. $, it 'll 1 --ns^ 'COL AR MOD (AMI O 5 2 3 1 2 \u2014T--T-26- The tinned copper foil interconnects between cells, and between terminals and cells, have stress relief loops to allow a significant margin of safety in fatigue loading due to thermal stresses. Redundant intercon- nects enhance the survivability of the module in the event of loss of an interconnect. The electrical termination consists of neoprene ,jacketed cable with a low-cost environmental type connector at the end to connect to the module junction box. Cadmium plated, steel terminals are provided to allow interconnection of modules in either series or parallel configurations. The terminals are located in a terminal box constructed of black, glass-reinforced, phenolic material. The terminal box can hold an encapsulating material (urethane) after installation of the necessary output cabling. This makes the terminal box water resistant. Modules are grouped so that short circuit currents of each module in a series string will not vary more than 5%. The open circuit voltage will not vary more than 10%. Reverse biasing can occur when there is a limiting cell within a series string of cells. A limiting cell is one which has lower current output than the other cells that it is connected in series with. The current of a cell is directly proportional to the amount of area which is illuminated by the sun. Therefore, dirt or other shadowing of the cell surface or a cracked cell caused by mishandling or vandalism can cause a cell to be limiting. The potential amount of reverse bias which the limiting cell can reach increases with the number of cells connected in series (high voltage array); it also increases as the operating voltage of a given array moves toward Zero (short circuit operation). As either of these conditions occurs, the power dissipated in any current limiting cell which goes into reverse bias raises its tewpera`ure above its normal operating value. A system can operate at short circuit by using a shorting type regulator for system regulation, or by deliberately shorting a high voltage array to make it safe to handle for maintenance, testing or cleaning.-27- The G12-361 module limits the amount of reverse voltage that can be imposed on a cell, thereby, limiting the amount of heat dissiptated in that cell. This is accomplished with the addition of two bypass diodes in each module. The G12 -361 module with 36 cells in series has one bypass diode across each string of 18 cells. As far as reverse bias effects are concerned, bypass diodes reduce the effective number of series-connected cells to the number within the bypass diode connections. The maximum reverse voltage that a limiting cell can see is the maximum voltage that can be generated by this series string. Since 18 cells in series can generate only half the voltage that 36 cells can generate, the two bypass diodes per module cut the maximum heat dissipation in half. To incorporate the two bypass diodes, two extra redundant interconnects have been added from the terminal box to the center of the series string of cells (between the eighteenth and nineteentn cell). The interconnects are connected to two of the four output terminals in the terminal box to allow the bypass diodes to be installed across each 18 cell series string. A conformally coated PC board is used to mount the bypass diodes which is then mounted on the two output terminals. This allows only two terminals for output connections instead of four. Figure 9 shows the two added interconnects and the terminal box with the installation of the bypass diodes. The addition of two bypass diodes reduces the potential temperature limit that any cell can reach to a level well below the module design criteria. This ensures the long-term reliability of the module. There is no loss in electrical performance with the incorporation of bypass diodes because, unlike blocking diodes, bypass diodes do not reduce the output voltage. The G12 -361 module specifications are, thus, unaffected. This design makes the CT12 -361 module ideal for low voltage, high voltage, and short circuit applications. An SPC G-Series Product Data Sheet is included to summarize the G -361 module characteristics. The module meets the requirements of the DOE Specification 5260-2. Specifically, the module: Has been tested and exceeds temperature requirements. Has been tested and meets thermal cycling and shock requirements between -40 0C and 90'C.

Unfortunately, no government agency has been able to complete a classical attribute test because most programs have not been in existence long enough to have all modules in a test fail. Based on JPL data and SPC data, the MTBF easily exceeds 50,000 operating hours. The MTTR has been demonstrated to be much less than one hour based on recent field trials for small arrays. Although safety is addressed elsewhere, it is noted that the modules meet all safety requirements; there are no exposed wires on the modules and ,junction boxes are secured with three Phillips head fasteners on plastic. Modules are inspected and tested using the Specification 5101-21 Revision B, \"Acceptance/Rejection Criteria for JPL/LSA Modules.\" MODULE FRAMING, MOUNTING AND SUPPORT STRUCTURE The photovoltaic modules are assembled into an anodized aluminum support frame with self-arraying flanges for simple assembly onto an array mount- ing rail. The protective glass sheet and encapsulated cells are held in the support frame by a one piece silicone gasket which isolates the assembly from shocks transmitted through the frame. The framed modules ar mounted onto aluminum rails having a minimum yield strength of 262 X 10^ N/m2 (38,000 psi), or equal. All bolts, nuts, washers, and split lock washers are stainless steel meeting ASTM A276 Type 304, or equal. Captives are by Engineered Fastners Division of Eaton Corp., or equal. ELECTRIC PLANT SUBSYSTEM The electric plant subsystem consists of the wiring, the BVR, controls and monitoring, the battery storage, and the wiring to the load. This section will cover the batteries and the other items from above as well as interface elements. The batteries will not only supply power to the load during inferior insolation conditions but also will be used to augment the normal array supply during system operational conditions. The batteries will also provide current surges. SPC specified Delco 2000 brand lead calcium batteries for all storage requirements for this application. Delco batteries have proven reliability and performance, high efficiencies, long cycle life, low self-discharge and resistance to rough handling, particularly when compared to pure lead plate batteries.% IW J4. ! -31- The capacity specifications of the battery storage bank are dependent upon the detailed integration of the overall power demand placed upon the system by the load, matched against the power that must be supplied by the system, i.e., the optimized combination of the photovoltaic array and storage batteries. Detailed daily, monthly and seaso-al variations in insolation levels and worst-case continuous sunless days during the most recent ten year interval are usually considered, in addition to system and component efficiencies, cell temperatures, and module and equipment degradation when sizing batteries. Battery operating voltages are deter- mined by the load and system requirements. Specific battery charging voltages are approximately 1% to 20% higher than the normal operating voltages. Battery charging voltages are critical since over charging of batteries will cause gassing and reduction of electrolyte levels in the batteries. Conversely under-charging will not allow the batteries to fully charge, which could result in abnormally low depths of discharge during high energy demand periods and the excessive current drains during sunless hours. Both over and under charging of batteries could eventually cause battery damage and curtail the battery life expectancy. The Delco 2000 batteries have a 105 A-hr capacity at the 100 hour rate at 25\u00b0C. Self-discharge rate is 4 A-hr per month at 27'C. Dimensions are 330.2 mm X 172.0 mm X 238.8 mm (12.99\" X 6.77\" X 9.37\"). The batteries weigh 27.3 Kg (60 lb). The refrigerator battery storage area will allow 6 of these batteries in a 3 by 2 matrix wired in parallel. WIRING The wiring from the junction box on the array to the BVR will be 10 or more meters as required and will be #6, or #4 AWG wire. CONTROLS AND MONITORING SUBSYSTEM The controls and monitoring subsystem includes the following items: Battery Voltage Regulator (BVR) Instrumentation and Monitoring Equipment REGULATOR BVR 12-30 Solar Power Corporation's shorting Battery Voltage Regulators are designed to provide exacting battery voltage control, low quiescent power consump- tion and reliable, long service life.-32-^ - r Available in weather-resistant or nonweather-resistant configurations, the BVR series battery voltage regulators are of shorting design. Once the regulating voltage is set, the BVR series regulators allow only enough current to flow into the battery as needed to maintain a full state of charge. Additional solar array output current is then diverted through to a power transistor which is turned on in saturation mode rather than a linear mode. As a result, when the battery terminal voltage reaches a preset full charge level, the control circuit sends an ON signal to the power switch. Then, the power switch is driven into the saturation mode and effectively shorts the array output to prevent array current from charging the battery. In cases where the battery falls below full charge, the regulator circuit draws only enough power to operate the terminal voltage level detector (typically lmA or less). The low 'off\" state power drain of the BVR shorting battery voltage regulator prevents unnecessary waste of valuable solar-generated power in the regulator circuits when the battery is below full charge. The battery voltage upper limit is selected to minimize electrolysis of water in the electrolyte. In addition to preventing unnecessary electrolyte loss, BVR shorting battery voltage regulators protect against equipment or battery damage due to excessive voltage. Typical Regulating Weight Model No. Voltage Current Net Shipping BVR 12-30 14.4 Vdc 20-OA 5.9 kg 9.1 kg All BVR series battery voltage regulators use solid state devices. A MIL STD 723 integrated circuit is used as the heart of each voltage regulator. All boards are conformally coated. Precision metal film resistors are used in voltage level detection circuits. Reverse polarity protection and the system blocking diodes are incorporated into the unit. All power handling devices are derated to assure long life, even at constant maximum power dissipation levels. Connections to printed circuit boards are made via terminal blocks capable of handling up to #6 or #4 AWG wire, and provide a solid gas-tight seal. Either weather-resistant feedthroughs or strain relieving cable clamps are offered.-33- INSTRUMENTATION AND MONITORING The instrumentation and monitoring package includes: System Voltmeter Array Ammeter Load Ammeter Array Amp Hour Meter Load Amp Hour Meter Battery Circuit Breaker Load Circuit Breaker Low Voltage Disconnect and Visual Alarm Elapsed Time Indicator The instrumentation is mounted beneath a clear plexiglass protective cover on the side of the SPC-RF103. Table 6 is a list of the components of the monitoring and instrumentation equipment provided by SPC. In addition SPC manufactures a low voltage alarm signal that monitors the battery terminal voltage. When the terminal voltage measured by this circuit drops below a preset level (nominally 12.0 volts), the low voltage signal will activate the alarm and disconnect. This relay will isolate the refrigerator from the system. The circuit conforms to MIL specs and includes a conformal coating for the PC board. The circuit is factory set but can be adjusted in the field if necessary. Protection and Safety The protection and safety subsystem was approached with two basic criteria: Maximize protection and safety for personnel through proper labeling and marking, and safety design components. Maximize protection and safety for plant equipment. The personnel protection and safety aspects deal with installation and maintenance. Sure-Seal or equivalent connectors are used at the terminal point of each module and its entry into the junction box. These connec- tors maximize safety to personnel and are extremely reliable. Wire gages for these type connectors range from 14 to 18. The connectors are polarized against mis-mates, are water submersible, rated for temperatures from -400C to 105'C, UV resistant and last in a variety of corrosive environments. They are field serviceable and by nature suppress arcing. Moreover, contacts are not accessible with human fingers Heineman General Time GE-34- TABLE 6 INSTRUMENTATION 7ND -70-NITORING EQUIPMENT DC Panel Ammeter (0 to 30A) Current Shunt (50 Amp 50 mV) Amp-Hour Integrator Circuit Breaker Voltage Regulator (Temp Comp) DC Panel Voltmeter (0 to 30V) DC Panel Ammeter (0 to 15A) Current Shunt (50 Amp/50 mV) Circuit Breaker Elapsed Time Indicator Transient Suppressor (for Timer)-35- Cam-Lok type connectors are used for the array wiring into the equipment cabinet for the larger wires. These are equally as good as Sure-Seals. Cam-Lok high-amperage safety connectors are used for the connections to the batteries also. A switch is located in the equipment cabinet for master ON/OFF control. In addition to safety connectors, array sections will be clearly marked in yellow. The safety procedures documentation will include all descriptions of safety equipment and procedures in detail. Equipment protection is emphasized also. Blocking diodes are used for battery protection against spurious deep discharge and transient suppres- sion for arrays. Diodes are also used to prevent hot spots in modules, a technique discovered during the Mt. Laguna installation for DOD by SPC. THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER The refrigerator/freezer offered with the SPC-RF103 system is manufactured by Adler-Barbour Marine Systems, Inc. The compressor is manufactured by Danfos and has proven to be reliable. The details of the refrigerator are included here as developed by Adler-Barbour. Performance data and calcu- lations, as furnished by Adler-Barbour, are given in Appendix B.-36- PRODUCT INFORMATION SHEET SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC POWERED REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER FOR MEDICAL USE IN REMOTE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS SPC-RF103 REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SPECIFICATIONS The SPC-RF103 is a chest type unit (top opening) constructed and designed to the following specifications: The SPC-RF103 box, the compressor, condensor, fan motor assembly, condensor, battery complement, electronic controls and instrumentation are assembled as an itegr.l unit. The SPC-RF103 is packa ged to provide maximum personnel safety. All rotating and moving components (condensor fan) are shrouded for personnel safety and additionally located in enclosed compartments. Batteries are contained within their own compartment and are isolated from all running and electronic components. Battery, electronic and mechanical (refrigeration) compartments are fully accessible for ease of servicing, maintenance and component replacement (if necessary). All compartments are fully ventilated. e The comnressor motor is a 12 volt DC brushless motor with electronic commutation. This completely eliminates the brushes and commutator ring assembly and makes possible its truly hermetic compressor design. Operating range is 10.5 - 15 volts DC. The compressor system is extremely reliable and is in current production by our company (in excess of 3000 units) as a marine refrigeration system since 3/80. It has very low energy consumption and can withstand continuous tilting at 30 degrees in any plane. The compressor also has solid state battery protection, solid state and redundant fused protection against over- load and solid state protection in the event of start failure. The dimensions of the SPC-RF103 are as follows: Height of assembly 43\" 109.30CM Length of assembly 43\" 109.30CM Width of assembly 27\" 68.63CM weight of assembly 210 LBS. 95.20KG less batteries - Gross Volume 103.24 Litres - Net usable volume 93.77 Litres - Gross freezer volume 34.41 Litres - Net usable freezer volume 25.47 Litres - Gross refrigerator volume 68.82 Litres - Net usable refrigerator volume 68.30 volume/weight/# of packages: CU. r1./117.9 KG/l (less batteries)-37- PRODUCT INFORMATION SHEET - Cont'd Outer liner of the SPC-RF103 box is of epoxy coated aluminum. Box inner liner is constructed of a specially formed aluminum one piece extrusion. Both inner and outer liners are durable, easily cleaned and resistant to deterioration from exposure to foods, vaccines and most chemicals. The inner and outer liners are sealed together utilizing a special reflecting aluminized mylar film vapor barrier (located between the polyurethane foam insulation and the inner and outer liners) to minimize moisture penetration due to atmospheric and/or temperature-induced vapor pressure differences between the environment and the insulation cavity. The material used for insulation is polyurethane (2.0 pound density closed-cell). 15.24 CM (6.0\") of insulation is provided in all dimensions to assure adequate cold retention, minimize compressor energy requirements, and, provide the greatest overall system economic benefit. The SPC-RF103 has a single outer lid which is hinged, self- closing and lockable. Outer and inner lid gaskets with receiving interfacing gasket form a triple sealing arrange- ment capable of withstanding normal medical use and providing the necessary sealing to minimize heat leaks. The SPC-RF103 has separate plexiglass interior lids for the freezer and refrigerator compartments. The interior lids are hinged and designed to reduce heat transfer between the compartments and the outer lid. The SPC-RF103 utilizes a finned copper condensor (as opposed to steel) for greater efficiency and thermal heat rejection. All fasteners are non-corrosive (either stainless steel, aluminum or brass) and all finishes are primed baked enamel. System compressor, electronics and condensor fan motor are all designed and built to ignition protection standards. Compressor system is fused with a Buss GLN-10 fuse (with spare attached to compressor wire harness). The SPC-RF103 utilizes a filtered cleanable aluminum condensor air-intake for continued efficient operation in sandy or dusty environments. Each unit is equipped with a spare replacement filter. The SPC-RF103 battery complement is of the lead calcium externally-connected single cell type designed specifically for the PV systems and are housed in a vented and lockable portion of the equipment enclosure (compartmentized and isolated from electronic and mechanical components). The SPC-RF103 utilizes a rollbonded aluminum, primary surface type, capillary fed evaporator (freezing unit). Aluminum evaporator is coated with an F.D.A. approved baked powdered epoxy finish.U6; W-38- PRODUCT INFORN +ATION SHEET - Cont'd The SPC-RF103 is equipped with the following instrumentation: - Load ammeter - Lead amp-hour meter (counting integrator) - Compressor motor run-time meter - Controlling thermostat with temperature indicator The SPC-RF103 is designed to maintain the following temperatures at a design ambient operational temperature of 43 degrees Centigrade (110 degrees Fahrenheit): Freezer com partment range: Refrigerator compartment range:-250 to -15 (-13o to 50F) + 40 to + 80C ( 39 0 to 470F) Each compartment is controlled by its own adjustable thermostatic control. fh I^ A ' 1 O O r I Ipop + d 'V c a liv- ^^M ' ~ #0 a I I \"nlcs,fn r7 w AV r *do 0 j .^ Y'14e 4 A / lo/ \u00ae t = I IeRraIMvII ^ Mw\"-41- ORIGINAL PAGE 18 OF POOR QUALITY, FIGURE 1,201\"\", M) t _..^ v ..a\" , SPC-RF103PHOT( (9 PI SHORT BATTF ( STOPPAGE 69 QUALITY FIGURE 13 SYSTE M SCH ZM!TIC SPC - RF103-42- i Im I-43- powered medical refrigerator/freezer was sub- jected to a two-phase test program of its thermal performance.

Acceptance Test Phase a.No Load Pulldown Test b.Steady State Test C. Hold-over Time Test (Temperature Rise) The test procedures used were based on \"Modified WHO Standard Testi.-.e Procedure for Refrigerators and Freezers for Use in the Cold Chain\", Sections 7 and 8 from ANSI/AHAM HRF-1 -1979, \"Household Refrigerators, Combination Refrigerator-Freezers, and Household Freezers\", and Sections 2.2 and 5.0 (in its entirety) from the \"Statement of Work\". All of the above tests were performed on the SPC-RF103 by the Electrical Testing Laboratory (ETL) in Cortland, New York. ETL is a recognized independent testing laboratory. All tests were monitored in their entirety by staff from Solar Power Corporation, ETL, NASA/Lewis Research Center, and Adler-Barbour Marine Systems, Inc. Figure 12 shows the refrigerator/ freezer unit with Solar Power Corpora- tion's instrumentation and monitoring package. Figure 13 is a schematic of the complete SPC-RF103 system. The qualification and acceptance phase test procedures and results are described in detail in the following sections. 1. QUALIFICATION TESTS The SPC-RF103 refrigerator/ freezer (R/F) was positioned in an environ- mental test chamber capable of controlling sensible heat at 43 0C +2'C and relative humidity at 45 to 50%. Instrumentation used during the tests for monitoring system performance is described in Table 7. Power to the systems' 12 volt (nominal) mechanical refrigeration system was supplied by a 90 ampere hour automotive type battery and an unregulated commercial grade 10 amp battery charger. The system, as tested during this qualifi- cation phase, did not include the photovoltaic array.Owl. -44- Instrumentation was set up as follows: Fluke - set for readouts at five (5) minute intervals (events) on thirteen channels. Unweighted thermocouples were placed in and around the R/F unit as shown in Figure 14. Thermocouples placed within the R/F unit were supported in such a manner that there was at least 1.5 cm (112 inch) of air space separating the thermocouples from any surface. Recording Voltmeter - wired to the supply battery to contin- uously record the system's supply voltage. Recording Ammeter - wired to the positive leg of the mechanical refrigeration system's wiring by use of a \"shunt\" to contin- uously record the system's operating current. Counting Integrator - also wired to the positive leg of the mechanical refrigeration system's wiring by use of a \"shunt\" to record cummulative ampere hours during operation. 1.A No Load Pulldown Test The purpose of this test is to establish that the cabinet temperature will be reduced from ambient to required storage temperature, determine the rate at which this change takes place and to observe the lowest steady state temperatures attained in the storage compartments. This test is based primarily on Section 7.5 of Appendix D, \"7.5.1 Purpose\". The R/F unit was allowed to thermally stabilize (soak) within the environ- mental chamber at 43\u00b0C (1107) for 8 hours prior to the beginning of the test. Upon completion of the soak period the inner and outer lids were closed and the mechanical refrigeration system was activated. The system was operated continuously until the freezer compartment temperature, as indicated by thermocouple number six (6), fell below -15'C and the refrig- erator compartment temperature, as indicated by thermocouple number five (5), fell below 5'C. Samples of the data are presented from Fluke and Counter Integrator readings at the following three time intervals: 1.Start of test (after 8 hour soak period). 2.Freezer temperature compliance (T6 = - 15'C) 3 Refrigerator temperature compliance (T5 c 5'C)r -45- TABLE 7 INSTRUMENTATION USED TO MONITOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE* INSTRUMENT OUTPUT Fluke Digital Recorder ( 13 channel input for 13 thermo- couples, output in 'C every 5 minutes with day of year, hours, minutes, seconds (day: hr: min: sec).

The containers were Thermos Brand \"Icepacks\" Model No. 3500/8706, manufactured by the Thermos Division of King Seeley Thermos Company. The internal capacity of the Icepack is 0.5 liters. The icepacks were allowed to \"soak\" in the environmental chamber until they stabilized at 43'C and then they were inserted into the freezer compartment of the R/F unit as shown in Figure 17. The test was termin- ated when the icepacks were frozen as indicated by subcooling after the latent change of state of the water occurred at 0'C, a temperature below 0'C indicates subcooling at atmospheric temperature. Thermocouples number fourteen (14), fifteen (15) and sixteen (16) were inserted in the icepack solutions, and connec;,ed to channels 14, 15 and 16 of the Fluke. The time reading of 118:23:00:00 (data below) is the start of this test, represented by insertion of the icepacks into the freezer compartment and the closing of the inner and outer lids.

The test determines the ability of the RF system to maintain internal set temperatures under high tempera- ture environmental conditions (43'C) while continuing to operate with low duty cycles at steady state. The refrigerator compartment of the RF unit was loaded with three cases (each case containing 100 30 ml bottles) of sterile water simulating packaged liquid vaccines. Thermocouples were inserted in thF corner vaccine bottle in the top and bottom cases and in the center bottle in the middle case as illustrated in Figure 19. The freezer compartment was left empty. Care was taken to ensure free air circulation inside the refrig- erator. There were no air gaps between the cases of vaccine. A gap of at least fifteen millimeters was allowed between the vaccine packages and all internal walls. Thermal stabilization is achieved wt',en ON/OFF cycling of the refrigerator system as controlled by the thermostat maintains internal temperature of the refrigerator compartment within the range of 4 0C to 8'C at each thermocouple point. The refrigerator/freezer, loaded with the simulated vaccine, was operated for a period of over 30 hours after stabilization was achieved. The Control Thermostat of the RF unit was set at -150C. The Control Thermostat is permanently mounted on the front face of the RF unit. The adjustable thermally activated damper between the freezer and refrigerator compartments was set to maintain the refrigerator compartment temperature at 60C. Figure 20 represents the current, voltage, and refrigerator and freezer compartments temperatures as a function of time. Figure 21, an expanded section (A-A) of Figure 20, shows in detail the ON/OFF cycle under steady state conditions. It should be noted that although the voltage line is drawn as a straight line at 13.0 volts, there were brief periods where, due to the unregulated power supply being utilized, the voltage did rise as high as 15.0 volts. This condition seemed mostly to occur on the off cycle of the RF system operation. 2.

Power to the refriger- ation system was supplied by a solar photovoltaic array consisting of nine SPC G12-361 panels connected in parallel. A set of six (12 volt) bat- teries connected in parallel was used to provide storage capacity for the system. An SPC power conditioner, and control unit was incorporated in the RF system to prevent battery overcharging. 2.A No Load Pulldown This test was based on Section 7.5 of the WHO test procedure as was the NO LOAD PULLDO'WN Test as described in the Qualifying Tests Section. The RF unit was allowed to \"soak\" in the environmental chamber for a period of 4 hours, empty, with the inner lids closed and the outer lid open, at 43'C (1107). Upon completion of the \"soak\" period, the freezer- to-refrigerator damper was ad;usted to its maximum opening, the outer lid was closed and the refrigeration system activated. This test was considered to be completed when a temperature of 6 0C or less in the refrigerator compartment was observed, as measured by thermocouple number five (5).

Figure 23 shows the two compartment temperatures as a function of time throughout the test. Data recorded during a 1 hour period in the middle of the test are shown in Figure 24. 2.0 Holdover Test The same \"vaccine\" as used in the Qualifying test phase was placed in the refrigerator compartment. The system was turned on and the \"vaccine\" allowed to stabilize within the 40C to 8'C range before the refrigeration system was turned off signifying the beginning of the test. The freezer compartment was empty throughout the test. The results of this test do not affect the outcome of the test program as a whole. The test is conducted purely for information gathering and cannot be \"passed\" or \"failed\".

REFRIGERATOR L18 HR,30 4IN i-67- w CONCLUSIONS The photovoltaic refrigerator/freezer developed by Solar Power Corporation under the sponsorship of NASA resulted with a reliable product that exceeds the WHO vaccine storage requirements. SPC acknowledges the government sponsorship of this Program without which the refrigerator/ freezer development would most likely not have occurred. Prior to the testing program Solar Power Corporation designed and deve- loped the R/F unit in accordance with the RFP. Several deficiencies in the original design were determined during the testing program. These deficiencies were corrected and implemented. The final result of the program is a better product primarily for NASA and ultimately the people receiving the vaccinations. Although somewhat unsure of the need for everything required by NASA originally, Solar Power demonstrated to itself and the WHO that a photo- voltaic powered vaccine storage refrigerator cannot provide sufficient reliability without an adequate developmental testing program. Several needs had to be studied and evaluated. Specifically the requirements are: 1.Fundamentally reliable components. 2.Careful integration. 3.Thorough laboratory and field testing. The components consisted of the following: 1.Photovoltaic modules 2.Refrigerator/freezer 3.Power processing electronics and regulator 4.Reliable instrumentaton for monitoring Solar Power has a proven history of manufacturing reliable photovoltaic modules. JPL Block IV testing of the Solar Power modules resulted in the first Block testing results without a single problem/failure report. The refrigerator/ freezer selected was demonstrated to be extremely reliable and may be the most energy efficient in existence. The power processing electronics originally proposed were thought to be some of the most reliable. This was not correct. Solar Power discovered that an essential ^..... ^- 4r.f*).- l4t -68- though often overlooked item in the system is the power processing elec- tronics. As a result Solar Power learned that the electronics are likely to fail if not properly integrated into the system. In addition, poorly designed electronics may induce failures in the refrigerator/ freezer, and cause battery failures. Solar Power corrected its design deficiencies by using an all new and entirely solid state set of power processing electronics that will not inhibit or degrade proper performance of the system. The instrumentation system as originally designed included components suggested by NASA and others selected by Solar Power. Ultimately one of the mechanical components was found to be unreliable. To fix this problem, Solar Power designed a solid state replacement for the component. In the final analysis, Solar Power 'Learned that previous experiences of its own and NASA's were not adequate to replace the approach requested by NASA. This design approach resulted in a much better s ystem integration and a Lhorough laboratory and field testing program. The program required nearly two years to complete. In retrospect, the delay was more than justified. 0APPENDIX A STATEMENT OF WORK: CONTRACT DEN3 - 238w POOR QUAL4TY PHOTOVOLTAIC POWEPEL REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER SYSTEM FOR STORAGE OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES Preface to Statement of Work A. Background The purpose of this contract is to develop a photovoltaic (PV) powered refrigerator/freezer system for use in medical out- posts in remote areas of developing countries. At present the three billion people of the less developed world suffer fror.. a plethora of infectious diseases. Because these infections tend to fluorish at the poverty level, they are important indicators of a vast state of collective ill health. The concomitant dis- ability has an adverse effect on agricultural and industrial development, and the infant and child mortality inhibits attempts to control population growth. Vaccination has been used extensively in developed countries over the last feu decades for the prevention of a number of ir.:portant corLmunicable diseases such as poliomyelitis, small pox, diphtheria, and measles. The experiences gained in these coun- tries are now being transferred on a gradually increasing scale to the developing world. However, the application of vaccination In developing countries has met with a number of problems of an econo-ic, operational, and technological nature. One of the main problems consist in the refrigerated storage and transporta- tion of vaccines, the so- called \"cold chain\". The cold chain Is a systen for distributing vaccines in the potent state fror.: the manufacturer to the actual vaccination site. Vaccines exposed to elevated temperatures suffer a permanent loss of - _.. & r ...- 79W _-'... r- - _-a ztract PEN3-238 2 - potency. To remain efficacious most vaccines must be maintained during storage and transport at 4 0 to Bo C. For the more sensi- tive polio and measles vacciner, a -20 0 C temperature is recommended for extended storage times. The available technical solutions to the problem of main- taming the cold chain are mainly based on the presumption that there is a steady supply of electric power, which is frequently not the case in developing countries. The problem is much more serious for these countries in that (1),many of them have a hot tropical climate, and (2) much of the cold chain equipment pro- duced in developed countries is unsuitable for tropical countries. The of effective photovoltaic-powered refrigerator/ freezer boxes ,to be used as peripheral units in the cold chain, is seen by the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) as vital to the success of immunization programs in the develop- ing countries. At present 75% of the population that is to be reached by th*^:irmnunizatioa programs are in areas not served by reliable refrigeration. Dr. Stanley 0. Foster, Center for Disease Control, has estimated that 30,000 refrigeration units will be needed in the next 5 years to support present programs in remote areas when no reliable commercial power supply is available. Photovoltaic-powered refrigeration units could fulfill this seed for remote refrigeration.of-- 8 -ORIGINAL PAGE 19 OF POOR QUALITY>at:act DEN3-238I,i 1 B.

Scope of fork The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, materials, equipment and services to perform the work described under the Technical Tasks listed below. In general, this effort is composed of two phases. In Phase I the contractor shall fabricate and test one (1) qualification model PV powered R/F System and be prepared to perform an option to deliver nine (9) additional PV powered R/F Systems. The initial PY powered P./F System bust meet the system and component per- formance requirements detailed in the Technical Tasks and must pass the specified tests performed by the contractor and verified by NASA. Phase II will be initiated, upon acceptance, by NASA, of the Phase I PV powered R/F System. The contractor shall then be prepared to deliver the ten (10) systems (9 from Option I, Phase II, and the qualification model of Phase I), manuals and other specified software to NASA to complete the contract re- quirements. At the option of NASA, spare parts and/or production, lots of ten systems each may then be procured under terms nego- tiated as part of this contract agreement. Technical Tasks General Guidelines and Requirements - The P1' powered R/F systems will be used in medical outposts in remote areas inmtract DEN3-238 S - ORIGIIN^ARL PAGE 69 -developin g countries. Such use requires a reliable PV QUALITY supply and an efficient, reliable refrigeration unit to minimize energy requirements while continuously maintaining the required temperatures in the R /F unit. The R /F configuration and opera- tion requirements shall be designed to meet the medical use requirements of the systems in their intended environment. For ease of shipping and installation, the system shall be designed as two separate assemblies: (1) A PV array assembly consisting of the Pt modules, array structure, array harness, and main power cable and (2) Another assembly containing all other components Including the R/F box, compressor motor /condensor, battery com- plement,controls, regulator, instrumentation, and assembly tools. All PV powered R/F systems shall be the same size (i.e., same peak-watt PV array, battery capacity, R/F capacity, etc). This standardization is required to reduce unit costs by elimi- nating the need for custom engineering and thus lead ultimately to an off-the -shelf supply situation. The assemblies shall be furnished fully suitable for export air shipment to the developing countries. This will require packaging of the PV powered R/F systems (including battery com- plement, manuals and spare parts, if the option is exercised) to meet applicable air freighting requirements.
