What toxic chemicals are hiding in most common dish soap brands? Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES): These are common foaming agents used in many home cleaning products, including dish soap. SLS and SLES can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs! Triclosan: This antibacterial chemical is often added to dish soap even though it has been linked to hormone disruption, antibiotic resistance, and environmental pollution. Fragrance: Many dish soaps contain synthetic fragrances, which can cause allergic reactions and trigger asthma attacks -not to mention headaches, ugh! Phosphates: These are commonly added to dish soap to help break down grease and food particles. However, when phosphates enter waterways, they can lead to algal blooms and other environmental problems. Luckily, that's not the case for our top picks for the safest dish soaps! What ingredients should we avoid in dish soap? Make sure to avoid formulas with Triclosan, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium dichloroisocyanurate, DEA/MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine. Is Dawn a non toxic dish soap? Dawn is not considered a non-toxic dish soap, as it contains some ingredients that can be harmful to humans and the environment. Unfortunately, triclosan, 1,4-dioxane, synthetic dye, fragrance, and methylisothiazolinone are listed on Dawn's label. So make sure to choose a non-toxic dish soap option instead to keep you and the environment safe. How do you know if dish soap is non toxic? To determine if a dish soap is non-toxic, you can look for particular labels and certifications on the product packaging. Some trusted certifications for non-toxic cleaning products include EPA Safer Choice, Green Seal, and Cradle to Cradle. These certifications ensure that the product has been tested and meets specific environmental and health criteria. Additionally, you can check the ingredients list for any harmful chemicals, such as phthalates, parabens, synthetic fragrances, and sulfates.
