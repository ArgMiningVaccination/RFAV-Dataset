In addition, in combination with nutritional counseling with our nutritionists, it can help you develop a holistic weight loss plan. Acupuncture to Quit Smoking To help support your goals to quit smoking, our acupuncturist will offer auricular (ear) acupuncture in a private room. This can help reduce nicotine cravings by stimulating receptors. Your custom-designed program can also include guided meditation. Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Acupuncture may be an effective treatment for reducing pain since it produces anti-inflammatory and analgesic biological responses. It can relieve knee, back, neck, and head pain without medication or alongside medical treatment. What Can I Expect During a Session? Your acupuncturist will take a health history and perform a physical exam. He or she will work with you to relieve your discomfort and identify and treat the underlying causes of your symptoms. During your treatment, the acupuncturist will insert very thin needles at specific points of your body. When performed by an experienced practitioner, it is safe and comfortable. You may also receive acupressure or other types of therapy, based on your individual symptoms. Your session length depends on your condition.
