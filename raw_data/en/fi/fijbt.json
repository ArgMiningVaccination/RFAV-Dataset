' .. 256 APPENDIX C LIST OF AT - 1 - INTRODUCTION; FINDINGS AND RECOMME~DATIONS The Temporary state Commission to Evaluate the Drug Laws has, in its five year history, addressed the problem of treatment on three prior occasions. In 1972, the Commission advocated a comprehensive system of regulating the manufacture, distribution, and therapeutic application of controlled substances, which would protect against the diversion of mood-altering drugs, but which could also encourage the expansion of treatment and research (Controlled Substances, Legislative Document No. la, 1972). The Commission then carefully balanced the risks and the opportunities entailed in the employment of genuinely rehabilitated addicts, and found that a verifiably good rehabilitation or work record coupled with the capability to perform a specific task were sufficient to reduce the risk of employing reformed addicts to essentially that of employing persons with no history of addiction (Employing the Rehabilitated Addict, Legislative Document No. 10, 1973). Also, in 1973, the Commission carefully evaluated reasons for the success of other countries in dealing with their own drug problems and found that the underlying principle of successful rehabilitation always included attempts, with proper safeguards, to reintegrate the addict with society (How People Overseas Deal with Drugs, Legislative Document No. 11, 1973). One of the most striking observations m~de by the Commission, while abroad, was that whatever success the Japanese, the British, the Dutch, or others could cite with regard to II I I , , j ~ - 2 - preventing drug abuse, the most significant common denominator was often positive action to promote the individual health and development of each child. This observation became the thesis of our study of American drug abuse prevention techniques, particularly those being attempted in New York State (Drug\u00b7 Abuse Prevention, Legislative Document No. 11, 1974). While analyzing the question of prevention, we discussed the role of treatment as a tertiary form of prevention, that is, after the fact of drug abuse. It became clear to us that the treatment of J drug and alcohol abuse in New York State was so complicated by philosophical and practical questions that further analysis would be justified, under our mandate \"to provide the e.Kecutive department and the legislature with comprehensive information on the social, fiscal and health problems associated with narcotics addiction, and drug abuse .. \"* This report is the result of a series of visits, both announced and unannounced, to treatment and research facilities throughout the state. It is the result of several meetings with treatment, research and law enforcement personnel. It is the result of tireless efforts by the Commission staff to read through hundreds of books, papers and monographs on the subjects discussed in this report. It is the result of a variety of questionnaires answered by more than four hundred programs throughout the State. It is also the result of six public hearings held: in New York City on September 4, 1974; ~ *Chapter 474, Laws of 1970. .,. 3 .,. in Mineola, Long Island on September 5th; in Buffalo on Septem\u00ad ber 24th; in Syracuse on September 25th; and in poughkeepsie on october 2nd. A joint hearing on drunk driving was held by this Commission with the Joint Select Committee on Transportation and the Senate Stan4ing Committee on Transportation in Mineola, .New York, on October 17, 1974. Although this report is sharply critical of many aspects of drug and alcohol abuse treatment in New York State, we believe that two prefatory qualifications are vital to an understanding of the treatment problem in tts true pe~spective. First, no other State has even begun to approach the comprehen\u00ad siveness and true dive~sity of the treatment programs in New York. * f alcohol abuse, the faults we find are Except in the area 0 those of unsuccessful planning; they are not mistakes resulting , Second, w\\.lJ.'le we tend to, suppo~t the methadone from not carJ.ng.

RECOM.HENDATIONS Methadone 1. In light of the controvers~ over methadone death statistics in New York City, the Commission recommends an h authorJ.'ty of the State Health Department to pansion of t e ex- , di~ tions from other states, including * Indeed, as tt:.is report goe~l to pres~s~n~~ of the heroin problem. This is a california, pomt to a posstchedrecrufullY\u00b7 with respect to the needs of New developrent that must be wa e care, . York - 4 - investigate and monitor the operation of the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, particularly with regard to its development of statistical data. Such authority should also extend to other Medical Examiners' Offices throughout the State. 2. There is a need to promote employment among rehabilitating addicts in methadone maintenance pro~rams. The Commission endorses the requirement of the Drug Abuse Control Commission that one vocational counselor be retained for each \" one hundred fifty patients. We invite the attention of providers of treatment to the excellent workJbeing carried on in this field by the counselors and job placement workers at the Nassau County Drug and Alcohol Addiction Co~~ission. We believe serious consideration should also be given to the study of such programs as that at long Beach !-Errorial Hospital, with a view toward utilizing openings in hos- pitals, themselves, as structured vocational training slots. 3. We find that the use of public funds to provide free methadone treatment to working patients who can afford to repay some of the cost of that treatment is counterproductive. (a) \\\\!e call upon the Comptroller of the State to audit state outlays of funds, including Hedicaid reimbursements, for patients capable of assuming a portion of the cost of their own care. (b) without engaging in aggressive collection procedures, non-profit drug treatment programs should permit their working patients to contribute a flat-rate weekly fee, such as three dollars per fifty dollars of take-home pay. In this way, the~State could reduce the annual cost of methadone maintenance by upwards of five million dollars.* *An estimated sixteen thousand patients are now able to pay upwards of six dollars per week on this basis. 1 } - 5 - 4. Methadone programs shQuld provide greater r~'crea- tional outlets for patients, to discourage indecorous confron- tations with neighbors of such programs. Community leaders 'should work along with methadone programs to overcome problems of ob- jectionable conduct by patients. Each facility should ffi3.intain an ob- servation of its clients in the neighborhood. 5 . 'l\\:) enhance the employability of rehabilitating addicts, the present federal require~nt that persons in treatment for longer than two years , must report to a clinic at least twice a week should be changed to at least once a week after one year. 6. The Drug Abuse Comnission should consider a nore specific regulation that rrethadone clinics open early in the norning or during the evening to permit working patiepts to pick up their medication without calling attention on the job to their need to do so. 7. Complaints about the rigidity of the current mechanism for granting exceptions to D.A.C.C. rrethadone regulations have led us to recommend the establishment of an advisory committee, comprised of providers of treatment, as well as D.A.C.C. officials, to advise as to measures to expedite decisions in this regard. 8. The State Health Department should suspend all Medicaid payments to methadone clinics, beginning with profit- making clinics, which are unable to provide actual, meaningful back-Up medical and psychiatric care. 9. 'rhe Drug Abuse Control Commission should inquire of treatment programs throughout the state as to the feasibili ty of providing formal psychiatric, psychological and social work evaluations and treatment of clients requesting such services, either through meaningful liaisons with corrununity providers of ,j ... z.. .. .......... a. .............. ________________________________________________________________ _ - 6 - such services, or through the incorporation of such services into treatment programs, themselves. Abstinence Programs 'While D.A.C.C. has assumed that the standards we recom- mend are or should be operational, we believe that the following specific written regulations relating to D.A.C.C. funded facilities would be more productive than the general workscopes now utilized: 1. Smaller p~ogramsJshould be required to concretize their services in as explicit a fashion as possible, and, conse\u00ad quently, their admissions criteria, as well. 2. Larger programs, particularly those which admit persons not abusing drugs or persons only minim~lly involved with drugs, should be required 'to offer a full range of services, as described, herein. 3. All programs should be required to demonstrate the immediate accessibility of medical and psychiatric evalua\u00ad tion back-up services. 4. Periodic urinalysis and reporting of results of urinalysis to D.A.C.C. should be required of all patients who maintain significant contacts with drug-free programs. Since certain tranquilizers and ~lcohol may not be detectable in urine samples, programs should be required to demonstrate their capacity to identify individuals abusing such SUbstances. 5. Professional and paraprofessional staff integration should be explicitly detailed, and heightened emphasis placed upon professional capacity to facilitate patient reentry into the general population. - 7 - Beyond these recommendations for additions to D.A.C.C. regulations, we further recommend the inclusion of outreach and recreational components, such as dayrooms, in all drug programs. Alcohol A. Research: 1. At the present time the State spends approximately six million dollars each year directly on various rrodalities of treatrrent for persons who have alcohol-related problems. The State also appropriates over one hundred million dollars per year for drug treatment programs, for an actual and a potential client population perhaps one third as large as the State's problem drinking population. As the focus shifts to providing more services to persons with alcohol and polydrug-alcohol problems, it would be sound social policy to begin a' study of each of the present treatment modalities, with an evaluation of success with patients within each type of program, as well as a comparison of the success of different types of programs. In that way, repetitions of the mistakes made in the hurried establishment and funding of drug programs may be avoided. 2. Continued pressure should be brought to bear upon funding sources to combine research with treatment, for the pur\u00ad pose of establishing pilot treatment programs on a purely research basis, so that results may be evaluated concurrently with the de\u00ad livery of treatment services. Viewed in this perspective, new forms of treatment would become aspects of research. 3. Epidemiological studies are useful in determining the scope of the problem. Cooperation between the State Health Al h 1 Researc'h Institute might serve to Department and the co 0 stretch precious resources while accomplishing this purpose . ....... --~-------------~ - 8 - 4. When speaking of the subjects of alcohol and education, many people refer to the idea that educational efforts regarding \"values clarification,\" \"decisionmaking,1I and warnings against alcohol abuse may deter each abuse. Efforts in the past that have failed often prompt the search for a new jargon and catchier slogans, and declarations that future efforts will avoid previous mistakes. A full analysis of these ideas appears in our report on Drug Abuse Prevention (cited above). Aside from informing people about the mature of human dysfunctions and calling their attention on an individual basis to their own problems in this regard coupled with giving them opportunities to receive help, there is little that education can achieve in ,the sense of deterring substance abuse solely through verbal manipulative techniques. However, education in the sense of teaching professionals how to deal with problems of alcohol abuse among their patients and their clients has been a much neglected area of concern. According to the Department of Mental Hygiene, there are seven subdivisions of students whose ultimate clients and patients would benefit from educational efforts at this level. These subdivisions of students are thos~ involved in professional degree education, such as medicine, psychology, nursing, social work and law; those involved in post professional degree education; undergra,duates seeking degrees in health care or human services; candidates for in-service education within existing agencies; participants ~n continuing education for professionals; those likely to attend periodic workshops; and alcoholism counselors. i d - 9 - We recommend that the Alcoholism Research Institute prepare courses of study for these categories of students, particularly family physicians, whose lack of familiarity with alcohol-related problems has been well documented.* 5. The excellent work of Alcoholics Anonymous is well known. For some of the persons who cannot respond to traditional psychiatric intervention and casework, A.~. represents not only a last hope, but a real hope. According to A.A. nearly half of the people who remain rrerrbers never drink again. Virtually every worthwhile treatment program today offers easy access to A.A. We believe that a prime research effort should be made to understand conceptually how A.A. achieves its results, and to what extent the concept might be broadened, without inviting the errors of the therapeutic communities. other studies of the Institute should, of course, pro- ceed. And in order to meet the suggested order of priorities, additional funding may be needed. Our recommendation in this regard is that moneys saved in the drug abuse field should be reallocated to alcohol research. Beyond those savings, however, additional funds may ul,timately be needed for further alcohol\u00ad rela'ted research and treatment. In recommending that such increases be preceded by meaningful evaluations, we are also mindful of the fact that revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages in New York state exceed three hundred fifty million dollars, annually. The damage to the State of alcohol-related problems *Planning' Guidelines, New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, 1973-1974, pp. 69-73. -10 - is estimated to be over one billion dollars. Yet the state spends only seven million dollars for treatment and research. We do not urge spending for its own sake. However, we also do not oppose justifiable increases in expenditures fo~ evalua- tions and for programs that work. B. Treatment: Alcohol-related problem~ occur with varying degrees of severity and at differing points in time among a variety of individuals. It is necessary that treatment services be provided in a comprehensive and systematic way, with built-in mechanisms to assure accessibility to the services, continuity of care, and availability of treatment for as long as individuals require it. Programs should not be developed which are piecemeal in character, possibly leading to \"revolving door\" utilization without significant impact on the individuals involved. . Children and Parents This Commission finds that in the absence of a real effort to shore up families, funds spent on treatment of child drug abusers are often wasted. Therefore, this Commission recommends: 1. Funding for research and pilot programs exploring the use of family counseling, including family therapy. Guide- lines should encourage the inclusion of family counseling services in drug progrmns, or in a nearby community facility working co\u00ad operatively with the drug program. ~~~-~-------------- --- - -\\ { ; ~ , , f I ( ~ i I -11 .... 2. A training program in family counseling and family therapy skills for both professionals and paraprofessionals in the drug abuse field. 3. The encouragement of family therapy and family counseling in present neighborhood based facilities, public and private, such as community mental health centers, other Health Maintenance organizations, community centers, ,churches. Such services can be publicized through P.T.A. 'S neighborhood associations, and narcotic guidance councils. 4. Families should be kept together. We recommend: a. That placement should be viewed as a last resort. Placement should be viewed as a temporary condition, with the expectation acknowledged that eventually the child will return to his family and the family should be prepared to cope with him constructively. b. The provision of concrete services to strengthen the families of children in trouble, those using drugs and those expressing their troubles in other ways. c. Imaginative and creative planning by social service professionals, to use the assets available to a child, such as relatives and neighbors who care about him. d. Neighborhood based service centers of various kinds do exist. Their work should be coordinated, so that cooperatively in the aggregate they offer a comprehensive range of services. U ---------~ ---- ------ - ----------12 - e. Coordinating programs which service the senior citi\u00ad zens with those which service families. A major problem with senior citizens is their sense of valuelessness and loss of self esteem when they retire' or \\l1hen t.hcir: children are all grown. Children and young parents in the inner city suffer from the absence of grandparents, aunts and uncles. If the two groups can come together, both gain. 5. When Placement is necessary: J ' a. There should be flexibility in the use of resources, including placement resources, so that each child's plan is tailored to his needs, not the agency's. b. When placement of more than one child in a family is necessary, the siblings should be placed together. 6. Acceptance of responsibility for a child by one agency, and when possible one social worker, on a continuing long term basis, no matter where that child is living, until he or she has been lauched on a life-program which is satisfying to him and to society. The model for this assumption of continuing responsibility exists in jurisprudence. A Judge can assume continuing responsibility for a case, and that case will then return to that Judge for review and supervision at any time in the future. It is high time that the social work profession recognized how essential it is to the well-being of a child that there be one helping adult to whom he can turn whatever vicissi- tude:s of life assail him. There is nothing in law or guidelines preventing the assumption of such responsibility for each child. In point of fact, in many cases, as in the one cited herein, j I \\ , \" ! , I 1 ; , , ; I I , t , I 11 -13 - prime responsibility for the family does rest with one agency, the Department of Social Services, from the child's birth to maturity. That Department even in some cases has statutory responsibility to supervise the services offered that child by other agencies, because it must approve reimbursement to such agencies. What is missing is the personal responsibility of a single worker supervising, in substance, not form --a worker who knows the child. The Drug Abuse Control Commission 1. D.A.C.C. has been reexamining its role as a primary provider of treatment. We adopt as a recommendation the view implicit in the January, 1974 report of the Legislative Commission on Expenditure Review that whi+e continuing to fund other treatment programs, D.A.C.C. should continue to reexamine the scope of its role as a primary provider of treatment. 2. We recommend the development of a Drug Research Institute to bring together the work of existing New York State drug research undertakings and to develop them into a comprehensive institute, similar to the Alcohol Research Institute, with which its work should be closely coordinated. We further recommend that the Drug Research Institute begin evaluations of all drug programs throughout the state, public and private. 3. We recommend that the Sta\u00b7te Comptroller perform an audit of the operations of D.A.C.C. and D.A.C.C. funded agencies and ,facilities. 4. Pending the creation of an agency to deal with all addictions, we recommend that the Department of Mental Hygiene Division of Alcoholism be given expanded authority to treat \\j Ifz believe that D.A.C.C. and the Department of Mental Hygiene Division of Alcoholism should be required to promulgate regulations governing treatment in drug programs of polydrug abusers with alcohol-related problems. For doubtful cases, there should be a joint local referral committee to decide which agency will take respon:sibility. Drunk Driving Pending the completion of a report to the Legislature by the Department of Motor Vehicles on their estimate of the J effectiveness of drunk driving programs in this State, this Commission's recommendations based upon the overview presented here, should be, and are, made in principle: 1. The mandatory diversion of drinking drivers to educational programs, such as the one in Dade County, Florida, would appear to, serve two purposes: a. The casual drinker who is convicted of drunk driving may learn the full nature and the consequences of his conduct and how to avoid such conduct in the future; and b. The problem drinker or alcoholic may be able to come to understand that drunk driving represents only one of several dysfunctions related to the use of alcohol. Recognizing other dysfunctions may be the first step towards developing motivation for treatment. In this latter context, no countermeasures pro'gram could possibly be effective without the incorporation of trained personnel in the helping professions, and also representatives *Prompt medical evaluation and treatment are particularly essential , in dealing with drug abusers who also use alcohol. II ! i i 1 [ -15 - of Alcoholics Anonymous, both to help the individual recognize his problems, as well as to help him secure treatment. 2. Because we are also recommending evaluation of the effectiveness of current treatment apprcaches to alcoholism, we believe that it would be premature to impose mandatory treatment requirements for convicted drunk drivers, at this time. However, the voluntary participation of person in a treatment program for a period of time, and evidence of the alleviation of other alcohol-related problems, might be useful considerations in the determination to restore his license. 3. The reluctance of juries to convict persons charged with drunk driving offenses may be attributable to three causes: a. Juries identify with defendants, because jurors themselves, tend to drive after drinking. If this is the case, nothing short of a total ban upon the operation of a motor vehicle soon after drinkin~1 regardless of how little or how much, could possibly be effective as a penal sanction. b. Jurors do not feel that drunk driving is serious. This seems unlikely. c. Jurors may have intuited that drunk driving is a medical problem and that the penalty structure is irrelevant to its meaningful solutioh. It seems to us that the most likely reading of the difficulty prosecutors report in achieving convictions for drunk driving is this third possibility, that juries believe the problem is not one of appropriate criminal sanctions, but rather, a problem f I , ' -16 - based upon the motivation for and the availability of treat\u00ad ment. Seen in this light, we recommend that further study be given to the folrowing procedure to be used in New York State: First, empower the police to administer a roadside or a station house chemical test. If the driver fails the test, allow the police to suspend his license, and give him the op\u00ad tion of a criminal proceeding, under the penalty statutes, to J clear himself, or a civil proceeding to regain his license. Second, if the fact of drunk driving is established either way, mandate participation in a countermeasures pro\u00ad gram for purposes of establishing the eligibility of such an individual to regain his license. Third, mQ~e specific offers of meaningful evaluation and treatment to apparently debilitated or troubled drinking drivers, with a view towards dealing with the underlying causes of their unwanted behavior, and thus, perhaps, reduce the overall problem by the successful outcome of treatment in a significant number of individual cases. In the event that the Legislature should conclude that a reduction in penalties would lead to a greater number of convictions in drunk driving cases, we would also suggest, as a condition thereof, the enactment of mandatory participation in a countermeasures program, such as the one describE\\d in our previous report, Drug Abuse Prev~ntion (cited above). -17 - CHAPTER I RESOLVING THE METHADONE CONTROVERSY Methadone is a synthetic opiate, technically an opioid. The opiates have a long history as analgesics. The use of opium , and, later, morphine to prevent medical complications and death as a result of intense pain is well known. Morphine was first introduced into widespread medical use during the American Civil War. The addictive properties of the opiates became a social problem during the Industrial Revolution, when narcotic addicts could be found amon~ injured war veterans, women who had 'been given excessive doses of morphine during childbirth, and among certain alcoholics, for whom alcohol was apparently not enough. Around the turn of the century, a German pharmaceutical firm (Bayer) marketed what was at first thought to be a safe, non-addictive analgesic called heroin. Heroin is an opiate, a further refinement of morphine. It was sold over the counter as a cough remedy, and was also used as a analgesic, until its addictive properties became widely knCMn. During the 1920's, it is said one of the reasons abuse of the stim- ulant cocaine became fashionable, was the disreputable status of opiate addiction, which even then, claimed as many as two hundred thou\u00ad sand victims. Despite the enactment and enforcement of strict laws against the unlawful possession and sale of narcotics and despite the total medical proscription of heroin, the addict population remained relatively stable'unti~ World'\u00a2ar II. -18 - Since all heroin is manufactured outside the United States, the h7ar interrupted its illicit importation. Unfortunate- ly, the basic social conditions which created a market for heroin did not improve, and to a great extent, alcoholism was seen in- creasingly in addition to heroin and cocaine use throughout poorer sections of the country. After the Second World War, illicit narcotics traffic resumed, again striking at poor people. The J. consumption of alcohol increased, as well. In addition, abuse of amphetamines and barbiturates were more frequently seen. Between 1921 and 1967 no treatment was generally available in New York State for heroin addiction, and very little was avail- able for alcoholism. Both types of illness were on the rise, however, and inflation coupled with wider medical demands for the legitimate production of opium, which has always been susceptible to diversion for the manufacture of illicit morphine and heroin, began to give an even more sinister cast to the heroin problem in America: Few people could afford the increasing doses of heroin needed to maintain the desired euphoria, without engaging in crime to secure the necessar.y funds to pay for the drug. The fact that Americans, in particular, seem to equate euphoria with happiness is a phenomenon probably associated with the combination of a sophisticated technology that Eromises manu\u00ad factured happiness, in the sense of unremitting elation, dnd the frustration of postponing one's share in that manufactured hap- piness, or in the sense of loss of an elation that could never have been sustained, when the manufactured happiness is recognized 11 11 1 r I I J , : 1 ; ; . , . 1 : i 11 ~. 1. 11 i! if n i i -19 - by the more affluent for the instant trash it usually tUrns out to be. 't wl'th l'ts eye on unremitting elation, was A consumer SOCle y, tempted to spend billlons , of dollars on health care, mental health, , and addl'ction, and did so, without once housing, education, crlme adverting to that time-honored maxim of receiving a dollar's worth of value for each dollar spent. Perhaps the widening availability of a variety of substances, including mood-altering drugs, al\u00ad Imved us to make the logical leap from the problem observed to solved, wl'thout timely inquiry into the effectiveness the 1?roblem 1 their cost-effectiveness, and without of our programs, let a one proper caution with regard to the acceptance of mood-altering drugs, such as the minor tranquilers, as substitutes for personal problem solving. When the abuse of heroin and other drugs usually anathematized along with it became current among middle-class young people, and when addiction-related crime began to spread, , there was a sharp demand for a treatment response by government. The irony in the United States was that general medical care became available first to drug addicts, a fact to be remembered sources of hostility which later developed to\u00ad when considering wards drug treatment programs. During World War II, the Germans were cut off from their supplies of opium. In 1942, German scientists were able h' narcotl'c similar to morphine, without recourse to synt.eslze a . to opium or its derivatives . The drug was methadone. More than twenty Y, -------------------~------------------~-i:. -20 - YODrs later, Drs. Vincent Dole and Harie Nys~ander of Rockefeller UJliversity developed the idea that methadone was somehow different from other narcotics. It was well knovm that cross-tolerances could be demonstrated among narco~ic drugs. However, the desire for increasing dosages, whether psychological or physiological, could not he deterred by the substitution of one narcotic for anolher. Dole and Nyswander postulated that methadone, with its different origin, might satisfy a 6raving for other narcotic drugs even when a level of tolerance was reached. The basic Dole- Nyswander approach was: 1. Detoxify the addict from heroin, using methadone. 2. Gradually increase the oral dosage of methadone to beb-leen 80 and 120 milligrams per day. 3. At a stable dosage of 100 milligrams of methadone a day: (a) The heroin addict would not go through painful with- drawal; (b) The addict would soon lose all sense of euphoria and side-effects from the methadone, enabling him to function normally; (c) The addict would no longer crave narcotics, and ad\u00ad ditional self-administered narcotics would have no effect; (d) The addict's health would no longer be threatened by adulterated drugs, dirty needles, collapsed veins and other problems associated with heroin use; and (e) The addict would be available for counseling, therapy, and rehabilitation, to guide him away from criminal activities and -21 - toward socially constructive endeavors. Rehabilitation would also serve as a deterrent to the substitution by the addict of non-narcotic drugs to waste away while achieving \"a high\". The -theory was extremely attractive, because of the continual failure of other forms of treatment. The most notable series of failures occured subsequent to the release of heroin addicts from the penitentiary. As a consequence of having been denied narcotics while in prison, addicts emerged apparently no longer physically addicted to heroin. However, the craving for the drug tended to overwhelm so many of them, of such varied back\u00ad grounds and of so many differing potentialities for rehabilitation, that the reality of this aspect of addiction had to be recognized. Theories of addiction began to proliferate. Some viewed addiction as a problem of weak character. Some thought addiction was a pro\u00ad duct of mental illness. Some surveyed inadequate social condi\u00ad tions and indicated they thought there was just so much people could take. Some spoke of subtle biochemical changes induced by ~ drugs. All observers were fascinated by, if apprehensive about, the backfire concept of using an addictive drug to arrest the undesir\u00ad able aspects of an ongoing problem of addiction. The backfire concept in medicine is not new. It was redis\u00ad covered by Dr. Edward Jenner, who guessed that a mild inoculation of cowpox could prevent smallpox. The germ theory of disease, which explained this discovery, was developed by Pasteur, who was born the year before Jenner died.

There is no accepted explanation for this discovery at this time. To the layman, the introduction of a disease to prevent a disease, or the induction of a lethal process to arrest a lethal process, may have the ring of charlatanism about it. On the other hand, an idea which would sound facetious in a drawing room, may open new vistas of knowledge when developed by careful and re\u00ad spected researchers. Progress in science is not the product of ideas which may occur at random to anyone, but of the occurrence of a particular idea significantly within a carefully planned research framework. Nevertheless, when scientific discoveries are offered as instruments of social policy, great care must be taken to com\u00ad pare the social conditions sought to be remedied with the original experiments which led to the discoveries. The apprehensions sur\u00ad rounding an application of methadone maintenance as a common form of treatment for narcotic addiction could not be and were not dis\u00ad missed lightly. At Rockefeller University, Dole and Nyswander found that the five attributes of methadone maintenance that had been postulated could be demonstrated. The Food and Drug Admin\u00ad istration authorized the use of methadone to maintain addicts on an experimental ~basis in several selected cities, including New York City, New Haven, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Chicago. , i I ~ ;:-J , I l.i Ii It 1 I U -23 - Opposition to this modality focused upon the following concerns: 1. If methadone has the same subjective significance to the addict that heroin has, then society is yielding to the immoral desires of the addict. 2. Methadone may have incapacitating effects, similar to those of heroin. Conse u tl 't q en y, 1. S use may eliminate crime, but not increase the capacity of the individual to function pro\u00ad ductively. It may also cause the individual, who could require methadone for the rest of his life, to become dependent, in a physical sense, on the government or on private sources bent upon exploitation. 3. To the extent that drug addiction is symptomatic of psychogenic or internalized socio-economic factors, methadone may block efforts to engage the patient in therapy or meaningful re\u00ad socialization. 4. Methadone may be diverted for profit and create a danger of overdose and primary methadone addiction. Between 1969 and 1971 over 50,000 heroin addicts were placed on methadone maintenance. The Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention gathered together all of the statistical data then available from the Food and Drug Administration, law enforcement agenc~.es, and scientists. The evidence was mounting that persons maintained on methadone were likely to decrease their criminal conduct at the same time they were becoming rehabilitated in terms of social and vocational adjustments. Late in 1971, the -24 - Special Action Office announced its recommendation that methadone maintenance no longer be considered an experimental treatment modality_ Because of what was believed to be the epidemic nature of heroin addiction, and the inability of public facilites, such as Beth Israel Hospital in New York City,to satisfy the need reflected by enormous waiting lists of addicts seeking treatment, the federal government had licensed a number of private practitioners, during the 1960's, to maintain patients on methadone. For the most part, such practitioners were ethical and performed a needed function. But several were nothing more than wholesale drug dealers, and their indifference to considerations other than profit left an unpleasant taste for private clinics with the public and a,lso set the stage for the promulgation of extremely restrictive regulations, first at the federal level and, later, at state and local levels. (Digests of regulations are appended to this report.) The decision of the federal government to approve the use of methadone maintenance as a treatment modality was based upon satisfaction that objections to such treatment could be over\u00ad come. To those who argued ~ha.t the use of methadone was a sign of yielding to immorality, the federal government responded with requirements for frequent urinalysis and a requirement that no person be admitted to a program unless a dependence on narcotic drugs for at least two years could be demonstrated. The theory was that within that two-year period, the addict should have exhausted other avenues of assistance. Moreover, addiction for 1 \" \\ ~ : ~ ; , J t j { 11 i i i ( 1 i i 1 it -25 - less than two years was co~sidered as insufficient reason for transfering a patient onto methadone, from which detoxification takes somewhat longer than from heroin. The objections that methadone might incapacitate an individual in terms of work or education, and might make him incapable of exercising his rights against treatment programs, were overcome by studies demonstrating the alertness, the excel\u00ad lent work records, the good coordination and the swift, appro- priate reactions of persons maintained on high doses of methadone (Employi,ng the Rehabilitated Addict, Commission Report, Legisla\u00ad tive Document No. 10, 1973). Moreover, the regulations were drafted to ensure the availability of medical, counseling and vocational services to the addict. A later regulation called for an explana- tion of the reasons for maintaining a patient on methadone longer than two years. Another concern of those who objected to methadone.main- tenance was that of diversion. The regulations required that take\u00ad home privileges be extremely limited, and that in no event should any person be permitted fewer than two visits to a clinic each week, regardless of his length of time in a program. With regard to the issue of whether methadone masks psychogenic or internalized socio-economic drug abuse etiologies, the debate continues. However, those who supported the inc]!.',eased availability of methadone pointed out that while any social problem can be reduced to the workings of the human mind, addiction may be more of a sociological, rather than a psychoLogical development.

PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC There are one hundred eighty-one methadone clinics in New York State, serving upwards of)forty thousand patients. Of these clinics, one hundred fifty-three are in New York City, twenty\u00ad two of which are private, profit-making ventures.

Prior to the issuance of federal regulations removing methadone from its experimental status and approving it for general use under strict guidelines, serious concern had arisen regarding a few unscrupulous practitioners who sold methadone for profit. Although the \\'lorst offenders were closed down, in an effort to which this Commission contributed, some observers came to view the profit motive as inconsistent with the operation of a metha\u00ad done clinic in the public interest and in the interests of its own patients. Continued diversion of methadone, subsequent to the promulgation of new federal regulations, was inferred by some to originate with private programs, and, therefore, suppo:t:'ted this contention. 1 !

II ~ -27 - In attempting to analyze this question, the Commission staff has met with community leaders, government officials, and providers of treatment. The staff has also visited methadone treatment programs, both public and private, around the state, and particularly in New York City. Some staff visits were an- nounced, others were unannounced. Some observations were made with the knowledge of the programs, others were made unobtrusively. Reports have also been received, both directly and indirectly, from the State Health Department, the Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Our finding is that while there have been sporadic deviations from the regulations, we know of no methadone program in operation at this writing, public or private, which is engaged in a wholesale violation of federal and state law to the extent of diverting large quantities of medi\u00ad cation to numbers of buyers for a profit. We also believe it neces\u00ad sary to question the basic premise of widespread methadone diver\u00ad sion in New York City. Although trie issue of methadone diversion has been publicized in the media, to the point that most people tend to accept it as fact, all roads along the diversion trail lead to statistics published by the Acting Chief Medical Examiner in New York City regarding so-called methadone related deaths. The controversy over methadone death statistics is well known. On November 10, 1972, then Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Milton Helpern, denied the validity of statistics issued by his own office, and on July 21, 1974, Dr. Helpern, now retired, was quoted by The New York T' d 1 . th t t' t' the output of \"an overzealous ~~ as ec ar~ng ose s a ~s ~cs -28 - assistant in his office who was eager to discredit methadone\". Despite Dr. Helpern1s candor, the controversy has not ended. We believe that the reason for this is the absence of published criteria for determining when a specific drug may be validly reported as the cause of death. In August of 1974, the Medical Examiner's Office issued new statistics. The New York Times, which usually takes great pains to see that its headlines J are supported by the story content, bannered the message that metha- done deaths in 1973 were double those of heroin deaths in the same year. The story, however, raised some other interesting points, both of fact and of omission: All narcotic deaths were down twenty-five percent. Most officials believe the overall reduction is attributable to the accessibility of treatment programs, particularly methadone maintenance clinics, which treat over thirty-three thousand addicts, as opposed to abstinence programs, which treat perhaps two-thirds as many persons, relatively few of whom are now true narcotic ad- dicts. The Medical Examiner did not s\"tate t nor did The Times inquire into the specific circumstances of the one hundred eighty\u00ad one deaths directly attributed to methadone. As witnesses frequently testified during Commission hearings, three ounces of lead intro\u00ad duced at high speed into the cerebral cortex of a methadone abuser is as .likely to result in death as the presence of methadone. The statistic of one hundred eighty-one deaths (even if valid) out of an in-treatment population of thirty-three thousand -29 - and an untreated population estimated by Dr. Vincent Dole to be as high as seventy-thousand, reveals a problem to be further di- minished, but hardly one so calamitous as to invite the attention it received. This continuing controversy in the New York City Medi- cal Examiner's Office leads the Commission to recomme~d an expansion of the authority of the New Yo:r:k State Department of Health to investigate and monitor the development of statistics by the Office, as well as those throughout the state. Let us assume, however, that a certain amount of metha- done is currently being diverted, whatever the actual statistics.* The question remains as to why any methadone is being diverted and whether private programs are more likely to be sources for such diversion than public programs. Compared to heroin, methadone is a long-acting drug. Patients stabilized at one hundred milligrams per day do not usually experience any significant effect fran heroin taken in tandem with the rretha- done. However, the arrount of rrethadone needed to prevent withdrawal sym- toms can be reduced to considerably less. The methadone patient who no longer craves heroin and is, 'therefore, not fearful of a relapse, may be able to Use only a portion of his methadone and * Police arrest statistics tend to indicate only a willingness of some persons in programs to sell small quantities of methadone to undercover agents posing as addicts feigning withdrawal. They do not indicate the actual number of non-police induced sales, nor do enforcement authorities perceive organized distribution efforts. \u00b7'''t .. , -30 - sell the rest. The patient who desires simply to lower his tolerance to methadone in order to achieve some sensation from heroin, may sell some of his methadone to purchase heroin. The purchase of heroin by methadone patients is not unknown; but it is usually detected by the presence of morphine or quinine in the urine. At a time when heroin of good quality is rarely available in significant quantities, methadone patients who j are experiencing difficulty in adjustment or resocialization tend to turn to non-narcotic drugs, such as tranquilizers and alcohol. While some tranquilizers, such as barbiturates, are detectable. by routine analysis, others are not,ond tl}e prog:ram must rely on the ab\u00ad sence of methadone in the urine and the demeanor of the patient to detect the existence of a problem. The fact that a ntethadone pa\u00ad tient may be using other drugs does not usually indicate that he is selling his methadone. He may either be taking other drugs in addi tion to the methadone, or he may Simply be discarding t.he metha\u00ad done. The misbehavior of a methadone patient is, in most cases, attributable to three causes. First, most methadone patients are gainfully employed. The resocialization of methadone patients tends to be far more rapid than that of narcotic addicts in other types of programs. The absence of work, on the other hand, is a severe impediment to rehabilitation, particularly for methadone patients. For these pati:nts methadone is not the substitute \"high\" in place of heroin addiction, since stabilized methadone patients seldom feel euphoric on their medication; rather, work: achieving at a -31 - job, becomes the sUbstitute \"high\". Methadone patients at work are industrious; they frequently have good morale; and they usually relish their new found feelings of importance.* Without work, the temptation to return to old habits, or variations thereon, may seem irresistible. The importanpe of constructive activity for methadone patients requires emphasis, because this treatment mo\u00ad dality, regardless of the number of counselors employed, does not by its very nature restructure character through confrontations and live-in situations. Oddly enough, it is often not the public methadone programs which support a work ethic, but the private programs, and, to a lesser: extent, the voluntary programs. In depth interviews with staff members of Drug Abuse Control Commission multimodality programs and with New Ynrk City Methadone MaintEmance Program personnel revealed a sense of hopelessness, a hopelessness that is communicated to their clie~ts, regarding ultimate job placement for as many as ten percent of the addicts now in treiatment. Their theory is stated both in psychological and in political terms. Some addicts have only enough ego strength to stop using drugs. To expect them to become constructively occupied is simply expecting too much. Moreover, so the political end of the argument goes, if a percentage of non-addicts have a right to do nothing and collect welfare, why should all addicts be expected to work? The Commission finds these arguments to be specious. Every respected authority in the field of education, psychology WWe have appended to this report the results of a carefully con\u00ad trolled employment project at Equitable which bears out these statements. .. ; ,. , . -32 - and human behavior shares the view that people normally ha\\ve a need to feel productive. Understanding the full range of (:!duca\u00ad tional and vocational requirements of addicts, as well as each addict's unique situation and potential, calls for the professional expertise of experienced vocational rehabilitation counselors. Understaru~;ng the job market and how to place rehabilitated addicts, how to develop employer trust, and how to help the rehabilitated ad\u00ad dicts to adjust to a job situation tS the role of tough-mindE~d job placement workers. Of course it is easier to hire a psychologist, 'who can invent reasons for doing nothing, than to hire vocational experts who will keep the entire program on its mettle. Of course it is easier to hire counselors who cannot distinguish between dead\u00ad end training programs and programs leading to genuine opportunities, because such counselors can always blame the addict for ul tir:late rehabilitation failure, rather than blaming the shortcomings of their own program. It has been said, \"drug addiction is a chronic re- , lapsing syndrome\". 'Ibis formulation can and has been used as a pretext for pessimism, inaction, and resistance to evaluation. Relapses among working, recovered addicts are infrequent. Creating the anticipation of relapse, for the employer or for the rehabilita\u00ad ting addict, invites not only complacency and incompetence of staff personnel, it invites the self-fulfillment of a cynical prophesy. * Despite this sharp criticism, as we did in our report entitled, Emplgying the Rehabilitated Addict, cited above, we again wish to call attention to the excellent work being done by W \"A Perspective on vocational R'ehabilitation planning\" Erie County Division of Addiction Services, July, 1974. ,J<Il; , I\"~ I i I ! j ! ) \\ t J I i ' i I, Ii' i 1 I ! I! Ii II Ii II [ -33 - the Na.ssau County Drug and Alcohol Addiction Commission, which continues to give the lie to the view that because an addict has not worked out on one job or because he has failed to complete one training program, he should be abandoned to welfare and medi\u00ad cation for the rest of his life. We also applaud the innovative approach of the Long Beach Memorial Hospital Drug Program. They denominate their effort as an attempt to \"resocialize\" patients. t The emphasis tends to be one-on-one counseling, not with reference to character restructure, but with reference to helping patients 'identify coping skills needed in social and work situations. One of their techniques is the use of the hospital, itself, as a train\u00ad ing ground for rehabilitating addicts. A general hospital maintains a cross-section of employ\u00ad ment opportunities. Instead of referring all individuals to train\u00ad ing.programs at the North Shore Hospital, some of which are alleged to set unrealistic goals, ~he Long Beach staff uses its hospital to help patients adapt to a variety of working and learning situations. A number of rehabilitating addicts participate in hospital functions, both on a paid and on an unpaid basis. This approach is highly regarded by the hospital's own administration. It also appears to have promise with regard to polydrug abusers, who can be counseled professionally while they work in a supervised and structured en\u00ad vironment. This theme will, therefore, recur in the forthcoming discussion on abstinence programs. Turning to profit-making programs, the charge is heard that because profit-making programs receive Medicaid reimbursement \" I, -34 - for indigent patients, the taxpayers contribute to such profits, which inflate in inverse proportion to the services allegedly denied patients. Medicaid was designed, in part, to induce upper income practitioners to attend indigent patients. There was never any question that Medicaid should apply only to public and non-. profit services. The average payment by a working addict to a private clinic is twenty dollars per week. The average reimburse\u00ad ment authorized per visit by Medic~id is six dollars, although pending the outcome of current litigation, New York City approves only four dollars per visit for profit-making programs. A volun\u00ad tary agency, such as Beth Israel, which provides full back-up care to a number of clinics, receives reimbursement at the rate of over fourteen dollars per patient visit. The Health Services Adminis\u00ad tration of New York City receives over seven and one-half dollars per patient visit. In terms of dollars and cents, working addicts in private progr8~ssubsidize a portion of the total cost of care . for indigent patien'cs in such programs. The requirements of ser\u00ad vices under federal and state regulations and the limitations on the nlwber of patients to be treated at anyone facility, reduces the argument about inflated profits to its proper perspective. MorE~over I since as many as one-third of the patients in private progra~s are on Medicaid, great emphasis is placed upon rehabilita\u00ad tion via employment and job training. It stands to reason that a higher percentage of profit-making clinic patients are gainfully employed than ~re patients in public programs. The Commission staff asked a number of patients in pri-I i 1 \\ ! i I ; I I f \\ II t1 t! I j I) (I II ~ -35 - vate programs why they continued to pay for treatment they could receive for nothing at public or voluntary programs. Although some patients cited the convenience of a particular location, such as \u00b7the docks near the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, where one re\u00ad habilitated addict works, and some cited the hours the clinic was open, most of the patients expressed a feeling of pride in being able to pay th~ir own way. A few were cynical, even embittered about their course of rehabilitation. The majority, however, felt closer to normality than they had ever been in their lives. Rather than raising questions about the public interest in maintaining private programs, the Medicaid-profit controversy raises disturbing questions about the operation of public and vol- untary programs. The Commission has been informed officially that no payment is ~ sought from working patients in voluntary pro\u00ad grams, such as those operat~d by Beth Israel, and in those operated .' by New York City. The total cost of methadone programs in New York State is over fifty-five and one-half million dollars. Of this . I t and one-half million dollars is allocated total, approxlmate y en for private patient reimbursement. The rest is unrepaid outlay for thousands of patients, many of whom are working and could be reimbursing the government, rather than receiving free treatment. At a time when the high cost of medical care to all citizens is a matter of serious concern, any unwarranted largesse to addicts must be carefully reappraised. '. ~--~------------~---------------------- -------- ----,------- --- -n- -36 - The cost analysis of methadone is as follows: $42.6 million (Organized contract programs) $14.4M State (50% Medicaid (25% state ) (25% local ) 9.5M Local governments and other sources 2.5 million (State-operated facilities ~ 50% federal 50% state) 10.5 million (Private practitioners) $55.6 million (See chart on following page for Medicaid reimbursement rates.) If, conservatively speaking, ten thousand of the patients currently at work and on methadone were permitted to pay ten dollars per week, the state could reduce the cost of methadone treatment by five million dollars per year. If an additional five thousand patients were willing to pay twenty dollars per week for their treat\u00ad ment, the state could save still another five million dollars. The catch is, of course, that even if the patient wishes to pay, he is systematically discouraged from doing so. The worst incident along these lines involved a patient in a private program, who was working, and who transferred to a public program when his private program re- located. He asked whether he could pick up his methadone either at seven in the morning, before starting work at eight, or in the evening. He was 'told that such arrangements were impossible, and if he could not manage, he should quit his job and apply for Medicaid. The Commission recommends the following: 1. The Drug Abuse Control Commission should gather together from the State Department of Health, which administers Medicaid, the State Department of Social Services, and its own programs materials necessary to aud~t any and all outlays o\u00a3 state funds for the care of drug addicts and drug abusers capable of providing some payment for the services they receive. il \\ i . -37 - CHART 1974 MEDICAID RATES INDEPENDENT OUT OF HOSPITAL HEALTH FACILITIES: New York City Region: Addiction Research & Treatment Corp.

Without engaging in aggressive collection procedures, non-profit drug treatment programs should provide a simple, onging and direct method of encouraging the weekly payment of fees from working patients. Since sliding-scale fees are difficult to ad\u00ad minister, we recommend the establishment of low, flat-rate fees, such as three dollars for every fifty dollars of take-home pay. 3. Regulatiens of the Drug Abuse Control Commission should require each methadone cli~ic to be open long enough in the early morning or in the evening to permit working patients to pick up the:~ medication without calling attention on the job to their need to do so. 4. The federal government should permit ~ clinic at\u00ad tendance per week instead of requiring two,for persons stabilized on methadone longer than one year (instead of two) in order to enhance the likelihood of their obtaining and holding jobs. Since even a methadone patient bent upon selling his drug will probably drink a full daily dose at least twice a week, to 'prevent withdrawal, the extra mid-week visit for the most re\u00ad liable group of patients seems superfluous. Rehabilitation workers have told the Commission that patients in metha~one programs who exhibit problems, such as di\u00ad version of drugs or polydrug and alcohol abuse, do so for three reasons. The first was lack of constructive activity, particularly lack of werk.

IiIII' _____ ------,------- ___ . ___ ._ \"\" -40 - There is strong evidence, particularly in terms of reduced crime, of the salutary nature of drug treatment. Moreover, although much opposition to it is framed in terms of criticism of profit- making programs, because some of the best programs in the state, such as several visited by the Commission staff, show a profit, leading experts in the methadone field, including the Directors of the largest public and voluntary programs, believe that op- position to private clinics is sim~ly opposition to methadone as a treatment modality. This opposition takes a grave toll among patients. Families, employers, and friends frequently coax, cajole.and threaten patients with loss of social acceptance if they remain on methadone. The patients, themselves, begin to feel as if they are second class citizens. This feeling is even reenforced by programs which have an explicit methadone-to-abstinence philoso- phy. The result of this pressure is that addicts leave treat- ment prematurely, or they become polydrug abusers, or they fail to enter treatment when it is available. These persons then create the very market for illicit methadone sought to be dis- couraged. Experts believe there is all the difference in the world between an explicit philosophy of methadone-to-abstinence, and an implicit but ultimate goal of abstinence. After one or two years, most methadone patients ask :[.or a reduction in medication. Some of them are able to be withdrawn successfully by a gradual regimen lasting, in some cases, as long as two years. Others, particularly long-term heroin addicts, feel uncomfortable if -41 - much of the methadone is withdrawn. One theory, espoused by Dr. Dole, is that patients who begin to feel uncomfortable dur\u00ad ing a gradual withdrawal from methadone may have to remain on the.drug for the rest of their lives, not because methadone is more addicting than heroin, but because their heavy and prolonged involvement with heroin resulted in an as yet undifferentiated biological imbalance. Wh t th a ever e reasons, some met~adone patients are resigned to life-long use of the medication, while others seek to be withdrawn, and are withdrawn successfully. either case, however, the pat;ent well t b'l' s a ~ ~zed on methadone In or successfully withdrawn will perform indistinguishably in social or employment situations from anyone else. Many rehabilitation workers believe that no patient on methadone should be the sub\u00ad ject of instigation by others to discontinue his medication. \"When he is ready for detoxification, he will let his counselor know\".* The third source. of difficulty in methadone rehabili- an emot~onal illnesses. tation derives from untreated ' ~ ~ ~ cause-an -e fect relation- We do not mean to suggest a s;mpl;st;c d f ship between emotional illness and drug abuse: The presence of concurrent, tangentially related symptoms in medicine is well known.

When these patients are examined, they are often found to be suffering from serious physical ailments, including organic deterio+ation attri\u00ad butable to alcoholism. In order to open free-standing clinics, a private physician must obtain an affiliation agreement with a hospital in the vicinity to provide back-up services. Dr. Arthur Zaks has alleged. that certain hospitals are willing to accede, pro forma, to such agreements, for consideration, with the expectation by both parties that physical and psychiatric care needed by methadone patients will be supplied spontaneously or on an ad hoc basis by public and voluntary agl'mcies. A phy- sician associated with a well-reputed private program confessed that he did not know the name of his own affiliated back-up hospital, and that he has been consistently unable to obtain needed physical and psy?hiatric care for patients from public or voluntary agencies. - The Commission recommends that the state Department of Health suspend all Medicaid reimbursements to any program, public or private, whose support services are blatantly non-exis- tent. Dealing with the emotional problems of addicts in treatment, who do not require care in a separate facility, raises the issue of professional versus experienced paraprofessional counselinq. This issue will be discussed at greater length in I ' , ) I , \\ ; ; ! ! ,I I \\ 1 I I i ! , ' II \\ ' , I: \\ \\ It (.( j' \\ II U -43 - our chapter entitled, \"Abstinence Programs: Prohibition Is Not Enough\". However, a few brief observations are in order in this context. When the heroin problem appeared to be reaching epi\u00ad demic proportions in this state, most professionals in the mental health field believed themselves unable to assist addicts, whose presenting problem, addiction, was not amenable to orthodox inter-\u00ad vention. The tendency of addicts to be totally engulfed by heroin: achieving euphoria, preventing withdrawal, hustling the price, and 'resisting treatment, led most concerned citizens, including health and mental health professionals, to view the problem as more suit\u00ad able for the criminal justice system than for the psychiatrist's office. Addicts simply did not look like typically emotionally disturbed clients. Thus, many psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers shied away from treating addicts. Others, who approached addicts in terms' of classical therapeutic modalities, had disastrous results. The people who seemed to relate best to addicts were other addicts who had somehow reformed themselves, or who had received the first experimental maintenance dosages of methadone l or who were p~rticipants in newly created rigidly disciplined therapeutic communities. Because of the unavailability of pro\u00ad fessionals in significant numbers, most initial treatment pro\u00ad cedures tended to screen out patients with histories of severe personality or emotional disorders. The first addicts admitted to treatment 'tended to be highly motivated, and were ' h own back-up and support services. to coordinate t e1r A metha- done patient might, for example, report to his counselor that to work had enabled him to afford psychotherapy; his ability or that his ability to function on methadone had eliminated nearly all of his preexisting anxieties and behavio!.'al indis- cretions, so t a ~ ~ h t no add4t40nal help was needed. f dd' t entered treatment, those As greater numbers 0 a 1C s 1 ass4gned to help theh, or to supervise others professiona s ~ counseling them, were further alienated by the extensive differ- and the addicts, in terms of their own 'ences between themselves t t'ons of patient amenability previous t1,ining, their own expec a 1 to treatment, ~ and the4r own subcultural predilections. \"It takes of t4me for a white, middle-class social worker to a great deal -L learn how to deal with the problems of a Black youngster who is in serious trouble, but who perceives his social worker as part of the cause of that trouble.

The second development was the entrance into treatment of greater numbers of addicts with accompanying emotional and personality problems, because of the advent of greater numbers of available treatment slots. These two developments have now made it possible to speak realistical- ly of a need for professional mental health services in the treat- ment of addiction, at the same time that it is now becoming pos- sible to meet that need. Initially, contact with addicts may still require the nonprofessional touch, particularly of a coun- selor in the same age group or ethnic category as the addict. If rapport is good, such counselors may continue to help their clients under close professional supervision. There are problems, however, which are of such complicated dimensions, involving dOh!estiC' relations, emotional symptoms and community resources, that the professionals should deal with these directly. We call upon the Drug Abuse Control Commission, therefore, to inquire of treatment programs throughout the state the feasibility of providing formal psychiatric, psychological and social work eval\u00ad uations and treatment of clients requesting such services, either through meaningful liaisons with community providers of such services or through the incorporation of such services into treatment programs, themselves. ! ,\" \u00b7_,...-. ~--------------~-~-~-----.-.\".- .. - -46 - LAW ENFORCEMENT The New York State Controlled substances Act provides for a methadone patient reporting requi:r:ement from the treatment programs to the state Department of Health, as one control against fraudulent admissions. By agreement between the state Depart\u00ad ment of Health and the Drug Abuse Control Commission, D.A.C.C. assumed full responsibility for treatment program compliance, 1 including the maintenance of a central registry of addicts. Data is provided by D.A.C.C. to the state Health Department, which has the primary responsibility of controlling against methadone diversion. The Controlled Substances Act also requires that metha\u00ad done programs report the quantities of medication received and dispensed. Initial compliance was slow, with ninety-eight pro\u00ad grams delinquent. By July of 1974 only twenty-three programs had fai~ed to report, and these were being closely watched. Only minor discrepancies have been noted between the quantities of drug received and those dispensed, although several robberies have occurred. The State Health Department reports the following dis- diplinary actions: (1) Elio Maggio, M.D. -upon investigation and refer\u00adrals indicted by federal grand jury for illegal sale of metha\u00ad done maintenance treatment pro\u00ad gram director ( -47 - (2) Robert Dale, M.D. -investigated and now fugitive from justice; former metha\u00ad done maintenance treatment program director (3) Rafiq Jan, M.D. -Investigated New Drug status removed by Food and Drug Admin\u00ad istration following major ir\u00ad regularities in methadone maintenance treatment program operation as a result of joint investigation by Food and Drug Administration and tne Depart\u00ad ment* (4) Evaldas Deckys, M.D. -medical director for a proposed methadone maintenance treatment program; arrested following Departmental investigation of illegal sale of narcotics .In addition a non-physician who aggressively promoted t~e estab~~shment of a methadone program was also investigated. H~s name ~s Robert Kottner, a real estate operator, about whom a B.C.I. report indicated a criminal history, involving grand larceny and related offenses and establishment was denied. During the past year and one-half, the Department ini\u00ad tiated action against the Alan Kaye, M.D., M.M.T.P., 1001 Fox ~treet, Bronx, New York, because of improper dispensing practices ~mproper labeling, and failure to maintain proper records. The ' charge was settled by a formal reprimand. . Action was also initiated against Eugene Silberman, M.D., M.M.T.P., 306 East 11th Street, New York New York because of ~lleged ~idden own.ership of the clinic, ~nd inadequate counsel- ~ng serv~ce. However, the charges were dropped and the sponsor was allo~ed to relocate on the formal condition that the program ~oul~ vol';lntarily cease operation if it was subsequently found ~n v~olat~qn.by the Department. The temporary narcotic license of Harold M.D., M.M.T.P., c/o Promethean Society 5 ~ane Street, Frankll.n Square, New York, was not extended because ~n consultation with D.A.C.C. we determined that the sponsor had not corrected numerous violations of state and federal rules on methadone. The Drug Abuse Control Commission is currently in the process ~f establishing f~ur investigation teams for the purpose of exact~ng program compl~ance. The Chairman of D.A.C.C. reports that at least two potentially unreliable programs have been dis\u00ad couraged from opening by pointed allusions to the new D.A.C.C. regulations. f.~ote: A new federal law permits the Drug Enforcement Administra\u00ad t~on to take direct action, without prior approval of \u00b0h t e F.D.A. -48 - The New York City police Department reports that felony arrests for methadone decreased from two hundred seventy\u00ad four between January and June of 1973 to one hundred nineteen betweon January and July of 1974. The total number of Narcotics Division felony arrests during the same 1974 period was one thousand seventy, so that methadone felony arrests reflect but one-tenth of all narcotic felony arrests. Cocaine and heroin arrests far outnumber those for methadone. J In other parts of the state, hearings in Buffalo, Syracuse, poughkeepsie and Nassau, as well as spot-checks in Rochester, Schenectady, Binghamton and Suffolk Counties revealed either extremely small or non-existent problems of methadone di\u00ad version. The numbers of arrests are statistically insignificant. Moreover, diligent inquiries by the Commission staff have failed to uncover more than two individuals recently admit\u00ad ted to treatment programs as primary methadone addicts, whose addiction eventuated from street sales. Although the extent of methadone diversion is con\u00ad troversial, the practical question remains of how to handle a patient suspected of selling his drug. Since the present penalty structure is currently under litigation, we reserve comment on the subject of appropriate penal sanctions and will present, here~ in, the reco~uendations made to the commission by br .. Alfred S. Howe, Director of the Suffolk County Drug 'l~reatment Services on the medical approach to a patient who may be di\u00ad verting his methadone. Telstifying at our hearing in Mineola, I 1 I l. \\ I , n i : I ! i' II ! l I I If II U V1 t'l t!'.1 ( ! , i l' -. 49 - Long Island, on September 5, 1974, Dr. Howe said that the first step would be to curtail or eliminate all take-home privileges. In the event that the patient continued to be uncooperative in treatment, other modalities should be considered. If the patient were not eligible for any o'ther treatment modality, and persisted in untrustworthy behavior, he should be detoxified and dropped from the program. RECOMMENDATIONS Methadone maintenance is an effective treatment modal\u00ad ity for the rehabilitation, resocialization and vocational ad\u00ad justment of hard-core heroin addicts. Unbiased multimodality providers of treatment report greater employability and less recidivism among methadone patients than among any other similar groups of rehabilitating addicts. The Commission makes the fol- lowing specific recommendations to improve the status of these patients: 1. In light of the controversy over methadone death statistics in New York City, the Commission recommends an ex- pansion of the authority of the state Health Department to in- vesti~.fate and monitor the operCltion of the Nev.l York City Medical Examiner's Office, particularly with regard to its development of statistical data. Such authority should also extend to other Medical Examiners! Offices throughout the state. 2. There is a need to promote employment among rehabili- addicts in methadone maintenance programs. The Commission II '/B\u00b7 1\",'-\" ,'. j' -50 - endorses the requirement of the Drug Abuse Control Conunission that one vocational counselor be retained for each one hundred fifty patients. We invite the attention of providers of treat\u00ad ment to the excellent work being carried on in thi~ field by the counselors and job placement workers at the Nassau County Drug and Alcohol Addiction Commission. We believe serious consider\u00ad ation should also be given to the study of such programs\u00b7 as that at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, w)ith a view toward utilizing open\u00ad ings in hospitals, themselves, as structured vocational training slots. 3. We find that the use of public funds to provide free methadone treatment to working patients who can afford to repay some of the cost of that treatment is counterproductive. (a) We call upon the Comptroller of the State to audit state outlays of funds, including Hedicaid reimbursements, for patients capable of assuming a portion\u00b7of the cost of their own care. (b) Without engaging in aggressive collection proce\u00ad dures, non-profit drug treatment programs should permit their working patients to contribute a flat-rate weekly fee, such as three dollars per fifty dollars of take-home pay. In this way, the State could reduce the annual cost of methadone maintenance by upwards of five million dollars. 4. Methadone programs should provide greater recrea\u00ad tional outlets fbr patients, to discourage indecorous confron- tations with neighbors of such programs. Community leaders should work along with methadone programs to overcome problems of ob- _________ ............ ____ '. ____ m __ ~ ~_ n -51 - jectionable conduct by patients. Each facility should maintain an Observation of the behavior of it\u00a3 clients in the neighorhood. 5. To enhance the employability of rehabilitating addicts, the present X~deral requirerrent that persons in treatrrent for longer than two years must report to a clinic at least twice a week should be changed to at least once a week after one year. 6. The Drug Abuse Control Commission should consider a rror:e specific regulation that :rrethadone clinics open early in the norning or during the evening to permit working patients to pick up . . their medication without calling attention on the job to their need to do so. 7. Complaints about the rigidity of the current mech\u00ad anism for granting exceptions to D.A.C.C. methadone regulations have led us to recommend the establishment of an advisory committee, comprised of providers of treatment, as well as D.A.C.C. officials, to advise as to measures to E:');::~pedite decisions in this regard. 8 The State Health Department should suspend all Medicaid payments to metha~one clinics, especially profit\u00ad making clinics, which are unable to provide actual meaningful back-up medical and psychiatric care. 9. The Drug Abuse Control Conunission should inquire of treatment programs throughout the state as to the feasibility of providing formal psychiatric~psychological and social work evaluations and treatment of clients requesting such services, either through meaningful liaisons with ~ommunity providers of such services, or through the incorporation of such services into treatment programs, themselves. ,. < -52 - CHAPTER II ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS: PROHIBITION IS NOT ENOUGH As we indicated in our report entitled, Drug Abuse Prevention (Legislative Document No. 11, 1974), prior to our national period of Prohibition, ?lcohol was not a proper sub\u00ad ject 01 humor. Its acceptance was surrounded by Victorian imprecations, sometimes motivated by class-consciousness, more often impelled by alcohol's exacerbation of problems but as- sociated with hazardous industrial conditions and unhealthy hous\u00ad ing. The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment by the Twenty-first Amendment in December of 1933, only ten months after the repeal- er's initial proposal, signaled a new, more realistic, but perhaps more indulgent, attitude towards alcohol in the united States. t later came the founding of an organization Less than wo years known as Alcoholics Anonymous. Twenty-three years after the founding of A.A., one of its members led the organization of the first therapeutic com- munity for drug addicts (synanon). Although certain differences I .\\ 1 t I ~ ~I IJ I! 1 1 f. to the A.A. approach were built into the t.c. program, the dynamics I l of A.A . which had never been satisfactorily explained, were thought 1 to provide a certain potential for treating drug addiction. That k for some alcoholics was knmm. A.A. wor s That A.A. wo~ks sub- sequent to the failure of mental health professionals to reform 1 ! l -53 - certain alcoholics was also known. Since rrost mental health profes- sionals then regarded addicts as \"incurable\", the timeliness of an experimental approach using reformed addicts to help rehabil- itating addicts, on the basis of an experience of using recovered alcoholics to lend in the recovery of drinking alcoholics was clearly established. Need overwhelmed niggling doubts regarding t whether the underlying concept of A.A., never made explicit, was transferable to drug addicts. Although no individual or policy group speaks for A.A., they do have a certain informal leader~hip. That leadership is comprised of persons whose views on alcoholism could, conceivably, be precisely the opposite of the very dynamic that explains the success of A.A. Those views tend to side with the thesis that alcoholism is not caused by mental illness or prolonged drinking, but rather, i~ a disease that strikes at only a certain percent- , age of the drinking population. Having identified themselves as afflicted with the disease, they simply strive to make alcohol as irrelevant to their social diet as a person with an allergy to feathers would strive to make swansdown irrelevant to his sleep. The most successful members of A.A. tend to give the impression'that their avoidance of alcohol has become casual, even cavalier. It is possible, however, that the success of A.A. is based upon zeroing in on the very liquor that destroys them. By focusing all of their guilt upon alcohol, since 1933 a drug pre\u00ad sented almost always as a source of pl\u00b7easure, they can provide -54 - themselves with a source of permanent expiation through self\u00ad denial: not the self-denial borne of one clear decision made at a single A.A. meeting, but the self-denial borne of myriad oppor\u00ad tunities and temptations. Perhaps that is why repeated reenforce\u00ad ment through attendance at meetings is considered so important to continued abstinence. For the drug addict, the label of sociopathy, or at j , least functional sociopathy, has been so often applied, we forget that even sociopaths may feel ~ guilt. Since heroin is not bnly a source of pleasure, but by its illegality and inherent dangers, and its romance with the needle, more frequently a souroe of punishment, abstinence, in and of itself, m.ay not be enough to deal with guilt. Because of the availability of alcohol, an al\u00ad coholic can remain oblivious to external stimuli for weeks, some\u00ad times months. A heroin addict can remain oblivious to external stimuli only until his source of the drug is interrupted. Return to drug abuse, then, is not only an indulgence in deviance and pleasure; it suggests a painful motif for the person with little or no self-esteem. Many guilty alcoholics can achieve their psy\u00ad chic pain through abstinence; the guilty heroin addict can achieve his pain either through abstinence or drug addiction. Since he can also achieve a certain amount of pleasure through drug use, to retain him in a drug-free program, a high degree of moti.vation is necessary f. derived from wi\u00b7thin himself or imposed from without .. by law enforcement and correctional agencies. n \\1 \\ ! ~ .-55 - The Synanon experiment established four basic princi- ples: 1. Self~help. Only an addict can understand and cure an addict. 2. Drug-free. Chemicals are not helpful in the rehab\u00ad ilitation process. 3. Honesty. Only with the brutally honest expression of feelings about each other are members of the community able to abandon their self-defeating and self-destructive images. 4. Utopia. The general community is sick. A micro\u00ad cosm of a putative healthy community is to be the goal. Patients may choose never to return to the general community, but people at large may seek to transform society as a whole into a macro\u00ad cosm of the therapeutic community. To cope with the pleasure-pain attraction of heroin, , therapeutic communities adopted rigid organizational structures marked by authoritarian hierarchies. The object was to treat the addict as immature and in need of developing good judgment, with regard to personal habits and, especially, in attitudes towards authority. As good judgment developed, status and privileges would be increased, until the patient assumed control over an area of t.c. life and thus beca~me part of the governing hierarchy. Until such point, the resident had no personal responsibility for decisionmaking without direct and immediate guidance and con\u00ad trol. As in an authoritarian state, there could be no personal guilt because there was. no personal latitude. -------------------- ----56 - Although the rate of premature terminations was always high (at least fifty percent within the first three weeks of treatment) and alt.hough the rate of \"graduation\" was always low d fourteen Percent), it was not until the late (between two an 1970's that ev4dence began to mount indicating 1960's and early ... therapeutic communities were in deep trouble.

Others, like Odyssey House, tended to develop along lines of treating drug addiction as a symptom of underly\u00ad ing emotional disorders. The Alpha School and Exodus House stres\u00ad sed educational and vocational training. The NARCO programs, among others, followed short term, local adaptational models. Using the Systems Sciences report as a starting point, ~he New York City Addiction Services Agency began evaluating all drug-free communities in New York City. Of those t.c.'s men\u00ad tioned in the System Sciences Report, Compass, Day top, Exodus, Inward House, Quaker Committee, Queens General Hospital and Sama\u00ad ritan Halfway Society were found to be valid, useful programs. Other abstinence programs praised by ASA included Boy's Harbor, E.S.P.A.D.A., Mount Sinai Hospital, Reality House If Greenwich House, The Door, Project Return, V.E.R.I.T.A.S. I, Seaport Pioneer Program, Riverdale Mental Health Clinic, Downstate Medical Center, Dynamite Youth Center, Midwood Adolescent Project, Canarsie Youth Center, and Samuel Field YMWHA. One of the excuses given by abstinence programs which have closed recently and those currently under investigation for failure to contribute to solving the drug problem has been the changing nature of the drug problem. Abstinence techniques, such as confrontation and gradual improvement in status, are said to have worked with true heroin addicts, but are not successful with , , '~1 ;',lJ, ' ~ff ~ff ' ~, ,'~ . -58 - today's polydrug abuser. A serious question exists however, as ,to whether the original drug-free concept ever really succeeded. It was pointed out that these programs, derived their impetus from Alco\u00ad holics Anonymous. Although A .. A. has been in existence for nearly forty years, and despite the increasing number of alcoholics in the United States (between nine cmd fifteen million), A.A. has only two hundred fifty thousan,d members nationally. Abstinence J . programs for drugs always recognized that they could help only a small percentage of the addict population, but statistics even 'among those who remained in treatment were never very promising. At its optimal level of operation, Phoenix House reported that over twelve percent of its residents were hea.vy alcohol abusers while in treatment (Phoenix House, Who Comes F9r Treatmen!, Decem\u00ad ber, 1972). The therapeutic communities steadfastly protest that their residents are all free of drug use while in the program. Most have equally steadfastly refused to require the, same periodic urinalysis mandated by federal and state law for methadone pro\u00ad grams. D.A.C.C. multimodality programs which require urinalysis report a greater incidence of drug abuse in their own \"drug-free\" programs than in methadone programs. Has this not always been the case? Except for the few addicts who were able to use their own abstinence in the same way recovered alcoholics do, and except for those addicts who found a refuge from the real world within the authoritarian structure of their p~ogram, and who have remained in the drtl,gfield ever since their graduation, success was always I \\ I -59 - ephemeral. Methadone programs teem with abstinence program drop\u00ad outs. Prisons and jails have been filled with those who absconded after a few weeks from drug-free programs. Aside from the con\u00ad ceptual non-transferability of the self-imposed prohibition of A.A., two other major defects may be responsible for pinpointing both the success of the few abstinence programs commended by ASA and by this Commission, as well as the failure of the rest. ' Some of the observations made by the Commission staff upon a recent visit to the Hart Island facility of Phoenix House may indicate what one of the problems of the typical abstinence approach may be. Despite the relaxation of some of the more gro\u00ad tesque house rules (residents in poor standing are no longer re\u00ad quired to shave their heads or wear placards reciting errors in conduct), the totalitarian* structure of the program is both philo\u00ad sophically and practically unrelated to the structure of society. Moreover, there appears to be a strong prejudice against blue col\u00ad lar work. This prejudice is reenforced by exaggerated expecta\u00ad tions of success to be derived from the achievement of a high school equivalency certificate, as well as by the use of menial tasks as a system of punishment and reward. Work in the community \". is discouraged until the individual is \"ready\". The theory is that the resident is going through \"changes\". This means that his character is being restructured. Should he accept work that is unsuitable or be rejected for the job of his choice, he might iThe word \"totalitarian\" is freely used in this context by staffs of th8rapeutic communities, including Phoenix House. .,'1 -60 - relapse. This approach is in marked contrast to other modalities which stress interaction with the community through gainful em- ployment and community-based training programs. If the treatment staff and unbiased observers do not view the operation of the as a design for community reentry, then a reasonable in\u00ad program ference must be that the resident who dropped out could not under\u00ad stand the relevance of what was happening to him, either. Perhaps there was none. (By way of contrast~ the Herculean efforts of Day top Village to reconcile its therapeutic community model with the need to prepare residents adequately for reentry is well known. Also well known is the extremely limited number of persons who can benefit from the rigors of a Day top type of program.) The most often-heard phrase in the context of success- fully treating addicts is \"the need to raise self-esteem\". The second most often-heard phrase is \"non-threatening atmosphere\". Therapeutic communities, daycare programs and ambulatory treat\u00ad 'ment programs which originated along the clas.sic Synanon model encouraged the \"brutal honesty\" of confrontation through group encounters. These encounters were designed to obstruct evasions and circumlocutions regarding personal conduct by confronting the patient with the underlying truth as inferred by more ad\u00ad vanced patients. Since one patient's underlying truth is another patient's evasion, the dynamic was thought to work both ways: to cut through all rationalizations, and to bring each individual, as well as the'group, as a whole, to confrontation with certain basic truths about human nature, or at least, about common I I -' -61 - experiences. The trouble with confrontation is that it works only under two exceedingly rare conditions: The client must view himself rather than the program, as a source of danger, and he must have the basic verbal and abstracting skills to come to terms with the group and with himself. Otherwise, he (or she) will view the process as threatening, and his (or her) inade- quacy to relate to the process will result in a diminution, rather than a heightening of self-esteem. Moreover, the exis- 'tence of any severe psychogenic or organic syndrome will serve to undercut the process via the well-known dynamics of mental illness. The first attempt to venture beyond confrontation was conceptualized in terms of drug addiction as a psychiatric dis- order or as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder. The remedy,as in the Odyssey House program, was to reinvent milieu therapy as an exponent of the Synanon model, and to reenforce environmental adjustment with individual and group psychotherapy. The flaw in this concept was that the only persons suitable for such treat- ment, assuming drug addiction is not simplistically related to Psychogenic factors, would be persons whose primary diagnosis was not drug addiction at all, but mental illness,overlaid with drug abuse. In other words, the Odyssey House approach may have been unintentionally designed for those mentally ill persons who medi\u00ad cated themselves with illicit drugs, rather than for the majority of heroin addicts, whose emotional problems are related to drug 1 ',. 0 , : I h f _' I , ! \u00b7i I I. ( i '~ ! -62 - abuse, but not the primary causative factors. Complicating the Odyssey House picture have beEm repeated charges that even those psychiatric services promised to the few addicts and drug abusers who might benefit from them halve not been fully delivered. The Odyssey House experiment did, at leaElt I point the way to the need for professional services beyond confrontation, whether or not such services have actually been furnished. Historically, therapeutic communities and other types of abstinEmce programs did not proviD.e professional services. During the 19701 S I the sheer humanitarian assessment of the needs of clients, t.he competition from methad.one programs, as well as t.he increasing incidence of non-narcotic polydrug abuse, led to growing incorporation in, or provision of, educational, voca'cional and mental health services by abstinence programs. These i:actors also led to the develop\u00ad ment of multimodality programs w'hich, despite a drug-free bias, began to offer chemotherapy to selected clients. Although the movement toward integration of services and integration of professional and paraprofessional staffing patterns is well underway, tensicms still appear to exist between professionals and paraprofessionslls. These tensions mirror simi- lar antagonisms among traditional mental health providers of service and revolve about the depth of personal involvement ap\u00ad propriate to achieve the rehabiLitative end sought. Without re\u00ad hearsing the full controversy in these pages, the most successful drug programs report that their success is contingent upon the willingness of staff, professional or otherwise, to work long hours \\ . ! 1 1 I -63 - to help clients unravel the many elaborations of their problems, and to build, as far as they can, on the groundwork of recovery, without arbitrary limits or unrealistic goals. It is indicated that traditional mental health and education professionals in the drug field have the general reputation of unwillingness to go beyond rather narrow contacts with clients. That is why it is difficul t to integrate professionals with paraprofessionals. The exceptions I as always, are dazzling.

Second, vocational training for young people appears to be minimal or non-existent. (The same problem exists in other Buffalo programs). Third, there appear to be no supervised group homes for young people who are in con\u00ad flict with their families, but who are not truly ready to be con- sidered emancipated. Fourth, in a heavily populated fifteen-block area, there is only one Boy's Club, which provides neither adequate facili- ties nor hospitality to engage the young people in the area. It was noted by the Commission staff that a need appeared to exist for teen drop-in centers to be established similar to the centers in Onondaga County. The client population appears to be hostile and rebellious, and yet individuals witL problems in the neigh\u00ad borhood are willing to seek counseling ,'>:eatment and advice. The lack of recreational facilities geared to such a client popu- lation would seem to be a notable omission. Since most clients are ort welfare, unemployed or youngsters who live at home and who may not be actively occupied with educational studies, the recrea- tional need and the need for vocational training would seem to be profound. The availability of vocational training, recreational facilities and drop-in or other types of counseling programs to lure \"at risk\" youngsters into constructive patterns of adapta- tion is generally regarded as necessary, but, in addition! the cry of \"outreach\" is being incx:easingly heard in the land. ~~----------------'-------------.-----------\" -68 - cal view Our 1974 report on prevention presented a highly skepti\u00ad of attempts to deter drug a,nd alcohol abuse through di- dactic instruction, values clarification and media campaigns. we felt the Presentation of information was vital area in which concerned the existence of available services to children and One families II at riskll To mean anything, such informa.tion must in- d' by the potential client of his own dys\u00advolve some under stan lng functional behavior, and the furth~r understanding of which-ser- vices might prove beneficial in the repair of his dysfunctions. -For the troubled youngster with a medical problem, or anxiety he discerns as unusual, or a specific learning problem he, himself, ,. t t tm nt may follow as a logical can recognize, the amenablllty 0 -rea e ~ consequence, assuming the availability of programs, such as The Door.

Outreach is necessary when the client is not otherwise available. As one witness from Westchester County testified at our hearing in Poughkeepsie, October 2, 1974: I spent six years on the streets doing outreach work in Cleveland and in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn where tit was essential that whatever treatment took place, took place on street corners, and in families' houses, and sometimes in bars, and sub\u00ad ways; and contrary to classical treatment theory, success did not depend upon motivation for treatment ... Success really is largely contingent upon my ability to demonstrate the need for help, and in order to demonstrate the need for help, I have to be in the environment where those needing the help are congregating or as\u00adsociating with each other. Underscoring the need for adequate medical and neurolo- gical examinations even regarding pat~ents with a non-narcotic history of drug abuse was the testimony of the Director of the Drug Detoxification, Aftercare and Methadone Maintenance Program at St. Mary's Hospital in Syracu\u00a3e. Medical evaluation is of primary importance for two reasons, he said. The variety of drugs cur\u00ad rently in use in Syracuse requires meticulous differentiation for detoxification and medical treatment. The drugs currently in use are: Heroin, tranquilizers. Dif- ferential medical and neurological diagnoses and treatment are also vital with regard to residual brain syndromes associated with prolonged use of ~-narcotic drugs, glue and aerosols. --------~ ..... ------.---~. j -70 - A number of witnesses discussed problems ,encountered in the treatment of youthful alcohol abusers, which result from separate funding of drug treatment and alcoholism services, pos\u00ad sibly preventing reimbursement with drug treatment monies for the care of young alcoholics who seek available counseling from drug treatment programs. This question will be dealt with in detail in our chapter entitled, \"The Drug Abuse Control commis- sion ~-A Reappraisal\". RECOMMENDATIONS We find that the cult of abstinence, which helps a significant number of alcoholics in A.A. to encapsulate their drinking problems, has not been successfully transferred, in most cases, to the problem of heroin addiction and other forms of drug abuse. Because of the A.A. model, the concept of ab\u00ad stinence from drugs as a goal, has been confused with the con\u00ad cept of abstinence from drugs as a therapeutic modality. It is this confusion which has led to the disutility of many therapeu- tic communities and ether drug-fre'e programs. Since a reasonable treatment alternative must continue to exist for heroin addicts who either do not wish to enter meth\u00ad adone maintenance programs, or who may not be suitable for such programs I and, since treatmel1,t must be available for ~-narcotic drug abusers, we believe that, with the exceptions previously n I ! [ t t I 1 ! f 1 , I II I I 1 t I ! I ! t ! j l I i \\ 1 II i ! I i l I I I -71 - noted, most drug-free programs would be well-advised to develop along one of the following two lines: (1) Narrow the horizon and offer a very specific service, such as individual counseling or office-work vocational training; or (2) broaden the base to ap\u00ad proximate a full, comprehensive mental health facility, including all or most of the medical, social, legal, psychological and vo\u00ad cational support services now available in the better programs. This approach is particularly desirable if drug-free programs plan to continue admitting children and non-drug abusing persons, as they have been doing.* We make this recommendation mindful that while we know what will ~ work, until we knew what will work, the concretiza\u00ad tion of purpose of the more limited drug programs, and the concreti\u00ad zation of goals of rehabilitating drug abusers in more broadly based'programs, would appear to represent sound social policy. In either case, the resociali~atLen and reentry of the client into the general community should serve. as the only abstract foun\u00ad dation. for treatment. In our, chapter on D.A.C.C. we plan to pur\u00ad sue the question of evaluation and how the state can go about determining which drug-free programs \"work\", in terms of reliable reentry and recidivism statistics. Until such evaluations are performed, however I it will be neces~,ary to confine our recommen\u00ad dations to a refinement of treatment protocols and the continued meaSurement of compliance. 1 * I?hoen ix\" House reports twenty-nine residents under sixteen years ! of age (one of whom is eight years old) and fifty~three ,residents I who have never used drugs. -------------------------------- .. ~ ...................... ~ \" ,\\'0 ,;, 'I Y\u00b7. -72 - Our specific recommendations for additional D.A.C.C. regulations are as follows: 1. Smaller programs should be required to. concretize their services in as explicit a fashion as possible, and, conse- quent1y, their admissions criteria, as well. 2. Larger programs, particularly those which admit per\u00ad sons not abusing drugs or persons ~n1y minimally involved with drugs, should be required to offer a full rang~ of services, as described herein. 3. All programs should be required to demonstrate the immediate accessibility of medical and psychiatric evaluation and back-up services. 4. Periodic urinalysis and reporting of results of urin\u00ad alysis to D.A.C.C. should be required of all patients who maintain significant contacts with drug-free programs. Since certain tran\u00ad quilizers and alcohol may not be detectable in urine samples, pro\u00ad grams should be required to demonstrate their capacity to identify individuals abusing such substances. I 5. Professional and paraprofessional staff integration should be explicitly detailed, and heightened emphasis placed upon professional capacity to facilitate patient reentry into the general population. Beyond these recommendations for additions to D.A.C.C. regulations, \"we further recommend the inclusion of outreach and recreational components in all drug programs. -73 - CHt1.PTER III ALCOHOLISM --EMPHASIS WITHOUT STRESS A mental health worker recently surveyed the damage attributable to alcohol in the United States each year and sigh- ed, \"You know, if alcohol were sought to be introduced to the people of this country today, for the first time, as a drug, the Food and Drug Administration might consider . 1t too ~oxic to mar-ket\".* According to those with responsibilities for treating a1coho1- related problems, the overconsumption of alcohol rates as the country's third largest public health problem, after heart disease and can- cer. Thirteen thousand people die each year from cirrhosis of the liver; and medical research has uncovered relationships be- tween alcOholism and heart disease, as well as general central nervous system and brain damage. Persons who dt'ink to excess tend to live ten to twelve years less than the non-drinking population. One half of all of the murders in the United States involve drink, either on the part of the killer, or victim, or both; and one fourth of all of the suicides in the United States iAnalysis of the scope of the alcohol problem provided Coordinator of Alcohol Programs of Dutchess County. by the -74 - are found to have alcohol in their blood streams. There are fifty-eight percent more suicides in the drinking population than in the abstinent population. One half of each year's fifty-five thousand traffic deaths, and about one half of the million major injuries suffered in automobile accidents can be traced directly to the consumption of alcohol, on the parts\\ of both <j1Fivers and pedestrians. A recent Department of Health, Education, and Welfare study found that alcohol~\u00b7related problems cost the nation nearly b~.nty\u00ad five billion dollars each year. In New York City, sixty percent of the one million forty-,eight thousand young people beJ.:.ween the ages of twelve and eighteE.m use alcohol, and approxima.tely thirty\u00ad six thousand of these exhibit problems related to such use.* To demonstrate that while the problem seems most virulent in large cities, other areas of the state also have need for concern, the Commission was informed that Dutchess County has an estimated eleven thousand alcoholics i that in 1973 there .. .,ere over three thousand accidents, of various types, attributable to alcoholism; twenty-eight drunk driving fatalities; and in 1972, the City of poughkeepsie, alone, counted five hundred arrests for Driving While Intoxicated and four hundred arrests for public intoxication. Twenty percent ,of the admissions to the Dutchess County Unit of the Hudson River State Hospital are alcohol related. *An Addiction~Services Agency survey in the fall of 1974 found that of 1,142 pupils interv.iewed in the ninth to twalftl1 grades, nearly eighty percent said they had at least one drink recently, and twenty-six percent were regular drinkers. 'M 75 - , . WHAT IS ALCOHOLISM? In attempting to cre~te a climate of enlightened public opinion, mental .health workers have for years been plagued by the colloquial usage of terms describing gross behavioral or emotional disturbances as epithets. At tl.' th d mes, e wor s are so btinding to the intellect that they must be removed entirely from the lexi\u00ad con, as New York State removed the word insanity from its Mental Hygiene J~aw, to promote more humane treatment of the mentally ill. The problem is further compoundeo in the Platonic sense by the fact that because a term has come into existence, there will be those ~.qho insist that there must be a valid idea which that term repref.lents. Prior to the identification of the germ theory of dise~se, scientists were persuaded, no less than the general pub\u00ad lic, that the cause of disea~e was \"bad air\". The existence of the concept of bad air was, in and of itself, an intellectual obstacle to the refinement of the theory of communicable difl~ase. Alcoholism, like \"bad air\" is an imprecise and unsci- entific term. Like insanity, it is also a term heavily prejudiced by usage as an epithet. In a memorable aside, the late Joe E. Lewis once responded to a demand that he explain the difference between an \"alcoholic\" and a IIdrunkll S 'd L . \\I h al. eW1S, T ey're the same; only a drunk doesn't have to go to all those . meetings\". In recent years, scientists have moved away from at\u00ad tempting a definition of alcoholism and toward descriptions of the role that alcohol plays in the chemistry, the biology and 0' \" ';;:;'~ ! \" 'i' , \\.1;.,. \",'~'\"r -----~--------~--:,;> -76 - the behavior of the human organism. At the same time, extremely well-motivated and often articulate and well-informed humani\u00ad tarians have bee; attempting to persuade the public that there is indeed such a thing as alcoholism, and that it i~ a \"disease\". Those who have been through the experience of dealing with un\u00ad refined definitions and diagnoses of mental illness, as a \"dis\u00ad ease\", recognize that the categorization of a group of human I disorders as a \"disease\" does not necessarily accrue to J:.he bene- fit of the people afflicted. As in the case of drug addiction, the response to the term \"illness\" is often the creation of social policies requiring \"quarantinell and \"cure\", which may be both self-de~eating and futile. There are three classic theories of alcoholism. One is that the existence of neurotic or personality disorders, such as an obsessive-compulsive neurosis, leads \"\\:0 the uncontrollable. use of alcohol. The addiction theory is that heavy o.rinking, over a period of time, leads to cumulative tolerances, behavioral dis\u00ad turbances, and organic damage. A third vie~~oint is that any drinker who has an as yet undifferentiated piological or biochem\u00ad ical imbalance will turn into an uncontrollable drinker. Less sophisticated theories tend to suggest that the products of heavy drinking are a combination of organic and social retribution for, at least initially, controllable self-indulgence. What we know, in the simplest terms, is that because alcohol has a sedative effect, and becausE! it tends to release inhibitions, it is a very attractive subs1:.ance to many. BecaUse -77 - it is a socially accepted mood-altering drug, its use is wide\u00ad sr::read. Alcohol use may produce consequences of unwan't.ed human behavior. Such behavior can occur a~ a transient, situational difficulty, or it can occur on a continuing bases, resulting in social, familial or occupational dysfunctions. Prolonged exces- sive alcohol use invariably t' . e erJ.oratJ.on, prin- . cipally in the two vital organs which do not have regenerative powers, the liver and the brain. The proper role of government, we believe, is not to .further incapaci~te afflicted individuals with opprobrious and ,~\"\"\". c~ntroversial terminology or categorizations. The proper role of government is threefold: 1. To attempt to help individuals reduce their own alcohol-related behavior, which results in significant interrup-1 , ...... tions of the peace and order of society, such as drunk driving and assaults. 2. To help individuals find adequate care for the health problems associated with heavy drinking. 3. To help researchers in their attempts to understand why some people drink to the point of causing problems one and two, and what proper means may be used to forestall or diminish these consequences. We believe that as long as there is serious controversy, it is counterproductJ.\u00b7ve to assert a single concept or definition of alcoholism and thereby shift the emphasis of government towards a process, one step 'removed from namecalling, of trying to identify ~ '1 ,: '~ -78 - just who is and who is not an alcoholic. We believe that govern\u00ad ment should concentrate on dealing with the dysfunctions associ\u00ad ated with alcohol use, in terms of remedying those dysfunctions, even as it encourages researchers to further refine their study of the relationship among alcohol, physiology, psychology and be- havior. J ' TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES ., .... -.... With the removal of public intoxication from the Penal Law, the Department of Mental Hygiene has announced the intention to establish \"sobering-up stations\" to which individuals currently intoxicated by alcohol can either bring themselves or be brought ~ \",4.,tII!,/ ~ ~ \u00ab .. ~ ... a.~\" -.;\" 4: by the police on a voluntafy basis. The National Council on Al- coholism refers to such stations as \"sleep-off centersllf which is a less judgmental as well as a more hospitable term. The model of the sobering-up station to be replicated throughout the State is the one located at the Rescue Mission in Syracuse, New York. It has a capacity of fourteen beds and is operated on the basis of a contract between the Department of Mental Hygiene and the Onondaga County Department of Mental Health. It is staffed by paramedics and part-time medical students attending the Upstate Medical Center. No drugs are administered at this unit. Clients who seek admissiortto the sobering;r-up station are self-referrals, may be brought in by ,the police or are\", picked up by the alcohol outreach workers operating a patrol van. The ,; admission procedure is voluntary. Instead of being arrested and I\" . '. -. -79 - jailed, the people are brought t o the sobering-up station, put to bed and carefully observed. An individual too ill to be handled in the sobering-up station is referred to the emergenc f y room 0 a hospital and then can be admitted from that po;nt .... to the detoxi-fication serv' 'f h ~ this highly skilled medical ser- vice. Rochester; Svracuse and New Special outreach services exist in York City (Manhattan Bowery Project). -, Other communities make use of a variety of methods in bringing the alcoholic to an appropriate service. Th' , ~s requ~res an organized information ser- vice to police agencies and orientation as to how best to utilize sobering-up stations and how to elicit cooperat;on from debilitated men/as Opposed to previous arresting methods. Proper approach by the police is necessary because sobering-up stations must be a totaliy voluntary service; otherwise, referral on to other levels be met with'resistance by th d b' , of treatment will e e ~l~tated person. Communities may wish to encourage h suc voluntary agencies as missions and the Salvation Army, where lar e b g nurn ers of alcoholic persons congregate and receive care to modify th ' , e~r programs to include outreach and sobering-up services. The new services could in conjunction with the traditional services pro\u00ad vided by these agencies. be carried out Special problems ex' t . ~s ~n rural and small urban centers. It is questionable whether a sobering-up station as described a- bove would be feasible in s~ch areas. However, some medical screen\u00ad is essential to asc~rtain the medical co.ndition ing of the, .individ-ual and whether or not f t' h ' ur er medical treatment (detoxification or If ~, . _,t::- : :t I) -80 - withdrawal) is required. Special arrangements will have to be made with various hospitals in rural areas to provide the needed services that could be shared by a number of localities. Imple\u00ad mentation of such programs on a regional basis is looked upon . as the solution to the delivery problem in less populated areas. The basic caution to the Department, expressed by treat- ment experts, has been that many persons who are public intoxi-I' cants may have ~~ alcohol and non-alcohol related medical problems. Indeed, the initial question would be whether a person ~ .:,;, ... t. who appears intoxicated may actually be. ill, *H{\" qui te another sense. While a close working liaison is supposed to exist between a sobering-up station, which may have only a nurse, a few recover\u00ad ed alcoholics and a social worker on hand, and' a general hospital, a detoxification unit, or other well-equipped medical facility, the viability of such liaison could, if not carefully enforced, turn out to be more speculative than real. We join others in cautioning that sobering-up stations not be used as substitute providers of non-\u00b7healt.h care, but rather be used to sec:U:re health care for those inebriates who may need usch attention but have difficulty obtaining it. Detoxification services threat the acute medical problems of alcoholism. They are well staffed with medical and nursing personnel and .are not the appropriate service for most of the people who are simply intoxicated. The detoxification service is ,,: -81 - usually located in or is closely associated with pital in order that third-party medical payments a general hos- can be obtained to defray the cost of the program.* These detoxification units serve thE;. '''total popUlation in the community, not just the person arrested for public intoxication. The Bowery detoxification service is located ,in the men's shelter and has backup services of st. Vincent's Hospital. The detoxification unit in Syracuse is part of the Crouse-Irving Memorial HOEli?\"'.iftal. The Albany de\u00ad toxification unit is at st. Peter's Hospi~al. Again, major metropolitan areas need this specialized concentrated service. There are existing separate detoxification units in Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and New York City. None has less than 14 beds and all operate seven days a week around the clock. In Rochester, the 15 bed detoxification unit is not located in a general hospl.' tal nd' t ff d . a l.S s a e prl.marily by nurses with doctors visiting for two hours a day_ This cuts costs of per day care to approximately $50, which is roughly one-half the cost of general hospital beds in this community. The Rochester unit i.s located one-half mile from a general hospital that serves as a backup for seriously medically ill individuals or those whose withdrawal becomes complicated by d.t. 's, severe seizures or non\u00ad response to medication. This backup has only been utilized a dozen n rura areas, agreements will have times in a year's operatl.'on.

The: services will 'likely be modest in *Depa,rtment of Mental Hygiene Planning Guidelines, 1973-74. }/ j . \\:-, J , \" . ' -82 - size with the number of beds depending upon population to be served. Since the dehilitated individuals are generally home\u00ad less, jobless and without resources and family and in poor health, they must be referred where these basic needs can be provided fol\u00ad lowing detoxification. We have found that there are major metro\u00ad politan areas that presently have such existing resources. These J' services differ from community to community in, size and range of services. Also, some communities need to coordinate existing ser- vices for better utilization . Basically, a residential rehabilitation program needs to have patients in residence on a voluntary basis from one to two months as in the Monr'oe County Continued Care Program. Pro\u00ad viders of this service have experienced qeneral willingness on the part of the debilitated man to stay engaged for this period of time on a voluntary basis. Monroe County uses antabuse as a , mandatory drug for patients in the rehabilitation program.* The state hospit.al alcoholism rehabilitation units are another example of this type of program in which the goal is to quickly restore physical health and ini,tiate change in life style of the individual by maximizing his ego strengths and helping him to re-enter society as a productive member. These agencies need to be an advocate for the debilitated individual in utilizing after- care services. (To the eight existing facilities, eleven more ~ will be added as a result of legislation enacted in 1974.) *compare comments,-infra, of Dr. Abrahams, who opposes this techni\u00ad que. -83 - The halfway house is a transitional facility which can be used by the alcoholic following his return to the community from an inpatient treatment resource. During his residence at the halfway house, the alcoholic is provided with meals and lodging, is helped to make use of community resources for alcoholism treat\u00ad ment, employment and vocational needs. The halfway house, being t a buffer between inpatient treatment and independent living in the community, is a major resource i11 assisting the alcoholic to\u00ad wards fully independent living. Without the services of the half\u00ad way house, many alcoholics experience great diff~culty in success\u00ad fully utilizing the benefits achieved during an inpatient stay and would be more likely to fail if suddenly placed in the community without the assistance of this type of program. While in the halfway house, efforts should be made to assist the alcoholic to obtai~ the services of the many social agencies which are geared to serve hint, such as employment services, vocational services and financial assistance from the county de\u00ad partment of social services. The Department of !.1,ental Hygiene has suggested the utilization of congregate living facilities or hostels for the alcoholic who, because of his debilitation, would not be expected to achieve fully independent functioning. Financial assistance from the local county social service department could, reportecUy f be utilized in both the hostel and halfway house programs so as to help defray operational costs. '0 'J' -84 - The aftercare needs for patients center around their re-entry into the community and include the need for certain services provided by Social Services, Office of Vocational Re- habilitation and the New York State Employment Service. The After\u00ad care needs provided by these agencies could assist the individual in his first attempts at living independently after a treatment or rehabilitation experience. Funds for living expenses, medical and alcoholism services can be providkd through the local county social services department. The Office of Vocational Rehabilitation and the New York State Employment Service should assist the alcoholic in\"seeking emploYment and upgrading his work skills. These services are components of a comprehensive ser- vice which may have to be phased in, as it may not be possible for a given community to provide all at once. In order to help insure that these services are available, they should be incorporated as part of any proposal for the alcoholic. This will not only insure coordination of services but may well be the only means by which funds could be obtained to make the services of specialized voca- tional and employment counseling available.

A CASE STUDY A case study of a treatment center, its problems and its progress has been provided by the Commission staff: M~mbers of the Commission staff visited \u00b7the Bedford- stuyvesant Treatment Center on october 7, 1974. The visit in\u00ad cluded a brief tour of the premises and a long question and answer -85 - session with the clinical director, Dr. Andrew H. Abrahams, who is an internist. The visit lasted two and a half hours. The Bedford Stuyvesant Treatment Center was estab- lished two years ago in a rather aging community-center type building. On November 1, 1974 a complete renovation of the pre\u00ad mises was scheduled to begin,. utilizing a grant of $335,000 from the Model Cities Program. The Center began with an 8-year de\u00ad creasing fund grant from NIAAA of $551,000, decreasing 10% each year. The grant is matched by a Health and Hospital Corp. grant which increases each year as the federal grant decreases. There is an increasing grant from the State Division of Alcoholism of $85,000 and a steady grant of $140,000 from the New York City Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardatiori services. This comprises an annual total budget of $1.4 million. The initial administrative problems of the program were that its design was functionally related to Downstate Medical Center and only nominally redrafted at the request of the Federal government for a free-standing treatment program. Ac\u00ad cording to Dr. Abrahams, they are much closer now to the goal of a free-standing treatment program, both in actuality as well as in design, than they were two years ago. The federal grant mandates certain basic services: 1. Outpatient care, including medical, psychological and social work 2. Twenty-four hour emergency care -86 - 3. A 12-bed detoxification unit 4. 'A 22-bed-long stay ward 5. A 50-unit residential halfway house 6. community education and evaluation Apparently the services now offered pending renovation are out\u00ad patient care; 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. emergency service; community education and some consultation. The area served is the extremely depressed Brooklyn ghetto neighborhood known as Bedford-Stuyvesant. The Center serves Blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans, with a majority of Blacks. The ages treated are from 18 up, with the majority in their 40's. Although the model of the treatment program is a free- standing clinic, certain liaison continues to exist with Kings County Hospital for the hiring of personnel, for billing pur- poses, and for purchase orders. Other administrative decisions 'regarding matters beyond the day-to-day operation of the Center are made with the Health and Hospital Corp. There are 1200 patients who are registered, 400 of whom are considered active in that they avail themselves of at least one service (counseling) once within any three-month period. When a patient is in need of hospitalization, referrals are made to Swedish Hospital, Long Island College Hospital and Kings County Hospital. Dr. Abrahams says that many of his clients who are alcoholics often do not get adequate care or attention I I ! t \\ I I ! [,! U r: I I ; )1 I ! I l ~ d -87 - paid to their physical and emotional problems through ex\u00ad isting health services. They are discriminated against because they are alcoholics as well as because they are poor and often Black. Dr. Abrahams says that there is another ,alcoholism program in Brooklyn which does nothing but treat secondary problems of alcoholism, such as physical distress. The Bedford-Stuyvesant Treatment Center emphasizes an attack upon th alleged psychogenic causes of alcoholism -either in terms of emotional disturbances or internalized sociological factors which may give rise to low tolerance of frustration. Group counseling is the usual mode of treatment. Other aspects -of treatment include a full medical clinic, individual counsel- ing, health education, some vocational guidance (al'though there is no trained vocational rehabilitation counselor on the staff and Dr. Abrahams not only sees' the need for such a staff member, but also would like to have a job developer as well) I and recreational therapy (including a well-used day room). D Ab h h' If r. ra ams ~mse engages in lectures in the communl.'ty. Al h I' An co 0 1CS onymous has representatives assigned to the program. Other techniques used involve the acting out of problems by patients with audio visual play- back to allow them to observe their own methods for dealing wi th problems. The staff is made up of counselors who have been trained at the Center, including several recovered alcoholics, clerks, a psychiatrist and a psychiatric social worker. A total of eight of the employees on the staff are alcoholics who were success--A8 - fully rehabilitated at the program. Dr. Abrahams would like to be able to attract more doctors into the 'program. He feels that a maximum salary of $28,000 per year is simply insufficient. Additiona'l funding would permit him to pay more. He would use the extra medical personnel to expand his treatment program to include polydrug abuse related b.) the abuse of alcohol. At the present time he rejects all applicants who use drugs other than alcohol. He believes the polY'drug-alcohol abuse problem is extremely se~:ious, particular among young people. He does n.ot see a dramatic in\u00ad crease in teen-age alcoholism, bu.t he 'tV'elcomes the emphasis and attention on what has always been a severe problem --that of teen-age drinking in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area. He is also very much opposed to the use of antabus~ and to suggestions that its use be made mandatory, ei ther as a condition of t.reatmen t or the re- turn of a driver's license. He believes that antabuse does not make most of his patients any sic~er than they already get from the amounts of alcohol that they ingest. If they drink on top of using antabuse, they may die. The antabuse can be used by severely depressed people in suicide attempts, and Dr. Abrahams takes the view that abstinence from any and all chemical substances can be the only solution for the problem of alcohol and drug addiction. Parenthetically, Dr. Abrahams called our attention to his experience with persons maintained on methadone who drink wine to obtain a high. He states that these people tend to de--89 - velop a tolerance to the alcohol much more rapidly than the or\u00ad dinary alcoho~ic and therefore run a greater risk of early deterioration and death. In order to expand and treat more people, particularly the cross-addicted individual, more money will be needed. Dr. Abrahams also would like more money to establish a full job development program, including a sheltered workshop. He was ap\u00ad parently unaware of efforts by other treatment agencies to de\u00ad velop jobs. However, he stated that the probiem of employment for reformed alcoholics is a particularly difficult one. Often the reformed alcoholic is an older person who has not worked in many years. There may be minor organic impairments, residual from prolonged alcoholism. Such individuals may not function in terms of their potential prior to alcoholism, but they may be competent to function at ano\u00b7ther level. Employers, however, seldom see it that way and Dr. Abrahams is not satisfied with efforts of the State Division of Labor in assisting poor rehabili- tated alcoholics. However, the picture is not entirely bleak. Only 41% of the patients in treatment are Medicaid eligible, which means that approximately 59% are working. Evaluation has not yet begun of this treatment program. Dr. Abrahams would guess that those who have been rehabilitated during the two-year maximum period of the program would consti\u00ad tute approximately 40% of the total enrollment thus far. He -90 - further estimates that of those who relapse while in treatment, approximately 23%'are retrieved. Since he has no hard statistics, it may be that these figures are optimistic. General discussion of alcoholism led to some interest- ing views of Dr. Abrahams. He believes there is no such thing as a problem drinker. He believes that any person who drinks j with regard to avoiding or coping with any difficult situation is an alcoholic and should stop drinking entirely, forever. He states that the amount of alcohol consumed is not significant with regard to alcoholism. (There is, of course, another view ... that heavy habitual drinking can lead to chemical addiction. Dr. Abrahams does not share this view.) Dr. Abrahams states that what is important in determining whether or not an individual is an alcoholic is what anyone drink means to the individual. He believes that all alcoholism is based upon an inability to cope with frustration or sociological or psychological problems. Any use of alcohol in such context must terminate entirely, particularly,because there is a cumulative chemical tolerance which never diminishes. Therefore, any return of emotional prob- lems could begin a new serious drinking habit. The Commission staff looked over the facility and was extremely impressed by the fact that the atmosphere appears to be non-threatening and congenial, and people appeared to be in the process of being helped. This is particularly impressive in light of the rather awkward atmosphere of several drug treatment i'~ .. );1 f J \\ -91 - programs visited and in light of the fact that the Bedford\u00ad Stuyvesant Treatment Center is heavily policed by both male and female unarmed hospital police force members. Quarters are cramped and a large amount of space appears to be set aside for record\u00b7keeping. A small ward h b t as een se up for people who come to the Center in an intoxicated condition. They are per- mitted to sleep off their intoxication without recriminations or repercussions. Returning to a discussion with Dr. Abrahams, he ap- peared quite skeptical about the Iredical sufficiency of the so-called sohering- up stations to be set up by the State Department of lI\"\" .... tal ~ .... ' J.\u00b7~U ~~.Y ~J.ene , Division of Alcoholism. (On the other hand, the Department b ases its plans on the significant experience whicn' has already been accumulated w'i th p,roperly run, adequately supported sobering-up stations in this state and elsewhere.) With regard to' changes in the laws or regulations, he had the following suggestions: 1. He believes that the federal government should reevaluate its policy of giving diShonorable discharges for alcoholism, which negates the basic premise that alcoholism is an illness and which follows the man as an impediment to em\u00ad ployment. 2. In the event that funding is expanded for poly- drug and alcohol abuse, he would prefer that the money go through existing alcoholism funding conduits and not through the Drug Abuse Control Commission .. '. -92 - 3. In the event that funding is made more plentiful, he believes that a proliferation of programs should be avoided, but that good programs should be better financed. 4. While he would like to see all health and mental health services available concurrently in proximity to one another, he believes that the role of alcohol treatment requires emphasis and should not be under-e~phasized in an attempt to unify services. 5. or subjective fa.vors the use of crisis situations, objective He on the part of the alcoholic, to induce him into the treatment process. RESEARCH AND EDUCATION In 1967, then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller announced the selection of Buffalo as the site of a projected Research Insti\u00ad tute on Alcoholism. That city was chosen to take advantage of the new campus for the State University of New York at Buffalo, and also to relate to a community known for its diversity of population and problems, but of manageable size for purposes of social research projects. The Research Institute began its operation in July of 1973 in an old federal building donated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to the State Department of Mental Hygiene. Its annual budget is just under one million dollars, although an orig~ inal recommendation for six million dollars was reportedly sent to ,. ...... , \".-<, -93 - the Governor by his committee of research authorities designated at the suggestion of the Advisory Council on Alcoholism. The Director of the Research Institute reports that approximately half of the projects being undertaken are in the biological field and the other half are sociological. Apparently, all of the research can be categorized as \"applied\", in ~he sense that practical applications of expected research findings are foreseeable. On the other hand, some of the projects are in the nature of long-term series of experiments and collections of data, with no immediate utilitarian expectations. One short-term project is the statistical analysis of the public inebriate popUlation in Buf~alo, and one long-term research project looks into the mecha\u00ad nisms of intoxication and alcohol addiction. AdditionallYr the Research Institute plans to supervise an evaluative component in the sobering-up stations e~tablished by the Department of Mental Hygiene Division of Alcoholism, with respect to the decriminali\u00ad zation of public inebriation, effective January I, 1975. It should be noted that the Institute, although a part of the Department of Mental Hygiene, is not under the Division of Alcoholism. The Institute staff is comprised of 16 professionals familiar with diSCiplines such as psychology, epidemiology and be\u00ad havioral studies. Other studies being made by the Institute relate to outcomes of arrests for driving while intoxicated, and evaluations of evaluations of driving while intoxicated programs. I, -94 - The Commission staff discussed with the Institute's staff the question of a dichotomy between funding for research and funding for treatment. Because the funding comes from dif- ferent sources or is rigidly categorized, evaluative components in treatment programs both for drugs and alcohol tend to be either non-existent or short-changed. For example, the National Insti- tute of Mental Health divides treatment and research funding. 1 The Federal government tends to be more likely to divide funds along these lines. Research projects contemplated by the Institute appear to fall into five categories: 1. Epidemiology' of alcohol-related problems. 2. Outcomes of treatment or arrest. 3. The effects of alcohol on the human organ- ism, alone or in conjunction with other drugs. 4. Evaluations af specific governmental programs relating to alcohol. 5. The development. of preventive educational programs. With all due respect to the exp~~rtise available at the Institute and the need to allow researchers to follow, to some extent, their own inclinations in order to hold their interest, there does appear to be something of a scatter-shot approach* to research at the Institute, without any specific ordering of pri- *New York State Task Force on Alcohol Problems, Committee on Research, Position Paper, September, 1974, p.4. I ,. -95 - ori ties. The issue seems to be hm\u00b7, to maintain the independence of a research organization while suggesting that it clearly define tasks more responsive to the immediate need~ f h -0 t.e state. Since this Commission is also an independent evalt.1ative agency f \\',1e make the fo11m<1ing research recommendations: RECOMMENDATIONS 1. At the present time the State spends approximately six million dollars each year on various modalities of treatment for persons ~lho have alcohol-related problems. The State also appropriates over one hundred million dollars a year for drug treatment programs, for an actual and a potential client population perhaps one third as large as the State's problep\\ drin~ing population. As the focus shifts to providing more ser\u00ad vices to persons with alcohql and polydrug-alcohol problems, it would be sound social policy to begin a study of each of the pre\u00ad sent treatment modalities, with an eva1ua~ ion of success with patients within each type of prograr:l, as \\<7e1l as a comparison of the success of different types of programs. In that way, repetitions of the mistakes made in the hurried establishment and funding.of drug programs may be avoided. 2. Continued pressure should be brought to bear upon funding sources to combine research with treatment, for the pur~' pose of establishing pilot treatment programs on a purely research basis, so that results may be evaluated concurrently with the de\u00ad livery of treatment services. Viewed in this perspectivel - forms of treatment would become aspects of research. 3. Epidemiological studies are useful in determining the scope of the, problem. Cooperation between the State Health Department and the Institute might serve to stretch precious re\u00ad sources while accomplishing this purpose. 4. When speaking of the subjects of alcohol and edu\u00ad cation, many people refer to the idea that educational efforts regarding \"values clarification\", JlldecisionmakingU , and warnings against alcohol abuse may deter such abuse. Efforts in the past that have failed often prompt the search for a new jargon and catchier slogans, and declarations that future efforts will avoid previous mistakes. A full analysis of these ideas appears in our report on Drug Abuse Prevention (cited above). Aside from inform\u00ad ing people about the nature of human dysfunctions and calling their attention on an individual basis to their own problems in this regard coupled with giving them opportunities to receive help, there is little that education can achieve in the sense of deter\u00ad ring substance abuse through verbal manipulative techniques. However, education in the sense of teaching professionals how to deal with problems of alcohol abuse among their patients and their clients has been a much neglected area of concern. Ac\u00ad cording to the Department of Mental Hygiene, there are seven sub\u00ad divisions of students whose ultimate clients and patients would benefit from educational efforts at this level. These subdivisions of students a~e those involved in professional degree education, such as medicine, psychology, nursing, social work and law, those 'j 1 ! I II l ! \" l (I I J 1 -97 - involved in post professional degree education; undergraduates seeking degrees in health care or human services; candidates for inservice education within existing agencies; participants in continuing education for professionals; those likely to attend periodic workshops including law enforcement officials and the judiciary;~and alcoholism counselors. We recommend\" that the Alcoholism Research Institute prepare courses of study for these categories of students, par- ticularly family physicians, whose lack of familiarity with alco\u00ad hol-related problems has been well documented.* 5. The excellent work of Alcoholics Anonymous is well known. For some of the persons who cannot respond to traditional psychiatric intervention and casework, A.A. represents not only a last hope, but a real hope. According to A.A. nearly half of the people who remain members never drink again. Virtually every worthwhile treatment program today offers easy access to A.A. We believe that a prime research effort should be made to under- stand conceptually how A.A. achieves its results, and to what extent the concept might be broadened, without inviting the pre- viously described errors of the therapeutic communities. other studies of the Institute should, of course, pro- ceed. And in order to meet the suggested order of priorities, additional funding may be needed. Our recommendation in this re- gard is that moneys saved in the drug abuse field should be real- loca'ted to alcohol research. Beyond those savings, however, ad- *Pl~,nning Guidelines, New York state Department of Mental Hygiene, 1973-1974, pp. 69-73. 1 ________________________ .L... \" -98 - ditional funds may ultimately be needed for further alcohol- related research and treatment. In recommending that such in- ., creases be preceded by meaningful evaluations, we are also mindful of the fact tha;t revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages in New York State exceed three hundred fifty million dollars, annually.* The gross cost to the State of alcohol-related problems is approx\u00ad imately one billion dollars. Yet the State spends only seven mil- l lion dollars for treatment and research. We do not urge spending for its own sake. However, we also do not oppose justifiable expenditures for evaluations and for programs that work. Finally, on the subject of treatment, itself, we make the ~ollowing recommendation: Alcohol-related problems occur with varying degrees of severity and at differing points in time among a variety of indi- viduals. It is necessary that treatment services be provided in a comprehensive and systematic way, with built-in mechanisms to assure accessibility to the services, continuity of care, and availability of treatment for as long as individuals require it. Programs should not be developed which are piecemeal in character, possibly leading to \"revolving door\" utilization without signifi\u00ad cant impact on the individuals involved. *The New York Time~,lNov. 30, 1974. t:J H <: H H (') (j) 1-3 S H ~ t<:!

These are the treatment services funded and operated directly by the Department of Mental Hygiene. Legislation earlier this year gave the Department the authority and funds to organize 11 new units which are now in the process of being opened. Concerning alcoholism treatment services which are funded either by 100% contracts with the Division of Alcoholism or by state aid from the Department of Mental Hygiene, the Division of Alcoholism since 1962 has used a significant amount of its funds to begin new treatment services for 100% contracts for a 3-year period. After the 3-year period the treatment service, provided it has become a valuable community resource, is funded by state aid (50% of the budget coming from the locality and the remainder from the Department of Mental Hygiene). This funding mechanism has proven to be valuable in developing alcoholism programs throughout the state. In listing the treatment services which have been funded by the Department of Mental Hygiene, I have grouped them by the areas served by the Department's Regional Offices'. A number of programs such as councils on alcoholism, coordinato~of alcoholism services of county mental health, mental retardation and alcoholism services. boards, occupational alcoholism programs, training, and public education programs have' also been developed throughout the state, but they are not listed here.

I believe the major recommendations of this committee will be available in January and that the total report will probably be available in February of 1975. This report should provide you with a great deal more information on directions and and programs which should be pursued by the Division of Alcoholism over the next several years. Wh~le the Executive Committee of the State Planning Task Force has not yet acted upon the major recommendations, the Division's staff has proposed that the total budget for the state alcoholism program over the next five years should be at a level of approximately\u00b7 $50 million (both state and federal funds) by the end of the five year period. ~ 'SCI' During the fiscal year in 1973-74, there were 4,265 admissions to the alc~~olism rehabilitation units at the state psychiatric centers, accounting for 13% of all admissions to the psychiatric centers. The average patient stay in the alcoholism rehabilitation unit was 35 days. It is expected that with the increased capacity for -alcoholism rehabilitation programs at the psychiatric centers (from 510 beds to 870 beds with the new legislation mentioned above), there will be approximately 7.200 admissions a year. During the-fi~ca1 year 1973-74 there were 38,886 admissions to alcoholism treatment facilities at the local level, and some 251,247 total visits to these units during the year. It is estimated that there are 900,000 persons with serious alcoholism problems in New York State. The treatment resource in both the public and the private sectors must be greatly expanded to meet the needs of this major public health problem. Progress must be made in the immediate future in establishing sobering-up stations throughout the state. As you know, public intoxication is to be eliminated from the State Penal Code as of January, 1976. In addition to the need for sobering-up stations for that part of the .population now arrested and jailed for public intoxica.tion, it is expected that the program on public intoxication will create demands for additional alcoholism treatment and rehabilitation services--with the sobering-up stations serving as au entree into a treatment program. Other programs which can also be expected to increase the demand for treatment programs are the occupational alcoholism programs developing in industrial and governmental organizations as well as programs in the area of alcohol and highway safety. : ...................... aar, ... ~ <I (1) (/) -109 - CHAPTER IV CHILDREN AND PARENTS: TIME FOR RECONCILIATION What We Have Learned in Five Years On December 14, 1969, Walter Vandermeer was found dead of an overdose of heroin in a tenement hall bathroom. He was under five feet tall and he was 12 years old. His death received a good deal of journalistic attention, notably the lengthy write-up, \"Obituary of a Heroin Addict\", The New York Times, January 12, 1970, appended to this chapter. In the en\u00ad suing five years, many lessons have been learned' about how to help children overcome a drug habit. A few lessons have been learned about how to help children who are expressing their trou\u00ad ble in other ways. Some lessons have been applied, to a limited extent. Others have served to modify our thinking, but not yet our priorities and our programs. This Commission, in evaluating the effectiveness of programs whose purpose is to prevent or to treat drug abuse, find~ Walter's story instructive. Was Walter a child who had unfortunately never come to the attention of public officials? Was he one of those never \"identified\" officially as in need of help? By no means. Walter was known to the Family Court, the Society for the PreventlQh of Cruelty to Children, the Department of Social Services (both to , .' - ~-~~IIi\"~-;r.;;.,\":\">-:,G:~,~-t\"k;i'~>~:\u00b7u - its Bureau of Child Welfare and as part of a family unit re\u00ad ceiving Aid to Dependent Children support), the Board of Educa\u00ad tion's Bureau of Attendance and Bureau for th~ Education of Socially Maladjusted Children, the Wiltwyck School' for Boys, and the Office of Probation. He had been in the Queens Shelter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Children's Center run by the Department of Social Services for j neglected children; Patterson House, the halfway house for chil- dren who had been living at Wiltwycki Wiltwyck's upstate campus. Along the way, had no one cared? Not so at all. Walter's mother cared, even to the point of pleading with the court to i; have him returned to her rather than~ sl?nt to a state training school \\ , school. His older sister cared. She'encouraged her mother's plea, because of her own destructive experience in a training school. His godmother cared enough to invite him to live with her if her son were to be inducted into the army. His counselor at wiltwyck cared, and Walter continued to visit him, even after both had left Wiltwyck, until that young man left New York to live elsewhere. His next oldest brother, Tony, cared a great deal. Tony had been placed, through the special interest of a probation officer, in a home in Yonkers operated by a private agency, and had made what was regarded as a highly successful adjustment there. Tony tried to interest the agency caring for him in the plight of his bro\u00ad ther, but failed. The two boys, despite Tony's concern for and attachment to Walter, were never placed together. Was Walter deprived of recommended care because of insuf\u00ad ficient funding? ,Did he diet because not enough was spent on his salvation? r -III - On the contrary. From March, 1967, when he was nine, until October 1968, Walter was in placement, (shifted to five dif\u00ad ferent places in fifteen months). H f' I e ~na ly arrived at Wiltwyck in June, 1968 but Wiltwyck returned h4m to Fam;ly .l. .... Court because \";;. \" he kept running away. Those twe t t -'. ny-one moh hs of,placement:cost ' ~ at least twenty thousand dollars. In add;tJ..' on, f\" , ... -0 course, was the cost . of the Family Court proceedings and of the time spent on him by the Office of Probation and by the Board of Education. With all this official attention, all these people who cared, and all this money spent, why, then, was Walter so sad, so uncared for, and, finally, why did he d;e ;n a ........ tenement hallway toilet? Had he given up on himself? N I 0, apparent y not. The New York Times article m t' h en lons t at Walter, upon being given a a new pair of shoes by a neighbor, said he would save them for when he went back to'school; he asked his younger brother to help him with his reading; he was looking forward to Christmas. What was missing? What went wrong? And what errors have we corrected? Walter was known to one agency all his life, the Depart- ment of Welfare (now the Department of S . I ' oc~a Serv~ces), and to another from the time he began school, th e Board of Education. '!he Department of Welfare, as far as the known record indicated, of- fered no special services either to Walter or his mother to help either one cope. The Board of Education, which first noticed how troubled he was when, at age nine, in the third grade, he roamed '. 112 - the halls and threw temper tantrums his teachers viewed as \"cries for helpll, also offered no help to the family. They did not refer Walter to the school psychologist or to the Bureau of Child Guid\u00ad ance. It is not known whether they ever even called in his mother to talk about his problems. The Board referred him to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which brought the family to court on a neglect petition. Although his brother Tony was placed, Walter was eventually released to his home. The record gives no indication of service to his mother to help her to cope, or to alleviate stress, and no effort to provide continuity of care by an adult more adequate than \u00b7the mother. Much could have been done at far less cost than the amount lavishec so fruitlessly upon placement of Walter. The most important thing in the life of a child is con\u00ad tinuity of close relationship with a \"parenting\" adult. This was dramatically restated by Anna Freud and Joseph Goldstein in their recent book Beyond the Best Interests of the Child: \"Continuity of relationships, surroundings, and environmental influence are essential for a child's normal development. Since they do not play the same role in later life, their importance is often underrated by the adult world. \"Physical, e:rrotional, intellectual, social, and moral growth does not hap- pen without causing the child inevitable internal difficulties. The instability of mantal processes during the period of development needs to be offset by stability and uninterrupted support from external sources. Srrooth growth is arrested or disrupted when upheavals and changes in the external world are added to the in- ternalone5.\"* *Goldstein, Joseph, Anna Freud and Albert J. Solnit, ~~yond the Best Interests of the Child, The Free Press, New York, 1973, pp. 31-33.. -113 - The Domestic Relations Court, and later, of course, the Family Court, recognized the central importance of this need .. The purposes of the Dome'stic Relations Court of the City of New York were to \"rehabilitate, reconstitute families, and reconcile differences in families with a view of reestablishing them\", James v. ~ames, 1941, 148 Misc. 1041, 37 NYS 2nd 89. This was restated in Tugender v. Tugender,Dom. ReI. Ct. 1942, 33 NYS 2nd Ib03, in which the primary purposes of the court were said to include \"the possible adjustment of dislocated human relations, possible main\u00ad tenance of a family unit\". To help a troubled child and an inadequate or pressured family, one of the following, or both, are usually required: first, that the family learn new patterns of interacting and that the family members learn to cope more satisfyingly, to enlarge their op\u00ad porturiities for sociable gratification; and second, that help be provided to alleviate the external stresses. When the family remains inadequate, it may be necessary to offer a continuing relationship with someone outside the family, someone to whom a child can turn through all the vagaries and pains of growing up. Meaningful help for a child must focus on strength\u00ad ening his family and, when this is not enough, must provide a SUbstitute \"Rock of Gibralter\". It is necessary, at times, to reinvent the parent. The record of what was or was not done for Walter is not known in detail to this Commission. The portrait sketched in The New York Times does point up what we know to be general r .'\" . i ):' g . -114 - defects in the system of delivery of care to.troubl~d children, t t d S These defects include: those on drugs and those no ye on rug . Failure to offer services which might strengthen the family. Such services might include family counseling, individual therapy, which, at its most expensive private rate of about three thousand dollars a year, is one fifth the cost of placement for one child. They might include homemafer service, which is a sur\u00ad rogate mother type service intended to pull together a disorgan\u00ad ized home and give the parent a Ilbreather\". This, too, at a cost of about five thousand dollars a year, or perhaps six thousand dollars for a large family, is a far better buy than placement at \u00a3ouxteen thousand dollars per year per child. Such services might include good day care for a young child so that the parent can k t school l'n preparation for work, and regain ,his or go to wor 1 or 0 her sense of self determination and control over his own and his 'f so that he or she might continue to work with-family's 11 ei or out his absence being a detriment to the child. Failure to keep siblings together, when placement is necessary. This failure was dramatic in Walter's case. His next oldest brother, Tony, the person to whom he had a continuing re\u00ad lationship, and who was concerned about him, tried in vain to interest the agency caring for him in his brother Walter. What grand design of society does it serve to separate two small bro\u00ad thers who might be a source of comfort and encouragement to each other? Inflexibility and lack of imagination in planning. The one place in which Walter reportedly did well was Patterson House, -----~~------------------- -115 - where he found an adult he trusted, returned to school and at- tended regularly. He was moved from there, however, because Pat- terson is a halfway house for children who have been at Wiltwyck's upstate campus, who are in transition back to their homes. Walter / was placed there to await the move to Wiltwyck, and was moved as soon as there was room for him upstate. Was any thought given to the possibility of simply leaving the child where he was; though he did not fit the category for which the house was intended? And what of the woman who viewed herself as Walter's godmother. Did anyone know she was willing to take in Walter, but needed more space? Could she have been helped to find such space, and to get an extra bed? Would she have been willing to parent Walter? Failure to provide one adult whom a child can trust, to see him through all his changes and strains. Walter's need for such a \"parent\" was clear, in his seeking out of the one counselor he loved, in his wanting even ~o go away with him. Such a parent can be a neighbor, a professional, a relative. He can come to .. know the child through an agency, as a staff member or a volunteer, or through a block association or neighborhood \"big brother\" group, or through a church or a P.T.A. But COIlE to knCM him he must, because for those. families' who need this buttress, its absence renders every- thing else useless. Since Walter Vandermeer died, some things have improved. There are now treatment centers for child drug abusers. Children's Center and Callagy Hall, both for neglected children, have been closed. The emphasis, at least for short-term care, is now on providing small group homes, rather than large institutions .... --.--,--------------------~--------------- 'I -116 - Th . l.'ncreasing talk about, and even some programs working ere l.S t d the reun: l.'tl.'ng and s.trengthenl.'ng of , _. Reinventing The Parent A substantial number of witnesses before this Commission described the destructiveness of the gUlf between their young drug abusing patients, and such children's families.

The family of choice is the child's own '1 I . i , i family. How the attitute toward families of children in troublet has changed is described in Innovative Approaches to Youth servic~/1 J ~ -117 - in the context of work with runaways.* Program staff find that working with runaways is a major learning and maturing experience. Initially, staff tend to identify with the runaway and to agree that the runaway's parents are in the wrong and that none of the problems are the adolescent's. The staff has a tendency to reinforce the runaway's perception and to agree that the parents are unjust and that the running aW'ay is justified. Since the staff con\u00ad sists of young people, their own problems with their parents are not that distant and help to influence their perception. When the parents are brought in for a counseling session with their teenager, the staff quickly learns that the problems are not so one-sided and that perhaps the runaway is also contributing to family conflicts. These experiences help the staff become increasingly more sophisticated in their coun\u00ad seling role and to take a more neutral, third party stance on problems. Our whole' concept of treatment, what you do when a kid comes in, is very different from our original stance. Initially we would come in and rap, and let a kid rap for ho-urs and hours. Our counseling perspective was to be a friend to the kid. Anything a kid says is true; take a kid\" s word for everything; that's who you identity with. We've made a real swing to much better interviewing techniques to help the people who initially interview kids to get a real sense of where the problem does lie. Is it the kid who's in really severe trouble personally? Is the kid in trouble more because of the family dynamics? Is the kid really okay, with a family that's really in trouble? We try to pinpoint what the problem is. Initially the staff feel that the runaway problem is not a psychological concern and are very much against clinical interpretations. The staff see the problem as mainly one of destruc,ti ve parental behavior. As the staff begins to see the complexity of family problems, they become more clinical in orientation. The staff started from an extraordinarily anti\u00ad psychiatry stance. Professionals didn't know anything; didn't have anything to tell them. They've become more sensitive to the child's needs~ they've really learned a lot about psychodynamics. The staff now gets together twice a week and talk about each kid that's there. The coun\u00ad selors are sharing information with each other in order to *Kolton, Marilyn, Ph.D., Dwarshuis, Louis, Ph.D., Gorodesky, Michael, MooS. W ., and Dosher, Anne, B.

Staff also become aware of how difficult it is to change family situations in which the members have a long history of destructive communication patterns. ,The need for follow-up work for both parents and adolescents is realized and more counseling is done after the adolescent returns home. If the family is not from the immediate area, the problem of counseling is greater and programs have to make referrals, with little assurance that the family will act\u00ad ually seek help. Working with runaways results in the staff feeling some pessimism about family conditions and adolescent treat\u00ad ment. They become acutely aware of the lack of real help in our society for the young person who is having trouble with his parents. The adolescent has few legal rights and is often trapped in a highly negative and destructive living situation. There are few adequate treatment facilities for the disturbed adolescent or living arrangements for the adolescent who does not want to return home or live with a foster parent. In Before Addiction: How to Help Youth, a book written for parents, the authors have these comforting words: * \". A conflict between generations has always been a nor- mal part of life. It comes about because of the necessary changes in adolescence to a new self in a different world than the pa~ents knew. The world has always changed from one genera\u00ad tion to another, even if at some times and places the changes appear slower and more gradual--usually only in historical perspecti ve . ' \\ Peter BIos, an analyet of the phenomenon of adoles\u00ad cence, suggests that the notion of IIgeneration gap\" is a de\u00ad vice used to create so vast a distance between young and old, that they become incapable of meeting in either mind or body. As a consequence the conflict between generations that is es\u00ad sential for growth both of self and of civilization is avoided. Disagreements between you and your child will not hurt him. They are inevitable and in the long run help him define the differences between you and himself, one of the very *Lieberman, Florence, D.S.W., Caroff, Phyllis, D.S.W., and Gotte:sfeld, Mary, M. S.

The process of ~n\u00ad dividuation necessarily includes both you,and y~ur young:ter~ as the actors. Alienation involves the ~lthdrawal of es~en:lal emotional caring and trying. Talk of allenated \u00a5oung,peopl~ concerns their resignation and hopelessness. Al~~natlon that involves parents themselves appears to be a,reac~~on to the separation and individuation process of the~~;chl~drent when the parents have given up all hope for commun~cat~on and when connectedness has broken down. Too many of you toda~anticipate your children's adolescence with apprehension. You do not have to feel hope\u00ad less and helpless. The large majority of our,young people work out relationships with adults, perhaps d~fferent ones from those of the past or future. But very frequ~ntlY they incorporate parental values. There are many ~tud~es com\u00ad paring adolescents' beliefs with those of thelr pare~ts which attest to the similarity in th~ir values, desp~te highly publicized opinions to the contrary. A trusting relationship between you and your,child is necessary to his learning how to be an adult. Confl~ct and difference of opinion need not un~ercut trust., Th~ , stereotype of adolescence .as a sorely troub~ed perl0d lS In\u00ad terfering too frequently with your expectatlo~s ~hat your children will make it. without talking simpl~st7cally about the power of positive thinking, there is much ev~~en<?e to support the sociological concept of the self-~ulfll~lng pro\u00ad phecy. It stands to reason that an apprehenslve cllmate,o~ expectation increases anxiety and tension. If you are l~vlng with such apprehension, you must of necessity struggle wlth feelings related to flight, or alienation. Your ability to maintain conn~ctedness in feeling with your children is important in helplng adolescents. Sometimes this involves remembering the fear~, doub~s, and struggles of your own adolescence by way of lncreaslng your understanding of that with which your children are strug\u00ad gling. Meanwhile, you still have to know your present feel\u00ad ings, attitudes, and values, as parent and adult. For some of you knowing your real feeli~gs and knowing who you are is very difficult. Partly thls occurs because oE the cultural emphasis on youth which has f~rther worsened your conflict and confusion. Some of you, llke all of us today want so much to be young, and may have work~d overtime to' demonstrate your ability to diminish generatlon differences. Not only does this dull who mom and dad are, -121 - but it adds\\, to the anxieties of the very youngsters whom you would Llke to resemble. It is simpler for a young per\u00ad son to deal with prohibitions and taboos than with contra\u00ad dictions, c~nfusion, and inconsistency. Two Programs Which Reconcile Families Since treatment agencies are more and more aware of the need to reconcile the children they treat with the children's families, they have begun to develop varying modes of irlvolving the families. The variations reflect different styles and dif\u00ad ferent philosophies, which are geared to families with different life-styles, and employ different kinds of staffs. Some of the programs which consider themselves \"inno\u00ad vative\", rather than traditional social agency settings, primarily the \"walk-in\" or crisis centers, have deve~oped imaginative ways of reaching out to the parents of their children and to other adults in the community. Innovative programs find themselves becoming increasing\u00ad ly involved with parental and adult problems. The case of the runaway and concern about their children's use of drugs are two good examples of ways programs-have to interact with adults. Parents are always a hassle. We feel it's not thorough enough to talk to the kid and counsel him. He goes home to the place that perhaps was responsible for the problem. So we want to talk to the parents and get them involved. Another source of contact with parents is through adult volunteers who are having trouble with their own children. Often staff find that the adult problems might have little or nothing to do with the adolescent's problem. Many adult problems are individual psychological problems, marital conflicts, or alco\u00ad holism. As a result of this growing awareness of adult needs, innovative programs are becoming more involved with programs for adults. Many programs hold parent counseling groups. Pa\u00ad rents originally corne to these groups expecting to learn how to cope better with their adolescent. They find they learn more about their own problems. 'I -122 - We've been running special groups of parents for about a year now. We had trouble getting the~ to come down; maybe one, two, or three parents would come down. We'd run these groups for ten weeks and then start a new gro~p. We never had a parent stay who wasn't just really overwhelmed. They come to it with all kinds of misconceptions, but they got something out of it. It turned out they liked it. They would tell other parents, so in the next group we would have seven or eight parents and so on. The most interesting thing was that we really didn't have a structure of objectives, other than to get the parents to talk about their families and their kias and drugs. The orien\u00ad tation was toward drugs, but evaluations were undertaken last year, including the parent's groups and use of pre-tests and post-tests over a year period. The post-tests indicated that the clinic had helped parents most often in learning about themselves--not about kids, drugs or the community, but about themselves. The parents said that. It's incredible. I was really amazed. But they actually learned something about themselves. Qne' guy discovered what he was doing to get his wife uptight, and that he hadn't talked to his wife in twenty years. One program reported beginning a housewives group. Several pro~rams developed auxiliary programs for parents. One especially ~nteresting program is run by parents for parents. They provide a phone service which they call a \"panic line\". Parents having problems with their children or wanting drug in\u00ad formation can call and talk with a parent who probably has had a similar experience. This parent's organization also conducts its own parent's groups as a means of providing follow-up coun\u00ad seling. Programs find that work with parents can also increase their credibility in the community. One of the best things that we've ever done is through this auxiliary. They had community coffee meetings just for parents in the com\u00ad munity, in their own neighborhood. They were held in their own homes. The staff would come and answer their questions and meet the people. Some weld win over, and some would be neutral, but they were not able to believe rumors and misunderstandings that they had come to the meeting with. We \\\\Tere right there, and they -123 - saw other parents saying, 'Listen to him\u00ad they're not doing all those things.' And it's b~come a f~rce in the community itself. The c~~y counc~lman can't say that these long what they're doing. The~r ~wn const~tuents are helping us in the commun~ty.* At Southeast Nassau Guidance Center (SNG Counseling Center, Inc.) staff uses a more traditional mode to resurrect a forgotten art, that of enlisting the help of a family in the cause of its child. That program, and the background of it, were described to this Commission at its hearing on Treatment of Drug Abusers in Nassau on Septe:rnber 5, 1974, by Dennis M Reilly, C.S.W., A.C.S.W. I. BACKGROUND: The mental health field, Mr. Reilly pointed out, has come to realize that the pathology manifested by the \"designated patient\" is often, if not always, a reflection of the interper- , sonal pathology prevalent within his family. Yet this insight has not been widely applied in the field of drug abuse. Family therapy as a treatment modality for youthful drug abusers and their families, for example, is a surprisingly underutilized technique. Too often, drug. counseling programs accept the \"myth of the designated patient\" and assume that the drug abuser is the only \"sick\" family member, the only one needing help. The process of labelling the drug abuser as the \"patient of record\" begins in the family or the criminal justice system, gains moment~ when he and his family are interviewed separately ~Kolton on admission to a residential treatment center or to outpatient therapy, and bursts into full steam when the drug abuser is diagnosed and assigned to a treatment regimen--w~ile the other family members either remain untreated or are treated separately as \"non-patients\" in parental counseling or some similar ap- proach. All too often,counselprs who have contact with the families of youthful drug abusers see family meniliers in an ex- tremely stereotyped or one-dimensional way--either as merely con- venient storehouses of information about the drug abuser or as villains who somehow \"made the patient sick\". Consequently, the families are eften denied the counseling help they desperately need, despite the fact that the drug abuser will often even\u00ad tually return to live within this same disturbed family system which helped to produce his symptoms in the first place. II. HYPOTHESIS: SNG believes that intrafamilial dynamics play a very large role in both the development and maintenance of dr~g-abusing behavior. Staff there does not, of course, discount the impor- tance of extrafamilial or non-familial factors in drug abuse-- they recognize, for example, that social class, subculture, and peer group membership are all influential in determing whether drug-using behavior is defined as an avenue of social conformity or deviance for the group or family in question. But, especial- ly in the case of youthful drug abusers who are living at home -125 - with their fam'l' h J. J.es, t ey believe that drug-abusing behavior is, above all., a ..family pathology, a symptom of family system dys\u00ad function. They therefore see famJ.'ly therapy--meeting the drug abuser together with all the merobers of his family simultaneously and.on a regular basis--as the treatment modality of choice. This form of interven.tion not only recognJ.' zOe\" s the f amilial fac- tor in the deviant behavior, but it also inVOlves the drug abuser a collective struggle to imp~ove the quality and his family in of their intimate 1 t' h' re a J.ons J.ps and day-to-day social environ- mente III. THE FAMILIES OF DRUG ABUSERS--INTERACTIGNS: At SNG Counseling Center many youthful drug abusers and their families are seen over extended periods of tJ.' me in conjoint family therapy. As thJ.'s I' , 1 c J.nJ.ca experience accumulated, staff began to notice that the familJ.\u00b7es f d o rug abusers tended to share certain very definite and very characteristic ways of relating. The Center recognizes. of course, that its sample was limited. The t' -t pa J.en -population is drawn from Southeast Nassau and is there\u00a3ore largely middle-class. SNG also recognizes that the traits these families share are probably present in all fam- ilies to _some degr~e--but these f amilies carried these trends to extremes. Mr. Reilly noted he must generalize t..;e -Center's find- ings with generalizable. Drug-ubusing families in their popUlation often NEGATDITSTIC in these families tended to have a dull, d~adened, lifeless, shallow, affectless quality--as if each member were encapsulated and living alone in his own world. Family members communicated primarily negative messages (criti- cism, nagging, complaints, warnings, etc.) to each other, when they communicated at all. There was rarely any praise for good behavior--acceptable behavior w~s ignored while negative behavior was unfailingly reinforced with attention. All family members found it very hard to express any positive feelings (love, con- cern, tenderness) for each other. Children learned early that the best way to get attention was to cause trouble--Itthe squeaky wheel gets the oil\". Even if it n\\eant a beating, at least one could get some attention by \"being bad\". Such families seemed to thrive on crisis, to only \"come alive\" in disaster. Their members were highly ambivalent about intimacy--they were also terrified of emotional closeness. (B) LACK OF CONSISTENT LIMIT-SETTING--The parents in these families seemed incapable of setting consistent limits upon their children's behavior. often parents would disagree over whether or how to discipline the children, and behavior that would be rewarded or ignored one moment might be puni~hed the next. The children received very confused and mixed parental messages con- cerning right and wrong. (C) A ... CRY FOR HELP--Under such conditions, the children often desperately attempted to provoke their parents and other authority figures to impose firm and consistent limits and moral standards. -127 - Thus, youthful drug abusers from such families often uncon= sciously \"set themselves up\" to be caught by leaving \"clues\" and escalatiltg their disturbed and self-incriminatory behavior. Their drug abuse wa 1 s a most flaunted in an attempt to invoke adult attention, concern, and intervention. (D) MASSIVE PARENTAL DENIAL--Despite the many \"clues\" drug abusers often left for their parents, parents just as often some- how managed \"not to see\" the 1 cues, to deny the drug-abusing behavior until forced to face it by outside authorities or by near tragedy. (E) VICARIOUS PARENTAL BEHAVIOR--One reason that parents do not always intervene early and forcefully' 'h' ~n t e~r children's drug- abusing behavior is that often h t e parents, themselves have an un- ~ deviant behavior. Seme consci.ous invest,ment in their ch;ldren's seem to get vicarious gratification from their children's actions --in a sense, the children are .acting out the paren t.s' own un- conscious desires. Though such parents often overtly denounce \"youth's f new reedoms\" (sex, drugs, etc.), they often uncon- sciously envy them and . commun~cate this feeling to their chil':\" dren. The children are oft . en g~ven tacit permission to use drugs in one way or anoth3r. (F) DIFFICULTIES CONCERNING ANGER--Family members tend to see any open expression of feelings as dangerous--especially anger. In such families where love ~s 1 ~ rare y shown, people tend to feel very emotionally deprived and angry. Often, their hurt and rage are so great that they fear they will \"lose con- . ~~ \"go crazy\", or \"kill someone\". Because of this fear, the anger is often suppressed, \"driven underground\". Seeing himself as a \"potential murderer\", the young person in s\"ch a family often feels it is essential to inhibit all direct :; expression of anger towards his parents. Instead, the anger gains iJ expression in a delayed or indirect fashion-\u00ad J (1) through displacement, in which authority figures, siblings, or peers, inst~ad of the parents, are attacked; (2) through passive-aggressive behavior--as in drug abuse, when the youth turns to drpgs partially in an unconscious attempt to \" spite Ii the parents and take revenge upon them for their unkindnesses. Drug abuse is frequently a,thinly-disguised hos\u00ad tile-rebellious act--sometimes even symbolically murderous, judg\u00ad ing from the number of young people who remark, \"If my parl:mts ,knew I used drugs it would }::ill them\" i (3) through intropunitive behavior, in which the rage originally felt towards the parents is turned inward against the self. This is very cornmon in drug abusers and leads to a more or less chronically depressed state, a 10\\l7ered self-image, and a self-punitive and a self-defeating life-'style. Along with this intropunitive trend, there are frequently manifestations of \"accident-proneness\", suicidal ideation/srestures/attempts, \"masked\" suicides (as in many overdose death~3), and psychoso- matic illnesses. (G) DRUG USE AS \"SELF-MEDICATION\"--Members of these families regularly experience feelings of mutual alienation, -129 - loneliness, meaninglessness, rejection, abandonment, loss, de\u00ad privation, guilt, anxiety, rage, depression, and worthlessness. They often defend against these unpleasant affects via self- medication. Rarely is this defense confined only to the so- called \"drug abuser\" in the family--more usually, almost every family member relies heavily upon the compulsive ingestion of mood-altering substanc~S--from_legally-prescribed or countertop tranquilizers, sedatives, or stimulants to heavy alcohol con- sumption, smoking, coffee-drinking, or even overeating. Sub- stances are consumed to bolster fl ' agglng self-esteem and to help prevent the family members from feeling the anguish of emotional abandonment, separation, and loneliness. They serve as anaesthe\u00ad -tics, as tranquilizers, as antidepressants'. Th ey may also be used as disinhibitors-~in such cases, members feel they can only . break out of the stultifying atmosphere of the family when they ,. are \"high \"--only \\vhen they a \" t th 1 re no emse ves\", only when \"under the infl uence\", do th f 1 f ey ee ree to express real feelings, con- front real issues, and act t' 1 crea lve y and spontaneously. In these instances, drug use is a miscarried attempt to be \"real\", to feel human, if only momentarily and if only through artificial means. \"Getting high\" often means not' only a t emporary surcease from psychic pain, but also, in fantasy, a symbolic reunion with the loving, warn, caring \"good-mother\"--a rob l'k wo -1 \u20ac feeling of well- being markedly absent in the gnawing emptiness of everyday family life. 1\\ SQ$ -130 - (H) ,PATHOGENIC PARENTAL EXPECTATION--Parents of drug abusers frequently either expected too much of the drug-user, t of hl'm, or shifted back and forth between expected the wors unrealistically high expectations and extreme pessimism. In . '\" t' any case, the drug abuser was placed in a \"no-win sltua lon. In cases where the parents expected perfection, where love was conditioned upon success, the child would develop fear of failure!

THE FAMILIES OF DRUG ABUSERS--INTERGENERATIONAL DYNAM,ICS: The compulsive use of drugs (including alcohol) by a young person in a family generally indicates a disturbance not only in the youth himself, but also in his parents, their personal backgrounds, and their marriage, according to SNG. Generally, the parents of drug abusers seemed to be people in mourning. Usually one, or more commonly, both parents have sustained profound emotional losses within their families of origin--a father or mother has been lost via death, divorce, desertion, rejection, etc. Characteristically, the parents of the drug abuser have never adequately resolved their hurt, anger, or guilt over ~is loss. The shadow of their grief hovers over 'all their later relationships. When they marry, they often choose a mate whom they hope will somehow recreate both the good and the bad qualities of the mother or father they feel they have lost. This search for a \"replacement\" invariably leads to a disillusion- ment and to marital conflict. When children are born, they too are seen less as individuals in their own right and more as sub- stitutes for, or \"reincarnations\" of, the lost grandparents. By remaking first his spouse and then one or more of his chil- dren into images of his own lost mother or father, the parent need never fully experience the dreaded pain of separation, loss, and completed mourning. Unfortunately, relating to one's spouse or children as if they were really one's parents creates more problems than it solves. When children are thus \"parentified\" the real parents lose their authority and ability to set limits; , II $ rZA$' .. Wl.,usa -132 - they turn to their offspring for direction and as allies against the spouse. Relationships become hopelessly confused, genera\u00ad tional boundaries are blurred, and the family members tend to lose track of whex'e they begin and others ll.:!ave off. Mari tal conflict is ever-present, in such families but it is 'not always overt--i t is more often demied and masked by J \"behavior problems\" in the children. Actually, the \"children's - problems\" \"Le.g.-,-druy' abuse) are often reac:tive to the marital schism, and repxesent an attempt to \"save 't:he marriage\" by di-- verting parental attention from marriage--essen-tially, the children offer themselves as sacrificail scapegoats in this situation. Paren'ts who have never adequately mourned or accepted the loss of their own parents are usually unable to tolerate the loss of separation from their children. Anxiety about separation in such families is quite high and is clearly conveyed to the children from infancy onwards. Developing individuation and independence on the part of the children is generally discouraged, since individuation tends to be equated with separation, loss, and death. Thust despite the deceptive surface appearance of mutual isolation, e.Th,cc.\\psulation, and noninvolvement given by these families, the members are, beneath this facade, strongly bound to each other and enmeshed in \"sticky\" ambivalent ties ... It is precisely these central underlying conflicts around attachment and separation, loss and replacement, which operate to move children into the drug-abusing role. Whatever -133 - their conscious tt't d a ~ u es towards drugs, the parents of many drug abusers have a t very s rong unconscious investment in their children's becoming and remaining drug abusers. Often a family \"needs\" the young person to use drugs so that he ' wJ..ll better fit into an assigned family role as the \"blacksheep\" who reincarnates a lost one or who embodies a parent's own disowned impulses. other cases, his drug abuse serves the faml'ly 1 we 1 by assuring In tha this \"sickness\" will keep him indefinl'tely d ependent upon , his parents, thus assuaging both his own and his parents' separa- tion anxiety. As Ion h' d g as lS rug abuse serves to II!aintain the existing family balance, to maintain relationships as they are, or the recognition of loss--as long as the family system will have a powerful and to guard against loss -these conditions are met , unconscious commitment to maintainl'ng the t symp oms, regardless of conscious protests or declarations to the contrary. These families can \"live with\" drug-abusing behavior-\u00ad indeed, they may even subtly encourage it, as long as it helps to keep the family together, to prevent' d' 'd ln lVl uation, and to maintain everyone in his assigned role. It is only when the drug use in redefined as \" 1\" b a revo t y the young person, only when he uses it in an attempt to establl'sh hl'S own identity apart from his family, only when he uses it to break out of his traditional family role, that drug abuse is perceived as a true threat and an evil by such parents. In th f 'I' b h ese aml les, e avior which pro- mot!';s fusion is II d\" h . goo ,w ereas acts WhlCh threaten separation are \"bad\". II -134 - .. V. FAMILY THERAPY IN DRUG ABUSE: In cases of true drug (or alcohol) abuse--where a person regularly and compulsively uses drugs, as opposed to oc\u00ad casional or experimental use--staff at SNG believe that psy\u00ad chotherapy should always be an option for the user. And in those cases where the user is either living with, or intimately J involved in a family unit on a more or less continuous basis, they would advocate family therapy as very often the treatment of choice. They find that outpatient family therapy, especially '\" with younger adolescents and those on \"soft\" drugs, can be very helpful--indeed, it is often superior to individual and peer\u00ad group counseling. And even for those \"into\" harder drugs and those already placed in residential treatment facilities, regu\u00ad larly scheduled family sessions can be invaluable, not only in helping the drug abuser to learn to cope with the family stresses which may have motivated his drug use, but also in assisting the family to improve its functioning as a whole. This is especially importa.nt if the discharg'e plan involves the drug abuser's re\u00ad turn to his family f ~lr. Reilly testified. Family therapy can b~ effective used either alone or concurrently with other treatment modalities such as group or individual counseling, or methadone maintenance. In conjoint family therapy, a trained family counselor meets with the dr~g abuser and all the members of his immediate household in regularly scheduled sessions--usually held once or twice weekly, and lasting at least an hour each. ,!!,'~i, ___ ------------~-~~~~= ... =~=,~~.,. -135 - In multiple family therapy, three or more drug abusers and their respective families meet together with one or more family counselors on a similar scheduled basis--common problems and situations are shared and solutions are suggested. The families which may not have been able to help themselves in the past, gradually become able to help each other. The experience of SNG indicates, Mr. Reilly believes, that once we redefine lithe problem\" as the family and the way it relates, once we identify it as interpersonal rather than solely a \"personal\" problem of the drug abuser alone, then we have opened the way to sign~ficant changes in the entire family. Therapy can be quite successful in helping families ,to alter unhealthy patterns of relating. Families can be taught, for example, how to \"accentuate the positive\" rather than the negative aspects of relationships; parents can be helped to set consistent limits and family members can be trained to listen to each other's feel- _ e p ; paren scan e helped ings and hear each other's \"cri,es for hI\" t b to complete th~ir mourning for the loved ones they have lost, thus finally laying to rest the ghosts which seem to haunt these families. As treatment assists family members to see each other as real individuals with the right to express real feelings, the family's need for a chemical crutch diminishes. In cases involving younger drug abusers, even short-term family therapy, time-limited at 15 sessions, can so alter the family balance that compulsive drug use may disappear completely as a symptom. , 'I L -136 - This center finds family therapy to be highly practical, hoth in its economy and in its preventative value. It is eco- nomical because it allows them to treat several people at once, and it is preventative in that it not only ameliorates the drug abuser's social environment so as to forestall relapse, but it also assists the entire family to reach a higher level of adjust\u00ad J ment--thus helping'to prevent future breakdown on 'the part of any other family members. In discussing the professional problems associating with family therapy, Mr. Reilly testified as follows: \"Mr. Dennis Reilly: I think that basically, in the past, a lot of times all of us h~ve been looking for the one true cause of drug abuse, or the one best treatment for ,drug abuse, and the fact is that we are learning that there is no one cause, and on one treatment. We are realizing that a treatment must include a broad gamut of activity ranging from changing the laws and society, to changing the individual drug abuser, and the social environment. \"In the past a lot of drug treatment programs kind of stressed the use of encounter groups, and methadone maintenance, and the therapeutic community. They have achieved some success with these approaches, but other forms of treatment have been '~ under-utilized and one such form, I think, is, the family therapy .. \u00b7 \"1 i \"What other drug programs have often done they have accepted the myth that the kid using drugs is the only one in the family that needs help, and he is the problem and the client, and ) ~ 'I 1I * ~ -137 - the patient, and the family is sometimes ' d 19nore .... \"Mr. Hollenberg: Are there any ideas that you might have for attracting more famil1'es as a group? \"Mr. Reilly: Well, what we have often done is said to the parents that the best way we have of treating, or of helping your son or daughter is for you all ' to come in because that problem seems to be affecting 11 f ' a 0 you In the family and not just him. It is bothering you just like it is bothering him and that is our hook to get them in. \"Sometimes we said that we can't really successfully treat their chiid unless they participate and unless they come in.

It' h d 1S ar a,nd the skill is in trying to get them' d k 1n an eep them in, and it is not easy, and we are not always successfulll, Reinventing Extended Families While the above described family therapy is a treatment modality which this Commission is convinced should be more widely practised, what of those one-parent families who are isolated in homes to which they have recently moved, or who find themselves forced to move so frequently that 1'\u00a3 b 1 e ecomes rootless? Some concrete underpinnings need to be offered to them, either instead II -138 - of, or along with, or before family therapy. Eighty-four percent of children from single-parent families live in a home in which it is the mother who is the head-of-household. In the last 13 years (1960-1973), these woman-headed single parent families increased from 1.9 million to 3. 8 million. In the past three years alone the number of such families with children under 18 increased by thirty percent.* More than half the children in these families live below the pov- erty line. A number of experimental programs, often of a self- help nature( are intended to provide the family, and therefore ind.irectly the children, with the kind of back up support tra\u00ad di tionally available from members of the e'xtended family--grand- parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings. These have been dis- cussed extensively in prior reports of this Commission and of its antecedent legislative committees. Many of these were discontinued, as volunteers tired. These programs of~er aid in emergencies, staying with the children if the parent needs to be hospitalized; babysitting while the parent markets; offering comfort and companionship to lonely adults who carry the load of constant care for their small children. It is possible to expand the services of centers to include a great deal for the *Whaley, Betti S., Commissioner, A Public Service Employment program For Women, informational paper issued by the Agenciy for Child Development, Ne't'l York City Human Resources Administ:ration i I I I Ii 11 i.\\ I~ -139 - working parent. To work hard all day and then pick up one's child, cook dinner, bathe the b b a y, wash the clothes, iron a shirt for school can be disspiriting when one is always alone. Community centers, or even h h c urc es and parish halls could offer to such a parent the t' op lon to pick up a ready-cooked dinner at cost , or to share a communal kitchen or laundry room, so that the parent can work with company while the child, perhaps, does homework with supervision. City living, with its frequent isolation and mobility, requires such services. The in- formal avenues ~f cooperation and mutual aid are often excellent in the inner city. S ' ometlmes, however, as was the case with Walter Va~dermeer's godmother, cramped quarters, a shortage of beds, lack of money make it impossible for\u00b7 even willing neighbors to help each other and each other's children. RECOMMENDATIONS ... the Family This Commission f,inds that at t;mes Court is used as a f' t . lrs resource rather than a last resort; and that the Court process t bl' h d es a lS e for the purpose of strength- ening families, yields the opposite result. Services are rarely offered to a family prior to the decision to place a child away, which should be a last decision when all else has alrrost never offered to a family while a child failed. Services are is in placement, so upon his return the family will be stronger. This Commission finds that children t f' , mus lt lnto categories, that resources are not used creatively and imaginatively to fit the child, that re-that I j '', ___ ....... -----e!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~.!I!!!!-!I!!!!\",!!II; ~ ____ --- . , I It. -'140 - lationships within the family and the neighborhood which might sustain a child are not utilized. Even more--they are often broken. This Commission finds that in the absence of a real effol:'t to shore up families, funds spent on treatment of child ~rug abusers are often wasted. Therefore, this Commxssion recommends: 1. Funding for research and pilot programs exploring the use of family counseling, including family therapy. Guide\u00ad lines, should encou:r::age the inclusion of family counseling services in drug programs, or in a nearby community facility worRing co- operatively with the drug program. 2. A training program in familY,counseling and family therapy skills for both professionals and paraprofessionals in the drug abuse field. 3. The encouragement of family therapy and family counseling in present neighborhood based facilities, public and private, such as community mental health centers, other Health Maintenance Organizations, community centers, churches. Such services can be publicized through P.T.A.'s, neighborhood associations, narcotic guidance counqils. 4. Families should be kept together. We recommend: , . a. That placement should be viewed as a last resort. Placement 'should be'viewed as a temporary condition, with the ex- pectation acknowledged that eventually the child will return to his family and the family should be prepared to cope with him -141 - constructively. b. The provision of concrete services to strengthen the families of children'in trouble, those using drugs and those expressing their troubles in other ways. c. Imaginative and creative planning by sociaQ ser\u00ad vice professionals, to use the assets available to a child, such as relatives and neighbors who care about him. d. Neighborhood based service centers of various kinds do exist. Their, work should be coordinated, so that cooperative- ly in the a,ggregate they offer a comprehensive range of services. ,e. Coordinating programs which service the senior citi\u00ad l~ens ,wi th those which service fami.Lies. A major problem with senior citizens is their sense of valuelessness and loss of self esteem when they retire or when their children are all grown. Children and young parents in the inner city suffer from the ab\u00ad sence of grandparents, aunts and uncles. If the two groups can come together, both gain. 5. When Placement is necessary: a. There should be flexibility in the use of resources, including placement resources, so that each child's plan is tailored to his needs, not the agency's. b. When placement of more than one child in a family is necessary, the siblings should be placed together. 6. Acceptance of responsibility for a child by one agency, and when possible one social worker, on a con,tinuing long F\",<\u00b7~- ... ! , 'I tr -142 - term basis, no matter where that child is living, until he or she has been launched on a life-program whic!h is satisfying to him and to society. The model for this assumption of con\u00ad tinuing responsibility exists in jurisprudence. A Judge can assume continuing responsibility for a case, and that case will then return to that Judge for review and supervision at any time in the future. It is high time ,that the social work profession recognized how essential it is to the well-being of a child that there be one helping adult to whom he can turn whatever vicissi- tudes of life assail him. There is nothing in law or guidelines preventing the assumption of such responsibility for each child. , . In point of fact, in many cases, as in Walter Vandermeer s, prlme responsibili ty for the family does rest with onf; agency, the Department of Social Services, from the child's birth to maturity. That department even in some cases has statutory responsibility to supervise the services offered that child by other agencies, because it must approve reimbursement to such agencies. What is missing is the personal responsibility of a single worker supervising, in substance, not form--a worker who knows the child. 1 I -143- 11 VII. Obituary of a Heroin Addict I j i) Who Died at 12 REPRINTED FROM: THE NEW YORK TIMES, JANUARY 12, 1970 Waller Vandermeer -the youngest person ever to be reported dead of an overdose of heroin here -had been identified by many of the city's leading Social Service Agencies as a child in desperate need of care, long before his body was discovered in the common bathroom of a Harlem tenement on Dec. 14, two weeks after his twelfth birthday. For most of these Agencies, he never hecame mOre than one case among thousand~ passing through their-\u00ad revolving doors. Others tried to fit him into their pro\u00ad grams, but lacked the manpower 01' resources to focus on him effectively. Eventually he -ivould be shunted off to yet another institution. It was not heartlessness or malfeasance that explain why he usually went unnoticed, just overwhelming num\u00ad bers. As one school official expressed, \"There are thOll' sands of Walter Vandermeers out there.\" Along the way his case was handled hy Family l Court, the Society for the Preventi'on of Cruelty to Chilo dren, the Department of Social Services and its Bureau of Child Welfare, the Board of Education's Bureau of At\u00ad tendance and the Bureau for the Education of Socially Maladjusted Children, the Wiltwick School for Boys and the Office of Probation. Most of these agencies refused to discuss their ac\u00ad f tions in the case on the ground that their relationship with the boy was confidential. I\u00b7 But, interviews with neighbors, relatives and in. dividuals in the schools and ageneies through which he :, :,assleddthhavel made it P~sSibhl~ to finhd a foothfoldl1in a o'or at a. ways seemed to 1m on t e verge 0 co apse. The agencies had exhausted their routine proced. ures, before he died; only his file continued to move. For his last 14 months he was left to himself, with no con. sistent supervision or counseling of any kind, on the decaying block whel'e he lived most of his life and died ~ -1l7th Street between Eighth and Manhattan Avenues. I' Thel'e he was in intimate daily contact with addicts and pushers, as if none of the overstrained agencies had ( heard of him, or even existed. After his death, one of . the junkies paid him this discerning tribute: \"Walter lived to be 30 in 12 years. There was nothing about the street he didn't know\"\" l Cupcakes and Coca.Cola In those months he slept at home only sporadically and attended school for a total of two \\lnd a half days. Walter would be out latc at night hawking newspa\u00ad pers in bars or begging for coins at the corner of Eighth Avenue. In the daytime, when most children were in school, he would station himself near a radiator in a grocery store for warmth until chased or borrow a couch to catch up on the sleep he had missed. His diet was made up of Yankee Doodle cupcakes, Coca-Cola and, when he had the change, fish and chips. It was a life of frightening emptiness and real dan. gers. The only regular thing about it was a daily struggle for survival. \"Walter didn't do too had,\" a junkie on the block remarked after he was dead. \"He didn't do too good,\" retorted a black youth, full of bitterness over what hel'oin has done to Harlem. \"He won't see his 13th birthday\". \"He didn't do too bad,\" the junkie repeated. \"He looked after himself\". A Family Court judge, charged with the responsi\u00ad bility of saving such youths but lacking in most cases the means to do !l0, despairingly reflected: \"At least we knew ahout this one. There are many we haven't even counted yet. That horrible feeling just drives me crazy in the middle of the night.\" The one thing the court and the various agencies to which it referred his case never knew -but might have suspected had they checked more closely into the cir\u00ad tumstances of Walter's life -was that he was experi\u00ad menting with drugs. But even this prohably would not have mattered, for no treament centers have yet been authorized here for narcotics users uIlder the age of 16, although youths un\u00ad der 16 are dying in this cilY of heroin overdoses at the rate of one a week. Anger and Fear Two sides of Walter Vandermeer are remembered 011 his block. -14 ~- One \\\\'as the apprentice hustler, an angry, mistrust\u00ad ful youth given to violent rages in which he hurled bot\u00ad tles and flayell about with iron pipes. The otiter was the small ehild who cried easily and searched continually (or adult protection and warmth. Some of the older addicts, into whose orbit he gravi\u00ad tated in the last months of his life say he would some\u00ad times call them \"Mommy\" or \"Daddy\" and fantasy a household into which he could move as their child. \"Walter wanted a lot of aUention,\" said his oldest sister, Regina Price. And there were those in his family and neighborhood who tried to extend it, when they could. Given the stress of their lives, that was only now and then and never for long. Survival on 117th Street is a hard proposition at best, and Walter's circumstances were already far frord the hest when hc W/iS horn Deccmber 1,1957. His mother, Mrs. Lillian Price, had come to New York from Charl~ton, S. C., with hcr husband, Cyril, in 1947, when she w~s 22. Her schooling had never got beyond the third grade and she was on welfare within a year. (21 years later, .she is still there). In 1949 Mrs. Price had her first children -twins\u00ad and her husband moved o~t. By 1957 she was, in s\"dal-work jargon, the nomi\u00ad Ill'll head of a growing, deBp~rately disorganized \"mul\u00ad tiproblem\" family., Walter was her sixth child; there hnd been four fathern. Five more children (one of whom died in infancy) were to be born in l~c nelCl seven years to Mrs; Price l]nd a Liberian immigran~ named Sunday 1'ogbah. ' Father Deported Walter's father, known variously as Robert or Wil\u00ad lie Vanderineer, entered the country illegally from Suri. nam, having jumped ship here in 19\u00b71.7. Six months after Walter was horn, he was found by immigration authori\u00ad ties while hc was working as a counterman at a mid. town pharmacy and deported. But hy then, it appears, Mr. Vandermeer and Mrs. Price had separated, for hardly six. months after he left lhe country she gave birth to the first of six chil~ren she was to have with Mr. Togbah. Only one other Vandermeer was left in the family, a brother, Anthony, three years older than Walter. In those days, Mrs. Price ancl six of her children were squeezed into one room of a Ihree room apartment at 305 West 117th Street lhey somehow shared with a cou\u00ad ple with two children .. of their own. (Another of Mrs. Price's children, a daughter named Bcverly, was heing raised hy a fritmd.) According to the recollection of neighbors, Walter was sniffing airplane glue by the time he was 6 and sit\u00ad ting III on card games On the sloops when he was 8.

Aggression Flar~ Out Public School 76 on West 12lst Street gave up on him in early 1967, when he WlIB in the third grade, soon after his ninth hirthday. Walter had been out ot school more days than not that year, When he WlIB there he seemed locked in an aggressive pattern, roaming the haUs and throwing punch~ at teachers who sought to restrain him. Sometimes his \\'ioience eouid be seen as a B~ifled cry for attention and help. On one occasion he stormed oul of an art class, only to fly into a rage hi:cause his teacher had not pursued him. Walter was repeatedly warned to behave better, then suspended ,on March 2, 1%7. It does not appear that the school ever attempted to arrange psychological consulta. tions for him or his mother with the Board of Educa\u00b7 tion's Bureau of Child Guidance. After Waller's death, Assemblyman Hulan E. JaCK was tn charge that the school had \"put the child oul onto ,the slreet\". In fact, it did just the opposite by referring hi. case to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil\u00b7 dren, whicb thtm brought it up in Family Court on a ne\u00ad glect petition.' However, had the Assemblyman's charge heen correcl, the result could hardly have heen worse. Placed in Queens Shelter On March 14, both Waltcr and his hrother Tony, the two Vandermeers, were placed in Ihe Society's Chil\u00b7 dren Shelter in Queens. Later they were shifted from there to the Children's Center at Fifth Avenue and l04th Street, which is run by the Department of Social Services for children neglected by their families. An attendance teacher, as truant officers are now called, had singled out the older hoy as a youth ot un\u00b7 usual intelligence and promise. Six months later, Tony was assigned to a home operated by a private agency in Yonkers, where he had fiiade what is regarded as a highly successful adjustment. But Walter got lost in the judirial maze. While one branch of Family Court found Mrs. Prh'e unable to care for Tony, another decided in August to release Walter\u00ad Ihe younger and more disturbed of the two hays -to her care. Releasing Walter to Mrs. Price was tantamount to releasing him to the street (by now the family had shifted to a lop-floor apartment at 2124 Eighth Avenue, near 1151h Street.) The court expected Walter to go to Public School If Strunded, Walter at 10 was reaching for his own ) solutions. I~ One involved Mrs. Barbara Banks, who had re\u00ad ijgarded him as a godchild ever since she accompanied I; Mrs. Price to the hospital at the time of his hirth. Around , Christmas, 1967, she said, she told Walter he could move in with her and three of her children, since her eldest I ~ soa was goiug into the Army. I; \"A whole lot of people told mc 'Ain't no hope for I ;i. ,Ihut hoy,''' she said. \"But I believed I could save him. i He was so inquisitive, he could have been anything\". 11 Although Walter eagerly seized the invitatioll, she Ii said, she Was soon forced to withdraw it, for her son was never inducted. Walter felt rejected. Lute one night he made that clear in his OWIl way by hurling a bottle through Mrs. Bank's window, rain\u00ad ing glass on her bed. The boy spent most of his time on the streets until It April, 1068, when the Family Court assigned him to the II Willwyck School for Boys, a treatment center for dis. I ~ turbed youths from the slums that had hasked in the I: patronage of Mrs. Eleanor Roose.velt and boasted such j I .... ' aiunllli as Floyd Patterson, the boxer, and Claude I Brown, the author of I<MallchiJd in the Promised Land\". I\u00b7 I The idea was to place Walter at the school's main <I center at Yorktown Heights in Westchester County, but the center was full alld cutting down on its staff hecause of a budget crisis. As a temporary alternative --to get Walter off the streets-he w~s put in Patterson House, at 208 East 18th Street, a \"llaHway house\" run by the j school for youths returning to their communities from the main center. I ~ I ~ Put on Tranquilizers Dr. Howard A. Weiner, a psychiatrist who was then in charge of Pattel:son House, rememhers W~lter was turbed as any kid we had.\" Like many maladjusted children from the poorest, nlosl disorganized families,. he would erupt into towering ,rages when he felt himself under pressure and he had to be held until he regained control. Usually that took at least an hour, so it was decided to give him 50 milli. grams of the tranquilizer Thorazene four times a day. At first, Walter showed his suspicions about his new surroundings by taking food from the table in a napkin and hiding it under his bed. Gradually, when he discov-145 - crcd that his stockpiles 1\\ ere left alone, he stopped hoarding. After his waril1ess subsided, he permitted himself to draw close to his childcare (;01l115elo)', John Schoonback, a recent graduate of the University of Michigan. Learn. ing that they both had Dutc.h names, Walter eagerly pro\u00ad claimed that they were \"soul brothers.\" 'Great Little Kid' Mr. Schoonbeck, who now is on the staff of Time Magazine, says Walter was \"a gr~at little\u00b7 kid\". Dr. Weiner credits him with giving Walter the warm, reli\u00ad able affection he had rarely found in an adult. Encouraged by his counselor, Walter finally put in an appearance at P.S. 14.8. In fact, in'May he. went there regularly --his first stretch of steady school att.endance in more than a year and the last in his life. Flora Boyd, a teacher at the school, says Walter had never learned to read heyond the first grade level but thought he could catch up. \"He wns all intelligent little boy,\" she recalls. \"Of coursej he had a lot of prob\u00ad lems. But he could learn.\" Finally a place opened for him at Wi1twyck's pas\u00ad toral upstate campus, and on June 20, Mr. Schoonbeck accompanied him to Yorktown Heights __ the fifth sepa\u00ad rate institutional setting in which he had been lodged in 1'5 months. Walter felt that. he had been betrayed and trapped. He had never heen told that his stay at Patterson House would be temporary. It was a repetition of his experi\u00ad ence with Mrs. Banks and, predictably, he flew into a fit of anger on his first afternoon at the school. Wiltwyck's troubles, meantime, had gone from bad to worse. In May, a third of its staff had been sus\u00ad pended after protesting that students were receiving in\u00ad adequate clothing and \u00a3ood in the wake of the economy drive. They also charged that there hnd been instances of hrutality. In the next two months Walter ran away at least four times. As justification, he told his family he had been beaten at the schoo!. Wiltwyck concluded that it could not hold Walter without his mother's cooperation, and that this was unavailable. Back in Family Court On October 10, 19GB, WilLwyck turned Walter back to Family Court, which meant he was wherc he had heen more than a year earlier, only more frustrated and \"street-wise\" . His involvement with il1stitut.io~ls was llOW nearly ended. It look warrunts to bring him ancI his mother to ('ourt so that he could be ordered to go to school, or to Harlem Hospital for psychiatric coullseling, or to one of I Taryou.Act's \"self.help tenms\". (;ollJ'1 \\\\(lIJ1d sim},ly hand down another. Asked why the court had not placed him in a state inSlitution -a training school or mental hospital- in order to take him off thel;treet, a judge replied that Wal\u00ad ler, who was too disturbed for Wiltwyck, did not seem disturbed enough. In fact, the probation officer assigned to the case recommended last spring that he he detained in a train\u00ad ing school. fiut Walter's sister Regina insisted that her mOlher oppose the recommendation in court. In the back of her mind were :recollections of the state institutions in which she was placed after she became pregnant at Ihe age of 12. Question of Survival J She knew that a youth in detention had to \"stay by himself\" to survive, she said, for there were &Iways homo- \" h\" d\" sexual fellow inmates threatenmg to mess up ns mID _ Ren'ina wanted Walter. to receive care, but she thought I:> d \". .. h'\" d the probation officer only wante to cnllclze 1m an \"lock him up\". In her view, state institutions were no less dangerous than the streets. The Director of Probation, John A. Wallace, agreed that a state t~aining school probably would not have been an ideal setting for the hoy, but as a practical matter, he said, it was the court's last option. The judge, however, honored the mother's objection. . Theoretically, the welfare casqworker assigned to Mrs. Price should have kept tabs on Walter. But welfare case\u00ad workers in Harlem are responsible for 70 to 80 cases, a population of 200 or more. Mrs. Price's caseworker never entered her !:Ie. ~'s life. On his own, Walter continued to search out adults he felt he could trust. In November, he went down to East Sixth Street to call on John Schoonbeck, who had quit Patterson House in discouragement and was packing for a trip to Africa. Walter asked plaintively if he could come along. Forays With Gang On the hlock he had a half\u00b7dozen households where he dropped in regularly at unpredictable hours to c~~ge food, coins, an undemanding hour in front of a teleVISion set. One addict said Walter tagged along after a gang that called itself Bonnie and the Seven Clydes. The gang spe\u00ad cialized in auto thefts and shoplifting, and he accompanied ;1 on ~evernl forays do.wntown. 110 1111'0 learned up, it was said, with some older youths who conducted raids into Morningside Heights and learned ta snatch purses. On at least one occasion he was said to have \"taken oJItI -that is, robbed - a drunk, although Walter never did auain 5 feet in height. According to Regina, 'he bought most of his OWIl food and clothes and sometimes had as much as S50 in his pockets. But. it is doubtful that he had any r6o\"1l1ar income as a drug courier, as has been alleged, for he c~ntinued uritii l~is las! days to hustle for small cbange, selling newspapers and delivering groceries. In his last month, Walter's already disastrous falllJ' ily situation deteriorated sharply. Last summer, Mrs. Price was living most of the time on 117th Street, although her younger children were still in the apartment on Eighth Avenue. Walter stayed on the hlock too, although not with her, sometimes sleep- ing on a fire escape above a warehouse. \" When his mother saw him, she would shuut, Go home!\" Walter would shout b,.wk, \"Go home yoursel\u00a3!tI Sometimes, neighbors Sf.iY, she would call the police on her son. Turning to Narcotics In November, the. whole family was evicted from the Eighth Avenue I',partment because Mrs. Price had not paid the $73_10 monthly renl for seven months out of her 8412 a month welfare check. She said she was holding the money in escrow be. cause the toilet hadn't worked for a year and a half, but never got to Rent Court to explain. this to the judge, perhaps because she no longer had the money. Tony Vandermeer became distraught when he heard the news and got permission to come down from Yonk~r8 for a da.y. It was not only the eviction that alarmed him -word had also reached bim that Walter had started to take drugs. The chances arc negligible thllt any child on 117th Street could retain much innocence about narcotics, for the block is wide open to the traffic. Everyone knows the addicts and their pushers and what stairways and landin .... s are best avoided at what times. I:> b W niter's brother Reggie bad long een usmg nar\u00b7 cotics. Sometimes he would show bis \"works\" -the eye\u00ad dropper, needle, cord and bottle cap that are the tools of tIJe addict's vocation -to his younger brothers. Addict Recalls Him Interviewed briefly after Walter's death, when ho was brought to the funeral home from Rikers Island, Reg. gie said he knew who had first given drugs to his brother and named a 17 year old addict on 117th Street, who shall he called Theresa here.. . When she was visited the next day, Theresa was 81t\u00b7 ting next to a stove with all its burners on, the only warm corner in an apartment that had been without heat all winter. She readily acknowledged that she had been on drugs for two years, had been close to Walter and had known him to be using them. AltllOughshe dCllied e\\'e1' having given him any her\u00ad self, Theresa said she had often seen him \"skin\" (inject the drug beneath the surface of his skin) but had never kllown him to \"main\" (inject it rlit\u00b7ectly into a vein.) Usually, she said, he skinned at thl:: top of the stairs at 303 West 117th Street or in an apartment next door at 301 shared by two of her fellol,-addicts. At 301, the two addicts -call them Mary Lou and Lizzie -also denied ever having sold or given drugs to Walter, but lUary Lou sl1id he would often ask for them. She said that she had seen him \"snort\" (inhale heroin) alld that she had occa5ionally allowed him to watch while she \"mained.\" Sometimes she would think of Waller as a \"little man.\" Lizzie said. At other times she would see him as an abandoned child and haul him to the bathroom and scrub him in t.he tub. Treated like a child, he would behave like one, she said. The two addicts said they. foulld it hard to imagine his locking himself in the bathroom across the street to \"shoot up\" by himself. \"Walter was scared of the needle,\" J...iz?ie said, laughing indulgently as one might in recalling a baby's first steps. \"He'd ahi'ays say, 'Wait. Don't hurt me. Let me gel myself together. Please wait!' \" Brother's Anger Erupts After the funeral, Tony Vandermeer rushed U,;;~je, overturning a floral wreath and shouting, \"You killed my hrother!'~ He had heard stories on the block that Lizzie and Theresa had dragged his brother's body on the morning of December 14. from 301 and across .the street to 310, where it was found. Lizzie acknowledged that she had a loud argument with Walter the night before he died over $9 -the change left from $25 he had given her to buy him some clothes -but \u00b7insisted she had not seen him after that .. \"Tony really didn't know me at all,\" she said. \"He just had nobody else to blame.\" Another addict -known here as Sugar -\u00b7moved off the block as soon as the body was found. Walter had been especially close to him since the summer, it was said, and sometimes called him \"Daddy.\" A lanky, good.looking youth who now worked at two jobs to keep up with the \"lones's\" {his habit} Sugar still returns to the block late at night to make his connections. The other night at about 12:30 a.m. he came am- 1 hling into Mary Lou's apartment on the heels of two \\ pushers -one wearing a leather tunic, with the other Olle dOlle out in a frilly shirt with lace cuffs like an 18th century gentl,eman. After an intc'rlude in a bathroom, Sugar appeared rolling down his s1i:eve and adjusting his cuff link. Be-147 -. hind his dark glasses his eyelids were drooping. His only response to a (Iuestion about Walter was a perfunc\u00ad tory expression of \"shock\" over his death. \"But something had to happen,\" Sugar drawled sleepily. \"He was always hanging around.\" Dr. Michael Baden, an assistant medical examiner, who examined the body at the scene, said it looked to him like \"a typical overdose case.\" But he cautioned that his office never classified narcotics overdoses as hom\u00ad icides, suicides or accidents, for medical evidence on this point is invariably moot. Curiously, chemical tests failed to reveal any trace of heroin in the eydropper found next to Walter in the sink - a hint, by no means conclusive, that it might have been planted. ' The autopsy proved that Walter had been using drugs for at least three months -possibly longer _ but the absence of any track marks on his arms indicated he had probably yet to become a full-fledged addict. He had also yet to give up on himself. About a month before he died, Walter received a new pair of shoes from Mrs. Carletha Morrison, one of the women on the block whom he would allow to mother him. He said he would save them for going back to school. A School Drop.ln According to both Regina and Mrs. Morrison, he seemed to' think he could not go to school until his mother took him to' court. No one seemed to realize that he was still enrolled at P.S. 148, where he had appeared only three times the previous year. When the school reminded the Bureau of Attend\u00ad ance of his truancy, it was told to stop sending in re\u00ad ports on [ne Dlly because Family Court had his case \"un. der advisement\" - a bureaucratic formula that seemed to have no specific application. Occasionally last fall, Walter would drop into the class of his younger brothel' \"Doe\" at P.S. 76 and would be allowed by the teacher to stay. He even asked his brother to teach him reading. \"I gave him my book, and any words he didn't know I told him,\" said \"Doc,\" who is II. He was also looking forward to Christmas. Regina had promised to buy him a pair of expensive alligator shoes and a hlue pullover. In addition, she said she would lrr-at him to icc skating in Central Park and a movie downtown, probably \"The Ten Commandments.\" Everyone noticed a macabre touch in a legend stamped on the cheap \"Snoopy\" sweatshirt Waller was wearing when he died. \"I wish I could bite somebody,\" it said. \"I need to relieve my inner tensions.\" \"When I heard that I broke down,\" Regina said. \"T11at was him. That was the way he felt.\" . , , ; -148 - CHAPTER V THE DRUG ABUSE CONTROL COMMISSJ:ON --A REAPPRAISAL In 1966, the Legislature and the Governor offered a program to divest the Mental Hygiene Department of primary J responsibility for dealing with problems of drug abuse and to establish, as an almost autonomous agency within that Depart\u00ad ment, the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission. (Because of amendments to the laws affecting N.A.C.C. in 1973, which changed the scope of its authority as well as its name to the Drug Abuse \" the agency w;11 hereinafter be referred to Control Comm~ss~on, as D.A.C.C.) The original purpose of D.A.C.C. was conceptualized d (2)\" 'n II getting most addicts off the streets; an cur~ g as: (1) their addiction.* Once the State's goal had been redefined as reintegration of rehabilitated addicts into society (How People Overseas Deal with Drugs, Commission Report, Legislative Docu\u00ad ment NO. 11, 1973), the conflict between quarantine and cure be- came apparent. The role played by D.A.C.C. has been twofold: (I) to fund local agencies for the purpose of providing treatment and rehabilition to addicts; and (2) to operate facilities for the civil comnit:ment of addicts (and now certain other drug abusers) as , f drug abusers from the community and well as the divers~on 0 *See \"Acquisition & Construction of Drug Abuse Treatme~t Facili-:\u00adties,\" Program Audit, Legislative Commission on Expend~ture Rev~eW, January 18, 1974. -149 - standard criminal justice and correctional systems into D.A.C.C. facilities. In terms of its own treatment program, a total of twenty\u00ad five facilities were acquired by D.A.C.C. or constructed by the Facilities Development Corporation at a total cost of $124.9 mil\u00ad lion by April 1, 1973. Of these, twenty-three were for 'treatment, rehabilitation, or aftercare purposes and two provided supportive services. Seven treatment facilities were closed as a result of program changes and budget cutbacks in 1971, leaving eighteen of the original facilities still in the program. Twenty-five of the total number of construction pro- jects were renovations and only seven were new construction, al- though the new projects constituted approximately forty-two per\u00ad cent of the total construction costs. Despite cOlnmunity antago\u00ad nisms, D.A.C.C. had enunciatetl a policy of attempting to locate its centers near the patients to be served. Prior to 1971, more than two-thirds of the treatment capacity was located in the New York City metropolitan area, and after 1971, nearly eighty-five percent of the programs were located in New York City. Community opposition had resulted in the location of certain programs in commercial areas. For example, one D.A.C.C. facility for women, visited by our own Commission statf, is located at the far western end of forty-first street, across from the now defunct west Side Airlines Terminal Building. Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk were often cited as examples of areas in which multi-modality aftercare centers were missing, although an excellent center for patients was,estab-4, -150 - lished in the highly drug-abuse prone area of the Southeast Bronx. '1'he building program began with an estimated D.A.C.C. intake of approximately seven thousand 'five hundred heroin addicts. Actual intake for the first fiscal year was three thousand six hundred forty-five. Nevertheless, a shortage of slots occurred, which forced the closing of int.ake for six months for nearly half of all those eligible. Bet~een 1968, when intake was reopened, J and 1971, D.A.C.C. was able to meet its statutory oblig~tions to accept heroin addicts. Unfortunately, its success rate was not what had been promised, because of the speed with which the program had to be implemented and the requirement of a non-select.ive admissions policy. D.A.C.C. 's operating budget request was cut by one-fourth in 1971, as part of a total economy drive, but also with a view toward reorganizing its operation. Once again, D.A.C.C. closed its intake until cnanges were made, phasing out seven of the twenty-three treatment facil- ities (mostly outside of New York City), canceling all contract facilities, and converting most of its remaining residential centers to include outpatient services. As a result of the changes, bed capacity dropped by about one-half, but outpatient capacity slightly more than doubled. The total rated capacity increased by approximately two thousand to a total of some thirteen thousand seven hundred. The total utilization of D.A.C.C. facilities remained at a reported seventy percent. This figure has remained fairly stable, even at times dipping way bolow seventy percent at certain facilities, despite the increased drug penalties effective 22 . -151 - September 1, 1973, althpugh it is difficult to assess the deterrent effect of the penalty structure on heroin abuse. When Governor Rockefeller issued his pronouncement in January of 1973 that \"Ne have achieved very little permanent rehabilitation and have found no cure\", many observers suggested that he was reflecting the situation of the Drug Abuse Control Commission, and even at that, only D.A.C.C~'s role as a primary provider of treatment services, rather than its more important role as a funding agency. The picture presented to the Governor by D.A.C.C. as a treatment agency, was as follows: 1. Over seven thousand of the twenty four thousand persons committed to its care had absconded without a trace. 2. Civil commitments, apart from diversions from the criminal justice system, which were high at the outset, had diminished.* 3. D.A.C.C.'s success rate was not what had been promised, for reasons previously discussed. 4. D.A.C.C. was often unable to house thousands of addicts who might have been eligible for treatment. This *See Fourteenth Annual Report of the Temporary State Commission of Investigation, Legislative Document No. 92, April=r972, pp. 268-282 passim. -152 - problem resulted in disillusionment with many aspects of the state's drug program. ACCOUNTABILITY Despite the fact that many problems have developed j in D.A.C.C.'s operation, since 1967, there has never been a full accounting of and justification for D.A.C.C.'s operating expenditures. This is true despite the partial audit of capital construction expenditures in 1973 and despite the fact that beyond its current state appropriations, amounting to over one hundred million dollars per year, D.A.C.C.' has been named, by law, as the designated state disbursment agency for additional millions of dollars of federal funds. In 1974, the Legislative Commission on Expenditure Review performed an audit on D.A.C.C.'s capita! expenditures. Although the audit made no explicit recommendations, taken as a whole, the report implied, with accompanying specific reasoning , J and case stUdies, that D.A.C.C. would be wise to end its con- :j :{ '; struction and renovation projects, and to tUrn over any unfulfilled \\ treatment responsibilities to funded agencies. The auditors also reported that of thirty-one million dollars in federal aid re\u00ad ceived by D.A.C.C. and forwarded to the Facilities Development Corporation, between 1969 and 1972, all but six million dollars benefitted the Department of Mental Hygiene, rather than D.A.C.C. Another point raised, incidentally, by the audit was why D.A.C.C., -153 - like other providers of treatment, has been unwilling even to permi tits patients t~ re,pay some f th o e cost of their care.* This latter 't h po~n as been unintentionally emphasized by a recent progress report of D.A.C.C. which stated that of five thousand D.A.C.C. aftercare patients who responded to q~estionnairesl employed. Of those employed, almost ninety percent were said to be working more than thirty hours per' at least half are gainfully week, while the remainder work part time. At a mean weekly ~ salary of $106.49, their pro]'ected annual net earnings are almost fou~teen million dollars. Commenting upon the partial legislative audit, the Chairman of D A C C ' . . . . sa~d: of the complex fact;rs in\u00ad VOtlVedll~n D.A.C.C.'~ changes and to clarify what has ac ua Y occurred s~nce 1966. ' We deem it appropriate to ]'uxtapose a recommendation published by New York State's C~mptroller, Hon. Arthur Levitt, in his Annual Report for 1974: There is a need for government self-evaluation of the effec~iv;ness of its programs. As one writer re\u00ad c~nt~y S~1d, ... to 40 better, we must have a wa T of dlst7ngulShlng bettet from worse\". Government m~st ask 1 tself: What programs are working? v7hat p ey and should be discontinued? ~s the range an~ nature of government activities ~ontlnue to expand ln an environment of competition or ~carce t~x dollars, there is an increasing need for ln~ormatl0n on the ~ffe~tiveness of governmental operat~ons. The determlnat~ons may be based upon the establlshment of qualitative and quantitative standards *. D.A.C.C. officials continue to insist that the cost of accounting for such payrrents would be greater :than the pay.rrents, \\ ( - ---~~~~~~------- \"\"'~~----------.~--\"------ -154 - and the operation of systems which measure the attainment of these standards. The absence of such seandards and systems can be ascribed, in part, to the difficulty of definir.g the s~an\u00ad dards and designing the appropriate measures. Just as there is no universal standard which can be applied to all operations, there ~s no single measure which can be used to read1ly gauge effectiveness. We believe that the statements of both the Comptroller J and D.A.C.C.'s Chairman can be reconciled only by a comprehens1ve audit of the Drug Abuse Control Commission, both as a provid.er of treatment services and as funding agency for other treatment programs, as an initial step in the overdue evaluation of what the . state .has received in return for the more' than six hundred mil'\" lion dollars already spent by D.A.C.C. We recommend that the' Comptroller perform a financial audit ~f D.A.C.C. In terms of qualitative assessments of the impact of legislation relating to D.A.C.C. funct~ons, th~ Temporary state Commission to Evaluate the Drug Laws has already issued a report on drug abuse prevention (cited above), which recommended the redirection of a substantial portion of the twenty-three million dollars, customarily appropriated on an annual basis for such purpose I into school health programs and the detection and re\u00ad mediation of impediments td individual scholastic achievement. It is hoped that further analysis of problems relating to the treatment of drug abusers contained in th~s report may contribute to an improvement in the quality of such services. However, L 1 d -155 - systematic evaluation of particular funded programs are also necessary. EVALUATION Although D.A.C.C. incorporates in its budge~ over two million dollars annually for research and testing, it has apparent\u00ad ly not undertaken contracts with independent evaluations experts to determine the cost-effectiveness of its own management, nor of the disbursement of state and federal monies, nor of the operations of funded agencies. Moreover, individual local conduits of as- sistance such as the Erie County Department of Mental Health, report that D.A.C.C. has consistently opposed the funding of eval~ative units or evaluation contracts by the providers of treat\u00ad ment services, themselves. Similarly, a spokesman for the Onon\u00ad daga County Mental Health Department reported, at our Syracuse Hearing on September 25, 1974, that there has been a substitution of genuine evaluation criteria with onerous and sometimes irrele- vant compliance requirements. \"We end up counting bedpans and the number of beds instead of healthy people\". He continued: I am saying that given the guidelines and regulations, many of the agencies, and in- deed, the County Department, are forced into managing against controls, rather than against goals. I think that one of our discouraging aspects, as we have looked over the guidelines and the legislation, has been an increase in ... the compliance criteria, and reporting criteria, and so on, and seemingly an almost absolute lack of attention to evaluative criteria, and what constitutes rehabilitation and success. . '. \" '-'~-~' '.~ , ! , . -156 - The Director of the Alcoholism Research Institute in Buffalo commented on the subject of evaluation, at the time of our visit there. He pointed out that D.A.C.C . keeps asking for more and more information, in greater and greater detail, without nearly the capacity for assimilating such data, and absent the slightest concept of how such information can be validly applied J to program improvement. Aside from questions of motivation, there appear to be two reasons for this: the elusiveness of a definition of evaluation and the paradoxical separation of re- search and treatment funding sources. In the narrowest sense (only), supervision of compli- ance with regulations and contract commitments is a form of eval- uation. At the very least, the taxpayer is entitled to know whether a psychiatrist or a nurse paid regularly with public funds performs the services promised as consideration for such payment. In this context, the suggested program audit by the state Comptroller would be extremely useful. Beyond compliance, there are other concepts of evaluation which may be employed. One form of evaluation would contemplate judgments regarding the effectiveness of an individual program, from the standpoint of that program's own desire to improve its performance. Many of the programs we visited said that they were too overburdened to make provision for healthy self-assessment, and were not in a finan\u00ad cial position to call upon others to help them do so. Another form of evaluation would examine and judge whether, and to what extent, a particular program had been successful in alleviating the per- \" ,,,' - sonal and social problem of drug abuse among its actual and po\u00ad tential client populations, and, if a measure of success could be ascertained, how such sue.cess might compare with that of other programs, and to what extent variations of the basic approach might be more effective. A third approach to evaluation is the t selection of specific geographic areas, (or the state, as a whole, broken down into such areas), the determination of the nature and the extent of the problem in those areas, an assessment of the means available to deal with the problem, and, to the extent of reason, logic, and available program content evaluation, the recommendation of changes to deal with the probiem in a better way. This last form of evaluation is necessarily long-term and would require from between three and five years. The question rema~ns., however, by what criteria should evaluation proceed? The formulation of issues, in a political context, has in the past, led to judgmental standards (putative evaluation criteria) that are meaningless. As'the Commission on Expenditure Review and our own Commission have pointed out, once it is acknowledged that addl.'cts and drug abusers are more likely to be successfully rehabilitated if there is interaction between them and corr~unity-based training programs or other sources of employment, it is inadequate to continue to insist that all addicts be \"taken off the streets\". Once it is acknowledged that an ad\u00ad dict who is truly rehabilitated and functioning may nevertheless require periodic administrations of methadone, it becomes equally inappropriate to speak of his failure to achieve \"a cure\", in the \" , --' -158 - drug-free sense of that word. The risks attendant upon a failure to reduce politicaJ issues to their manageable intellectual components, include governmental frustration and demoralization, as well as waste and inefficiency. To cite an analogy, the problem of space travel was, for years, too big to solve. Only when the term space travel was further analyzed as a series of problems of fuel, thrust and lift- J. off, and these problems were further reduced to the needs attendant upon the activity of hydrocarbons at a given temperature and pres'\u00ad sure, could 'the problem of space travel be approached. The first step in bringing such scientific thinking to social problems is a similar willingness to seek clues to specialized needs. Acting in terms of crises has often resulted in hasty judgments and equally hasty refutations of-earlier hasty judgments. The drug problem has been with us since the Civil War. The alcohol problem has been with us since colonial days. These problems may continue to be with us for many years more. To suggest that we undertake new beginnings is not to suggest that everything in the past be cancelled out. It is merely to suggest that we try to get our thinking straight on certain aspects of the problem. Two of the basic intellectual tools for initiating the process of developing evaluative criteria are the ideas of risks and opportunities. The questions which serve as the foundation for an evaluation of the drug problem and how to treat it are: f, -159 - Risks: 11 What are the risks one must accept --the risks built into the nature of any approach to treatment? '1 What is the risk one can afford to take? '1 ~7hat is the risk-one cannot afford to take? '1 What is the risk one cannot afford ~to take? Opportunities: '1 How un1. 1.es, rather than on minimizing , can all major opportunities be scruti\u00ad nized jointly, ~ystem~tically, and in re\u00ad spect to their characteristics, rather than one by one and in isolation? '1 How can one determine which opportunities and risks fit the area of treatment, and which are 'not appropriate? '1 How can one strike a balance between the im\u00ad mediate and easy opportunities for improvement and the long-range and difficult opportunities for innovation and for changing the character of the problem? These are the fundamental questions into which most of the commonly stated issues relating to drug abuse tre~tment can , . -160- be reduced. A careful reading of our ;report, Employing the Rehabilitated Addict (cited above) will demonstrate a practical application of the risks-versus-opportunities analysis. Beyond these questions, however, one must take cognizance of the fact that most public institutions are over-administered, but not administered for: J ,\" h htl S to tlwhc~lt ';s our 1.

Building self-control from results into the system. 6. Organized audit of objectives and results and establishing a mechanism for sloughing off obsolete or unproductive activities.* We believe that evaluation of drug treatment programs *Drucker (19..73), as. quoted in New York State Task Force on Alco\u00ad hol Problems Position Paper, September, 1974. -161 - should be carried on at all three levels: individual programs, comparisons among programs, and an analysis of the State's needs and its present capacity to meet those needs. 'It; We 'recommend\" that top research priority be afforded to these questions. ORGANIZATION We have suggested methodical evaluation\", neither as a slogan, since we have offered a preliminary outline for actual inquiries, nor as a pretext for inaction, since we are also mind- ful of problems which exist in the funding and delivery of treat- ment services, and which should be addr.essed at this time. Fore- most among these problems is the faulty relationship among ser\u00ad vices to drug addicts, drug abusers, alcoholics and, inferentially, persons with emotional problems. An analysis of this problem has been prepared by the Director of the Division of Addiction Ser- , \" vices of' the\"Erie County Department of Mental Health. In Erie County, as in most of New York, alcohol is viewed as the primary drug of abuse. This view is voiced Illost strongly by those involved in the delivery of drug abuse services; , services which traditionally have excluded alcoholism as a prob- lem central to their concerns. This view upon the part of pro- viders of drug abuse services stems from their experiences in dealing with the very pragmatic problems associated with attempt- isuch analysis to be coordinated with present research studies on the problem of alcoholism. / , t -162 - ing to provide effective treatment and rehabilitation services to their clients. They have found, for example, that a very large percentage of youth who have a primary symptom of abuse of drugs also have a parent who is an alcoholic. In attempting to treat the client and his family they, of course, must attempt to deal with the parent's drinking problem. They have found that J the vast majority of youthful drug abusers do not have a primary symptom of a singular drug of abuse but instead, present a pat\u00ad tern of multiple drug-alcohol abuse. In attempting to treat these clients they must, of course, deal with their drinking problems. They have found that methadone maintenance clients, while on metha\u00ad done as well as after withdrawal from methadone, may develop serious drinking problems. Again, in order to conuinue to treat these clients, they must treat the'ir drinking problems. From the perspective of the provider of alcoholism services the pattern of multiple substance abuse is quite similar. For example, the alcoholic housewife not only abuses alcohol but often abuses other drugs such as barbi\u00b7t.urates. In order to treat such a client her drug problem must also be addressed. The alco- holic blUe collar worker, in addition to abusing alcohol, is often found to be abusing tranquilizers and amphetamines. drug abuse problem must also be treated. Again, the Mental health professionals have historically viewed ...' the alcoholic and the drug abuser as two distinct client groups with different constellations of psychodynamic conflicts and prob- lems, and, therefore, as groups which require separate and unique < .1 \" . , , , f. I\u00ad t !: t f r i { -163 - treatment regimes. Thi 1 ' sear y V1ew still represents the opinion of a large segment of the mental health professional community. It is at least in part responsible for th . e separate bureaucratic structures which have been established at the Federal and State levels to fund drug and alcohol programs and wh1'ch have prolife- rated separate and distinct alcohoi and drug abuse treatment programs throughout the State. ,. A view which is shared by an increasing number of men- tal health professionals is that alcohol and drug abuse can be conceptualized as two partially overlapping halves of a single dimension, with the public inebriate and the heroin addict hold- ing positions at the opposite ends of this single dimension. The implications of this conceptual vi~ are: (1) that certain sub\u00ad groups within the alcoholic and drug =:\"busing population are dis\u00ad similar in their characteristic problems to the extent that they can best be treated in separate programs ut'l\" , 1 1z1ng ~n1que modes of intervention for each group,' and (2) th t th a e vast majority of the alcohol and the drug. abusing population are similar to the extent that they can be viewed as a larger group of substance abusers whose problems can be addressed within a single treat- ment program. As an analogy, one does not establish two separate outpatient psychiatric clinics: one to provide treatment services only to phobic patients and the other to provide treatment to neurotically depressed clients. * This latter view does not negate the necessity to see each client as unique in his own right and the related need to tailor a treatment approach . __ is not to say that alcoholics and drug addicts are ordinarily in the same clinic setting. -164 - signed to address his or her specific problems. Simply, the im\u00ad plications here are that the treatment skills and services needed to address these overlapping populations can most efficiently and effectively be delivered from a single program base. Unfortunately, the obstacle to a truly integrated ap\u00ad proach to addiction treatment programming is the requirement that J the utilization of State Aid must be justified on the basis of services to either the the drug ~ alcohol abusing client popula\u00ad tion. The Director of the Nassau County Drug and Alcohol Addic- tion Commission sought to underscore this point: The State of New York ... still separates drug and alcohol programs and funds. Federal, County, and Town governments all have seen pblydrug use as requiring coordinated services. . Unchanged is the problem of furnishing services to the polydrug user where alcohol is the primary drug, because the legalities of reimbursement are still a step behind the need. If someone comes to us with a mixed addiction and barbiturates can be called the primary drug, we and our subcontract agencies will be reimbursed by the D.A.C.C. even if alcohol is a secondary drug. However, if the patient's primary usage is of alco\u00ad hol combined with other drugs, we have two options: We can turn the patient :away --which would be un\u00ad thinkable --or we can a.ccept him or her and pre\u00ad pare to face the consequences of non-reimbursement. In either case, as you can sea, we are in an un\u00ad tenable position. That untenable position has led staff personnel to be unsure of wlmther to accept persons needing help into their pro\u00ad grams, and \"unthinkable\" or not, we have received reports that persons have been denied assistance because they turned to an {' -165 - alcoholism program and were also drug abusers, or they turned to a drug program, but their problem \\,7as viewed pr imar ily as one of alcohol. D.A.C.C., itself, appears to have begun to understand some of the ramifications of this paradox. As a provider of.treat\u00ad ment services, D.A.C.C. has begun to encourage an approach to treat-. ing families of addicts on a voluntary basis. However, in a written , submission to the Commission, dated November 21, 1974, D.A . C.C.' s Chairman stated: Increasingly, D.A.C.C.'s approach entails reaching individuals not previously involved [in treatment] --such as voluntary persons and the~r ~amilies involved around drugs. T~us, s1b11ngs as well as parents with various k1nds of drug problems (except for prim~ry alcoholisn:!), can be treate::d by D.A.\u00b7C.C. on a voluntary basis (emphasis added). . The typical youngster in need of help today, whatever the ongoing symptom, is usually characterized by the jargon of the helping professions as manifesting an \"unsocialized aggres\u00ad sive reaction of adolescence\" .. Family Court and drug program spokespersons throughout the State have estimated that as.many as eighty percent of the children in trouble they see have at least one parent who is an alcoholic or a drug abuser. We be\u00ad lieve that it tends to place extraordinary ~ressure on a family unit to attempt a treatment plan for a family which envisages a drug treatment program for the barbitura~l:.e -using teen-ager, A.A. for his mother, a mental hygiene alcoholism program for his father, a mental hygiene clinic for his wayward sister, and as '} . , t -166 - .. many scattered physicians to treat gross medical complaints as there are gross medical complaints. On the other hand, unless a treatment facility consists of staff members who are competent to deal with the individual problems of various clients, there f f\u00b7 everal family members may be undesirable results rem re err1ng s to' a pregram realistically equipped to handle the preblems of J' enly one of them. Two general remedies have been prepesed to lift the State out of this organizational quagmire. Erie Ceunty, among ethers, believes that a Divisien of Addiction Services should be created within the structure of the New Yerk State Department ef Mental Hygiene. The new Division would incerporate the present Divisien ef Alcehelism and the Drug Abuse eentrol Commissien, and could plan and administer a unified addiction services pregram withing the context ef a total mental health service delivery system. A leading Breeklyn treatment program Director expressed herrer at this suggestion. She wrete: If Mental Hygiene funded dru~ pr~grams, they weuld be noth1ng but,non-Judg\u00ad mental traditional therapy. D.A.C.C. 1S p::obably the best run funding seurce. It would be 1mpor\u00ad tant fer them to' be open to' innovated approaches. Nassau Ceunty, among ethers, tends to agree with this judgment; however, seme ef the legic seemed to be based upon the view that while drug abusers may turn to' alcehel, classic d b Even if true, this alcohelics do net usually turn to' rug a use. \" , \" , ~ -167 - particular argument appears to' us to' be academic, since the client we are talking abeut presents eeth symptems, and which came first is the very irrelevancy we are all seeking to' dismiss.

THE CANADIAN EXPERIENCE The Canadian Criminal Code applies in all provi~ces and territories of Canada. Sections 222-224 of the Code govern restrictions on drinking and driving. The Canadian Criminal Law Amendment Act was enacted in June 1969, ~mending Sections 222-224, and effective across Canada on December 1, 1969. By this Amend- ment, suspected drinking drivers, who are apprehended, are required, under Section '223, to provide samples of breath by police analysis, -and under Section 224, blood alcohol concentration in excess of 0.08% constitutes a punishable offense. Punishment on conviction includes a fine of $50-$1000, or imprisonment for up to six months, or both. Refusal to provide a breath sample without reasonable excuse can result in similar punishment. While license suspen- sion is not mentioned in the Criminal Code, the provincial or territorial government will suspend a convicted driver's license. The average period of suspension'is six months. Priar to December 1; 1969, only those drivers who exhibited obvious physical signs of impairment were apprehended. The Canadian driver was not required to undergo a. chemical test to measure his blood alcohol level. The 1969 Criminal Law Amendment (\"The Breathalizer Legislation\") enabled the various police forces in Canada to administer chemical testing of suspected drinking drivers on a -170 - national basis and provided, for the first time, a blood alcohol concentration above which it was an offense to be operating a motor vehicle. The Breath Test In England, and the united States, breath tests are employed only as a preliminary cherck for alcohol levels as a basis for further tests (e.g. New York's pre-arrest breath testing statute). In both countries, blood tests are given to suspected drunken drivers because it is felt that this direct method is much more reliable and accurate than the indirect determination by breath analysis. In both countries, only the results of a blood test are admissible in court. The Canadians, howEwer, believe that the advantages of breath testing outweigh any disadvantages for the following t, reasons: a) the sample can be obtained in a few minu'tes; b) breath analysis closely reflects arterial blood levels at the time of the test; c) test facilities are minimal and cost per test is much lower than laboratory analysis; d) breath analysis eliminates prob- lems of identifying the specimen donor, as well as most of the collection, identification, preservation, transportation and other problems common to all body materials; e) breath analysis is more acceptable to the driving public. Administration of the Breath Test The Criminal Code requires a driver to take a breath test only when the police officer has \"reasonable and probable -171 - grounds\" to believe that the person l'S ' cOIDmltting, or has com- mitted, the offense of driving whl'le l'mpal'red. This section has been interpreted to m th t th ean a e policeman must observe physical evidence of impairment, such as slurred speech, glassy eyes, flushed face or erratic driving, before he can require a breath test . . s: a lone Before All tests are carried out at the police t t\" undergoing the test, the driver must remain under observation for fifteen minutes. During this period, th~ breathalizer operator interviews the driver. V' 'b\" arlOUS tests are given, including walking c.-rz'_ ... \u00b7d.ight line, putting one's finger to one's nose, and picking up coins from the floor. A breath sample is then given for analysis. After a few minutes, the test is repeated to insUl:::e the accuracy of the first readinc_~.

If he l'S b' l' , at the police station until someone comes for him. Evaluating the Breathalizer Legislation How effective has the Breathalizer Legislation been in decreasing serious road accidents involving alcohol? In its 1974 report,* the Canadian Ministry'of Transport concluded that the legislation did not have a large or sustained effect, and *Carr, B.R. ct aI, The Breathalizer Legislation: An Inferential Transport, Canada, 1974. \u00b7,.~. c ) , -172 - further action programs will be required. Some of the obser- vations were: 1. A slight decrease in fatal accidents for 1970, but in 1971 road fatalities returned to 1969 levels, and 1972 figures were five per cent higher. 2. There is no compelling evidence that alcohol has J \u00b7;;::4':11:\u00b7..,.\u00b7 ... played a lesser role in fatal accidents since the ri~eatl.all.zer Legislation. 3. The legislation has caused an increase in the num- ber of drinking/driver charges. However, the legislation has not affected the likelihood that a driver with a high BAC* (above 0.20%) will be charged. Rather, the risk has increased for those drivers above 0.:10% and below 0.20!~ , ........ ~ A compari?on of statistics of three provinces casts heavy doubts upon the effectiveness of the Br.eathalizer Law. In 1969, 702 dead drivers were tested for alcohol in Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick. Of these, 385 or 54.8% had alcohol in their blood and of those with alcohol, 322 or 83.6% had higher- than-legal levels of blood alcohol. By 1972, the number tested had jumped to 1,044, with 588 or 56.5% found to have alcohol in their blood. About 82% of these had higher than 0.08% blood alcohol. On the other hand, the Breathalizer Law did have a .. significant impact upon police action. Across the country, the number of impaired driving charges has increased dramatically, *BAC Is the comm0n abbreviation for Blood-Alcohol Content. -173 - and the conviction rate of th ose who are tested is very high (96%) .. Rehabilitative Programs Two of Canada's 1 ess populated provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, have recently b victed impaired drivers. egun reeducation programs for con- The Alberta program is set up as follows: Convicted drivers in Alberta are ordered by a Provincial Judge to attend the A.I.D.P.

At the first lecture, '''This Course is not intended to stop you from drinking. This is a decision only you can make. However, the Course is very ~uch concerned with the harmful combination of driving and d ' r1.nking. The Course is con- ducted to encourage h f eac 0 you to examine and assess your own be- havior while you drive and the reasons why you are here, and so to be in a better position to choose between driving while impaired or only when sober. W b ' e el1.eve that you have an interest in the ability to correct and modify your behavior _ once you know the facts.\" Initially, students are asked. to f1.'ll '. out a \"Personal Questionnaire\" and a \"History of Events Lead1.'ng to \" ~i I; \\, -174 - Arrest\". These ~orms will later be assessed by the program (to determine if a follow-up is indicated) and will be used for sta\u00ad tistical purposes. Students are lectured on a variety of subjects by various officials. In the first lecture, a police officer speaks on the obligation of the police, ~nd a representative of the pros\u00ad ecutor discusses Federal and Provincial legislation on impaired driving. License suspension and reinstatement, and automobile ... .. . . . insurance are the to~ics of the second lecture. During the third lecture, a representative of the Alberta Alcoholism and Drug Abuse , Commission (AADAC) discusses the progressive phases of alcoholism. Also covered the third week are driver training and safety and available resourc.:;s for guidance and help. The last lecture in\u00ad cludes a talk on the terms of a probation order by a probation officer and comments by a judge. A committee consisting of the Chairman of the Driver Review Board (which reinstates licenses), a supervisory Probation Officer, a Court Counselor and a Supervisor of Treatment of the AADAC determine: a) those students who have drinking problems and b) those who have repetitive driving infractions, as well. In the case of the problem drinker, a referral is made to the Out- Patient Clinic of AADAC. The problem driver is referred to the Traffic Clini-c of the Alberta Safety Council. * The effectiveness of this program has not been mea- sured at this time. The program's directors are cau,tiously *Strachan, J., A Working Policy and Procedure Manual on the Alberta\u00ad Impaired Drive,r's Program, Department of Highways and Transport, Government of :Alberta, 1973. !, 1 I -175 - optimistic that some positive h c anges may be forthcoming.* Provincial Legislation Legislation in the Canadian provinces supplements the Federal Criminal Code. In general, the individual provinces have the authority to formulate their own standards for apprehending the drunken driver, and as mentioned b a ove, tQ.e~. have complete authority over the suspension and reinstatement of licenses after conviction . The Vehicle Codes of British Columbl'a and Saskatchewan provide for on-the-spot roadsid; checking f o suspected impaired drivers. Where a police offl'cer has . reasonable grounds to sus- pect a driver has consumed alcohol, he may request the driver to surrender his driver's license, which is thereby suspended for twenty-four hours. The driver may request, at the scene, a breath test and if the test shows a BAC of less than 0.08%, his license is returned ' , d\" t' 1 .' lmme la e y. ,If the reading exceeds 0.08%, the license remains suspended f th t or e wenty-four hour period and no charges, are laid.** In 1969, over twelve thousand licenses were suspended in this manner in British Columbia alone. *Brown, P',. e\"f, ai, ~valuatin.g, the Effectiveness of Impalred Drivers, paper presented at Slxth Internatlonal Conference on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic SafetYr Toronto, Canada, 1974. **This procedUre does 'not apply where a police officer intends to proceed under the provision of the Criminal Code. \"~-'---~ j t , ' -176 - British Columbia has begun a pilot program where, following a second suspension for impaired driving, the offender must obtain treatment from a medical clinic or other such agency, and certificiation of improvement in controlling the use of al- cohol must be received by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles before reinstatement of the driving privilege. British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario have laws which protect the medical profession iru reporting medically high risk drivers to the authorities. Doctors, however, are under no duty to serve such notice to the licensing agency. Legislation After 1969, The Criminal Code was amended again in 1972 to provide for limited licenses to convicted drivers who have had their li- censes suspended. Apparently, this change has had little success since Canadian safety experts are predicting its repeal during the next session of Parliament. Proposals for Future Action In a recent report*, the Canadian Ministry of Trans- port determined that there are no simple solutions to the drink\u00ad ing driver problem. Since they were also confronted with the fact that solid information is lacking on the direct and indirect or delayed effects of countermeasures implemented in the past, it was felt that any recommendations made in the report were to be of an cxperilnental, explorative and research-oriented nature. However, the report did emphatically reject the punitive approach \" t' l\" . 1: f. r \" I',,'; license suspension) 'tl (long jail sentences, harsh fines, long periods of 'l\"Alcohol and Highway Safety: A Review in Quest of Remedies, Ministry of Transport, Canada, 1973. 1; t-l' I' p t -177 - The proposals are: Set BAC limits rath h' h er, 19 , otherwise the police and the judicial process will not charge 2. and convict 6f~enders.

If judges and court personnel were better informed of the ramification of the role of alcohol in road safety, if they had more interest in the cases they see, kept abreast of research findings in the area, and in- stigated novel approaches, greater effectiveness can be expected. 7. Expand research efforts. At this time there is J no empirically verified proof of the effectiveness of counter- measures that are in existence. 8. Educate the public on the real risks of drinking .. 0\"- and driving. Mass communication campaigns should be conducted. Warning labels should be placed on alcoholic beverages. Bars and restaurants should post warnings concerning driving after drink- ing. Driver training courses and driver examinations should in'- elude a discussion of alcohol and traffic safety. 9. News media should report accidents more frequently and in a way to maximize the opportunities for learning. A person might learn from the road collisions of others if the relevant information of contributing factors is made available. 10. Reward desirable driving behavior, such as discounts in insurance premiums. Punishment has a minima,l and temporary effect upon behavior but the rewarding of desirable behavior pro- duces consistent and long-term changes. h very recent report by the Province of Ontario* has set out the scope and characteristics of the drinking driver *Report of Government of Onts-rio Interministerial Committee on Drinking and Driving, September, 1974.

THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE A -PARTIAL VIEW Engldnd For more than a quarter of a century following the de- velopment of the automobile, there was ., no law governing drinking and driving in England. Under the Licensing Act f 1872 o , a penalty was applied to being \"drunk.in charge\" of horses and steam engines the major not until vehicles. means of transportation before the auotomobile. the 1930's that the pen~~ty was extended to motor It was The Road Traffic ~ct of 1930 made \"b ' . elng under the in- fluence of drink or a drug to such an extent as to-be incapable of having proper control of a h' 1 \" ve lC e a criminal offense. Subse- quent definitions of the '11 1 b . l ega ehavior became \"being unfit to drive through drink or drugs\" (Road T ff' ra lC Act of 1960) and driving when the \"ability to drive properly' f h lS or t e time being impaired\" (Road Traffic Act of 1962). These changes in the t ttl s a u ory anguage reflect the fact \u00b7that experience in h' d c.arglng an convicting drivers was full of difficulties. An mens for chemical accused person was not required to provide speci\u00ad analysis for alcohol, and courts had to rely on \"----~--,--- ....... ----------------------.::, .. -- -182 - direct evidence such as eyewitness reports and doctors clinical examinations. Convictions, particularly by sympathetic juries, were difficult-to obtain, and many drivers were in fact acquitted with blood alcohol levels higher than 0.15%. Finally, in 1967 England enacted into law the sweeping Road Safety Act which introduced a maximum prescribed level of blood alcohol for drinking/driving. The level chosen was 0.08% and was based on experiences of bther countries and the advice of the British Medical Association. The Act authorized police to give pre-arrest, on-the-scene, breath tests under certain con- ditions.* If a driver failed the roadside test, he was to be taken to a police station for a blood test, on the basis of which a charge would or would not be made. Violation of the law car- ried a mandatory punishment of a one-year license suspension and a fine of up to one hundred pounds, or imprisonment for up to four months, or both.** Similar penalties were also established for failure to submit to any of the tests for BAC level. During the interval between the passage of the legis- lation and its effective date, the British Government engaged in a massive publicity effort to inform the public of its obligation under the new law. The results of a public opinion survey in early 1968 indicated that most people knew about the new laws *1\u00a3 the driver is lnvolved in an accident, or the policeman has \"reasonable\" cause\" to suspect the driver of having alcohol in his body or of having committed a traffic offense while the vehicle was in motion. iWThe Act dld not increase the penalties for, drinking and driving. Jail sentences are rarely imposed. Fines average twenty to forty pounds. -183 - and penalties d an understood that they were subject to breath tests. The British Government claimed that ~ramatic decreases occurred in the t ff' ra lC casualty rate as a result of the legis-lation. In the first f 11 percent fewer and all u year (1968), deaths were seventeen casualties from the trend over the previous eleven per t cen fewer than expected four years. While Positive ef-fects were noticeable through 1970, after three years the dramatic reductions began to returl'l to former levels. In a recently published article * Prof h ' essor H. L. Ross as undertaken an evaluation of the Road Safety Act of 1~67. He surmi~ed that the key to the initial . Success of the Act was the increased d ' rlvers' expectations of punish_m~nt ~ if they were to drink and drive. H owever, the ambivalent and moderate attitude of the legal sy t s em, particularly the police, in applying the legislation , rendered these expectations base'less so that the learning process based on drivers personal experiences reduced the effectiveness of the Act over time.

Swedish insurance companies will not pay claims arising from accidents in which the injured par'ty was the at fault driver J who was driving with a revoked license. S\\\\1edish law also relieves an insurance company of liability. When a driver is involved in an accident where someone else receives personal injuries or where property damage occurs, should the insured driver be convicted of driving while intoxicated (BAC above 0.15%), the insurance company will pay the claims of the injured party, but the company may then sue the driver for claims paid out. Police are authorized to stop a motor vehicle at random and administer a breath test to the driver. Roadblocks are often us/ad. The Swedes claim that their laws serve as an effective de- terrent to drinking and driving. The Government reports that less than 10% of the fatal accidents are alcohol related. (In the United States, approximately fifty percent of fatal crashes are alcohol related.) united States traffic safety experts and researchers, however, are highly skeptical of the success claims made on be- half of har,d line procedures because of the lack of data and scientific research provided by the government. THE UNITED STATES Drinking and driv~ng is a major Social problem in the United States. The National Safety Council has estimated that the use of alcohol by drivers and pedestrians leads to 25,000 deaths. and a total of at least 800,000 crashes each year. The problem was first identified in 1904, and was firqt shown to be serious in 1924. S\u00b7 lnce that time, deterrence o~ th~ drunken driver has been a goal of national importance. However, the continual rise in the number of deaths . attrlbutable to drunken driving suggests that current sanctions for the offense of d~iving under the influence o'f 1 h 1 a co, 0 are not achieving wide scale deterrence. One reason for the difficulty in structuring an effective sanction may be that Americans are w~ll~ng .... .... to accept ~ risk implicit in any arbitrary distinction between driving after drinking and d~ driving. What is the crime? In the past, alcohol impairment in regard to driving was equated with drunkenness,\u00b7 as long as one did t .... no appear drunk one was considered capable of driving a vehicle safely~ In recent years, however, research has proven that a driver can be impaired long before signs of drunkenness appear. This new knowledge is now reflected in the laws of all fifty states. The majority of states specify 0.10%* as the level at which one is presumed to be under the influence of alcohol. A few *0.15% was used in most states until 1968. ,\",I , 1 ,J ~ ~ :r' .< , : .-t - -186 - states, New York included, have recently enacted per se laws, under which it is an offense to drive with a BAC of 0.10% or more with- out proof of overt signs of impairment or intoxication. At least four stab:s have two categories of drunk driving offenses. In New York, it is a misdemeanor to drive while intoxi- cated (mfI); and it is a simple traffic offense to drive when ability is impaired by the use of alc()ho~. (DWAI). The presumption level for DWAI i., !\\Jew York is 0.07%. Implied Consent This legal principle implies the consent of any person who drives a motor vehicle to submit to a chemical test of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining blood-alcohol levels. The police, however, must have probable cause to believe that the driver has committed an offense before any tests can be administered. A person may refuse to submit to a chemical test, but in doing so he subjects himself to an administrative suspension of his driver's license. One who refuses is entitled to a hearing to determine if such refusal was or was not \"reasonable\" under the circumstances. S()me states have laws which specifically permit the fact of a test refusal to be admissible in court. Other states specif- ically forbid such mention in court. Most state laws, however, are silent on this point. Pre-Arrest Testing A relatively new provision which permits \"pre-arrestll -187 - breath tests appears in the laws of at least eight states, in\u00ad cluding New York. Traditionally, a driver could be testeq for al- cohol only after being placed under arrest. Under this new pro- cedure, a driver m b ay e requested to submit to a preath test any time he is involved in a collision or violatl'on, officer has reason to believe the test is administered at roadside, the driver has been drinking to a or the police driver has been drinkin~. The. and if the results indicate that substantial degree, he is taken to the police station for a more sophisticated test, usually a blood test. N Y k' ew or s law went into effect in 1971. Penalties Fines and jail sentences are the penalties for drunLen driving meted out by the courts. Although the suspension or revo- cation of a driver's license is considered by many to be a harsher penalty than the fine or short'jail term, that form of sanction is usually administered by the State Motor V h' e lcle Bureaus, not by the courts. The use of driver licenses for . sanctloning purposes will be treated separately. First Offense There is a wide variation of penalties. For example, the mandatory minimum fine varies from none at all in Nevada to two hundred dollars in Delaware. New York, Alaska, Maine, Wisconsin and Texas do not specify a minimum fine, but state the fine in terms of \"not more than --\", one hundred dollars, two hundred dol- lars or whatever the figure is for that state. Presumably the\u00b7courts .. -188 - f as ll',\"ttle as one dollar ahd 'still comply with the could impose fines 0 law. , of ten dollars, five states Tennessee has a minimum flne dollar n,l-in~mums, and seven states use one hundred have fift~T .......... dollars or one hundred fifty dollars as minimum amounts. Maxi- from a low of one hundred dollars in South Carolina mum fines range to one thousand dollars in Alabama and Delaware. Most of the states prescribe a penalty of either a fine J ' or jail,or both. Arkansas authorizes a fine and a jail sentence. and South Carolina provide for a fine or jail, but not Mississippi both. and Arizona speci.fy a mandatory minimum Texas, Tennessee jail sentence which cannot be suspended by \u00b7the judge. Second Offense The variety of penalties for the second offense is even greater than for the first offense. Generally, the penalties for but in three states (Alabama, Alaska the second offense increase, '1 t;s the same as for a fi\"rst \u00b7offense.' and Texas) the punls.lmen ..... Some d-O away with a fine for the second of\u00ad states, like Connecticut, fense but specify a mandatory jail sentence. Maximum jail sen- , N' e'braska to two ye .. ars in New York, tences range from three months ln Texas an Kansas, ~ d an(~ three years in Pennsylvania. RevoC'ation and Suspension of Licenses ~ <: Followin9 conviction, every state provides ,for revoca- tions or suspensions of varying duration\" In some states, including, -189 - Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, it is possible to obtain an occupational or limited driver's license to permit the erring driver a minimum amount of driving to prevent undue hardship. The definition of \"suspension\" or \"revocation\" may differ from state to state. In general, however, a suspension extends over a stated period of time, at the end of \\'lhich the d:riving privi:\u00ad lege is automatically reinstated. A revocation also exte~ds over a stated period of time, at the end of which the licensee must reapply as though he were a new driVer, ~nd whether he is granted or refused the license is left up to the discretion of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. suspension for Driving While Impaired In the handful of states which have the DWAI category, a license suspension usually follows conviction. In New York, a mandatory two-month suspension is specified. In Michigan, license sUspension is not used, but four points are added to driver's record. * Revocation for DWI -First Offense This sanction varies from no revocation at all in Wisconsin and Mississippi to revocation for up to one year in sev- eral states. In Arkansas, Alabama and Nevada, the license may be revoked. Three states do not specify a minimum period but use \"up to six months\" or \"up to one year.\" North Carolina and Illinois provide for mandatory revocations but are not specific about the period. *Points are assessed after conviction of any driVing offense. A t~tal of twelve points in an eighteen-month period leads to a suspension. 1- , \\ -190 - Revocation for DWI -Second Offense In some states, the revocation for the second conviction is the same as for the first. All states, with one exception, pro\u00ad vide for some mandatory period of revocation, which ranges fl:{':;: a minimum of thirty days in Alabama to a maximum of five years in Massachusetts. Arkansas is alone in allowing a discretionary period of revocation. Suspension for Refusal to Submit to a Chemical Test If a suspected driver refuses to submit to a test, it follows that the court will not have evidence of alcohol in the blood. This substantially lessens the likelihood of conviction. As the use of chemical tests became more widespread, the practice of refusing the test also increased. To counteract this practice, the states have enacted \"implied consent\" laws. These laws .are based on the premise that driving on the highway is a privilege granted by t.he state - a privilege the state may also rescind. applicant for a driver's license presumably agrees that, if he is requested to submit to a chemical test by a police officer who has reason to believe that he is impaired or under the influence of alcohol, he will submit to the test. He further acknowledges that if he refuses to submit to the test, his driving privileges will be suspended. Most states have provided for a license suspension penalty for failing to take the test that is as severe, or more severe, tlian the suspension penalty after the first conviction.* *conceivably, a person can have his licens~ suspended after a test refusal and face another suspension if subsequently convicted of DWI. -191 - However, for persons liable for a second conviction, it would be to their advantage in many states to refuse the test and face a less severe penalty. In Dela f ware, or example, a second offender faces a one year suspension, but only six months after a refusal. Nevada mandates a two year suspensl'on for d ' b a secon convlction, ut only six months after refusal. Limited Licenses The practice of issuing limited or occupational licenses is increasl'ng. AIm t h If f os one-' a 0 the states have a provision for their issuance. Su h I' c lcenses are usually very restrictive, even to the extent of specifying the hours during which driving may be done, and in what area. All unnecessary or recreational driving is prohibited. In most states such limited licenses can be obtained only after a hearing, at which the need must be justified. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Legal Sanctions It had been widely believed that drunk driving behavior could be changed, discouraged, interrupted or prevented through the enactment and application of the punitive laws described above. Although the overall effect of these laws is generally unknown, there are indica\u00b7tions that such measures may be of only limited value. Government officials and highway safety researchers have attempted to explain the reasons for this lack of success. Some of their observations are: Harsh penalties for driving under the influence, often \\ :, -192 - cited as a panacea to the DWI problem, can reduce the likelihood of apprehension and conviction by creating a reluctance in police officers, pr0gecuting attorneys, and judges to act when the penalty appears excessive with regard to the grqvity of the offense. (Driver Behavior: Cause and Effect, Washington, D.C.: I L' 1 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 1968}. j, ! Criminal sanctions are most ineffective in dealing with L ;. 1'\u00b7 the most dangerous drivers, th~ problem drinkers ,who constitute !: }< ! the majority of high-risk drinking drivers.\u00b7 (Alcohol Abuse and ~' L J<,' the Criminal Justice System, Center for Governmental Research, Inc., i Rochester, N.Y., 1973). A frequent criticism of the criminal justice system is that many drivers arrested for drunk driving are permitted to plead to a lesser charge, usually reckless driving. The reasons usually advanced for this practice are: a) drunk driving trials are time- consuming; b} jury trials are frequently demanded; c} prose'cutors are aware that juries are often sympathetic to defendants; d} the courts are clogged with drunk-driving cases; e} prosecutors do not feel that drunken driving is a serious charge (unless death or serious injury results). This last reason underscores the fact that many people are ignoring the act that the law prohibits (driving under the influence) and concentrating only on the tragic consequences of that illegal behavior (a highway accident) Arrest and Apprehension Presently, the law requires a police officer, before he can stop a driver he suspects of driving while intoxicated, to have -193 -- probable cause to believe that the driver has committed an offense (DWI). He does not have the power of his counterpart in England who can arrest a driver upon reasonable cause to believe the driver had been drinking. The strict laws of arrest h b ave een severely criticized by many traffic safety experts. Oft th en, e arrest or apprehension stage in the enforcement process is cited as the most ' lm1?ortant reason for our failure to get the drunk driver off the road. A noted researcher, Professor Robert Borkenstein of Indiana University, has t' t d h es lma e t at the average police officer in the U.S. makes an average of two alcohol-related traffic arrests per year. He ha f d th ' s cun at In a typical com- munity of one million population, wl'th 1,000 l' po lce officers, there will be an average of only two thousand arrests and over four million DWI violations.* The Problem Drinker The deviant drinker, who constitutes only one to four percent of the drivers on the roadf is responsible for more than fifty percent of the serious and fatal alcohol-related accidents. Studies by the Department of Transportation have refuted the general impression that most accidents are caused by the social drinker. Punitive sanctions for DWI, as currently administered, , appear to have little or no deterrent effect on the problem drinker. Consequently, the relatively new ,*Remarks d71ivered at 6th International Conference on Alcohol, Drugs and Trafflc Safety, Toronto, Canada, 1974. many areas of the hIt has been introduce ln country.

These are:\" 1) increased law enforcement; 2) stepped-up court pre-sentence investigations to isolate problem drinkers; 3) rehabilitation of problem drinkers and 4) public information and education. In all, 35 local ASAPs have been started at ap average cost of more than two million dollars each, with a total allocation of seventy-eight million dOllars. In the area of enforcement, the major effort is to increase the detE:,.::tion and apprehension of drinking drivers. Each ASAP provides for the establishment of special alcohol enforcement patrols at the times and places where most alcohol- related crashes Occur. A second objective is to improve the conviction rate for alcohol-related offenses, through the use of chemical testing equipment, tape recording devices, and video cameras to record the condition and behavior of. the arrested driver for use in cotlrt. In addition, officers are trained in all aspects of,the arrest procedure including the operation of health-testing equipment. At some sites, special mobile breath-testing vans equipped with video tape may be Used. The pre-sentence investigations countermeasure assists the court in making the most individually and,societally appropriate adjudication of a drinking and driving offense. An offender is Classified as either a problem drinker or a social drinker. Depending on the extent of the individual's alcohol-related problem, a recommendation is made to the court -196 - which may include some type of rehabili-ta,tion in addition to, or in place of, a more traditional, punitive sanction. The investigation varies from site to site, but generally consists of checks of the offender's driving and criminal records, social health agency record, interviews with family members, associates, employers, blood alcohol concentration at the time of ,arrest, and the use of structured diagnostic interview instruments. In addition, in ~cime cases thE~ investigation includes medical and psychological examinations. Probation is often used as a tool for l~eferring the convicted offender into rehabilitation programs suited to his needs. The judge, based upon the recomrnendation growing out of the pre-sentence investigations, places i:he offender on probation which is conditioned upon successful completion of the prescribed rehabilitation. The rehabilitation phase of the ASAP program attempts to modify the drinking-driving behavior of those arrested to preclude any further recurrence.* For the social drinker and early problem drinkers, it is intended that exposure to alcohol education will help such individuals recognize the relationship , 1 t d bl ms For the chronic between drinking and drink~ng-re a e pro e or acute problem drinking drivers it: is intended that ASAP\u00ad \"II 'd such persons in the initial supported rehabilitation w~ a~ step of the rehabilitation process, a change in atti~ude. ral into ~omrnunity-based programs is the next logical step. *Approximately 40 percent of convicted drivers entered some form of rehabilitation program. Refer--197 - In 1973, the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis\u00ad trations (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportations published a preliminary evaluation of 29 of the 35 ASAPs in operation. Their conclusions \\Vere as follows: 1. The ASAPs have produced a sharp increase in safety activity as indicated by an overall growth of over 150 percent in alcohol-related arrests of the average site during the first two years. 2. ASAPs have been effective in inpr0ving the overall safety system as evidenced by the increase in numbers of arrested drivers who are handled effectively by the courts and enter into treatment programs. 3. There has been a small, but statistically s\"ignificant, reduction in drivers with high BACs using the road. 4. There has been a statistically significant drop in the ratio of nighttime to daytime fatal crashes. There has been a reduction in alcohol-related fatal crashes of between 10 and 19 percent. This favorable account of the effectiveness of the ASAP program has been challenged in a recent report by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety.* This study compared year-to-year variations in fatality statistics between groups of areas with ASAPs and comparison groups of areas without ASAPs. *Paul Zador, Statistical Evaluation of the Effectiveness of ASAPs~ Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, Washington, D.C., 1974. , I I,: ; , . -198 - 't' , d because that report neglected The NHTSA study was crl lClze to rule out the possibility of to provide convincing evidence alternative explanations for t e POSl h 'tive outcomes in program areas.

Some, like the program in Westchester County, New York, are sponsored by the Automobile Association of America {AAA}. Rehabilitation At this writing, at least 9 states* have taken a new approach to the DWI problem by moderating the punishment for convicted drivers while at the same time allowing for some form of rehabilitation. The principal characteristic of these statutes is the broad discretionary power they vest in the courts in referring defendants to treatment programs. They generally allow referral to a rehabilitation program upon d h' a secon , t lrd, or Subsequent conviction of DWI. In t f th . mos 0 ' e, states the courts are also giVen the discretion~ry power to lessen or sUspend the jail sentence and fine of the defendant upon his completion of a treatment program. Two states, Vermont and South Dakota relate completion of rehabilitation to the privilege to drive an automobile. This sUspension or lessening of the penalty for DWI is obviouSly an incentive for the defendant to sUccessfully complete the rehabilitation program, because the penalties are generally quite severe on later convictions. Very little is stated in these statutes as to what actually consti tutes a program of alcohol rehabi Ii ta,tion.

At a time when chemical tests to, determine bleed-alcehel level were unknewn, ene had to, be ebvieusly drunk to, be cenvicted ef DWI. During the 1940s, research in the area ef the effects ef alcehel upen driving ability preved that ene did net have to, be severely intexicated to, censtitute a menace to, himself and ethers en the highway. * As a result ef these findings, New Yerk State in the late 1940s passed a law which permitted the use ef chemical tests to, determine the bleed-alcehel levels ef suspected drinking drivers. Abeut the same time statutery presumptiens ef intexicatien based upon bleed-alcehol cencentratiens. During the past ten years, the Legislature has displayed its cencern with the drinking and driving preblem by amending the laws time after time. By 1974, except in the area ef the rehabilitatien ef the cenvicted driver, New Yerk had ene ef cemprehensive statutes in the ceuntry. 'rhe mest the addi tien ef two' effenses cencerning drinking and driving. The first is the per ~ law, under which it is an effense in itself to, drive a meter vehicle with a BAC ef 0.10% er mere, witheut the need *See part C. ef this chapter. , \" i -202 - for proof of ar,y physical signs of drunkenness. The penalties for a violation of this law are the same as for DWI. The second change createCi the category of driving while ability is impaired (DWAI), a violation of which was made a simple traffic infraction. DWAI is not defined in the statute, but driving with a BAC of .07% or more creates a statutory presumption of impairment. (Section 1195 (b), Vehicle and Traffic Law) Penalties A violation for DWI or driving with a BAC of 0.10% or more carries a penalty of up to one year in jailor a fine not to exceed $500r or both. A repeat offender faces from 60 days to 2 years in jailor a fine of $200 to $2000, or both. A DWAI conviction, a simple traffic offense, carries a jail sentence of up to 15 days or a fine up to $50, or both. Suspension and Revocation of Licenses The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles must revoke the license and vehicle registration of a driver who is con- victed of DWI or driving with a BAC above 0.10% for at least 6 months. A DWAI conviction carries a mandatory suspension of license and registration for 60 days. Law Enforcement Our statutes, as well as the common law, require a police- man to have,probable cause to believe a drinking and driving offense has been committ:.ed before he can stop a driver on the road. The policeman is asked to make an informed judgment on -203 - the behavior and physical condit;on f ..... o. the occupant of another mOVing vehicle perhaps hundreds of yards away from him. The policeman has a better h c ance to make a valid arrest when he happens across d' a r~nking motorist he has pulled over for a traffic violation or comes upon th e scene of an accident. In such situations he I' may va ~dly administer a breath test to everl person involved in the accident, w;th.out ..... a showing of probable cause. (Section l193-a, Vehicle and Traffic Law) In other cases an arrest probably w_;ll be I'd' ~ va ~ ~f the officer smells alcohol on th b th e rea of, or notices drunken behavior by, the driver. In addition to f 11 ' o oWlng proper arrest procedures, the police officer must take great care in administering chemical tests to the suspect. Th ' e requlrements for these procedures are highly technical, and the Department of Motor Vehicles reports that police errors nave led to many , acqulttals and reversals upon appeal. Over the y,ears, New York prosecutors have found that drunk driving cases are difficult to prosecute to convictions. Juries, they say, are reluctal~t to 't conV1C someone of such criminal conduct. Based upon this experience, only those defendants ~ho have been involved in accidents or have very high BACs (usually above .20%) are brought to trial.* *Ford, J.M.et 17\\.1 h 1 Ab System, Center for a . . co 0 use and the Criminal Justice Governmental Research, Inc., Rochester N.Y., 1973, p. 80. ' /1, '..,.' \", ... ,,' -204 - Others who are arrested with lower (but illegal) BACs are invariably involved in the plea-bargaining process. In Suffolk County for example, defendants are allowed to plead to DWAI, an offense, instead of DWI, a misdemeanor, with BACs as high as 0.21%.* It was hoped that the adoption of the per se law would dramatically increase the number of persons convicted of DWI. j \" Since the only issue in that offense is a scientific blood reading, trials could be simplified and the role of the jury minimized. However, the per se law did not exclude testimony by the police to establish probable cause for arrest, and apparently prosecutors still feel that the juries will continue to acquit defendants in the .10%-.20% range. Their plea-bargaining rules have remained the same. The extent of the plea-bargaining process is clearly reflected by the following statistics: of .27,000 DWI arrests in 1971, there were only 5200 DWI convictions. In that same year there vlere almost 10,000 DWAI convictions. Since DWAI is virtually never an original charge, it can safely be assumed that those 10,000 persons were initially charged witp DWI .. ** *Testimony of John J.

Under the provisions of Article 21, in February of 1969 the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles appointed a Driver Rehabil- itation Advisory Board to investigate methods of driver rehabilitation and to set up as experiments appropriate rehabilitation programs based on their findings. In 1970, two pilot programs were begun. The New York City Rehabilitation Clinic opened in June, and a second clinic in Monroe County (Rochester) began in October. In December 1970, the Board approved the application of the provisions of Article 21 for the rehabilitation program of the Nassau County Alcohol Counterme~sure Program, with the require- ment that the Nassau program adhere to the guidelines of the Board. This program, one of the Alcohol Safety Action Programs funded by the National Highway 'Traffic Safety Administration, is restricted to alcohol-related convictions only. After a proposal submitted by the Automobile Associ?tions of America, the DWI Counterattack Program, also concerned only with alcohol convictions, was approved for operation under Article 21. This program was begun in October of 1971 in Erie, Onondaga and Westchester Counties. These courses, based upon the Phoenix, Arizona DWI course, are educational. While other counties,' such as Dutchess County, do operate other types of educational and rehabilitation programs, more than half of the population of our State does not have -:..u,= I r; --------------..-:, .. ,'''--------_ .. -208 - access to such programs. Moreover, in the areas that do have programs, only a small percentage of convicted drivers are eligible \"to participate because of a lack of space. In Nassau County, for example, only 50% of convi~ted drivers are eligible. Proposals for Reform: Department of Mental Hygiene The Committee on Alcohol and Highway Safety of the New J York Task Force on Alcohol Problems has recently studied the problems associa'ted with drinking and driving. The Committee made provisional recommendations in the areas of Public information and education, law enforcement, prosecution, the judiciary, an( re-education and rehabilitation of the drinking driver. Public Information and Education: 1. Develop local data on the problem and prepare fact sheets prior to recruiting volunteer help, especially media help. 2. Interview highway safety program personnel personally to examine the extent of their interest and resources in alcohol and highway safety. 3. Develop a policy of working with local chapters of national organizations rather than dealing directly with their central administrative offices. 4. Plan to use a network of community resources rather than just Qne agency to assure adequacy and continuity and to avoid a vested interest or fragmented approach. . . 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. -209 - Law Enforcement: Motivate police personnel to take preventive measures against drinking' drivers before accidents Occur.

Proposals for Reform: Center for Governmental Research In November, 1973, The Center for Governmental Research published a report1 \"Alcohol Abuse and the Criminal Justice System,\" for the Genesee/Finger Lakes Regional Planning Board. This detailed and in-depth study of the>handling of drinking and driving cases in six upstate counties concluded that available research to date supports a method of handling alcohol\u00ad related traffic offenses which combines effective law enforcement wi\u00b7th a flexible program of educational and therapeutic pro\u00ad cedures (medical, psychological, psychiatric and social work). The report goes on to make the following recommendations: More Effective Law Enforcement. Effective law enforcement 1. is important for three reasons. First, a high perceived probability of being stopped, tested and arrested may at .. least deter social drinkers. Second, while the threat of arrest may not deter problem drinkers, the probability that these high risk individuals will be detected before -213 - they cause accidents will be increased. Third, the enforce\u00ad ment phase shoUld be, considered the intake stage for sUccessful channeling of offenders into treatment variants. 2. Screening of Arrested Offenders. Intake procedures for all arrested persons shoUld be established to permit the gathering of comprehensive information on offenders. 3. Revision of Motor Vehicle and Traffic Law. The present laws making drunk driving a criminal offense have not been enforced by the p~lice nor the courts because the offense is perceived as a social and medical problem, rather than a criminal act. Therefore, administrative, rather than criminal processing of drunk driving offenders should be instituted, at least for the first offense, and that DWI and driving with a BAC of .10% or more be reduced from a criminal misdemeanor DO a traffic infraction on the\" first offense. 4. Sanctions. License suspension and revocation, not jail terms or fines, are the only punitive sanctions which b\u20ac~ar a logical relationship to the offense by attempting to remove the driver from the road for a period. In view of this, longer periods of license suspension should be experimented with. The possibility of creating limited licenses should be considered. Finally, the process of reissuing licenses after the period of revocation needs revision. The Department of Motor Vehicles' investi.gation prior to reissuing licenses should include serious attempts -214 - to determine whether the conditions wh.;i.ch precipitated the offense are still present, especially problem drinking. A chronic alcohol abuser who is not receiving treatment should not be issued a license. 5. Referral and Rehabilitatio~. EVen with the improvement of present sanctions against drinking drivers, punitive measures will always have limited value because they do not deal J with the underlying medical, psychological and social factors responsible for the offense. A program for enforced therapy for alcoholics should be studied further. Proposals for Reform: State Traffic Safety Council The State Traffic Safety Council believes that the effective\u00ad ness' of the criminal justice system in handling drinking cases can be improved by a review of the conviction rate in comparison to the arrest rate. The number of convictions per year is available from the Department of Motor Vehicles, but there is no state and these statistics are often incomplete and are obtained only after long delays. DWAI arrests, because they are classified as traffic infractions, are not reported at all. The Council therefore recommends that all arrests for violations of Section 1192 of the Vehicle Code be reported to a central state agency. ~. ',. i t; ! ; i 1 -215 - The complex probiems associated with the handling of drunk driving cases in the courts were explored in a recent public hearing held in Mineola, L.I., on October 17, 1974. The hearing was jointly sponsored by this Commission, the Joint Se\u00ad lect Committee on Transportation, and the Senate Standing Com\u00ad mittee on Transportation. Testifying-at the hearing were the following witnesses: Inspector William Morrell, Commanding Officer of Suffolk county Highway Patrol; Peter Gerstenzang, Assistant District Attorney, Albany County; Judge John Edwin Loewy, N. Y. Sta.te Magistrates As\u00ad sociation; Judge Alfred S. Robbins, Administrative Judge of the District Court of Nassau County; Robert Siek, Lieutenant, New York State Police; Ernest Peace, Attorney, Nassau County; Com\u00ad missioner Harold A. Adams I Na,ssau County, Department of Drug & Alcohol Addiction; Donald T. Phillips, New York State Automobile Association; Orman Crocker, Long Island Council on Alcoholism; Julian D. Rivo, Director of Research and Program Development of the N.Y. Traffic Council; Inspector Richard Ketcham, Nassau County Police Department and John J. Grennan, District Attorney, Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. I l The witnesses were specifically asked to comment on r t the following topics: 1 1. The elimination of the right to a jury trial for the first offend~r by the reclassification of the first offense I as 2. The of a pilot project providing for the administrative adjudication of first offenses. 3. The establishment of short-term mandatory jail sentences for all those convicted of drunk driving, or increasing fines. 4. The continuation on a voluntary or mandatory basis of the drunk-driver rehabilitaiion programs. 5. The establishment of an occupational or restricted use license in New York State. There was a general consensus among the witnesses against the introduction of occupational licenses for convicted drivers, because such a program would be impossible to administer and enforce. All those who addressed themselves to rehabilitation programs felt they have achieved positive results and should be continued either in place of or in addition to, the punitive penalties. The witnesses were evenly divided on the third proposi- tion, mandatory jail terms or increasing fines. The proponents generally felt that something has to be done to insure \"punish\u00ad ment\" of the convicted drivers. Some opponents felt that mandatory sentences would only add another factor which would lead juries to acquit more defendants. The police officers felt that present law provides adequate sanctions if the courts would not hesitate to invoke ti\\em. The greatest controversy surrounded the first and second proposals, the elimination of the right to a jury trial, and the decriminali\u00ad zation of DWI for the first offenders. Judges Morrell and Robbins -217 - D.A. Gerstenzang, Mr. Rivo and, M r. Adams, strongly supported this proposal. They expressed their opinion that something must be done to relieve th t' e conges ~on in the courts caused by ~he backlog of DWI cases. With the arrest rate skyrocketing and trials taking up many days, the system is reaching the breaking point. In Nassau County, there is a backlog of 5000 DWI cases which is over 25% of the entire ' cr~minal caseload. Only one witness, Commissioner Adams, suggested tha~ the current plea\u00ad bargaining system be ended, and deplored tl 1e fact that more than 85% 6f arrested drivers plead to traffic infractions. Mr. John Grennan vehemently opposed any changes in the present system, which' b d ~s ase primarily on plea-bargaining. Even though the legal leyel o~ intoxication in New York is .10%, Mr. Grennan's office will accept reduced pleas to DWAI for read\u00ad ings up to .21 %. (Thirty-five percent of the cases get DWI con- victions, 62% plead to DWAI and 3% have dismissed or are acqui t ted) . D.A. Gerstenzang proposed that the revocation of driving privileges should be d It ' ea w~th administratively and n ~s manner, the arrest- separated from the criminal process. I th' ing officer would confiscate the license temporarily, until the driver has a (civil) hearing before the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Administrator of DMV could then make a simple de- temination of d \" \" r~v~ng pr~v~leges without regard to any criminal charge. , I I\u00b7 ! -218 ... RECOMMENDATIONS Pending the completion of a report to the Legis.lature by the Department of Motor Vehicles on their estimate o'f the effecti ve\u00ad ness of urunk driving programs in this State, 't.his Commission's recommendations based upon the overview present9d here, should be, and are, made in principle: 1. The m~ndatory diversioh of drinking drivers to educational programs, such as the one in Dade county, Florida, would appear to serve two purposes: a. The casual drinker who is convicted of drunk driving may learn the full nature and the-consequences of his conduct and how to avoid such conduct in the future; and b. The problem drinker or alcoholic may be able to come to understand that drunk driving represents only one of several dysfunctions related to the use of alcohol. Recognizing other dysfunctions may be the first step towards developing motivation for treatment. In this latter context, no countermeasures program could possibly. be effective without the incorporation of trained personnel in the helping professions, and also representatives of Alcoholics Anonymous, both to help the individual recog\u00ad nize his problems, as well as to help him secure treatment. 2. Because we are also recommending evaluation of the effectivene~s of current treatment approaches to alcoholism, we believe that it would be premature to impose mandatory treatment requirements for convicted drunk drivers, at this -219 - time. However, the voluntary p~rticipation of persons in a treatment program for a period of time, and evidence of the alleviation of other alcohol-related problems, might be useful considerations in th d t ' e e ermJ.nation to restore his license. 3.'The reluc-cance of juries to convict persons charged with drunk driving offenses may be attributable to three causes: a. Juries identify with defenda~ts, because jurors themselves, tend to drive after drJ.'nkJ.'ng. f I this is the case, nothing short of a total ban upon the operation of a motor ve\u00ad hicle with any BAC level could possibly be effective as a penal sanction. b. Jurors d t f 1 h o no ee t at drunk driving is serious. This seems unlikely. c. Jurors may have intuited that drunk driving is a medical problem and that the 1 pena ty structure is irrelevant to its meaningful solution. It seems to us that the most likely reading of the difficulty prosecutors report in achieving convictions for drunk driving is this third possibility, that juries believe the prob\u00ad lem is not one of appropria'ce criminal sanctions, but rather, a problem based upon the motivation for and the availability of treatment. Seen in this light, we recommend that further study be given to the following procedure to be used in New York State: First, empower the police to administer a roadside or a station house chemical test. If the driver fails the test, allow the police to suspend his license, and give him the option ; I, . , \", \" I -220 - of a criminal proceeding, under the penalty statutes, to clear himself, or a civil proceeding to regain his license. Second, if the fact of drunk driving is established either way, mandate participation in a countermeasures program for purposes of establishing the eligibility of such an individ- ual to regain his license. 'Ihiro, make specific offers of meaningful evaluation and treai::rrent to apparently debilitated or troubled drinking drivers, with a view towards dealing with the underlying causes of their unwanted behavior, and thus, perhaps, reduce the overall problem by the successful outc')me of treatment in a significant number of in- dividual cases. In the event that the Legislature should conclude that a reduction in penalties would lead to a greater number of convictions in drunk driving cases, we would also suggest, as a condition thereo\u00a3, the enactment of mandatory participation in a countermeasures program, such as the one described in our previous report, Drug Abuse Prevention (cited above).

J It B01lt,.c:mt the opinion of experts in the field. Genera.lly their experience was primarily with hard-core unemployed street addicts. All of the experts stated that drug addiction among employees would not be a problem to the Equitable because young people about to enter the work force could not E.fford to have an entry level job and support a drug a.ddiction. However, experience proved that a large number of young people wbo While not addicted are frequent users of heroin and ~ be habituated. Some of this group have sufficient conventionality to seek jobs. But once employed their life-style and drug habits if unchanged may result in un~atisfactory performance and/or attendance. It was found that their presence tends to encour~~e \"puahingll on the premises, the spread of drug usage to others because of the ready availability and peer pressure, thefts from the company and ,fellow employees to pa:,)r for drugfl, and loss of other employees not wishing to be associated with drug users. Because of the clerical nature of the Equitable's operations, e.ccidentB 'were not a problem. By 1968, because of awareness of drug users among ou:r emp.loyee/ po~tlation the Equitable started on its way 'boward the development of a poJ.ic;y regard,ing drug abuse among employees. as follows: 1.

Written policy regarding drug abuse. Employees found using drugs and not involved with selling or passing drugs are not fired providing they undergo indicated treatment .and rehabilitation. If this can be done without interfering with work, they remain on the job. If working is not possible, the problem is regarded as any other illness and they are returned to work whenl they are able to work. t , ,,\"' -224 - The Equitable program for dealing with drug problems among employees is the result of many hours of thought and deliberation by top management and by key individuals in the Medical, Personnel and Security Departments. We are committed to its periodic eValuation and revision as dictated by our own experience and by new knowle~e of the problem of drug abuse and better ways of dealing with it. The Equitable requires all employees to demonstrate reasonable'ability to perform the work to~hich they are assigned and to maintain a reasonable record of on-time attendance and productivity. Drug - abuse is only one of a large number of behavioral problems which impair work capacity and performance, increase absence, and have upsetting or demoralizing effects on other employees in the work unit. Included in this group are alcoholism and a variety of emotional and personality difficulties that can have similar effects. Actually, drug abuse accounts for only a small percentage of the behavioral problems we encounter. The essence of ' our drug abuse program is a clearly stated policy enforced by well defined procedures for implementation contained in a segment of the Equitable's Supervisory Guide ~rsonnel Policies entitled \"Emotional and Behavioral Problems, including Alcoholism and Drug Abuse.\" A copy is attached. It is believed that placj\"ng drug abuse in a section with a generalized designation has a practical implication. It permits supervisors to be sensitized to impaired performance and unusual behavior among employees reporting to them While relieving the supervisor of the responsibility of trying to diagno~e the specific cause. Once identified, ~he problem employee is referred promptly; to the Medical Department. There a diagnosis is made and appropriate trea'tment and rehabilitation procedures are initiated Where indicated. ~ .- -225 - Specifically, th E equitable's policy on drug traffic is as follows: drug abuse and 2. 1.

In September 1971, during an officers' meeting the then Equitable President (now Chairman of the Board), J. Henry Smith, explained his feelings about drug abuse, particularly among employees, and explained the new Equitable policy regarding drug abuse. During October 1971, an j educational progranl about drugs and drug abuse was conducted for all employees. Also, a special program for 1,200 middle management employees was held to acquaint th~~ 1~th the policy and the procedures to be employed. About this time, an Equitable publication for employ~es, Equinews, printed an article deseri'bing the emphasis on rehabili tatioD. made by the program. In November 1971, a memorandum went from the Presid/ent to .each employee regarding policy as to drug abuse. A copy is attac;hed. There is no fixed routine for dealing with employees who are abusing drugs. Rather, each case is considered separately within the framework of our policy and a rehabilitation program uniquely designed to meet the individual! s needs is developed. Within the Employee a , Health Cerlter, counseling and supportive therapy are 'offered ~ilile the person is referred to an outside community agency for definitive treatment and rehabilitation. We have used a number of agencies; the Depar~ment of Psychiatry at the New York Medical College however has been our major resource and most helpftll. As time has passed and supervisors have gained experience with the problem, the general reaction of both ycnrnger and older supervisors toward the employee with problems, drug or otherwise, has become . , -227 ;. progressively one of und t ers anding and supnort. Tl i ~ 1 S has been particular 1r true during the last year. ~ Before there ~as 1969 through August 1971, 75 written company policy, between January employees were found using h i disch ero n and were \u00b7arged.

We contacted many drug treatment and rehabilitation programs ,in and around the New York City area and indicated our willingness to consider \"graduates\" of their programs who they felt were ready for employment. Until 1973 these contacts were disappointing. Most did not bother to follow-up. Same centers were actually visited to emphasize our interest but ~ referrals for employment were received. other program representatives were invited to visit the Equitable. Many did but were never again heard from. It became obvious that these agencies had few job-ready clients in spite of their complaints, frequently and loudly voiced through the media, that busine~s and industry discrtminated against and would not hire ex-addicts. At that time many other companies were having the same experience. Later, some began to send out resumes of clients to the personnel department to read to see if any were qualified for available jobs. In interviewing these prospective employees it was found that a number of the programs took the word of clients as to their qualifications and working experience without actually verifying it. This resulted in unqualified referrals. Also, in talking to, some vocational rehabilitation counselors we found that they, themselves, had never held a' regular job. Not only were they sometimes not aware of the basic requirements for employment, but some were actually hostile toward business in general. Our experience now is that a number of agencies are producing job-ready graduates including some agenCies previously found deficient. ... The Equitable's criteria for job readiness of people referred from vocational rehabilitation programs are very simple: We require that the ~ lJ j I j, I I I J i I I Ii U [J lj I 1 j.

Generally, before long on the job, the ex-addict himself tells his colleagues of hiB past history. The supervisor is told however to keep the new employee's personal history confidential. Generally, the reaction of a supervisor' to the request that an ex-addict be considered for the job is simpl\u00a5, \"Can he do the job?\" We have come a long way in a short time! It would be unfair,! ;r feel, to discuss our experience with ex-addicts hired prior to 1973. As previously stated, few agencies knew what \"job readiness\" was all about initially a..'1d we too have learned through experience. Recently, in order to evaluate our experience with people employed through programs for treatment and vocational rehabilitation of ex-drug ad,dicts, we compared rehabilitated ex-addicts hired during 1973 through October 1, 1974 (the \"study\" group ) with employees not known to have been addicts of the same age, sex, grade and hired as close to the same day as possible (the .\"control\" group). Members of the control group were selected at random and without knowledge of their current status with the company or of how they were regarded by their departments. The comparison revealed: Performance Ex-Addicts Non-Addicts 2 Excellent 0 6 Above Average 4 4 Average 8 1 Below Average 1 1 Poor 1 8 Not Evaluated * 8 *At work less than 4 months 1: 1 I I t 1 11 1 I 1 i j ! j 'j t rt I I I I !

We found no significant difference between the two groups in our studies. The Equitable's favorable experience with hiring rehabilitated ex-addicts is not unusual. Throughout the business community those hiring ex-addicts are having similar good experiences. It is urgent that these experiences be pooled in order to provide meaningful statistics. No one employer has enough experience to be able to do this alone. Together, however, there is little doubt that the combined experience will prove significant. The results nrust be made available to other employers so that they are aware that there is now a group of people available for employment who can make good employees and who are asking only that they be considered on the same basis as any other applicant for ~~pl03~ent.

October 31, 1974 DRUG ABUSE CONTROL COMNISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATING A ME'I'HADONE PROGRAM NEW YORK STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT I S REQU\"IREMENTS FOR OPERA'rING A METHADONE PROGRZiM FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS FOR THE OPERATION OF A METHADONE PROGRAM .\"\" 234 DRUG ABUSE CONTROL COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATING A METHADONE PROGRAM The Mental Hygiene Law of the State of New ,York requires that the Drug Abuse Control Commission approve in advance facili- ties and services for the treatment of drug dependent persons, Pursuant to this statutory authority, the Commission has enacted various rUles and regulations for operating a methadona program. These requirements pertain to all methadone programs conducted in the State with the exception of operations provided :Oy licensed hospitals or agencies of th'e State and local governments. A methadone program is defined as, a person or organiza- tion utilizing methadone and any of its derivatives for the detoxification and maintenance treatment for the rehabilitation of narcotic addicts; and conducting initial intake and evaluation of patients at a single specified location and ongoing treatment at the same or other specified locations. The rUles and regulations divide programs into two areas: methadone detoxification and methadone maintenance. -morc--235 - METHADONE DETOXIFICA'I'ION detoxification program cedure .... us;ng methadone or any of its derivatives to be administered in decreasing doses, over a time period not to exceed 21 days, for the purpose of detoxification from opiates. to a methadone detoxification All applicants t ff before admission. be screened by the program s a process includes: program must The screening I, tIs identity (name, 1. the verification of an app ~can 't number and other identi\u00ad address, date of birth, social secur~ y fying data); 2. a , narcotic addictions, from its designee narcotic abuse history, and ver . t' t in another not Presently a methadone pa ~en that an applicant is met:liudor,c: program. is completed, the rules and Once this screening process following admission procedure be regulations require that the followed on each applicant: 1.

Issuance of an identification card with beginning and termination dates of validity prominently set forth on the face thereof, and valid for no more than a total of 21 day~. Except in emergency cases, no methadone can be administered unless the applicant has been determined to be an opiate addict* and has undergone all the screening and admission procedures required. In emergency cases, methadone can be administered after the sub- mission of a clearance inquiry of specimens, and pending return of enrollment clearance reports from the commission or its de'signee, or clinical laboratory reports. Programs are called upon to dis- courage repeated or prolonged exercise of this privilege by any single patient. Only a physiciar. may determine the patient's initial methadone dose, detoxification schedule, and any departure fr0rn the prescribed dose or schedule. The physician must communicate the dose to the phar- macy or nurse supervising medication, and any oral communication must be confirmed in wri'ting within 72 hours. The current dosage each patient must be entered on his medical chart. Methadone cannot be administered at a detoxification facil- ity until the patient has been identified and the dosage compared with his currently ordered and documented dosage level. The phy- sician or nurse administering the medication must observe its in- gestion which must be taken orally. *DACC interprets primary methadone addiction as maintenance, a procedure defined in the rules and regulations as using me'thadone and any of its derivatives, to be administered over a period of time in excess of 2l days, for the purpose of maintaining. patients at a stable dosage or by sloW .--\" reduction of the dosage to achieve a drug-free state. All prospective methadone I)laintenance patients must be screened by the,intake staff to determine eligibility. This pro- cesS includes the verification of the applicant's identity (name, address, date of birth, social security number and other identify- ing data), and a determination of opiate or synthetic narcotic addiction. That determination must be based upon: a physical eX- aminatio n performed.by a physician; laboratory evidence (urinalysis), verification of narcotic abuse and narcotic abuse history.. Ad- ditionally, DACC must verify that the applicant is not presently a methadone patient in another methadone program. The following procedures are required to admit an applicant to a methadone program: 1. a complete medical history, physical examination, and psychiatric and psychological evaluation, (2) laboratory workup which includes routine blood chemistry, liver profile, serology, complete blood count, and routine urinalysis, (3) a test for tuber- culesis, with folloW-UP, if indicated, (4) current tetanus im\u00ad munization, t5) intake interview and complete psycho-social hi$tory by social worker; (6) \"consent to Methadone Treat- ment\" (FD2635) form to he signed by applicant or if he is under , 1 I 1 \\ 1 I \\ I l f I \\ 1 (I \\ \\ \\1 II t 1 \\ I 1 l l 1: \\ I \\ -2.38 18 years, by his , parent or legal guardian; (7)' the an ldentification card with photo.

In the following exceptional Circumstances, notification of DACe , but not its prior approval, is reqUired: acute illness, f~ily crises, emergency travel, holidays. However, a patient can never be issued more than a siX-day SUPply. A medical examination by a phYSiCian or nurse is required daily during the indUction stabilization stage of treatment. Fol- lowing stabilization, for one month, a weekly examination is re-.. quired. SUbseqUently, each patient must be examined at three-month intervals on a regularly scheduled basis. Additionally, medical services must be readily available to the patients during clinic hours. It is mandated that in addition to medical services, eaoh methadone treatment program must provide a comprehensive range of rehabilitation services on-site under profeSSional supervision. These are individual, group, and VOcational counseling.

A detoxification procedure must be provided to all patients who request it, and to any patient who, by staff deCiSion, is no longer a SUitable methadone maintenance patient. In cases where it has been determined that on-site detoxification is undesirable (e.g. patient's viOlent behavior), alternative arrangements for in-patient or out-patient detoxification may be made at another facility.

Such person must hold a master's degree in one of the behavioral sciences or social work or he must have had direct or progressively responsible eXferience in the operations of a narcotic treatment program. If a clinic is aqtho- rized to treat more than 300 patients, the duties of the adminis- trator-supervisor are to be divided into two positions - a clinic administrator ( having administrative experience) and a case super- visor (same qualifications as required for administrator-supervisor). The clinic administrator will be responsible for the on- going supervision of administrative functions, and the training of all staff in administration and for the training and supervision of all counseling staff. In those clinics with less than 300 patients, the clinic adminrstrator-supervisor will assume all of the above responsibilities.

These reqUlations can be groUped as fOllows: organization, staff, admission, drug dispensing, attendance and take-home privileges, records and miscellaneous. ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS , Treatment programs must provide in addition to methadone dispensing, counseling, rehabilitative and other social services which will help the patient become a well functioning member of society. Such supportive services should be made avail- able at the primary facili~y (where methadone is administered). However, if formal agreements exist, these services may be offered elsewhere. Hospital care for drug-related problems must be avail- able to any patient. vlliile not mandatory, it is suggested that each program have formal arrangements with a hospital to provide general medical care to patients. Neither the program nor the hospital are required to assume financial responsibility for a -259 - Programs are-permitted to refer certain patients to . a IImedication unitll for the dispensing of methadone. Such fa- cilities can be utilized if the program determines that a patient is not in need of frequent counseling, rehabilitative and other services which are available at the primary program facility. These units can be established in private physicians' offices or in J community pharmacies. However, after a referral, the program is still responsible for the patient's care. The referred patient must recieve needed medical and social services at least monthly at the primary facility. Each medication unit must be approved by the FDA and DACC. Approval will be based on the distribution of these units within a particular geographic area. Methadone will be supplied by the primary facility to the medication unit out of its sto~k of the drug. STAFFING Each program must have a program sponsor who must take primary responsibility for -the program and its employees. The sponsor must agree to inform all his employees of all rules and re9ulations and to monitor their activities to assure compliance with the provisions. While the sponsor need not be a physician, he must employ a licensed physician as the medical director of the program'. The medical director must submit form FD-2633 \"Medical Responsibility Stai;ement fOr Use of Methadone in a Tre.atment, Pxogram\" This fOl:'Hi includes the names of all pers.ons who will administer or dispense methadone for the program. $'1= ~ /1 11 II 1 1 ! j ,j I I 1 II !

Additional methadone may be provided if withdrawal symp- toms are not suppressed or whenever symptoms reappear. When patients are physically dependent on high doses of methadone, it may be necessary to exceed-these levels. Forty milligrams per day in single or divided doses will usually constitute a~ ade\u00ad quate stabilizing dose level. Stabilization can be continued . ...' 2 to 3 days and then the amount of methadone will normally be gradually decreased. The rate at which methadone is decreased will be determined separately for each patient. The dose of meth- adone can be decreased on a daily basis or in 2-day intervals, but the amount of intake must always be sufficient to keep withdrawal symptons at a tolerable level. In hospitalized pa\u00ad tients a daily reduction of 20 percent of the total daily dose usually will be tole:::-ated and will cause little disc.omfort. In ,ambulatory patients, a somewhat slower schedule may be needed. If methadone is administered for more than 3 weeks, the pr,t,ee- dure is considered to have progressed from detoxification or treatment of the acute withdrawal syndrome to maintenance treat- ment, even though the goal 'and intent may be eventual total wi thdrawal. In maintenance treatment the initial dosage of, metha- , (done*shouldcontrol the abstinence symptoms that follow with- drawal of narcotic drugs, but should not be so great as to cause sedation, respiratory depression, or other effects of acute in- toxication. It is important that the initial dosage be adjusted *15 to 20 milligrams I' f : j -263 - on an individual basis to the narcotic tolerance of the new patient. If sllch a pat.ient has been a heavy user of heroin up to the day of admission, he may be given another 20 milligrams 4 to 8 hours later, or 40 milligrams in a single oral dose. If he enters treatment with little or no narcotic tolerance (e.g. if he has recently been released from jailor other confinement) , the initial dosage may be one-half these) quantities. When there is any doubt, the smaller dose should be used initiaily. The patient should then be kept under observation, and, if symptoms of abstinence are distressing, additional 10 milligram doses may be administered as needed. Subsequently, the dosage should be adjusted individually as tolerated and required, up to a level of 120 milligrams daily. For daily dosages above 100 milli- grams patients must ingest medication under observation 6 days per week. These patients will be allowed take-home medication for 1 day per week only. A daily dose of 120 milligrams or more must be justified in the medical record. For daily dosages above 120 milligrams, prior approval from DACC and FDA must be obtained. For take-home doses above 100 In.tlligrams per day, prior approval from DACC and the FDA must be obtained. A regular review of dosage level should be made by tt;e responsible physician with careful consideration given for red:uction of dosage as indicated ~ I fJ !1 1.1 I I I II r/ l II ~~' ! 1 1 L I .. ~. . j 11 ii J I II f I 1 I ! i'l 'j' I jl ',j , I '1 II ! !

They must receive no more than a 2-day take-home supply. With continuing adherence to the program's requirements and progressive rehabilitation for at least 2 years after en- trance into the program, such patients may be permitted twice weekly visits to the program for drug i~gestion under observa- tion with a 3~5lay take-home supply. Prior to reducing the fre\u00ad quency of visits, documentation of the patient's progress and the nee.d for redt.l.cing the frequency of visits must be recorded. , The requirements and schedule for when the drug must be ingested under obse;evation may be relaxed if the patient' has a serious physioal disability which would prevent frequent visits to the program facility. The FDA and ~ACC must be notified of such cases. Additional medication may also be provided in ex- ceptional circumstances such as acute illness, family crises, 9r necessary travel when hardship would result from requiring the customary observed medication intake for the specific period. In these circumstances the reasons for providing additional medica- tion will be recorded. In circumstances of severe illness, in- firmity or physical disability, an authorized individual (e.g. a licensed practitioner) may deliver or obtain the medication. In maintenance treatment, a urinalysis will be performed randomly at least weekly for morphine and monthly for methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines and other drugs if indicated.

The FDA will approve such exemptions or revisions of program standards at the time of application with the concurrence of DACC. The FDA has the right to withhold the granting of an exempt~on until such time as a program is in actual operation in order to assess if the exemption is necessary. If periodic in- spections of the program reveal that discrepanCies or adverse conditions exist, the FDA must reserve the right to revoke any or all exemptions previously granted. The program sponsor must report any patient death which is considered me'thadone related to the FDA. The program sponsor must report to the FDA the birth of any child to a female patient, if the newborn is premature or shows any adverse reactions which, in the opinion of the at- tending physician, are due to methadone, within I month of the birth. There is a danger of drug dependent persons attempting to enroll in more than one methadone treatment program to ob\u00ad tain quantities of methadone for the purpose of self-administra- tion or illicit marketing. Therefore, except in an emergency situation, methadone must not be provided to a patient who is . '.' \" -269 - . known to be currently receiving the drug from another treatment program using methadone. The patient must always report to the same treatment facility unless prior approval is obtained from the program sponsor for treatment at another program. Permission to report for treatment at the facility of another program must be granted only in exceptional circumstances' and must be noted on -the patient's clinical record. To prevent multiple enrollments, the program must agree to participate in any patient identification system that exists or is designated and approved by the FDA. Information that would identify a patient must be kept confidelil.l.al. Patient records must remain confidential. Any record that would divulge the name, diagnosis or prognosis of a partic- ular patient cannot be used outside of the program unless a patient waives the privilege. The ,FDA and DACC may use these records only in actions involving the program or its personnel. Before the FDA may deny or revoke an application, the applicant has the opportunity to question the information on which the proposal to deny or revoke approval is based, and to present any dral or written information and views. If, after this informal conference, the FDA finds no justification for the approval of the license, the applicant is entitled to a full .. hearing on the matter. The FDA may, howevel~, subsequently reverse an adverse determination if i t find~, that the applicant has justified approval of the application. n ,I fI II ij /1 11 j' 11 II I 1 \\ II [I if 'I) !
