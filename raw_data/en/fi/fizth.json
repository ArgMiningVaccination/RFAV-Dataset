Pungent taste is what makes [spicy foods](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/article/Spices/178) hot. Pungent spices stimulate by irritating the lining of the digestive tract and other membranes. Made of fire element, pungent taste is sharp and concentrated, fast acting and intense, spreading quickly to all tissues. Penetrating substances, like digestive enzymes, and anything that \"penetrates\" all tissues, like the nervous system and the blood, are pungent. Aggressive substances, like the immune system, and intelligent tissues, like the analytical centers of the brain, have pungency or sharpness. The forceful, constant contact of fire element penetrates, burns, ulcerates, cuts and cauterizes. Types of Pungents Black pepper and chilis are quintessential pungents. Hard liquor is pungent and burning. Sour taste, which increases secretions, is sharp but not pungent. At Joyful Belly we've lumped together pungent taste and the sharp quality because they share many similarities. Acrid is a subtype of pungent, used for foods that aren't spicy but have a burning sensation, like tobacco. [Aromatic](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/herbal-action/aromatic) is a subtype of pungent reserved for herbs and spices that have a strong smell, like peppermint. Herbal resins like frankincense and myrrh have a distinct pungent taste as well. Circulation & Immunity The body flushes pungent irritants by thinning the blood, dilating blood vessels, and increasing the heart rate. Pungent taste thus improves circulation, liquefies, softens, secretes, and flushes, breaking up and dissolving thick or hardened masses such as mucus. As it moves blood, pungent taste warms the liver, forcing it to work harder. Warming the liver is helpful if blood is cold and liver is stagnant. However, the surge of blood stimulated by pungent taste can overtax the liver's cleansing capacity if Pitta is already aggravated. Pungent taste stimulates courage and valor because blood flow is movement of . The immune system exists mainly in the blood. Therefore, good circulation, stimulated by ginger, black pepper, and other pungents helps improve immunity and resolve sore throats. Pungent & Kapha Pungent taste is the best taste for Kapha. Circulation increases heat, metabolism, and [agni](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/article/Digestion-Agni-Ama/8) (digestive strength). It burns off all Kapha tissues, creating lightness. It helps the body sweat, clearing and flushing all secretions. It breaks up and dries mucus in the GI tract and in the lungs. It wakes up the sleepy Kapha mind and brings focus to mental activity. Pungent & Vata Vata should be careful with excess use of pungent taste. A small amount of pungent taste warms Vata, but pungents should not be used to stimulate deficient organs. They increase Vata's already high metabolism, which burns fluids ( [ojas](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/article/Ojas-Tejas-and-Prana/16) ), causing tissues to dry out. Instead, nourishment is the best way to rebuild organ strength for Vata. Excess pungent taste Excess sharpness and pungent taste aggravates Pitta and could lead to bleeding disorders, bruises, ulcers, inflammation, and rashes. After encouraging secretions, excess pungent taste leaves behind thirst and dryness, much as the hot sun dries the desert. Treatment of Excess Pungents Sweet, gooey foods coat and soothe excess pungency. Cooling demulcents like [licorice ghee](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/products/Licorice-Ghee/52) and [shatavari](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/products/Shatavari/79) are also indicated. Astringents like [amalaki](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/products/Amalaki/76) and arjuna cool inflammation.
