In addition, if a Member incurs expenses for Illnes s or Injury that occurred due to the negligence of a third party: /square4 We have the right to reimbursement for all benefit s we paid from any and all damages collected from the third party for those same expenses whethe r by action at law, settlement, or compromise, by the Member, Member's parents, if the Member is a minor, or Member's legal representative as a result of that Illness or Injury; and /square4 We are assigned the right to recover from the thir d party, or his or her insurer, to the extent of th e INDHMOIL01-2019 01/19 Cigna Connect 1300-1 MIHM0195 90 benefits we paid for that Illness or Injury. /square4 We shall have the right to first reimbursement out of all funds the Member, the Member's parents, if the Member is a minor, or the Member's legal repres entative, is or was able to obtain for the same expenses we have paid as a result of that Illness o r Injury. /square4 You are required to furnish any information or ass istance or provide any documents that we may reasonably require in order to obtain our rights un der this provision.

Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate plan. Primary Plan The plan that pays first as determined by the order of benefit determination rules below. Secondary Plan The plan that pays after the primary plan as determ ined by the order of benefit determination rules below. The benefits under the secondary plan are re duced based on the benefits under the primary plan. Allowable Expense The portion of a Covered Expense used in determinin g the benefits this plan pays when it is the secondary plan. The allowable expense is the lesser of: /square4 the charge used by the primary plan in determining the benefits it pays; /square4 the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the primary plan, and /square4 the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under your pr imary plan are reduced because you did not comply with the primary plan's requirements (for ex ample, getting pre-certification of hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the allowable expense is reduced by the amount of the reduction. INDHMOIL01-2019 01/19 Cigna Connect 1300-1 MIHM0195 91 Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this plan or any date before this section or any similar provision takes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the primary plan. If the plan does have a coordinat ion of benefits rule consistent with this section, the first of the following rules that applies to the si tuation is the one that applies: /square4 The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the primary plan and the plan that covers you as a Dependent shall be the secondary pl an; /square4 If you are a Dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the primary plan shall be the plan which covers the parent whose bir thday falls first in the Calendar Year as an enroll ee or employee; /square4 If you are the Dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the Dependent shall be determined in the following order: o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has ac tual knowledge of the terms of the order, but only from the time of actual knowledge; o then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; o then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; o then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child, and o finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. /square4 The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's Dependent) shall be the primary plan and the plan that covers you as laid-o ff or retired employee (or as that employee's Dependent) shall be the secondary plan. If the othe r plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the order of bene fit determination, this paragraph shall not apply. /square4 The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the secondary plan and the plan that covers you as an active employee or retiree (or as that employee's Dependent) shall be the primary plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the ord er of benefit determination, this paragraph shall n ot apply. /square4 If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and determines the order of benefits based upon the gen der of a parent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefit determination, the pl an with the gender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the longer period of time shall be primary. Effect on the Benefits Payable /square4 If this plan is the primary plan, the amount this plan pays for a Covered Expense will be determined without regard for the benefits payable under any o ther plan. /square4 If this plan is the secondary plan, the amount thi s plan pays for a Covered Expense is the allowable expense less the amount paid by the primary plan du ring a claim determination period. INDHMOIL01-2019 01/19 Cigna Connect 1300-1 MIHM0195 92 If while covered under this plan, you are also cove red by another Cigna individual or group plan, you will be entitled to the benefits of only one plan. You may choose this plan or the plan under which you will b e covered. Cigna will then refund any premium receive d under the other plan covering the time period bot h policies were in effect. However, any claim payment s made by Cigna under the plan you elected to cance l will be deducted from any such refund of premium. Recovery of Excess Benefits If this EOC is the secondary plan and Cigna pays fo r Covered Expenses that should have been paid by the primary plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will have the right to recover the actual overpayment ma de. Cigna will have sole discretion to seek such recovery from any person to, or for whom, or with r espect to whom, such services were provided or such payments made by any insurance company, health care plan or other organization.

Medicare Benefits If a Member is eligible for Medicare, Cigna will ca lculate the claim payment for Covered Services according to the benefit levels of this EOC based o n the allowed amount defined below, and pay this amount minus any amount paid by Medicare. Cigna wil l estimate the amount Medicare would have paid and reduce benefits by this amount for any Member w ho is eligible to enroll in Medicare but is not enrolled. In no event will the amount paid exceed t he amount that Cigna would have paid if it were the sole insurance carrier. Under this scenario, the allowed amount will be the lesser of: The amount Medicare allowed or Cigna's Negotiated Rate for a Participating Provid er or Cigna's Maximum Reimbursable Charge for a Non Part icipating Provider.
