Most times you won't even notice your immune system working overtime to keep your body healthy. A well-functioning immune system performs its duties quietly, continuously patrolling the body for any external substances that may have snuck in \u2014 initiating a complete defense strategy when necessary. In addition to upholding good health, there a number of benefits associated with having a strong immune system that shouldn't be taken for granted. That said, the below list isn't at all conclusive and can vary depending on the individual. Regardless, taking care of your immune system goes a long way. What are Some Benefits of a Strong Immune System 1. Better Protection Your immune system's number one job is to protect the health of your body. A strong immune system is your body's best defense against outside forces. Whether it's free radicals from the environment, seasonal changes or crowded spaces, a robust immune response prepares your body to handle the many challenges it faces on a daily basis. In other words, a strong immune system provides better protection, helping you stay healthy. 2. Heal Faster Having a strong immune system helps your wounds heal faster. When you cut, scrape or otherwise damage your skin, the healing process is regulated by immune cells.i Specialized white blood cells work to keep the wound free of infection and send out chemical messengers, called growth factors, to help repair the damaged area. Thus, a weakened immune system can result in delayed wound healing and those with poor immunity may take longer to heal. 3. Less Tired A strong immune system typically results in less down time and overall fatigue. When your immune system is well-functioning, less time and energy is spent having to fight off common ailments. If you're getting enough sleep regularly and still feel tired all of the time, your immune system may be struggling, making you more sluggish.ii 4. Clearer Skin Your skin is your immune systems first line of defense, acting as a physical barrier between your bloodstream and the external environment. And as you learned above, your immune system is responsible for repairing your skin when it's damaged. It's also responsible for fighting off bacteria that can lead to acne. Therefore, having a strong immune system often results in healthier, clearer skin.iii 5. Healthier Hair and Nails The same is true for your hair and nails. A strong, well-functioning immune system makes for healthier hair and nails. Research has discovered that specialized immune cells, called regulatory T cells, play a role in hair growth.iv The good news is that hair and nail nutrients, like vitamin C and E, also support the health of your immune system. How to Maintain a Strong Immune System There are a number of lifestyle choices that influence the health and vitality of your immune system. Ensuring you're consuming nutritious whole foods, getting adequate amounts of sleep, exercising regularly and managing stress levels are some of the healthy choices that help maintain a strong immune system. Reversely, unhealthy habits, like drinking and smoking, tend to weaken your immune system. Unfortunately, life can be hectic, stressful and downright overwhelming at times; and there are factors outside of your control that negatively impact your immune system. Oftentimes your immune system could use extra support.
