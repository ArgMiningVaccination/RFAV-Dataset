The Westmead Vaccination Hub is one of the initial three vaccination hubs set up to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to the high priority groups in Phase 1a. Westmead Hospital emergency department nurse unit manager Dante Canete was the first to receive the jab from Western Sydney Local Health District (WSLHD) this morning. \"I'm happy to be part of the first group because I can lead by example, share my experience and encourage others to get the vaccine,\" Mr Canete said. \"This is for the entire world. Let us heal all together.\" Work will continue as normal for the 48-year-old father of four, who has worked in Westmead Hospital's emergency department for 19 years, including the designated area for suspected COVID-19 patients. \"I am grateful to have an extra level of protection against COVID-19 and the roll out of the vaccine is a really important milestone for my colleagues and I in the fight against the virus,\" Mr Canete said. WSLHD Chief Executive Graeme Loy said the day was a momentous occasion in response to the pandemic. \"We are extremely proud to be supporting Australia's vaccine rollout in a significant capacity,\" Mr Loy said. \"Many staff from across the district have worked exceptionally hard to make this clinic possible and help protect Australians against a virus that has claimed so many lives around the world.\" NSW Health is working closely with the Australian Government to implement a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccination program.
