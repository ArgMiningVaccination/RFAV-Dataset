What is medicine for? What does it mean to be a good doctor? Their answers seem essential to the practice of medicine and to understanding its moral norms. The absence of answers to these questions\u2014or incoherent or incorrect answers\u2014would seem to prefigure a crisis for both medicine and medical ethics. For without correct and coherent answers, practitioners of medicine cannot properly orient themselves within their profession, nor even think of their practice as a profession at all. And without some account of what the medical profession professes\u2014without an account of medicine's purpose or end\u2014ethicists rely on norms that bear only contingent relationships to the activities of medical professionals. Ethicists fail, in other words, to articulate an ethics of medicine in the proper sense. We believe that medicine, and hence medical ethics, is in precisely this sort of crisis. Medicine has lost its way because it lacks clarity about where the way should lead. We no longer have a shared public understanding of what medicine is for, of what the end of medicine is or should be. Rather, medicine has substituted for its once clearly recognized purpose something amorphous, subjective, and shadowy. As a consequence, the norms that medical professionals and professional ethicists bring to medical practice are devoid of objective content and radically deficient for guiding doctors and protecting patients. THE PROVIDER OF SERVICES MODEL FOR MEDICINE In answer to the question What is medicine?, according to the provider of services model, medicine comprises a set of technical skills that are to be put to work to satisfy patient-client preferences. Healthcare workers are providers of services, and these services are undertaken for the sake of patient well-being, understood principally in terms of satisfying the patient's wishes.\u00b9 Every culture gets the medical practice it deserves, and in our culture medical practice is dominated by a consumerist understanding, where well-being is understood in terms of the patient's desires being satisfied. Efforts to identify an ethical framework capable of guiding practitioners and patients in our time have resulted in consequentialism, contractarianism, and, most prominently, principlism\u2014the framework that gives us the familiar four principles of medical ethics.\u00b2 In the context of an individualist and consumerist environment, however, these efforts all tend to default to three norms: what the law permits, what is technologically possible, and what the patient wants. Thus, according to the provider of services model, if an intervention is permitted by law, is technologically possible, and is autonomously desired by the patient, medical practitioners should provide the intervention. Indeed, they may be professionally obligated to do so.\u00b3 After all, these norms fit our expectations of other providers of services. The good folks who provide us with Wi-Fi or who make our double soy lattes do not bring further considerations to bear on whether to give us what we want. They do not consider the appropriateness of our desire for a double soy latte; they do not ask what websites we'll be visiting. We expect them to obey ordinary norms of law and not defraud or deceive, but beyond that we expect them to do as we wish (provided that they can perform the service, and we can pay). There is no distinctive professional ethic for these practices because there is no profession, no deep orientation to a good or set of goods, that gives meaning and purpose to what they do. Thus, in the provider of services model, the work of physicians becomes demoralized, and its ethic becomes what the philosopher H. Tristram Engelhardt has identified as a morality of strangers. One does not knowingly do violence to the unconsenting innocent, to be sure. But within the boundaries of law and consent, what is technically possible is ethically permissible. That which is permissible and also desired may even be ethically obligatory. Medical ethics reduces to a set of procedures for negotiating noninterference with patients' wishes to the greatest possible extent. Medicine itself devolves into a powerful set of means to be used to satisfy the preferences and desires of those who are authorized, legally and procedurally, to choose. Among the many consequences of the provider of services model, the following three loom. First, professional authority has steadily eroded. If there is no objective standard or end for medicine, physician expertise is merely technical. Thus, instead of exercising the authority of expertise within a sphere constituted by their professional commitments, physicians become increasingly subject to the exercise of power by lobbyists and political advocacy groups. Medical professionals come to work in a highly regulated domain in which the exercise of clinical judgment and prudence is neither possible nor desirable. It's no surprise, then, that declining professional authority is followed by a second consequence: a crisis of medical morale. Insofar as medicine merely provides desired services, its pretense of moral seriousness is a charade, and its attempts at professionalism are a fa\u00e7ade. The practice of medicine is characteristically grueling, with long hours spent under taxing circumstances. Is it surprising that physicians who experience themselves largely as mere functionaries\u2014asked to set aside traditional medical norms, religious convictions, and their best judgment\u2014suffer high rates of burnout? Finally, when medicine is understood as the provision of healthcare services, the physician's judgment\u2014and particularly the physician's claims of conscience\u2014come to be seen in competition with the fundamental, but minimal, norms of the profession. The exercise of physician conscience is treated as the intrusion of private or personal concerns into transactions that should be governed by physicians' professional commitment to provide legally permitted services to patients who request those services. Michael and Tracy Balboni note that this artificial separation of the personal and professional leads patients and clinicians to suppress and ignore their moral and spiritual concerns, to the detriments of both. As a result, the medical profession and society at large appear increasingly ready to abandon the idea of the conscientious physician and to use the coercive powers of the profession and the state to compel physicians to participate in practices that violate norms that have guided medical practitioners for millennia. THE WAY OF MEDICINE What is our alternative vision for medicine? We call it the Way of Medicine. The Way of Medicine offers physicians both a path out of the provider of services model (PSM) and the resources necessary to resist the various political, institutional, and cultural forces that constantly push practitioners and patients to think of their relationship in terms of an economic exchange. We attempt in this book to articulate and defend this Way of Medicine. Medicine as a Practice We begin by arguing that medicine is a paradigmatic practice, elevated to a profession because of its social importance, that aims at human health. Health is an objective natural norm for any organism: the well-functioning of that organism as a whole. Human health is also an objective human good: our organic well-functioning is an aspect of our human flourishing. Understood in this twofold way, health gives singular purpose to the practice of medicine. The PSM also concerns itself with health; no one, to our knowledge, denies the importance of health to the practice of medicine. But under the PSM, health is only a subjective and socially constructed concept. Therefore, the norm of health is sufficiently malleable to justify pursuing almost any desired bodily condition. In addition, many see health, however defined, as only one among a number of goals toward which medicine might reasonably be aimed. For the PSM, pursuing health is optional. In contrast, in the Way of Medicine, the good physician orients her practice centrally around the good of health. Physicians need only pursue those aims related to health, and the profession as a whole should, to the extent possible, avoid entanglement with goods other than health\u2014except when necessary to understand and address patients' health-related needs. In detaching from the objective demands of health in favor of a broader and more subjective mandate, the medical profession makes a grave mistake of prudence. Such detachment erodes the grounds for treating medicine as a profession rather than as a technical trade; the professional commitments of medicine are watered down, and physicians find themselves lacking the excellence that is made possible by sustained focus on a single good. Physicians and other members of the medical profession must also, according to the practice of medicine, resist inducements to act in ways that contradict the good of health. This commitment dates back to Hippocrates and the promise the physician makes in the Hippocratic Oath to give no deadly potion nor cause an abortion no matter how much the physician is implored to do so. In the Way of Medicine, physicians are always justified in refusing to intentionally damage or destroy the good of health. But this is very different from saying that physicians should avoid any action that even indirectly injures health; the rule of double effect has for centuries helped clinicians practicing the Way of Medicine to discern when they can accept as side effects of health-oriented interventions harms that they should never intend. The Way of Medicine obviously requires that physicians do more than refuse to damage the good of health. Physicians must devote themselves to that good, not in the abstract but as it bears on their patients' concrete needs. Medical practice is neither a pastime nor merely a career; it is a profession, whose members make life-shaping commitments to care for particular vulnerable persons. The patient necessarily occupies a privileged position in the physician's life, as a focal point of his concern and care. At the same time, the physician who practices the Way of Medicine pursues the health of his particular patients while mindful that health is not the only good, nor are his patients the only ones in need. The Requirements of Practical Reason The Way of Medicine starts with attention to the kind of practice medicine is and the good toward which medicine aims, but it does not stop there. People who pursue the health of patients must do so in ways that respect the broader demands of ethics. (We use the terms ethics, morality, and practical reason interchangeably.) Put differently, the practice of medicine has its own integrity, but that integrity depends on and is accountable to the requirements of practical reason. The requirements of practical reason have been known under a number of names. One is natural law. Natural law is not law inscribed in the heavens but rather the practical reason that directs persons to act. C. S. Lewis identified another name, the Tao, as a synonym for practical reason and natural law, which he describes as the source of all value judgments.\u00b9 These various names point to the same reality: practical reason's identification of that which is genuinely good for human beings\u2014that is, conducive to human flourishing\u2014and the corollary implications as to what we should do and how we should live. What goods contribute to human flourishing? Practical reason identifies several goods as giving human persons fundamental and basic reasons for action: friendship, knowledge, and play are three examples. Human life and health constitute another such good: we are better off, as individuals and in community, if we are alive and healthy. Health is not good only in order to achieve some other purpose; its goodness is what philosophers call basic. We can reasonably preserve a life for its own sake; we can reasonably pursue health simply in order to be healthy. So practical reason gives us the principle that health should be valued and pursued. What are the implications of that principle for the Way of Medicine? Here we find that the internal norms of the practice of medicine are strongly confirmed by what practical reason requires, unlike, say, the internal norms of the practice of torture. Practical reason forbids us to intentionally damage or destroy any basic human goods, including the good of health. Practical reason thus adds to and deepens the norms internal to medical practice, but it does not contradict those norms. In the Way of Medicine, a practitioner focuses on the patient's health but does so while respecting and being guided by the fuller requirements of practical reason. AN OPEN INVITATION In this book we invite the reader to join us on a quest to investigate the Way of Medicine. While we write primarily for those who are dissatisfied with the PSM, we welcome any readers with an interest in contemporary healthcare. We do not intend to divide the medical profession into two starkly distinct camps. We recognize that our description of the PSM may seem like a caricature to some practitioners, who find themselves agreeing fully neither with the PSM nor with our account of the Way of Medicine. These readers may call themselves providers, but they are devoted to providing quality healthcare and they take seriously the duty to do no harm to their patients' health. Yet they also see much value in respecting patients' choices and providing healthcare services that align with what the patient believes is good for him or her. In fact, the PSM and the Way of Medicine both operate in the practices of most clinicians\u2014to different extents in different contexts. Few physicians practice consistently within only one or the other, and the two accounts coexist amicably so long as what patients want is for their practitioners to use their best judgment to pursue the patients' health. Most patients do want just that most of the time. But ultimately, as we will show, the two accounts are irreconcilable and the future of medicine will be determined by which one governs the profession. What might readers who deeply value what the PSM offers gain from learning about the Way of Medicine? At a minimum, they will come to understand what still attracts some of their colleagues to this once regnant, but now contested, vision of medicine as an honorable profession. Even if we fail to win over such readers, we can at least contribute to the promotion of civility and mutual respect among those who disagree. Still, in this book we speak primarily to those who are disposed to recognize and affirm that human health is a good that medical practitioners can know objectively and pursue conscientiously. The book is primarily for people convinced that some real moral boundaries should never be traversed\u2014for example, physicians should never kill or deliberately harm their patients, even when patients request it. These convictions still run deep in the medical community, but those so convinced inhabit a culture and a profession that have lost the language (and the arguments) to make sense of these eminently reasonable propositions. Without such language, it can be hard for physicians, ethicists, and even patients to find their way. In this state of affairs, for example, we observe physicians who know that they should never kill their patients and are deeply unsettled by medical and societal pressures to the contrary but who have lost the language to talk about how that commitment to life and health is integral to medicine. With respect to such physicians and others, our task is to reintroduce a more fitting vocabulary to make sense of what they already know. If we succeed, our physician readers will leave this book with tools, concepts, and arguments that help them practice medicine well while enabling them to account for what they are up to as physicians. If our argument is sound, such readers' practice of medicine will have a coherence and goodness that others will both admire and want to emulate. Professional bioethicists and healthcare policymakers will also find resources to address some of the most contested ethical issues of our day. Finally, those whom the profession of medicine serves have something to gain, for our book helps identify what patients can reasonably expect of medicine. THE PROVIDER OF SERVICES MODEL IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT A full history of what we call the provider of services model goes beyond the scope of this book, but Gerald McKenney, in his book To Relieve the Human Condition, traces the PSM's roots to the writings of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Francis Bacon. Bacon saw in modern science the means to relieve and benefit the condition of man by reducing suffering and expanding the realm of human choice, ostensibly noble goals.\u00b9\u00b9 Unfortunately, as McKenney observes, this imperative to relieve suffering and expand choice finds in contemporary culture no larger framework of meaning in which to discern which suffering should be relieved and which choices should be accommodated. In the resulting moral vacuum, medicine comes to relieve any condition that an individual experiences as a burden; maximizing choice becomes the default. What McKenney calls the Baconian project takes the human body to be without any given purpose or end (telos)\u2014without what Aristotle called a final cause. Jeffrey Bishop, in The Anticipatory Corpse, traces out how modern medicine was birthed historically and argues that the loss of a teleological understanding of the body produced a medicine that treats the body as so much matter in motion and death as simply the terminus of that motion.\u00b9\u00b2 In Bishop's account, contemporary medicine has come to have no purpose except that which is given to it, post hoc, through the choices of those socially empowered to do so\u2014in our era, autonomous individuals. If an individual chooses to use medicine in a certain way\u2014to manipulate their body in some way or even to cause their own death\u2014the choosing itself is taken to make that use of medical technology ethical. Although McKenney, Bishop, and other critics of contemporary medicine such as H. T. Englehardt and Stanley Hauerwas all have different points of emphasis, each finds this turn toward maximizing choice and minimizing suffering according to the wishes of the patient to impoverish medicine. All urge, in different ways, the restoration of final causality (purpose) to our understanding of life, death, and medical practice. All call for medicine to be situated within an ethical framework in which illness and suffering, and the practices of medicine, are understood against a vision of humans flourishing as the mortal, rational animals that they are. The arguments we make in this book intersect with, diverge from, and are indebted to the work of these and other critics of contemporary medicine. However, our primary task is to articulate and defend our own account, and so we do not trace these intersections, divergences, or debts here at any length. THE WAY OF MEDICINE AS A TRADITION We have suggested that what we call the the Way of Medicine constitutes the practice of medicine, deepened, corrected, and shaped by the requirements of practical reason. Some readers may be suspicious of this language because they doubt the existence of the Way of Medicine. Such skepticism is likely to be heightened insofar as our account invokes the Hippocratic tradition of medicine. As Bishop puts the point, It is indeed odd to think that there has been real continuity between Hippocrates and the medicine of today.\u00b9\u00b3 The objection can be extended. Has not medicine always\u2014the skeptic might ask\u2014encompassed arguments, exceptions, contradictions, and confusions? When, if ever, has medicine been characterized by sufficient uniformity\u2014 hegemony, the dubious might say\u2014to justify speaking of the Way of Medicine? We take this objection seriously, as uniformity rarely exists with regard to any human activity. Consider a parallel problem with designating something as traditional. Traditional marriage\u2014for example, a man and woman joined in a permanent and exclusive union\u2014is found at least as often in the breach as in the observance. Nevertheless, just as the phrase traditional marriage identifies a core set of beliefs and practices, adopted by many and constituting a social imaginary that could be found deeply embedded within Western culture,\u00b9 so does the Way of Medicine designate a core set of beliefs and practices adopted by many and constituting a social imaginary within which doctors and patients have understood much of what has been expected of medicine and its practitioners. So while the Way of Medicine (like Hippocratic Medicine) has a somewhat idealized quality to it, it identifies a discernible tradition with characteristic practices along with ideas that make sense of those practices. More important, this tradition gives rise to what thinkers such as Edmund Pellegrino have called the internal morality of medicine,\u00b9 whereby the norms that govern physicians as physicians emerge from the particular needs to which the practice of medicine responds and the goods toward which the practice aims. The Way of Medicine identifies the traditional practice that, as McKenney writes, emphasized health as a standard of bodily excellence.\u00b9 Moreover, we do not claim that the internal morality of medicine is self-vindicating. As the example of torture reveals, practices can be unreasonable in themselves\u2014intrinsically contrary to human good and human flourishing. Or, as we observe with respect to medicine, an otherwise reasonable practice can grow corrupt, unreflective, or shallow. So one must engage in critical reflection to discern whether, to what extent, and in what dimensions a practice is in fact reasonable. Such reflection, however, is simply a form of attending to the requirements of practical reason, the natural law, or the Tao. This task, albeit difficult, is incumbent on us all. We need not, however, attempt the task on our own. Just as the practice of medicine has been deeply shaped by healers such as Hippocrates, Jesus, Maimonides, Avicenna, Hildegard von Bingen, Galen, Thomas Percival, and Dame Cicely Saunders, so have a host of philosophers, theologians, legal scholars, and clinicians given deep consideration to the requirements of practical reason in the medical context. The list would begin with Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and several of the healers mentioned above, but it would include, and not end with, twentieth-century thinkers such as Edmund Pellegrino, Leon Kass, Alasdair MacIntyre, and John Finnis.\u00b9 The Way of Medicine does identify a tradition, not understood as an unbroken continuity between the past and the present, but in the sense articulated by MacIntyre, as a historically extended, socially embodied argument.\u00b9 To our own development of that argument we now turn. CHAPTER ONE The Way of Medicine To help us investigate the Way of Medicine and to clarify how it differs from the provider of services model, we now introduce three patients whose clinical cases we follow throughout the remainder of the book: Cindy Parker is a twenty-year-old undergraduate student who presents to the student health clinic. Abe Anderson is a fifty-year-old carpenter who makes an appointment to see a local primary care physician. Nora Garcia is an eighty-year-old widow with multiple chronic diseases who presents for her quarterly appointment with her geriatrician. With these patients in mind, we return to our fundamental questions: What is medicine, and what is it for? What can Cindy Parker, Abe Anderson, and Nora Garcia reasonably expect of their physicians? What goods or ends give purpose to the practice of medicine? What does it mean to call medicine a profession, and how should its nature as a profession structure the life of the one who enters it? Oddly enough, physicians rarely ask themselves these questions, nor do medical educators ask them of their students. But the answers to these questions are central to the Way of Medicine. By contrast, the provider of services model (PSM) either ignores these questions or denies that they can be answered. The PSM denies that medicine has an end or a purpose that can be known. In the absence of a rational purpose for medicine, the morality of strangers stands in: physicians must at least gain consent before intervening upon the body of another. But the morality of strangers declines to take up the question that the Way of Medicine poses as central: what actions are, and what actions are not, essential to, acceptable for, or incompatible with the fundamental purposes of medicine and hence with the profession of the physician? Principlism, the most prominent ethical framework guiding the PSM, explicitly circumvents the question of what medicine is for. Tom Beauchamp and James Childress chose four principles\u2014beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and autonomy\u2014that seemed relevant to the kinds of practices in which medical practitioners typically engage, yet their framework neither specifies nor depends on an account of what those practices are supposed to do. Principlism encourages medical "}
