Excludes gift vouchers Considered one of the \"Master Crystals\", Lemurian Quartz Crystals teach oneness, reminding us that while we are all individuals, we are also connected to each other, and that we are all equal in Spirit. Lemurian Quartz Crystals help us maintain our connection to Spirit, aiding spiritual evolution, and have been used successfully in dream work. Lemurian Quartz crystals are a wonderful tool to use when clearing and activating the Chakras. An amazing healing crystal, Lemurian Quartz will assist in removing all types of energy blockages. Use a Lemurian Quartz Crystal for healing and meditation work. Also called \"Lemurian Seed Crystals\" or \"Lemurian Star Seeds\", Lemurian Quartz Crystals were originally found in Brazil. Metaphysical Legend states that there was once an advanced ancient civilization called Lemuria, similar to Atlantis but more spiritually developed and peaceful. As the end of their time on Earth was coming to an end, the Lemurians programmed these crystals to teach their messages of oneness and healing - messages that would be revealed when the energy on Earth was ready to receive them. The Lemurians then planted (or \"seeded\") the Lemurian Crystals, encoded with their ancient knowledge and wisdom, to be found centuries later by us. The legend continues to state that Lemurian Seed Crystals are planted in a grid pattern over the surface of the Earth and beyond, to other stars and dimensions. When you connect to a Lemurian Crystal and the energy it contains, you are also connecting to this grid of associated energies from the Earth, the stars, and beyond. Lemurian Crystals have a distinct appearance. Look carefully at a Lemurian Crystal and you will see horizontal striations or grooves, like \"bar codes,\" on one or more sides. Commonly, the sides of a Lemurian Crystal will have alternating striated and smooth faces. Lemurian Quartz Crystals are often found in the shape of a Laser wand, where the faces at the tip of a Lemurian Crystal are small and gently taper in size from base to tip. As opposed to Quartz that you program, Lemurian Quartz Crystals are a type of Quartz that you activate. As you meditate, rub your finger along the \"bar codes\" on the side of a Lemurian Quartz Crystal to activate and download Lemurian knowledge and connect to the Lemurian energy grid. NOTE: Natural Pink Lemurians were discovered in one pocket of the same mine in Minas Gerais, Brazil where the Lemurian Star Seed crystals were originally found. The pale pink coloring is due to a dusting of Hematite during the growth process. This coloring is within the layers of crystal growth. The \"New\" Pink Lemurians that are currently available also have a pink to orange pink coating of oxidized Hematite. However, these are more similar to Tangerine Quartz. The Hematite on these can easily be removed and/or may chip or flake off. Check for the alternating pattern of horizontal striations and smooth sides. If they are present, you have a Lemurian Star Seed. If the sides are smooth all the way around, what you have is Tangerine Quartz.
