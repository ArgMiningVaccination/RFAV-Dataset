Our immune system is the body's defender against foreign invaders . It works hard to fight against bacteria, viruses, and anything else that is attacking us from within . A strong immune system is the first line of defense in maintaining our health. Eating a well- balanced diet filled with a rainbow of colors from various fruits and vegetables is a great step to staying health y, but what nutrients we eat will support our body's ability to fight sickness during cold and flu season? This article will focus on some core micronutrients that have been found to be beneficial in supporting the immune system ; examples include vitamins C and D, B vitamins, zinc, and iron. It is important to remember , however , that including these dietary nutrients alone won't keep you heathy! Getting and staying healthy also requires lifestyle habits that promote health, such as getting adequate sleep, staying active and hydrated, minimizing stress levels, and attending regular preventative care visits. Sources of Micronutrients Let's take a look at a few of the immune strengthening micronutrients and their various food sources. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a water -soluble vitamin that supports the immune response and has been shown to limit the development of bacteria. Sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, melons, tomatoes, bell pepper, and broccoli. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a hormone made by the body in response to sunlight. It is a fat -soluble vitamin that can assist with controlling infection and inflammation in the body. In Minnesota, the sun is not strong enough to help our bodies make adequate vitamin D. Vi tamin D can be found naturally in very few foods ; some sources include fatty fish, egg yolk, and a select group of fortified foods (soy beverage, breakfast cereal, and orange juice ). For most people, the best way to meet their vitamin D needs is through a dietary supplement. See the nutrition education card Getting More: Vitamin D for s upplementa tion information.

Some good sources of B vitamins are salmon, leafy greens (spinach, collard or turnip greens, romaine), liver and other organ meats, beef, legumes, and fortified breakfast cereal. Zinc Zinc plays a central role in protecting the integrity of the immune system , supporting growth and functioning . It is an essential trace element whose sources include animal products, whole grains, wheat germs, beans, nuts and seeds , and tofu. Iron Iron is a fundamental element that play s a role in the development of the immune system. It supports immune cell creation and maturation. Sources of iron are both animal and plant - based , including meats, seafood, beans, nuts and seeds, spinach, and soy products. During critical periods of their life, c ertain populations may need iron supplementation, such as pregnant women, some infants, and those with an iro n deficiency. Read the Eating More Iron nutriti on education card for more information on iron . It is important to r emember that these micronutrients are not exclusive in supporting the immune system. Eating a diet rich in a variety of macro and micronutrients is essential in maintaining one's health. Vitamin Supplementation Getting the best source of nutrients is easily met through eating a variety of nutritious foods. Deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals can actually decrease the functioning of the immune system. For those that choose not to or cannot eat certain foods or food groups, vitamin and mineral supplementation is an option to fill in the gaps. Participants can typically meet their supplemental needs with the appropri ate amount of a recommended daily multivitamin . It is important to avoid \"megadosing \" on any on e specific vitamin or mineral as there are risks associated with higher levels of intake. WIC can give participants the information they need to make an informed choice about supplemental vitamin and mineral intake. WIC staff may encourage supplementation of vitamin D for all participants (Getting More: Vitamin D ). For pregnant women, iron, folic acid, and iodine (Prenatal Vitamins ) may need to be supplemented. Finally, folic a cid is recommended for all women of childbearing age (Stay Healt hy).
