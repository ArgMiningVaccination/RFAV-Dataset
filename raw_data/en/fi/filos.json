I have had a private practice in New York and New Jersey for the last three years. During that time I also worked as an integrative therapist at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital in Paterson, NJ. I worked in the pediatric hematology/oncology unit and in the labor and delivery units at St. Joseph's. We used reflexology, aromatherapy, acupuncture, massage and visual exercises to help the patients during their time at St. Joseph's. My passion is in helping active people and athletes who strive to remain healthy. I look forward to working with you and thank you for the opportunity to help you reach your life goals. MSAC (Masters of Acupuncture, DipLAc, (Diplomate of Acupuncture), C.SMA (Certified Sports Medicine Acupuncturist) Sports Medicine Acupuncture Dry Needling/Trigger Point Acupuncture Sports Medicine Acupuncture\u00ae (SMA) utilizes a combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Sports Medicine diagnostic techniques in order to determine an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis for the patient and their injury. Whether working with the professional or recreational athlete, I will accurately assess the mechanism and severity of the patient's musculoskeletal injury through a combination of TCM and Sports Medicine assessments. The information gained from these assessment techniques are combined with a TCM differential diagnosis, which provides an Eastern medical perspective on the athlete's injury and also on the overall health status of the patient and their ability to heal the injury. The combination of TCM and Sports Medicine diagnostic and assessment information sets the foundation for treatment and the unparalleled results that I am able to attain. Acupuncture Physical Medicine \u2014 Acupuncture Physical Medicine (APM) is a modern approach to acupuncture that combines classics-based French-meridian acupuncture with Western physical medicine techniques, most notably trigger point dry needling. APM assessment of a patient focuses on palpation of the body for myofascial constrictions, which are referred to as holding patterns. By studying Chinese and Japanese tight tender points, and undertaking a detailed study of myofascial trigger points, students learn how to navigate the body to release areas of obstruction. In this way APM assessment and treatment takes as its basis a patient's actual, physical, lived experience of illness or distress. Acupuncture Physical Medicine is especially well suited to treating the complex and chronic disorders that plague modern medicine; from chronic pain, chronic fatigue, multiple allergies, and stress disorders, to the symptomatic relief of internal medical complaints in the various organ systems of the body, including neurological, cardio-respiratory, gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and gynecological complaints. APM has also proven an effective complement to the psychological treatment of post trauma disorders. Tui Na/Myofascial Release \u2014 Classical Tui Na is one of the most powerful modalities in Chinese medicine, known for consistently producing clinical results. In fact, for many medical conditions that plague people today, Tui Na is the superior choice for effective treatment: Anxiety, Low Back Pain, Pain Darren Maynard hasn't specified any additional languages.
