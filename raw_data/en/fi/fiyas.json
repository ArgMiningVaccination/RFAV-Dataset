Section 312 requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit to the Congress a report on all assessed and voluntary contributions with a value greater than $100,000, including inkind, of the U.S. government to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies and related bodies during the previous fiscal year. Section 4(b) of the United Nations Participation Act further requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual report to Congress on the extent and disposition of all financial contributions (any amount) made by the United States during the preceding year to international organizations (including the UN and its affiliated agencies) in which the United States participates as a member. Due to the significant overlap in these two reporting requirements, this report for fiscal year 2021 addresses both by covering contributions of any amount to international organizations and multilateral entities (including the UN and its affiliated agencies) for fiscal year 2021. For each entry, the report provides specific information including: the responsible U.S. government agency and bureau, the account that was the source of the funding, the recipient entity, a description of the purpose of the activity that the funding supported, the amount obligated, and whether the Department considers the amount provided to be an assessed contribution. In some instances, the amounts presented are negative. These negative amounts reflect deobligations of funds previously obligated, including in prior fiscal years. This report includes all obligations and deobligations made in fiscal year 2021. Note, the grand total of contributions under Section 312 does not match that of contributions tabulated for Section 4(b) since the former is limited to contributions to U.N. and affiliated agencies and the latter covers the entirety of contributions to all international organizations. The report includes funding in support of certain multilateral entities that are not generally considered international organizations. The format of this report is similar to previous OMB reports on contributions. The Department of State collaborated with OMB on the production of the report and has also submitted it to Congress and will post it on its website at https://www.state.gov/u scontributions to international organizations , consistent with the United Nations Participation Act. Some of the information included in the report was provided to OMB by the Executive Branch agencies identified in the report. Each participating agency was responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information provided. Not all Executive Branch agencies provided information for inclusion in the report. The amounts of U.S. government funding included in this report are amounts of funding obligated in fiscal year 2021. The amounts of total funding to recipient entities from all sources in the report is generally by calendar year, except for funding for UN peacekeeping missions, which have a July 1 through June 30 financial year. The amounts of total funding were obtained from publiclyavailable documents produced by the recipient entities. Information for some entities was not available when the Department produced this report. Based on the latest information provided by the Department of State and other agencies, the report lists the approximate percentage of U.S. contributions to each entity compared with all the contributions to that entity in the relevant fiscal year. The amounts of total funding were obtained from publicly available documents produced by the recipient entities. Information for some entities was not available when the Department produced this report. For completeness, the report will be updated when the information does become available. The information provided on U.S. government funding includes financial and inkind support, including assessed contributions, voluntary contributions, grants, and other financial assistance to international organizations and multilateral entities. For each entry, the report provides specific information including: the responsible U.S. government agency and bureau, the account that was the source of the funding, the recipient entity, a description of the purpose of the activity that the funding supported, the amount obligated, and whether the Department considers the amount provided to be an assessed contribution. This report does not contain information on contracts for goods or services provided to the U.S. government, the cost to the U.S. government of the salaries and expenses of American employees detailed to the secretariats of international organizations, or the costs of reimbursing international organizations for taxes that American citizens and legal permanent residents employed by the organizations pay to U.S. federal, state, and local governments. Contributions to international financial institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are not included in this report but are the subject of a separate report to the Congress by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.
