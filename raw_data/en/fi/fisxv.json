Course Description The COVID epidemic has challenged all of us to review what we know about infectious disease. We will review the internal and external factors that increase susceptibility to infection, the differences in response to infection based on severity of symptoms, and the long-term consequences of disease. The evidence for therapies (pharmaceutical, natural, and innovative) will be discussed. How health disparities influence disease progression will be related to the current epidemic as well as other infections and health outcomes. Finally, we will discuss the vaccines in development. "}
