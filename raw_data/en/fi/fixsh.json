ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to extend my sincerest gr atitude to all those who supported and encouraged me in my educational and prof essional journey. Wo rds cannot express how honored I am to have such a wonderful support system. First, I would like to thank my di ssertation committee for their continuous encouragement throughout my writing process. Dr. Marley, I have always appreciated your ethical and clinical orientation to social work and I sincerely thank you for being a part of this final phase with me as my co mmittee chair. You have an ease about you that is warm and calm and therefore created a hopeful space for me in this oftentimes arduous process. Dr. Maynard, you have been such an inspiration to me. You have proven you are superhuman by all you can manage in your professional and personal life. I am so honored that you took the time to mentor me and very generously guide me throughout this entire process. Your know ledge and direction has been pr iceless. Your expertise in systematic reviews and meta-analyses inspir ed me to truly enjoy this methodology and gives me the drive to conti nue on this research journey. Dr. Gilbert, thank you for allowing me to teach one of your classes which is how we fortunately were able to cross paths. With all you had on your plate, you still were able to very ge nerously give your time and provide your insight and knowledge to my research. You truly have moved me with your selfless and continued support. You will always hold a special place in my heart. iii I would also like to thank the faculty who contributed to my growth and knowledge. Dr. Kenemore, thank you for seeing my clinical interests so clearly and steering me toward working at Perspectives, Ltd. The experience led me toward research on compassion fatigue and secondary trauma . Dr. Sokolec, thank you for making the statement on the first day of the Ph.D. program \"Life happens!\" when referring to unexpected events that might come up during our educational experience. This became a mantra that got me through those numerous , inevitable unexpected events! Dr. Kelly, thank you for introducing me to systematic re views and meta-analyses and subsequently introducing me to Dr. Maynard. Dr. Crawley, thank you for instructing me how to allow the writing process to \"marinate\". This stra tegy improved my writing sk ills significantly. I will be forever indebted to my previous employer, Joseph Monahan, JD, for seeing me as a social worker rather than a lawyer a nd encouraging me to pursue my Master's in Social Work many years ago. My warmest gratitude goes out to my co lleagues and friends that shared in this experience with me. I could not have had a better and more supportive cohort. Darby, Danielle, Jessica, Lina and Ma rissa - you all touched me in unique ways in these past several years. We laughed, we cried, but most importantly we endured and we got through! We truly did it together, as we had promised each other from the very beginning. Finally, I would like to thank my famil y. You have been so understanding and accommodating during this time. Mom, you have always been magical to me. You are such a strong, beautiful and intelligent woman. Without your unconditional love, support and advice, I would not have been successf ul. Dad, although you are no longer here on iv this earth, I know you have been there to guide me from abov e. I learned my drive and business sense from you and I am forever grateful. Jen, you also gave unconditional support and loved me. You are so selfless wh en it comes to helping me out and I truly appreciate everything you have done for me to make my lif e easier in these past three years. Jack and Casey, you are my beautiful children. You probably do not know this, but I made a promise to myself to only st udy and write during my two years of classes while you were sleeping or at school. You both were so young when I started my Ph.D. education. I did not want my studies to take time away from you both and leave any negative residue and taint at how you look at higher education. Two years later, with you both two years older, I then began writing at times while you both were around to enable you to understand better how to manage educa tional, personal and professional life. I hope I have been an inspiration to you and ha ve proven that it can be done with relative ease and balance. You both make me so incr edibly happy and my hear t bursts every time I see your beautiful faces. Fi nally, I give a heartfelt thank you to my very significant other, Carson. You have been with me th rough thick and thin and have always found the right words to inspire me whenever I was in need of a boost. I could not have done this without you and I am so proud to have you in my life. v For my unconditionally supportive parents, Georgene and Jack, my incredible sister, Jennifer, my very significant other, Carson, and my amazing children, Jack and Casey.

Mental health workers become more vulnerable to significant stress when they work with trauma victims, which can lead to many negative consequences that can affect their own health as well as their treatmen t of their clients. While there is much that we are learning about the cause s and outcomes of mental health workers' exposure to their clients' trauma, there has been less focu s on effectiveness of interventions. It is imperative for both the mental health worker and the clients with wh om they work with that it is known what treatment is effectiv e for mental health workers who experience negative effects from exposure to survivors' traumatic material. To date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducte d to examine the evidence of effects of interventions on compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization. The present study utilized systematic review methods and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize research and syst ematically examine interventions targeting compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization to examine the effects of interventions on symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic xii stress and vicarious traumati zation. A comprehensive search strategy resulted in the identification of two single group pre-posttest studies that met criteria for inclusion in the current study. Effect sizes as well as study, participant and intervention characteristics were coded and analyzed. The meta-analytic findings showed overall medium to very large effects of indicated interventions on the reduction of compassion fatigue and burnout symptoms, and an increase in compassion satisfaction. Though, it was alarming that only two studies met the inclusion criteria. With the constructs of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization bein g heavily present in th e literature for the past two decades, it seems warranted to lo cate more research regarding intervention effectiveness on this topic as the constructs relate to mental health workers. xiii CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Background Mental hea lth workers regularly come in contact with people who have suffered from a traumatic experience. Evidence of ps ychological effects of traumatic experiences is becoming more apparent in those who help the traumatized (Bride, 2007). Brady, Guy, Poelstra, and Brokaw (1999) surveyed 446 fe male psychotherapists who work with sexual abuse survivors, and 72% reported exposure to graphic details of trauma either \"sometimes\" or \"frequently\" in their work with clients. Brady et al. concluded that female psychotherapists are more likely to ex hibit trauma symptoms when they have a heavy caseload of sexual abuse clients or wo rk with a higher number of sexual abuse survivors over the length of their careers. In another su rvey of 221 mental health professionals, 45.2% reported moderate amounts of exposure to traumatic material, while 24.4% reported profound amounts of exposure to traumatic material (Kadambi & Truscott, 2004). Kadambi and Truscott ( 2004) found that 20.8% of their sample was experiencing moderate to severe levels of tr aumatic stress according to the results of the Impact of Events Scale (Horowitz, Wilner & Alvarez, 1979). Th e literature identifies these effects of exposure to traumatic events as compassion fatigue (CF), secondary traumatic stress (STS), and vicar ious traumatization (VT). 1 2 The mental health worker listens to the individual's traumatic stories in order to decipher how to most effectively help with treatment. These stories often include vivid descriptions of a traumatic experience, some times with reports of human-induced cruelty and abuse that elicit strong emotional e xpressions from the clients (Figley, 1999; Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995a; Resick & Ca lhoun, 2001). Pearlman and McCann (1990) found that psychotherapists negatively responded when their client's traumatic stories triggered a personal response within themselves . A disruption in the therapists' identity, intimacy and sense of safety was found. Thes e disruptions can greatly affect one's work with clients. A disruption in identity, for example, is related to when a psychotherapist becomes numb or desensitized when listening to clients' stories. When one's sense of safety is affected, feelings of fear of p hysical harm can become overwhelming causing one to develop safety practices that were not of concern prior to the exposure to traumatic stories. Disruptions in intimacy can be due to intrusive thoughts of negative experiences told by clients leading to a decreased level of enjoyment in physical intimacy for the therapist (Landis, 2010). According to Cunningham's (2003) study w ith social work clinicians, working with traumatized clients can be particularly challenging (Figley, 1995; Herman, 1992; Wilson & Lindy, 1994). In a study investigating the prevalence of STS among social workers, results indicated that social wo rkers are highly likely to have secondary exposure to traumatic experien ces through their work with traumatized individuals, and the social worker is likely to experience symptoms of STS as a result of this exposure (Bride, 2007). Furthermore, Cunningham (2003) argues McCa nn and Pearlman's (1990) 3 point that workers who work with traumatized clients ar e in unique situations in comparison to other \"difficult populations\" b ecause of the worker's exposure \"to the emotionally shocking images of horror and suffering that are charac teristic of serious trauma\" (p. 134). Studies that investigate CF, STS, and VT in workers who work with the traumatized have found varying levels of reported severity (Elwood, Mott, Lohr, & Galovski, 2011). Some studies report that symptoms in mental health workers who work with the traumatized client are low level (Adams & Riggs, 2008; Collins & Long, 2003a; Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002; Wee & Myers, 2003), although other studies report that secondary trauma symptoms are moderate to high levels (Bride, Jones, & MacMaster, 2007; Conrad & Keller-Guenther, 2006; Hargrave, Scott, & McDowall, Johnson & Hunter, 1997; Wa y, VanDeusen, Martin, Applegate, & Jandle, 2004). The differences in the varying ra nges in severity could be due in part to measurement differences and/or to the varying levels of the secondary trauma exposures. Some examples of measurement tools utilized to measure severity of secondary trauma symptoms are the Impact of Events Scale (I ES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979); the Traumatic Stress Institute (TSI) Belief S cale (TSIBS; Pearlman & Mac Ian, 1995); the Trauma Attachment Belief Scale (TABS; Pearlman, 2003); the Compassion Satisfaction/ Fatigue Self-Test for Helper s (CSFST; Figley & Stamm, 199 6); the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL; Stamm, 2009); and th e Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS; 4 Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, & Figley, 2003). Furthermore, Elwood et al. (2011) suggest that the differences in levels of STS sympto ms can occur due to a worker's individual characteristics such as gender (Kassa m-Adams, 1995) and age (Ghahramanlou & Brodbeck, 2000) as well as organizational envi ronment characteristics such as training and supervision (Rudolph & Stamm, 1999) as well as access to support groups for staff (Landis, 2010). The construct of burnout is often intermixed with CF, STS and VT. Maslach (1976) defines burnout as \"a syndrome of em otional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment that can o ccur among individuals who do people work of some kind\" (p. 3). According to the rese arch, burnout appears to affect individuals as a result of organizational issu es such as: (a) having a sust ainable workload; (b) feeling competition in the workplace; (c) lacking a supportive environment; and (d) feeling deprived of what one deserves (Van der Venne t, 2002). Therefore, bur nout is viewed as separate from CF, STS and VT since these c onstructs are found to be caused by hearing one's traumatic stories as well as the level of the mental health worker's empathic engagement. Controversy that surrounds the topics of burnout, CF, STS and VT is whether or not some of these constructs actually exist. Sabin-Farrell and Turpin (2003) posit that reactions that one has that ar e related to hearing traumatic material may simply be just normal, short-term psychological or physical responses. Adversely, claims have been made by Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995b) that the consequences of VT can be severe and 5 have immeasurable costs. As a result of these claims, an increased number of materials on the impact of VT have been published. The constructs of CF, STS, and VT are based on symptoms and effects caused by traumatic experiences, whereas burnout is rela ted mostly to one's work environment that may or may not include traumatic events. Recently, strong empirical evidence in research has focused on burnout being primarily caused by work environmental stressors, rather than personal problems. Accordi ng to Jenkins and Baird (2002), a finding of moderate overlap with burnout supports the construct vali dity of STS, CF and VT. However, Jenkins and Baird (2002) caution that these constructs should be no more than moderately related due to the theoretically di fferent impact of trauma exposure compared to the strains caused by workplace structure issu es. \"Burnout is relate d to chronic tedium in the workplace rather than exposure to specif ic kinds of client problems such as trauma (Schauben & Frazier, 1995), and STS and VT have not been linked to workplace conditions\" (Jenkins & Baird, 2002, p. 425). These findings set burnout apart from the other three constructs, therefore burnout will be excluded from the search terms in the systematic review. Costs of CF, STS and VT Compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicar ious traumatization have many implications for mental health work ers who suffer from them. The negative consequences associated with those who suffe r from CF, STS or VT include nightmares, intrusive thoughts, disturbing im agery along with affective states such as anger, sadness, and anxiety that correspond to their clients' traumatic ma terial (McCann & Pearlman, 6 1990). Figley (1995) categorized reactions trauma workers experience when working with trauma survivors: (a) indicators of psychological distress or dysfunction; (b) cognitive shifts; and (c) rela tional disturbances. Collins and Long (2003) elaborate on these categories and also include studies that supp ort the findings: 1) Indicators of psychological distress include: Distressing emotions, including sadness or grief, depression, anxiety, dread and horror, fear, rage, or shame (Clark & Gioro, 1998; Harbert & Hunsinger, 1991; McCann & Pearlman, 1990); Intensive imagery by the trauma worker of the clients' traumatic material, such as nightmares, flashbacks and images (Figley, 1995; Herman, 1992; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Stamm, 1995); Numbing or avoidance of efforts to elicit or work with traumatic material from the client (Figley, 1995; Herman, 1992; McCann & Pearlman, 1990); Somatic headaches or gastrointestinal 1995; Herman, or compulsive behavior, incl uding compulsive Gioro, 1998; Davis, 1996); and/or Impairment of day-to-day functioning in social and personal roles, including missed or cancelled appointments, decr eased used of supervision, chronic 7 lateness, and feelings of isolation, alie nation, or lack of appreciation (Dutton & Rubinstein, 1995). 2) Cognitive shifts (Janoff-Bulman, 1992; McCann & Pearlman, 1990). Changes in: dependence/trust to reveal a chronic suspicion of others; safety to a heightened sense of vulnerability; power to an extreme sense of helplessness; and independence to a loss of pe rsonal control and freedom. 3) Relational disturbances: personal relationships can suffer as a resu lt of increased stress or difficulties related to trust and intimacy (C lark & Gioro, 1998; White, 1998). Moreover, Way et al. (2004) lis t trauma effects of clinic ians who treat survivors and clinicians who treat offenders and found they share similar VT effects. Way et al. list these effects which include disrupted c ognitive schemas (Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Rich, 1997), intrusive s, 1999; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Rich, 1997; Steed & Bicknell, 2001), decreased sense of personal safety and safety of significant others (Jackson et al., 1997; Rich, 1997), hype rvigilance around strangers (Jackson et al., 1997; Steed & Bicknell, 2001 ), difficulties with trust and intimate relationships (Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Rich, 1997), self-esteem issues (Pearlman & MacIan, 1995), increased cynicism, depresse d mood and discouragement, disruptions in sexuality, and increased subs tance use (Rich, 1997). Vicarious trauma symptoms and reac tions can be immediate which include nightmares, feelings of being unsafe, avoidi ng activities that re mind one of traumatic 8 incidents that were heard, feelings of ange r, and numbness of emotions (Bober & Regehr, 2006). Trauma effects that have been found to be longer term are emotional and physical exhaustion, feelings of hopelessness, and view ing others with suspicion and cynicism (Illiffe & Steed, 2000; Ortlepp 1999; Schauben & Frazier, 1995). Causes and Correlates of CF, STS and VT Due to the serious effects of CF, STS and VT, researchers from several different professions with fields of practice, in cluding social work, psychiatry, psychology, nursing, and emergency mental health have been studying and tryi ng to understand and address the problem. A large body of literature has been accumulating over the past few decades related to the causes and correl ates associated with CF, STS, and VT. The causes of CF, STS, and VT have been given extensive attention in the empirical research in the field. Research points to a number of factors that have demonstrated some causal or correlational relationship to CF, STS, and VT. These will be discussed more extensively in the literature review, but some of these factors/causes include individual, organizational, and community/conte xtual factors. Individual factors identified as causal or correlational to CF, STS, and VT include personal trauma history (Cunningham, 2003; 1999; Pearlman & MacIan, (Dunkley & Whelan, 2006a; Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002), self-care strategies (Way et al., 2004), self-efficacy (Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002), level of experience (Adams et al., 2001; 9 Crothers, 1995; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995) , 1999), age (Ghahramanlou & Brodbeck, 2000), the number or percentage of trauma cases on a therapist's caseload (Bober & Regehr, Best, & Kramer, 1992; Schauben & Frazier, 1995), and length of time providing sexual abuse treatment (Brady et al., 1999; Chrestman, 1999; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Rich, 1997; Steed & Bicknell, 2001). Organizational factors associated wi th CF, STS, and VT include access to supervision or consultation (F arrenkopf, 1992; Follette et al., 1994; Jackson et al., 1997; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Rich, 1997) and tr aining for new and experienced clinicians (Chrestman, 1999; Follette et al., 1994; Ortl epp & Friedman, 2002; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). A community/contextual factor of social support has also been found to have an effect on CF, STS, and VT (Chrestman, 1999; Follette et al., 1994; Jackson et Friedman, 2002; Rich, 19 97; Schauben & Frazier, 1995). Compassion fatigue, secondary trauma stress, and vicarious traumatization are increasingly being recognized in the mental health field as a considerable risk for mental health workers who work with clients who have been traumatized (Dunkley & Whelan, 2006). When mental health workers are affect ed by CF, STS and VT and subsequently suffer negative symptoms, workers can run the risk of becoming ineffective in their work with clients. Researchers and practitioners have developed various strategies targeting a number of risk factors that have been associated with CF, STS, and VT resulting in intervention strategies being im plemented in various settings. 10 Interventions Targeted at Decreasing Negative Effects of CF, STS and VT The number of interventions designed to decrease symp toms of CF, STS and VT have been growing in the past decade. Re searchers in the trauma field are recognizing more and more that traumatized clients are not the only individuals in need of interventions. Mental health workers who are working with these traumatized clients are becoming affected and displaying negative sympto ms. As a result, the attention given to addressing the issue of workers who are second arily traumatized has resulted in a number of different modalities of interventions being modified and developed to decrease symptoms of CF, STS and VT in mental health workers. Because CF, STS and VT are recognized problems among various professions, including social work, psychology, criminal ju stice, emergency response teams, lawyers, doctors, nurses and others, the conceptual izations of the problem as well as the approaches used to intervene with CF, STS a nd VT are diverse. In tervention strategies targeting CF, STS and VT range from individual level interventions to various organizational level modalities. Statement of the Problem Compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization have received widespread attention in the l iterature due to an in creased awareness of negative effects mental health workers expe rience when working with people who have been traumatized. Research has shown that th e mental health worker s' responsibility of listening to clients' and patients' ex periences of human suffering may cause psychological symptoms, which in turn may lead to CF, STS, or even VT (Adams, 11 Figley, & Recent research indicates that between 5% and 15.2% of therapists experience STS and VT symptoms at clinical levels (Adams & Riggs, 2008; Bride, 2007; Kadambi & Truscott, 2004). Mental health workers become more vulne rable to significant stress when they work with trauma victims, which can lead to many negative consequences that can affect their clients. Professionals who are affected by STS are at a higher risk of making poor professional judgments than those who are not affected (Bride, Radey, & Figley, 2007; (1995) and Newmann and Gamble ( 1995) assert that research has shown that defense mechanisms, such as detachment a nd non-empathic distancing, that mental health workers use to deal with client's traumatic experiences can l ead to clients feeling emotionally isolated and det ached from those workers that are trying to help them. Victim blaming (Astin, 1997) and the disrupt ion of empathic abilities that result in therapeutic impasses or incomplete therapie s (Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995a) have also been found in therapists' work who has suffered from STS and VT. This ineffective care can be quite detrimental to the client who seeking compet ent treatment. According to Herman (1992) psychological trauma theory pos its that traumatic events can lead to the trauma effects of psychological numbing, flooding and hypervigilance. Although these trauma affects occur in order to give the tr aumatized person the ability to cope with the event, they can also lessen one's ability to function optimally in the following weeks and possibly months after the traumatic even t (Newman, Kaloupeck, & Keane, 1996). 12 While there is much that we are learning about the causes and outcomes of mental health workers' exposure to their clie nts' trauma, there has been less focus on effectiveness of interventions. It is impera tive for both the mental health worker and the clients with whom they work with that it is known what treatment is effective for mental health workers who experience negative effects from exposur e to survivors' traumatic material. To date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducted to examine the evidence of effects of interventions on CF, STS and VT. It is imperative that the evidence of effects of interventions be synt hesized and analyzed to inform practice and policy in this area. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study is to (1) conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions targ eting vicarious traumatization, compassion fatigue, and secondary traumatic stress to examine the effects of interven tions on symptoms of vicarious traumatization, compassion fatigue, and seco ndary traumatic stress in mental health workers; (2) to provide evidence-based recommendations to inform social work practice; and (3) recommend priorities for future research. This review will compare various modalities of interventions including individual, peer/collegial, agency, and organizational to explore similarities and di fferences in populations served, services provided and outcomes of measured effectiveness. 13 Research Questions The four research questions guiding this study are: 1) How are intervention researchers operat ionalizing compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization? 2) Do interventions targeting compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization affect symptoms and signs of psychological distress, cognitive shifts, and re lational disturbances? 3) Are there differences in effects be tween individual and organizational level modalities with regard to techniques u tilized and effects on CF, STS and VT? 4) Are different modalities of interventions more effective than others in decreasing symptoms of CF, STS and VT? Significance of the Study Every day mental health workers are tr aumatized by their clients' stories and experiences related to their own traumatic events in their lives. Research has shown that due to this secondary traumati zation from hearing clients' traumatic stories as well as witnessing emotions felt by the cl ient such as horror and fear, mental health workers can suffer psychological problems that have been defined as compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization. Since these are three terms that are used interchangeably in the literature, a synthesis of research that identifies the effectiveness of various interventions that are targeted to decrease symptoms of CF, VT, and STS would be beneficial for the mental health community. Determining which interventions are more effective by synt hesizing and combining studies using a systematic 14 methodology and meta-analysis can add to and e nhance the current empirical literature in the research community. A systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the intervention (or outcome) research in this area of compassi on fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization is grea tly needed and warranted. To date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducted to synthesi ze the evidence of eff ects of interventions with mental health workers who are experien cing negative affects related to their work with traumatized individuals. This review and meta-analysis will fill this gap in the literature and provide eviden ce based recommendations to guide practice and policy. Relevance to Social Work Professional social workers are the na tion's largest group of mental health services providers (www.naswdc.org, looked up on 2/9/2012). NASW (2012) states that there are more clinically trained social wo rkers than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Over 40% of a ll disaster mental health volunteers trained by the American Red Cross are professiona l social workers (NASW, 2012). Social workers who provide mental h ealth services are often in positions within hospitals, community mental health centers, social servi ce organizations, or criminal justice settings working with individuals who have experienced trauma at some point in their lives. These individuals who have experienced trau ma often have the need to share their traumatic stories with a social worker. Due to their exposure to these traumatic stories, social workers can suffer negative physical a nd emotional consequences because of their absorption of this trauma from their clients. 15 According to McCann and Pearlman's ( 1990) definition of vicarious trauma, the cognitive schemas or core beliefs of the me ntal health worker can change due to the exposure of the traumatic imagery that the clie nts present. This change in the mental health worker's cognitive sche ma may cause a disruption in th e view of self, others, and the world in general (McCann & Pearlm an, 1990; Sabin-Farrell & Turpin, 2003). Additional negative consequences of vicarious trauma suffere d by mental health workers found by Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995) can co mprise of a negative impact on feelings and relationships, poor decision making, social and professional withdrawal, substance abuse, and clinical problems. Bober and Regehr (2006) address the issue of blaming the victim when discussing intervention strategies for ment al health professionals: As mental health professionals dedi cated to the fair and compassionate treatment of victims in society, we have been strong in vocalizing concerns that those who are abused and battered not be blamed for their victimization and their subsequent traumatic response. Yet when addressing the distress of colleagues, we have focused on the use of individual coping strategies implying that those who feel traumatized may not be balancing life and work adequately and may not be making effective use of leisure, self-care, or supervision. (p. 8) In light of these findings, it is essential to assist the social work profession in examining the effectiveness of interventi ons for mental health workers who are experiencing secondary trauma. Numerous interventions are bei ng utilized; however, it is unclear which, if any, are effective or if some are more effective than others. Knowledge gained from this study can directly inform the ways in which social workers get help if they are experiencing secondary tr auma as well as inform how social workers 16 intervene in systems and with clients w ho are experiencing symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss, and vicarious traumatization. CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW History of Trauma Constructs Vicarious traumatization, also referred to in the literature as compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and burnout, has been an area of research that has recently been highlighted in the literature to ha ve inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous definitions. These terms have been app lied interchangeably in many studies. The validity of the results in many studies come s into question by researchers due to the unclear definitions and the interchangeable use of seemingly parallel terms. Some controversies that surround the topics of burnout, compassion fatigue (CF), secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious traumati zation (VT) are whether or not some of these constructs actually exist. The lack of conceptual clar ification in the literature has allowed for many different authors to crea te their own versions of the terminology, sometimes versions that suit their own rese arch needs (Beck, 2011). Providing a brief historical overview of burnout, CF, STS and VT will help to clar ify the four terms according to the current definitiona l trends in the literature. According to Baranowsky, Gentry and Schultz (2005), studies began about the psychological effects of trauma related to sh ell shock and combat fatigue in the late 1800s. In 1907, Baranowsky et al. reported that Carl Jung referred to what is now called \"compassion fatigue\" when he discussed the co ncept of countertransference. Jung was 17 18 concerned about therapists' exposure to their client's traumatic scen arios in sessions and how the exposure may have a negative effect on the therapist. In the 1970s studies on the effects of psychotherapy on the treating therapists began to surface (Baranowsky et al., 2005). Al so in the 1970s Maslach and Jackson first identified the construct of burnout (Maslach & Leiter, 1997). Ma slach (1976) defines burnout as \"a syndrome of emotional exhaus tion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who do people work of some kind\" (p. 3). At this time, burnout was seen as a personal problem. Recent research on burnout has now been expanded to include not only pers onal issues but orga nizational issues as well. In 1980 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980). Since 1980, the psychological e ffects of traumas have been formally recognized. The first people to be diagnosed with PTSD we re the veterans of the Vietnam War. In 1983, Figley (1995) originated the concep t of secondary traumatic stress (STS) when referring to sexual assa ult survivors and combat ve terans' significant others. Devilly, Wright, and Varker ( 2009) contend that STS was act ually originated after the revision to the DSM-III in the mid to late 1990's when Criterion A for PTSD was revised to include witnessing or hearing about threat ened death or serious injury occurring to another individual ( American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 1994). 19 By the 1990s, the field of traumatology was recognized (Baranowky et al., 2005). Research studies on the reactions of therapists to listening to their client's traumatic stories began at this time. Vicarious traumatization (VT) was first conceptualized by McCann and Pearlman (1990) in 1990. Vicarious traumatization was originally focused on the effects of working with trauma survivor s on the therapist. Although this continues to be the focus in the literature, currently more emphasis is placed upon the change in cognitions with the therapist after th ese exposures to traumatic material. Joinson (1992) first used the term compassion fatigue (CF) while studying burnout in emergency room department nur ses. Between 1992 and 1995, Figley (1995) renamed secondary traumatic stress to compassi on fatigue because he felt that this term was less stigmatizing and had a more positiv e connotation. Figley (2002) has described CF as a form of caregiver burnout. In 2003, Salston and Figley (2003) made a recommendation to eliminate th e burnout component in CF because this was arbitrarily added in some research studies when the CF construct was not found to be strongly correlated with Maslach's Burnout Inventory (MBI) tool. The construct of burnout is the first term that refers to worker stress that appeared in the literature. The foundati on of burnout has been solid a nd stable in the research. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) measurem ent tool has been found to be valid and reliable for over a decade and has been utilized in the 25 plus years of research (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). Reviewing how researchers operati onalize compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization as constructs can inform the definitional 20 issues that surround them. Systematically reviewing the literatu re and looking at the interventions utilized for each of the construc ts individually as well as seeking a deeper understanding of how subjects ar e included and excluded in st udies can bring researchers closer to the possibility of grouping the three constructs in a more meaningful way. Definitions Vicarious traumatization (VT), also referre d to in the literature as compassion fatigue (CF), secondary traumatic stress (STS ) and burnout, has been an area of research that recently has been highlighted in the literature to have in consistent definitions. These terms have been applied interchangeably in many studies which have led to considerable confusion in distinguishing these terms from one another. Craig and Sprang (2010) concluded that \"to date, there is no definitive data that suggests the constructs are conceptually distinct, suggesting that a fina l decision over the most appropriate term to use in any given situation would be premature\" (p. 320). Burnout Of the four terms, burnout is the first to appear in the literature. The literature review by Edwards et al. (2000) shows that th ere is not a standard definition of burnout. Variations of Maslach's defin ition appear to be the most prominent in the literature. Maslach (1976) defines burnout as \"a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who do people work of some kind\" (p. 3). Maslach (2001) establishes that emotional exhaustion is the key feature of burnout. Depersonalization, the second feature of burnout, also includes the feel ing of cynicism. The interp ersonal context of burnout is 21 the negative, callous or exceedingly detached responses to various aspects of the job. Maslach's findings demonstrate that reduced personal accomplishment within burnout is in relation to feelings of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity at work. More recently, research has shown that bur nout occurs due to a disparity between the worker and the job (Leiter & Laschinger, 2006). According to Sabo (2011), research supports six work-life issues that involve the disparity between the worker and the job as the most plausible explanation for burnout. These six issues are: work overload, lack of control, lack of reward, lack of community, lack of fairne ss, and value conflict (Leiter & Laschinger, 2006; Leiter & Maslach, 2004). Compassion Fatigue Most authors refer to Figley's (1995) definition of compassi on fatigue (CF) in their research (Boscarino, Adams, & Figle y, 2010; Devilly et al., 2009; Sexton, 1999). describes compassion fatigue as \"identical to seconda ry traumatic stress disorder (STSD) and is the equivalent of PTSD\" (p. xv). Figley defines CF as the stress connected with the level of empathic engagement the worker has to the victim or client. Through this empathic engagement, the worker can experience emotions and symptoms which are similar to those of their client (F igley, 1995). Figley adds that CF is \"the reduced capacity or interest in being empath etic or 'bearing the su ffering of clients' and is the 'natural consequent behaviors and emotions resulting from knowing about a traumatizing event experienced by a person\" (p. 2). 22 Secondary Traumatic Stress Craig and Sprang (2010) assert that Figley (1993, 1995) created the term \"secondary traumatic stress\" when he was extending the concept of vicarious trauma, which was coined by McCann and Pearlman (1990). Figley (1995) renamed STS as CF because he felt that CF has less stigma attached to it. Since Figley has been credited with the formulation of the concept of STS which he then later renamed to \"compassion fatigue,\" a majority of the authors defer to Figley's (1995) definition of STS as \"the natural, consequent behaviors and em otions resulting from knowledge about a traumatizing event experienced by a significant other. It is the stress resulting from helping or wanting to help a traumatized or suffering person\" (p. 10). Some authors allege that STS' rapid onset sets STS apart from other concepts (Beck, 2011; Devilly et al., 2009; Figley, 1995; Sabin-Farrell & Turpin, 2003; Sexton, 1999). Bocarino et al. (2010) introduce STS in their research as the same concept as CF and VT. Jenkins and Baird (2002) cite that STS and VT have the same definition; however Stamm (1999) contends that STS implies a temporary stress response. Vicarious Traumatization The fourth and final concept to be define d is vicarious traumatization (VT). The definition to which most researchers defer is Pearlman and Saakvitne's (1995) definition which states that vicarious traumatization is \"the cumulative transformation in the inner experience of the therapist that comes about as a result of empathic engagement with the client's traumatic material\" (p. 31). 23 Stamm (1999) defines STS as only a tempor ary stress response with a rapid onset whereas VT is viewed as a cognitive shift w ithin the therapist's th inking that accumulates over time and affects one's world view (McCann & Pearlman, 1990). Figley (1995) disagrees with McCann and Pearlman's (1990) notion of accumulation and argues that only one severe exposure to a client's traumatic material can lead to VT. Sabin-Farrell and Turpin (2003) conclude that the evidence for VT to exist within trauma workers is inconsistent and ambiguous. Discussion In general, the authors seem to agree on th e definitions of the terms, but the terms are subsequently misused or generalized into si milar concepts. It is difficult to determine what the actual causes of CF, STS and VT are when the literature is not consistent with the usage of the constructs. There are many inconsistencies with th e ways in which the phenomenon of secondary trauma is defined and operationalized in the trauma research. VT appears to be used as the default term when resear ching compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatizati on. This is due to the fact th at VT relates specifically to trauma work as well as incorporating the intr insic and extrinsic factors that can cause VT (Dunkley & Whelan, 2006a). Resulting from the confusion about the term s to describe the effects of trauma work, various authors have made attempts to clarify the concepts (Jenkins & Baird, 2002; Sabin-Farrell & Turpin, 2003). Sabin-Farrell and Turpin be gin clarifying by simply stating that STS and VT occur specifically when working with trauma survivors whereas 24 burnout and CF can occur with any type of client work. VT stands out because by definition it is an actual cogni tive change within the therap ist whereas STS is related to social and emotional symptomology (Jenki ns & Baird, 2002). When disruptions in therapists' cognitions were assessed, the re sults were inconclusive (Sabin-Farrell & Turpin, 2003). Additionally Sabin-Farrell a nd Turpin found that some studies looking for VT did not include any assessments for disrup tions in cognitions which make evidence, if any VT exists, unclear. Methodol ogical issues also arise sinc e the majority of research on VT is done through questionnaires. Valid ated assessment tools are not currently available to measure VT (S abin-Farrell & Turpin, 2003). Najjar, Davis, Beck-Coon, and Doebbelin g's (2009) systematic review of 57 compassion fatigue studies report their inability to adequately state c onclusions due to the ambiguous definition of CF that fails to set itsel f apart from other related constructs in the literature, such as burnout, STS and VT. Na jjar et al. (2009) acknow ledge that there are indeed accepted similarities wi thin the research among all fo ur constructs, but there are also differences that need to be further resear ched in future studies. The similarities of CF, burnout, VT and STS that Najj ar et al. (2009) highlight ar e that they \"can be caused by emotional engagement with patients, they can negatively affect th e services provided by the healthcare professional, they share risk factors of empathic ability and interpersonal demands and they result in ps ychological distress (Jen kins & Baird, 2002; Najjar et al., 2009, p. 271). Some have proposed that VT is differentiated from STS in that VT is a transformation e xperienced by mental health wo rkers due to their empathic engagement with the patients' trauma materi al, which is a cumulative process (Najjar et 25 al., 2009; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995) whereas STS is a reference to a set of psychol ogical symptoms that are acqui red through the exposure to a patients' suffering from traumatic experien ces (Baird & Kracen, 2006; Najjar et al., 2009). Currently there are no agreed upon definitions, tools or measures that can adequately be utilized to differentiate the four concepts therefore, studies have recurrently used different terms to refer to the same concept which has subsequently led to the inconsistencies in the literature (Najjar et al., 2009). The majority of the empirical studies in the area of seconda ry trauma have used the vicarious traumatization (VT) construct. Due to this reason, the term vicarious traumatization or VT will generally be used throughout this paper unles s another term has been used specifically in the research cited. Measures Research has been significantly limited in the area of trauma work due to the confusion that surrounds the concepts of burnout, CF, STS and VT. The controversial issues of these four constructs are not only definitional issues, but also are associated with the reliability and validity of the meas ures utilized to study these concepts. Four main instruments reported in the literature are designed to assess for secondary trauma. The Compassion Fatigue Self-Test (CFST; Figley, 1995) and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL; Stamm, 2005) both assess for CF and STS. The ProQOL is the more current version (and third revision) of the CFST (Stamm, 2005). The Traumatic Stress Institute's Belief S cale, Revision L (TSI-BSL; Pearlman, 1996) 26 assesses for VT. And finally, the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS; Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, & Fi gley, 2003) is used to measure STS. Three additional instruments are useful for assessing for other more generalized trauma related symptoms and coping strategi es. These instruments are: the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R; 1983); the Event Scale Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979); and the Coping Strategi es Inventory (CSI; Bober, Regehr, & Zhou, 2006). Compassion Fatigue Self-Test (CFST) The Compassion Fatigue Self-Test (CFST) was originally designed psychotherapists by Figley (1995) which incl uded two subscales for compassion fatigue and burnout. The instrument was later revi sed to the Compassion Satisfaction/Fatigue Self-Test (CSFST) by Figley and Stamm between 1995 and 1998 to include a third subscale for compassion satisfaction (see Append ix A). This 66-item scale assesses for compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction and burnout with a 6-point Likert scale (0 = never, 5 = very often ). Reported internal consistency re liability alphas range from 0.86 to 0.96 on two subscales from this instrument (i.e., compassion fatigue and burnout) and a structural reliability coefficient (Tucke rs) of .91 (Figley & Stamm, 1996; Jenkins & Baird, 2002). Good evidence of reliability and in ternal consistency al pha scores for each of the three subscales has been found in th e psychometric properties of the CSFST (Bride, Radey, Figley, 2007; Stamm, 2002). A ccording to Stamm, the alpha reliability on the compassion fatigue subscale is .87 with a 16.04 standard deviation. The burnout subscale reliability is .90 with a 10.78 standard deviation. Finally, the alpha reliability of 27 the compassion satisfaction subscale is .87 w ith a 13.15 standard deviation. Jenkins and Baird (2002) state that although there has been wide application of the CFST and CSFST, there is little published resear ch. Scores have been relate d to greater se condary trauma vulnerability for therapists with trauma hi stories (Good, 1996) and to level of education and training (Good, 1996; Rudolph, Stamm, & Stamm, 1997). Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) is a 30-item instrument with a 6 point Likert scale (1 = never , 6 = very often) that screens for compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. Compassion satisf action (CS) is the pleasure gained from having the ability to do the work within one 's profession well (Stamm, 2005). This instrument emerged to replace the CFST for two reasons: the CFST has known psychometric problems & Stamm, Jenkins & Baird, 2002; Larson, Stamm, & Davis, 2002); and the name change was to support positive system change to prevent or ameliorate the negative effects of careg iving and reinforce th e positive effects of providing care (Stamm, 2005). There are thr ee subscales within the ProQOL that are psychometrically unique and cannot be comb ined with the other scores. The first subscale is compassion satisfaction that has an alpha scale reliab ility of 0.87. The second, burnout, has an alpha scale reliability of 0.72. Compassion fatigue is the third subscale with an alpha scale reliability of 0.80. Traumatic Stress Institute's Belief Scale, Revision L (TSI-BSL) The Traumatic Stress Institute's Belief S cale, Revision L (TSI-BSL) is an 80-item instrument with a 6-point Likert scale (1 = disagree strongly, 6 = agree strongly ) that is 28 used to measure VT symptoms by assessing for disrupted cognitive schemas. \"The TSI BSL measures the disruptions in beliefs about self and others that arise from psychological trauma or from vicarious exposure to trauma material through psychotherapy or other helpi ng relationships\" (Devilly et al., 2009, p. 377). Disruptions in five cognitive schemas/beliefs are measured. These five cognitive schemas/beliefs are: safety, trust, esteem, intimacy, and control. Each cognitive schema/belief is related to self and others, yielding 10 and other- control (Jenkins & Baird, 2002). Scores obtained include a total score calcu lated from the sum of all responses; a higher score indicates greater cognitive schema disruption. The average score for mental health professionals is 166.83 (Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Cunningham (1996), Lee (1995), and Pearlman and MacIan (1995) f ound higher scores among trauma therapists with personal trauma histories, but Sc hauben and Frazier (1 995), Green (1996), and Simonds (1996) did not (Jenki ns & Baird, 2002). These discrepancies in scores could be attributed to participants' concern about a ppearing weak or affected by their personal trauma history and then adjusting their res ponses accordingly. Also, it is unclear if any of the participants had previous treatment for their personal histories of trauma which could make their score lowe r at that point in time. Pearlman's review of unpublished studies reported overall inte rnal consistency reliability of 0.98 (Pearlman, 1996), with s ubscale reliabilities ranging from 0.77 for other-control to 0.91 for self -esteem (Jenkins & Baird, 2002). Schauben and Frazier 29 (1995) studied psychologists and counselors working with sexual violence survivors and reported internal consis tency reliabilities of five sel ected subscales ranging from 0.68 to 0.84. Satisfactory reliabilitie s are also reported by Br ady et al. (1999), Cunningham (1996), and Pearlman and MacIan (1995). Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) The STSS is a 17-item instrument with a 5-point Likert scale that measures STS by the frequency of intrusion, avoidance and ar ousal symptoms associ ated with indirect exposure to traumatic incident s through professional relationships with clients who have been traumatized over the past seven da ys (Bride et al., 2003). The STSS has good reliability of 0.93, utilizing Cronbach's alpha for the total score. According to Devilly, Wright, and Varker (2009), the STSS is very unique compared to other instruments that measure traumatic stress symptoms because it re fers specifically to 'work with clients' as the traumatic stressor. Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R) The SCL-90-R 90-item, self-report instru ment with a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely ) that assesses symptoms of general psychological distress for the last seven days. The internal consistency of the scale in a study by Pearlman and MacIan (1995) was found to be 0.96 with Cronbach's alpha. Impact of Event Scale (IES) The IES is a 15-item, self-report instrume nt with a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 4 = often ) that measures trauma related distre ss (Horowitz et al., 1980). Typically this measurement tool is used in studies of trauma survivors although it can be used to 30 detect distress that is also related to traumatic incidents, which can indicate VT (Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Pearlman and Ma cIan suggest directing participants to \"Decide how true each item is for you these days as it applies to the tr aumatic material of your clients\" (p. 560). They reported that a voidance and intrusion subscales each had an internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.86, and a test-retest reliability of 0.87. According to Sabin-Farrell and Turpin (2003) in a systematic review , the IES is one of the most commonly used instruments in resear ch related to STS or VT (Bober & Regehr, 2006). Coping Strategies Inventory (CSI) The CSI is composed of two sections: the CSI-Belief Scale (CSI-B) and the CSI- Time Scale (CSI-T). The CSI-B assesses belie fs that trauma therapists hold regarding which coping strategies will lead to lower levels of se condary trauma (Bober et al., 2006). There are three subscales within the CSI-B which are leisure, self-care, and supervision. The subscales have internal reliability coefficients of 0.71-0.82 (Bober et al., 2006). The CSI-T assesses time available for engaging in coping strategies. There are four subscales in the CSI-T: leisur e, self-care, supervision, and research/ These subscales have internal reliability coefficients of 0.67-0.80 (Bober et al., 2006). Discussion Boscarino, Figley, and Adams (2004) di scuss the methodological and conceptual problems with research on CF. The scal es created to measure CF have had few validation studies along with little information provided on the psychometric properties 31 of the scales used (Boscarino et Figley, 1999; Gentry, Baranowsky, & Dunning, 2002; Stamm, 2002). Also, control gro ups have not been included in many of the CF studies in order to examine possible organizational factors or other factors that may increase a therapist's likelihood of expe riencing CF (Jenkins & Baird, 2002; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995; Schauben & Frazier, 1995). The amount of empirical evidence of VT is very minimal and is described as being \"based on the anecdotal experien ces of therapists\" (Sexton, 1999, p. 396). Pearlman and MacIan (1995) sent a survey regarding VT using the TSI Belief Scale, Revision L (TSI-BSL; Pearlman, 1996) to 780 trauma therapists and had 188 respondents. They found that those therapists with a histor y of trauma reported more VT than those without a trauma history, F(12, 169) = 2.25, p < .05. In similar studies, Cunningham (1996) and Lee (1995) also f ound higher TSI-BSL scores among trauma therapists with a trauma history (as c ited in Jenkins & Baird, 2002). Adversely, Schauben and Frazier (1995), Gr een (1996), and Simonds (19 97) did not find higher TSI- BSL scores among trauma therapists with a trauma history. Devilly, Wright, and Varker (2009) us ed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) to measure burnout; the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) to measure STS; and the TSI Belief Scale-Revision L (TSI-BSL ) to measure VT. The STS predictors were found to be the same as burnout, i.e. perceived interpersona l support, caseload, and satisfaction with work as a mental health pr ofessional (Devilly et al., 2009). Devilly et al. found that exposure to patients' traumatic material by mental health professionals did not affect VT, STS or burnout; rather it was work related stressors that best predicted 32 distress in therapists, which contradicts the theory and re search of Figley (1995) and Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995), th e originators of these construc ts. Devilly et al. (2009) concludes that the three constr ucts of STS, VT and burnout appear to measure the same phenomenon and that STS and VT are bette r predicted by the model for burnout than their own theoretical models. According to Devilly et al. STS and VT were found to correlate moderately highly (r = 0.49, p < 0.01), which indicates a strong convergence between the constructs. A dditionally, STS was found to co rrelate very highly with burnout (r = 0.62, p < 0.01), which Devilly et al. found to be unexpected due to the theoretical differences between the two constr ucts. Finally, VT also correlated highly with burnout (r = 0.51, p < 0.01), which was al so unexpected due to the theoretical differences between these two constructs. Jenkins and Baird (2002) examined the concurrent, discriminant, and construct validity of the instruments designed to measure the construc ts of STS, CF and VT by comparing the instruments with each other and with more established measures of burnout and general distress. Jenkins and Baird (2002) stre ss caution when using either the TSI-Belief Scale to measure VT or the Compassion Fatigue Self Test (CFST) when measuring STS, CF and/or burnout, because neither scale has substantial psychometric evidence yet, nor has their association been studied. Most studies measuring VT have only used self-report questionnair es and questions have been raised about the validity of the results. Of all the scales in the trauma studies, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is considered the best validated measure of burnout and is the most widely accepted scale in measuring burnout (Jenkins & Baird, 2002). 33 Causes and Correlates of CF, STS and VT The causes of CF, STS and VT have been given significant c onsideration in the extant literature in the field; however causa tion remains unclear as it is challenging to ascertain if CF, STS and VT is a cause or an e ffect of the factors iden tified in research. Much of the research only lends itself to concluding significant corr elation with a number of variables that have been studied. Historically , individual factors were the primary focus of research in the search for causes of CF, STS and VT (Bober & Regehr, 2006). Now researchers are taking a more critical look at CF, STS and VT and are exploring alternative hypotheses and variab les, thus leading to additiona l explanations of why some mental health workers suffer from CF, STS and VT and why some do not. Consideration of organizational factors and i ndividual levels of empathic engagement is becoming more dominant in the research. Because empirical evidence regarding th e causes and correlates of CF, STS and VT often provides the basis for the developm ent of interventions targeting CF, STS and VT, this research will be explored. Thus f actors that have been linked to CF, STS and VT, including individual, organizational, and community/contextual factors will be considered. Individual Factors Personal or individual factors identified as causal or correlational to CF, STS, and VT include personal trauma history (C unningham, 1999; Pearlman & Ma cIan, 1995; Wall, style Ortlepp & Jandle, 2004), self-efficacy (Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002), level of experience (Adams et al ., 2001; Crothers, 1995; earlman & MacIan, 1995; W ee & Myers, 2002), and age (Ghahramanlou & Brodbeck, 2000). These i ndividual factors will be separated into demographic variables and personality and coping variables and will be further discussed in the following two sections. Demographic variables. Several studies have shown that less experienced therapists have shown greater effects of VT (Adams et al., 2001; Crothers, 1995; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Dunkley and Wh elan (2006a) suggest that as therapists develop into more experienced professionals their schema s become less disruptive and the therapists will experience decreased VT effects. Furthermore, Steed and Downing (1998) found that a majority of counselors did not identify an increase in negative effects as their personal experience with sexual assault victims increased over time. Additionally, in a study on trau ma impact on social work clinicians, Cunningham (2003) found a significant but negative correlation (r = -.23, p = .001) between the number of years in specialty and a negative total score on the Traumatic Stress Institute Belief Scale, Revision L (TSI-BSL). The number of years in specialty also correlated negatively with the subscales of self-safety on the TSI-BSL (r = -.17, p = .01) and other-esteem (r = -.14, p = .04) (Cunningham, 2003). Cunningham's findings indicate that clinicians with more 35 experience in their specialty populations re ported fewer disruptions in the cognitive schemas of self-safety and other-esteem. Regarding gender and STS, two studies found that women reported more STS symptoms than men (Kassam-Adams, 1999; Meyers & Cornille, 2002), one found that men reported more symptoms (Wee & Myers, 20 02), one showed that symptoms differed by gender (Lind, 2000), and two found no ge nder differences (Meldrum, King, & Spooner, 2002; Pearlman & MacIan, 1995). Younger age was found to be a significant pr edictor of higher levels of secondary trauma intensity in a study of 89 sexual assault trauma counselors, ages ranging from 20 to 63 years old (Ghahramanlou & Brodbeck, 20 00). Similarly, in a study of 259 trauma therapists with the mean age of 41.31 ( SD = 9.29) years, Bober and Regehr (2006) found that the older therapists had lower levels of distress on the IES ( r = -.14, p .05). Higher levels of secondary trauma in tensity in younger mental health workers could be attributed to simply having less experience in the fiel d and not yet having a complete understanding on how to handle traumatic situations. Also, the longer one works in the field the more immune one can become to hearing trau matic stories therefore allowing a more experienced worker to suffer le ss intense secondary trauma. Personality and coping variables. The research findings have been conflicted regarding the counselor's personal trauma history and its influence on VT (Dunkley & Whelan, 2006). Pearlman and MacIan (1995) studied VT in 188 self-identified trauma therapists and found that the therapists with a personal trauma history experienced greater disruptions than those without. Cunn ingham (2003) found a positive and significant 36 correlation (r = .19, p = .01) between working with clie nts who have experienced sexual abuse and the mental health professional ha ving a personal history of sexual abuse. Ghahramanlou and Brodbeck (2000) also found that a personal trauma history was a significant predictor of higher le vels of secondary trauma intensity in a study of 89 sexual assault trauma counselors. Furthermor e, Pearlman (1996) found a significant and positive correlation between having a history of sexual abuse and the subscales of self- safety (r = .15, p = .02) and other-esteem (r = .13, p = .04). In contrast to these findings, Schauben and Frazier (1995) inve stigated therapists who work with sexual violence survivors who themselves had a personal history of sexual violence (i.e., either rape or in cest). They found that the therapists' symptomology was not related to their own personal trauma history. Schauben and Frazier concluded that a therapists' own pe rsonal history of sexual violence has the potential to create more empathy and theref ore enhance the ability of the therapist's assessment techniques. Creamer and Liddle (2005) examined STS and therapist characteristics in disaster mental health workers who responded to th e terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Creamer and Liddle also concl uded that there was no signifi cance between the therapists' personal trauma history and their STS symptoms using the IES which assesses the two domains of trauma symptoms: intrusion a nd avoidance (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979) . The IES total scores can range from 0 to 75, with scores less than 8 deemed as low severity of symptoms, scores 9 thr ough 25 deemed as medium, scores 26 to 43 deemed as high, and above 44 is considered severe. Although, according to Creamer and 37 Liddle (2005) therapists who had a history of therapy wher e they discussed their own personal past trauma had higher IES scores ( M = 20.62; SD = 14.51) than those who had not had a history of therapy where they di scussed their own personal past trauma ( M = 11.86; SD = 11.76). Ortlepp and Friedman (2002) measured c ounselor's personal coping style with Antonovsky's (1987) Orientation to Life questionnaire. Personal coping style is indicated by a sense of cohe rence construct which include s a sense of manageability, meaningfulness, and comprehensibility. They found that personal coping style was strongly related to counselor' s reactions to their trauma counseling experience. When counselors' levels of coherence were reported high then report ed levels of STS were low; and their reported levels of role satisfacti on were high (Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002). This finding supports other studies wh ere coping style consistently was found to moderate the stress experienced by trauma counselors (B artone et al., 1989; Follette et al., 1994; Hodgkinson & Shepherd, 1994, as cited in Ortlepp & Friedman, 2002). Schauben and Frazier (1995) assessed the e ffects of working with sexual violence survivors and found five coping strategies th at were associated with lower symptom levels of VT. These five coping strategies were: (1) active coping; (2) seeking emotional support; (3) planning; (4) seek ing instrumental support; and (5) humor. In Schauben and Frazier's (1995) assessment, the subjects also listed additional coping strategies, which were: physical health and well- being; spiritually-o riented activities; and various leisure activities. Dyregrov and Mitc hell (1992) found that emerge ncy personnel who work with traumatized individuals use coping strategies after the traumatic event such as: 38 suppressing of emotions, distancing from certain aspects of the event, dehumanizing aspects of the event, and ta lking about th eir feelings. In a study that compared VT in clinicia ns who treat survivors of sexual abuse to VT in clinicians who treat offenders of sexua l abuse, the self-care strategies of physical exercise, spiritual practices , seeking support from family /friends, and seeking own therapy was measured by the IES (Way et al ., 2004). It was found that clinicians who treat survivors were more likely than clinicians who treat offenders of sexual abuse to utilize the self-care st rategies listed above, t(347) = 3.50, df = 345, p = .0005. According to Ortlepp and Friedman (2002), relationships between self-efficacy and the STS indicators in their study of STS in lay trauma counselors were statistically significant. This significan ce showed that the stronger th e counselors' perceptions of their required skills in tr auma counseling that they possessed and their perceived effectiveness, the less STS and burnout was reported. Palm, Polusny, and Follette (2004) argue that the adaptation to the trauma material heard by the disaster and trauma worker is depende nt on the interaction between the characteristics of the situation and th e characteristics of the individual. Three situational characteristics that have an effect on the adaptation of trauma material have been found in previous studies: listening to de scriptions of graphic details of the event; personal event-related loss; and consecutive interactions with trauma survivors (Durakovic-Belko, 2003; Follette, 1994; Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995). Palm et al. (2004) studied trauma reacti ons in disaster and trauma workers. Disaster and trauma worker's coping skills, their current stress, and their physical and 39 mental health are the three individual character istics that assist with adaptation to trauma material. Palm et al. found four individual st rategies used by these workers in order to cope more effectively: (1) spending more time with other people; (2) asking for support from others; (3) engaging in activities that can provide a sense of purpose (i.e., volunteer activities); and (4) self-care (i.e., attendi ng to physical and psyc hological health). Organizational Factors The values and culture of a work environm ent set the expectations about the work that is done with clients. Organizations that work with clients who have had traumatic experiences should acknowledge and normalize the impact that trauma can have on the individual worker and the or ganization itself (Bell, Kulkar ni, & Dalton, 2003). Workers may feel inadequate or ineffective at their j obs when working with traumatized clients. Palm et al. (2004) identify the following strate gies that could be implemented in the work environment in order to cope with or help to reduce trauma reactions: limiting caseloads with trauma clients; not scheduling one trauma client after the other; allowing for breaks during the day; providing opportunities for co -workers to interact and discuss cases; providing support groups or time to attend th e groups; and providing vacation time. These factors will be further discussed in the following sections. Caseload. The number or percentage of trau ma cases on a therapist's caseload has been an organizational factor identified as correlational to CF, STS, and VT (Bober & Regehr, 2006; Resnick, Kilpatrick, Best, & Kramer, 1992; Schauben & Frazier, 1995). Research has shown an asso ciation between having a 40 more diverse caseload and having decreased VT (Chrestman, 1999). Brady et al. (1999), Kassam-Adams (1995), and Schauben and Frazier (1995) all found that increased distress reported by mental health workers is associ ated with the number of treated trauma survivors. Furthermore, Schauben and Frazi er found that therapists who had a higher percentage of trauma cases in their total ca seload reported more di sturbed beliefs about themselves and others, more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and more self- reported VT. However, Follette (1994) and Baird and Jenkins (2003) found no significant relationship between the mental h ealth worker's psychological distress and the number of trauma survivors in their caseload. Bober and Regehr (2006) established that the hours per week spent counseling traumatized individuals was more hi ghly correlated with IES total (r = .31, p .001), avoidance (r = .24, p = .001), and intrusion ( r = .34, p .001). Ortlepp and Friedman (2002) assert when trauma counselors' expos ure to traumatic material is purposefully controlled, meaning limiting the nu mber of trauma survivors counseled per incident, the counselors' post-traumatic stress disorder (or STS) symptoms may be prevented. In Kassam-Adams' (1995) study of psychotherapists who treat se xually traumatized clients, the therapists' STS was found to be directly related with the leve l of exposure to the clients. Supervision provided by manager/supervisor. The use, availability and quality of supervision have been shown to affect CF, STS and VT. Several studies have found that an important coping stra tegy for dealing with VT is the provision of adequate supervision for the worker (Brady et al ., 1999; 1999; Sommer, 2003). Dalton (2001) found that not only the nu mber of hours of supervision the social worker received but also simply the number of times a social worker received supervision were positively related to low levels of STS. Therefore, it appears that not only is the total amount time of supervision im portant, but also the notion of supervision being accessible for any amount of time is important in the reduction of symptoms of STS. In suppor t of these findings, Neumann and Gamble (1995) suggest that counselors with less e xperience were especially vulnerable to VT when they did not have adequate access to supervision. Wilson (1998) conducted a quantitative and qualitative study on 20 crisis co unselors in South Africa which examined the perceived effectiveness of supervision wi th counselors suffering from STS. Wilson's (1998) results indicated that the process of supe rvision can help to decrease the effects of STS. Peer supervision and group support. Peer supervision can function as an important resource in lessening the effect of VT (Catherall, 1995). According to Catherall (1995), peer supervision can provide normalization of VT experiences as well as creating an opportunity to share persp ective and coping strate gies. Hodgkinson and Stewart (1998) studied social workers who had counseled su rvivors of a train crash and found that sharing their experi ence with their colleagues was their main coping strategy. Pearlman and MacIan (1993) found that the most common method of dealing with VT was discussion with colleagues according to 85% of trauma counselors' reports. There are many ways group support can be offered and available within an organization. The culture of the organizat ion is a good indicator of whether opportunities 42 will be provided for group support. Group support can be offered in the forms of treatment teams, case conferences, group case co nsultation, or clinical seminars (Bell et al., 2003). Education and consultation. Education on trauma has been found to decrease the potential for VT (Bell et al., 2003). P earlman and MacIan ( 1995) established that more experienced counselors are more like ly to seek out continuing education and different methods of consultation and as a result experienced signi ficantly less distress when working with trauma clients. Follette et al. (1994) found that 96% of mental health professionals reported that e ducation regarding sexual abuse was essential to effective coping with challenging client cases. More over, Chrestman (1999) also found empirical support that showed that extr a training and education decr eased symptoms of PTSD in counselors working with client s who experienced trauma. Community and Other Contextual Factors Social support plays an important role in the lives of indivi duals who work with clients who have experienced trauma. Kassam-Adams (1995) conducted a study on 100 psychotherapists who worked in out-patien t agencies. Approximately 50% of the subjects reported symptoms of STS, includ ing symptoms of avoida nce and intrusions. The subjects' stress levels were found to be inversely related to the levels of social support they had in their personal and prof essional lives. Ortlepp and Friedman (2002) found a statistically significant but moderate inverse relationship be tween social support and counselor's experience of STS, which was in agreement with Bartone, Ursano, Wright, and Ingraham (1989), and Hodgkinson a nd Shepherd (1994). Palm et al. (2004) 43 also maintain that sufficient social support out side of the work environment is necessary for self-care for disaster professionals (Polusny & Obst, 2002) in order to effectiv ely meet their own needs. Discussion It is apparent by researchers in this field that CF, STS and VT is a multi- dimensional and complex phenomenon. A number of variables, either individually or in combination with other variables, have been identified as causing or being linked to CF, STS and VT. These variables cover several le vels: the level of the individual mental health worker, the organizational level, and the community level. Palm et al. (2004) make the argument that VT could be minimized or avoided in disaster workers by creating conditions th at are conducive to healthy personal and occupational functioning. Additionally, Kirmayer (1996) points out that solely focusing on reducing the total number of trauma clients in the disa ster worker's caseload and allowing for more of a variety of client issues is missing the bigger picture which is that the scope of the problem should also in clude organizational consideration. Although a few interventions have been developed to mitigate the identified factors at all levels, research related to the effectiveness of these interventions is in its early stages. Many interventions are geared toward the client who has been the person primarily experiencing trauma. There is a gr owing need for interventions for the mental health worker who is the intervener for that primary trauma client. Some interventions are being modified from trea ting the traumatized to treati ng the secondarily traumatized 44 mental health worker. In the following s ection, the various interventions aimed at decreasing effects of CF, STS and VT will be discussed. Interventions Targeting CF, STS and VT Interventions targeting CF, STS, and VT fall into several different categories, target a variety of different risk factors and levels, are implemented in different settings and are delivered through a variety of modalities. Interventions that target CF, STS, and VT strive to: decrease numbing, flooding and hypervigilance (VanderKolk, McFarlane, & VanderHart, 1996); correct cognitive distortio from trauma experience (Zoellner, Fitzgibbons, & Foa, 2001); assist individuals in return ing to a previous level of adaptive functioning (Wilson, Friedman, & Lindy, 2001); and ensure safety from future overwhelming events (Herman, 1992). An overview of the interventions will be discussed below. These interventions will be categorized in terms of the primary level (individual and professional/org anizational) that is the focus of the intervention. Individual Level Interventions The individual level interventions' foci are enhancement of self-consciousness and body awareness that include recognizing symptoms of CF , STS and VT. Individual coping style consistently was found to m oderate the stress experienced by trauma counselors (Bartone et al., 1989; Follette et al., 1994; Hodgkinson & Shepherd, 1994). Self-care that relates to basic physical hygiene such as healthy eating, sleeping, and exercising is also an important factor on an individual level. Copi ng style and self-care are individual interventions that are usually measured in addition to the implementation 45 of a formalized intervention. In the fo llowing section, examples of two of these interventions that aim to decrease symptoms of CF, STS and VT will be discussed. Cognitive behavioral therapy. The theoretical perspective of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) involves thoughts, co gnitions, feelings, moods, and actions that are conceptualized as covert and overt behaviors. Thes e behaviors are then learned through classical and operan t conditioning or vicariously learned through modeling behaviors (Coady & Lehmann, 2008). Both th e cognitive and behavioral schools of thought agreed to three assump tions of the learning theory which are: (1) behavior is influenced by experience; (2) learning is ad aptive for the individual; and (3) learning is a process governed by natural laws that can be tested and studied (Payne, 2005). CBT focuses on worker-to-patient empa thy, understanding, and warmth which begins in the engagement phase and ideally lasts throughout treatment (Gambrill, 1995). CBT often requires the patient to do homework in order to successfully increase/decrease behaviors and/or cognitions that might be pos itive/negative in the patient's life. There are numerous interventions in CBT that are used dependent upon the problem brought to the therapist. Some examples are: system atic desensitization, behavioral activation, response prevention, self-monitoring, psychoeducation, management, and cognitive restructuring (Coady & Lehmann, 2008) . When this method is utilized with trauma professionals, the interventions focus on how the professional is interpreting their realities which has a direct effect on th eir coping skills (Inbar & Ganor, 2003). Stress Inoculation Training. Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) is an example of a cognitive behavioral interven tion that has been utilized w ith individuals and groups to 46 help reduce effects of secondary trauma and increase coping skills while working in stressful or traumatic situations (Inbar & Ganor, 2003; Meichenbaum , 1996). There are three components to SIT: (1) education; (2) coping skills training; and (3) exposure to simulated stressors (West, Horan, & Games, 1984). SIT has been evaluated in a variety of psychoeducation, prevention, and re mediation programs (Meichenbaum & Deffenbacher, 1988). These programs includ e anger control (T immons, Oehlert, Sumerall & Timmons, 1997), pain manageme nt (Hackett & Horan, 1980; Ross & Berger, 1996), test and other performance anxieties (Sau nders, Driskell, Johnston, & Salas, 1996; Schneider & Nevid, 1993), stude nt coping (Israelashvili, 199 8), and occupational stress (West et al., 1984). Dane (2000) examined th e nature of secondary trauma and how it impacts social workers in a child welfare ag ency. Dane then created and utilized a framework of stress inoculation training in a pilot program for child welfare workers. Although no pre or post-test was given to assess reduction of secondary traumatic symptoms and the author also cautioned th at a definitive statement about the model's effectiveness cannot be made, participant evaluations indica ted that the intervention was helpful. Professional/Organizational Level Interventions Although the primary focus of interventions used to prevent and decrease symptoms of VT has traditionally been on the individual, organizational level interventions can complement and enhance in dividual interventions. Some organizational interventions include the provision of supervision, workshops, and a supportive organizational culture (Inbar & Ganor, 2003). Dalton (2001) found that the number of 47 times a social worker received supervision and the number of hours of supervision were positively related to low levels of STS. Th e systemic social-organizational intervention is one that occurs typically in institutions that deal mainly with crisis and trauma situations (Inbar & Ganor, 2003). This interv ention is more of an organizational culture that encourages effective coping strategies and problem-solving skills. The environment is one that allows for social and professiona l support while having to manage crisis and trauma situations on a regular basis (Inbar & Ganor, 2003). Supervision and a supportive cu lture are organizational in terventions that can be assessed in adjunct to more formalized interven tions such as vicarious resiliency training, psychoeducational seminars, and various moda lities of debriefing. These interventions will be discussed more in depth in the following sections. Vicarious resiliency training. Vicarious resilience is a relatively new concept in trauma work. It reflects a reality that ment al health professionals can experience positive outcomes in their mental and physical health due to improved clinical skills, reframing their experiences, and coping with traumatic events in the process (Reivich & Shatte, 2002). Therefore, vicarious resiliency training helps educate mental health workers on the various aspects VT so they can acquire enhanced knowledge and tool s to manage future traumatic situations with the goal of turn ing the experience into a positive one. In an unpublished dissertation, Shew (2010) carried out a study to determine the effectiveness of vicarious resiliency training with 25 professionals \"who are at a high risk for developing vicarious trauma\" (p. 4). The author collected data through questionnaires and followed a pre, post, and follow-up design where all 25 participants served as the 48 control and experimental groups. After four weeks, Shew (2010) found that 71% of the participants reported a positive change in th eir symptoms. The author concluded that \"resiliency training is a potent way of mitig ating the effects of vicarious trauma...and supports that resiliency traini ng promotes awareness of vicar ious trauma as a means to reduce the consequences of vicari ous trauma\" (Shew, 2010, p. 4). Psychoeducational seminars. Psychoeducational seminars about the impact of VT are commonly recommended interventions for organizations. Meadors and Lamson (2008) conducted a study on the scope of CF and STS on health care providers who work on critical care units with children with a s econdary aim of evaluating the effectiveness of providing psychoeducational seminars on CF to those same health care providers. Although only 1.1% of their subjects were soci al workers (2/185), their findings could possibly be applied to other professions that are exposed to traumatic situations. Meadors and Lamson's findings were \"overwhelm ingly supportive\" (p. 33) regarding the effectiveness of psychoeducational seminars on CF. They also found that their final hypothesis of \"the posttest was predicted to reflect significant improvements on awareness of CF and identification of strategi es to handle the differe nt stressors that are associated with working on ICUs\" (pp. 32-33) was also supported. Most importantly, the participants felt considerably \"less tense, jittery, or overwhelmed while having increased feelings of being calm and peaceful\" (p. 33) wh ich results in a decreased clinical stress level. Debriefing interventions. A phrase now found frequently in trauma literature is \"debriefing the debriefers\" (Kahill, 1998; McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Talbot, Manton, & 49 Dunn, 1992). Since CF, STS, and VT in mental health professionals who work with individuals who have experi enced trauma has become mo re recognized, utilizing the various debriefing methods on the mental health debriefers is becoming more important in supporting mental health worker's own psychological and emotional health (Regehr, 2001). Although debriefing can allow for wo rkers to ventilate and compare their experiences with fellow co-workers, it is also involves some controversy. Research outcomes regarding the effectiveness of cris is debriefing are mixed. Neria and Solomon (1999) found that non-controlled studies we re effective in the debriefing method. Adversely, controlled studies found no effect on the reduction of stress symptoms after debriefing and additionally found that th ere was an increased psychopathology and increased vulnerability within debriefed s ubjects (Neria & Solomon, 1999). There are several types of debriefing me thods that will be discussed in the following sections. These methods are not specifically used in reducing symptoms of CF, STS or VT in mental health workers which will be furthe r discussed in the discussion section below. Crisis Debriefing Model. An early intervention strategy is the Crisis Debriefing Model (Dyregrov, 1989; Mitchell, 1982; Raphael , 1986). The Crisis Debriefing Model is a brief group treatment approach that is typically limited to just one session. This session allows for participants to discuss their feeli ngs regarding a specific traumatic incident that occurred that also involved everyone partic ipating in the group. The goal is for the participants to ventilate their stress while learning and employ ing appropriate coping skills in order to move on emotionally from the trauma suffered (Everly, Boyle, & Lating, 1999). Variations of this model include psychological de briefing (Dyregrov, 50 1989; Raphael, 1986); Crisis In tervention Stress Debriefing (CISD) (Mitchell Bray, 1990); community teams oung, 1991); and multiple stressor debriefing model (Armstrong, O'Callahan, & Marmar, 1991). Psychological debriefing. Psychological debriefing is an intervention that provides an opportunity for me ntal health workers to talk about their experiences who have assisted victims in a traumatic inci dent. The purpose is to provide a safe environment and allocate time for the workers to compare their experiences as well as verbalize any negative occurrences so these ca n be explored, resolved, and integrated so that the worker is able to transition back into their re gular life (Talbot, Manton, & Dunn, 1992). Raphael (1986) discusses how the integration of the disaster is important for the worker because this gives the traumatic experience a cognitive structure \"and the emotional release of reviewing it helps th e worker to a sense of achievement and distancing\" (p. 255). Furthermor e, the integration also enables the worker to have the ability to move on emotionally from this experience and not con tinue to have ongoing symptoms of stress because of it. Crisis Intervention Stress Debriefing. Crisis Intervention Stress Debriefing (CISD) is a method that is often used mo re for emergency service personnel workers (such as fire fighters, ambulance workers, police officers) or for workers who have experienced a particular cris is in the workplace (such as sudden death, bank hold-ups, serious injuries). The debrie fing is exposure based when clie nts are encouraged to recall the specific events of a trau matic experience. The groups of workers take part in a structured discussion within 24 to 72 hours af ter the traumatic incident that emphasizes 51 normal thoughts, feelings and behavioral res ponses to abnormal events (Talbot et al., 1992). Hypothetically, as the experiences are re called multiple times, the negative effects of the memories are supposed to decrease whil e being in a safe environment as well as minimizing the development of abnormal stress responses. Education about the events and processing the traumatic reactions are emphasized (Bisson, McFarlane, & Rose, 2000). However, researchers have found mixe d effectiveness results with the CISD method and some studies have found that de briefing methods can even exacerbate stress symptoms (Regehr, 2001). Rose and Bisson (1998) review ed randomized controlled tr ials (RCTs) of CISD. In two of the six studies re viewed the treatment group significantly improved. In the remaining four studies, two showed no diffe rence between groups while two showed an increase in psychiatric morbidity when exposed to treatment. Rose and Bisson found that the effectiveness of CISD may depend on the in itial severity of trauma symptoms. They propose additionally, that the effectiveness of CISD may be affected by the individual's present level of functioni ng and trauma history. Mitchell and Everly (1997) ha ve projected that CISD be incorporated into critical incident stress management (CISM) which involves pre-trauma tr aining, debriefing, and individual follow-up. Richar ds (2001) compared CISD and CISM with bank workers who were exposed to critical incidents. It was found that the CISM group of workers had significantly fewer trauma symptoms at thr ee month and twelve month follow-ups than the CISD group (Richards, 2001). While Mitchell's (1988) CISD debrie fings, mainly applied to emergency 52 personnel, are focused on catharsis, Raphael's (1986) psychological debriefing includes the catharsis element but then expands the intervention to also include a discussion regarding the worker's experience of the trauma work, strengthen ing of the workers' relationships as a team as well as inte grating the experience (Talbot et al., 1992). Discussion. A number of interventions have been modified and developed to decrease symptoms of CF, ST S and VT in mental health workers based on the known factors that have been implicat ed in contributing to CF, STS and VT. In theory, if the interventions are targeting known \"causes\" or factors, then the intervention techniques should be effective in reducing the problem of CF, STS and VT. Unfortunately, there seems to be very minimal outcome resear ch to support the effectiveness of the interventions being developed and implemented that pertains specifically to mental health workers. The outcome research that has been published is scattered and focuses mainly on primary victims of trauma and other prof essions. This makes it difficult for policy makers and practitioners to use research to guide their decision making specifically for mental health workers. With limited outcome research, knowing which of the interventions to implement is challenging. One review of interventions and outcome research was conducted exploring the effec tiveness of group psychological debriefing on VT. This review will be examined in terms of their findings. Prior Reviews of Outcome Resear ch Targeting CF, STS and VT Published Reviews Exploring the Effects of Interventions on CF, STS, and VT A search for previous reviews and meta-a nalyses of interventions related to the problems of CF, STS, and VT was undertak en. Nine databases (Academic Search 53 Premier, Dissertation & Theses @ Loyola, PI LOTS, ProQuest, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Social Service Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, TRIP Database) were searched and one review of interventi on research was identified. A summary of the findings of the search will be discussed below. One meta-analysis was conducted by Everly, Boyle, and Lating (1999) and explored the effectiveness of group psychologi cal debriefing with VT. The authors did describe their search strategy and did not include unpublished studies. This study included 10 investigations that yielded an aggregate pool of 698 subjects. In the 10 investigations, trauma symptoms, anxiety, depr ession, stress symptoms and the impact of events were measured through various instru ments (i.e. IES, SCL-90, Beck's Depression Inventory, STAI, General Health Quest). In the studies that included more than one outcome variable, the outcome measures were combined within each study and then averaged. This study was not specific to ment al health workers, and is unclear if any variation of mental health worker was incl uded in this study. Regarding inclusion the authors state \"the empirical investigations in cluded in the current meta-analysis do indeed include applications in em ergency and trauma medicine , but also extend beyond those venues to include subjects from law enfo rcement and primary victim subject pools\" (Everly et al., 1999, p. 232). If \"primary victim subject pools\" were included, then this appears to be a mixture of PTSD and VT inte rvention effects. The authors concluded that \"the results support the effec tiveness of group psychological de briefings in alleviating the effects of vicarious psychological distress in emergency care providers\" (p. 229). 54 Published Reviews of Related Outcome Research One systematic review has been conduc ted to assess if ST S is prevalent among nurses and to determine what instruments are used to measure STS in nurses. Outcomes of interventions were being re viewed and the population studie d was not of mental health workers. Discussion There is a definite need for an increase in studies of outcomes of interventions in the CF, STS, and VT literature. From the literature reviews, there seems to be more attention to the definitional issues among the three cons tructs as well as assessing whether these constructs exist in various populations. Less atte ntion has been assigned to outcomes of interventions. To date I have not been able to locate a meta-analyses or systematic review of interventions intended to decrease symptoms of CF, STS and VT. It is important to synthesize the intervention re search to provide a comprehensive picture of interventions that are being util ized in the field to decrease symptoms of CF, STS and VT and to identify interventions that are effectiv e and areas in which more research needs to be conducted to better info rm social work practice. CHAPTER THREE METHODOLOGY A systematic review and meta-ana lysis was conducted to examine and quantitatively synthesize research related to the effects of interventions intended to decrease symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma in mental health workers to inform policy, practice and social work education. A systematic review method was utilized for several reasons. The first reason is that the systematic review method assists wi th combining empirical data pertaining to mental health workers to find a clearer path on where research needs to be headed in order to further the effectiveness of inte rventions intended to decrease or prevent symptoms related to CF, STS and VT. A second reason is the systematic review method requires an explicit and well-defined process fo r searching and selecting studies included in the review as well as for coding and analyz ing data found in the st udies. This explicit and transparent process limits bias and reduces chance effects, leading to more reliable results (Higgins & Green, 2006). A well-defined process also allows for the review to be replicated and/or expanded either by other reviewers who want to expand upon the criteria established by the original reviewer or by adding additional studies in the future to the original review as more data becomes available. Meta-analysis is a form of research integration that applies statistical analysis to quantitatively aggregate and compare results of different individual research studies 55 56 (Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Meta-analysis offers several advantages over other means of research synthe sis. As the amount of empirical research has grown, from perhaps a few studies one would find in the 1940's and 1950's to hundreds and even thousands of studies one would find on a particular topic today, the form of research integration has evolved. Na rrative reviews of research may have been appropriate and satisfactory when few studies were available; however, it becomes increasingly difficult to narrativ ely synthesize a vast amount of data when there are large numbers of studies (Glass et al., 1981). It is suggested that \"the findings of multiple studies should be regarded as a complex data set, no more comprehensible without statistical analysis than w ould be hundreds of data point s in one study. Contemporary research reviewing should be more technical and statistical than narrative\" (Glass et al., 1981, p. 12). Meta-analysis provides a way of organi zing, handling and analyzing data from a large number of studies in a more differen tiated and sophisticated way than narrative reviews or vote counting methods. Narrativ e reviews and vote counting methods make determinations about whether an interven tion was effective based on the number of studies that were found to demonstrate statistically significant positive results. These methods disregard sample size, thus possibly leading to erroneous conclusions (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Meta-analysis, on the other ha nd, represents key fi ndings in terms of effect size rather than statis tical significance. Thus, meta-analysis provides information about the strength and importance of a relationship, the magnitude of the effects of interventions and the characte ristics of the effective in terventions (Lipsey & Wilson, 57 2001). Also, meta-analysis produc es synthesized effect estim ates by pooling effect sizes across studies, producing effect estimates that have more statistical power than an individual study alone (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). This study utilized a systematic method for every aspect of the review, following suggestions by Lipsey and Wilson (2001) and Littell, Corcoran and Pillai (2008). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies that were searched as well as the explicit process was thoroughly documented and defined in this chapter. In order to reduce publication bias, every effort was made to locate and include both published and unpublished studies. All studies that met criteria for incl usion were using a coding instrument developed by this au thor. The coding instrument wa s utilized to extract data from each eligible study. Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion of Studies in the Review The following criteria were used to de termine whether a study would be included in the review: 1. Types of studies: Randomized Controlled Tria ls, Quasi-Experimental Designs and single group pre-posttest designs we re included in the review. 2. Types of participants: Ment al health workers who work di rectly with clients/patients and are experiencing symptoms of compa ssion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and/or vicarious traumatizati on (as identified by the researchers) were included in this review. Studies in which participants had not been identified as having symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss, and/or vicarious traumatization prior to the intervention were excluded. 58 3. Types of settings: This review included interventions conducted in any setting. 4. Types of intervention: Interventions with a stated primary goal of decreasing symptoms of compassion fatigue, seconda ry traumatic stress and/or vicarious traumatization among mental health workers. 5. Types of outcome measures: This revi ew included only studies that measure compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss and/or vicarious traumatization. The secondary outcomes of burnout and compassi on satisfaction were discovered in the process of the review. Th ese results were also included in the results chapter. 6. Geographical context: There were no ge ographical limitations; however, only studies written in English were included. 7. Time period: This review included studies that were published between 1983 and 2012. Secondary traumatic stress was or iginated in 1983 and the concepts of compassion fatigue and vicarious traumati zation followed in the 1990's which is why this time period was limited from 1983 through 2012 for this review. Search Strategy for Identification of Relevant Studies A comprehensive search strategy was utili zed to search for studies that met the inclusion criteria defined above. Both pub lished and unpublished studies were searched and retrieved when identified through the search strategy. Several sources were used to identify the eligible studies, including: Electronic Databases A total of 11 databases were searched (s ee Table 1). One librarian specializing in social work were consulted and met with in person to determine appropriate databases to 59 search as well as keyword search terms to utilize. Table 1: Databases Searched Academic Search Premier Databases of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness Pegasus Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress ProQuest Dissertations and Theses PsycINFO Social Service Abstracts Social Work Abstracts/Ovid Sociological Abstracts TRIP Database WorldCat Keyword searches within each database included combinations of keywords grouped into three main categories: 1) Targeted problem: compassion fatigue OR secondary traumatic stress OR vicarious traumatization AND 2) Intervention: evaluation OR intervention OR treatment OR outcome AND 3) Targeted population: social worker OR mental health OR therapist OR counselor OR psychologist. Internet and Website Searches Websites of relevant research institut es, academies and professional associations were searched for published and unpublished stud ies. Some relevant websites included greencross.org Scholar. 60 Personal Contacts Personal contacts with researchers w ho do work in the field of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatizati on and vicarious traumatizatio n were made via email and telephone. An email query of authors/resear chers and experts in the area of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic st ress and vicarious traumatization were attempted in an effort to discover additional published or unpubl ished studies relevant to the systematic review. Phone calls were made to two resear chers, Charles Figley and Ellen Landis, to discuss any additional research that might be relevant to this study. Contact was made via telephone to both Charles Fi gley and Ellen Landis. Reference Lists Reference lists of related prior reviews and related meta-analyses were reviewed for relevant studies. In addition, the refere nces of the retrieved primary studies were examined for potential studies relevant for the review. Conducting and Documenting the Search and Selection Process All searches were tracked with the maintenance of a comprehensive search log maintained in Excel. This log includes: (1) search engines utilized; (2) database or main source searched; (3) keywords used for th e search; (4) time period searched; and (5) number of hits. Also using Excel, a list of study titles, citations and inclusion decisions were documented. All titles and abstracts found in the searches were reviewed and screened. When the abstract appeared appropr iate and relevant for the review, a full text of the study was obtained and reviewed and a decision for inclusion was made based on the entire article. For example, studies th at would be deemed as inappropriate at the 61 title/abstract review phase would be that that do not involve the ta rget population (e.g., mental health workers, social workers, psychologists, counselors or therapists) or were theoretical in nature where no intervention was being evaluated. All abstracts deemed potentially appropriate were retrieved in full text and assigned an identification number. The bibliographic information as well as location of where the study was found was entered into the Search Documentation Log, an Excel spreadsheet. If there was any question as to the appropriateness of the study at this stage, the full text was obtained and screened. If the study was in electronic form at, the study was saved into a folder on the computer. If the study was obtained in hard copy, usually through InterLibrary Loan, the study was kept in a file cabinet. Once the full text of the studies were retrieved and documented in Excel, each study was reviewed and the basic information needed to determine whether the study met the inclusion criteria was coded on the Screening Form (see Appendix B) and entered into the Search Documentation Log in Excel. For those studies that met all inclusion criteria described previously, data was extr acted and entered onto the Study Coding Form (see Appendix C). Results of Search The database and website searches yielde d 4,134 \"hits\". After re view of titles and abstracts, 191 of these were identified for full text retrie val. Of the 191, 32 of these studies were duplicates that were listed in more than one data base/source. A total of 159 unique studies were retrieved for sc reening from the database search. Email and telephone inquiries to author s/researchers in th e field yielded no 62 studies for the screening phase. Reference lis ts of retrieved primar y studies and related prior reviews yielded one study th at was retrieved and screened for eligibility criteria. Through an exhaustive search process, th e full text of 159 studies were retrieved and screened for basic eligibility criteria. Fi ve studies met the basic eligibility criteria. Of these five studies, three were single group pre-posttest studies, one was a quasi- experimental study and one was a randomized controlled trial. Of those studies, two single group pre-posttest studies met final eligibility criteria and were included in the review and meta-analysis. An explanation for the exclusion of the three studies from the analysis at this final stage can be found in the following section. Studies Excluded After Coding Cohen, Gagin, and Peled-Avram (2006) a ssessed the occurrence and levels of compassion fatigue and its correlates among hosp ital social workers in Israel after three years of recurrent terrorist attacks in 2003. A total of 53 participants filled out the Compassion Fatigue Self-Test (Figley, 1995). All of the participants were social workers with the degrees of either BSW (N=32), MSW (N=20) or PhD (N=1). The participants were divided into three groups according to wh ich interventions they had taken part in within the past three years (p rior to 2003) which included: (a) group supervision; (b) individual supervision; and/ or (c) debriefing. The results showed that 75.5% of the participants had participated in debriefing sessions soon after the terrorist attacks, and \"most\" had participated in either indivi dual or group supervision. The CFST results indicated moderate levels of secondary traumatization and low levels of burnout (Cohen et al., 2006). Although a pre-test was not given to determine levels of compassion fatigue 63 prior to the interventions, wh ich was the reason for exclusion, Cohen et al. (2006) found that receiving supervision or participati ng in debriefing sessions did not yield any differences in secondary traumatization. They also conclude that the outcome of low levels of burnout was related to the subject s' participation in group supervision during 2002. Moreover the authors found that secondary traumatizati on was not associated with the number of terror attacks that each pa rticipant was involved in, nor with the demographic characteristics or their leve l of degree or seniority, nor with having individual or group supervision or participation in debriefing. Novoa (2011) implemented a cross-sectional experimental study to examine the effects of Reiki on risk level for secondary traumatic stress (STS) among mental health professionals and students (N=67). Reiki is a form of energy therapy that research suggests relieves anxiety and stress (Novoa , 2011; Wardell & Engebretson, 2001), and depression (Novoa, 2011; Shore, 2004). Accord ing to Natale (2010), Reiki is based on the belief that when spiritual energy is cha nneled through a Reiki pract itioner, the client's spirit is healed, which in turn heals th e physical body. This study was excluded due to over 50% of the participants were students (61%) at the time of th e study and had not yet practiced in the mental health field. The mental health workers and students were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: Reiki, placebo or control group. In this sample, the Reiki treatment was found to be non-effective on STS symptoms and risk for developing STS (Novoa, 2011). Through an eight-week art therapy model of intervention, Van der Vennet (2002) assessed whether the modality of art therapy is effective in helping to reduce secondary 64 trauma and burnout in mental health wo rkers who work with clients who have experienced domestic violence and sexual trau ma. This study was a quantitative single subject A-B design and a quali tative heuristic art-base d phenomenological study. The components of the art therapy sessions includ ed art projects such as: collage, mandalas, persona and shadow masks, self -portrait boxes, clay and painting. The author utilized the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) as a pre-test for the quantitative results as well as self- report surveys for trauma and burnout. Van der Vennet concluded that the model of art therapy is effective in reduci ng secondary trauma and burnout for mental health workers who work with domestic violence and sexual a ssault survivors. This study was excluded due to no TSI post-test given as well as only five out of the 12 subjects (less than 50%) were experiencing symptoms of secondary trauma prior to the intervention. Strengths and Limitations of Excluded Studies Strengths. The Cohen et al. (2006) study adds a new dimension in the supervision and debriefing resear ch repertoire in that it was the first study to assess the existence of correlates of compassion fatigue in hospital social workers in Israel as a result of working with victims of bombing incidents and with the families of the victims. Van der Vennet's (2002) study opens the door to alternat ive ways of coping and intervening with secondary traumatic stress by education and experi ence with different methods of art therapy. Particip ants in her study were able to obtain the capacity to apply new tools and interventions for self-car e and self-exploration. Van der Vennet's qualitative results supported that the ar t therapy module was effective in reducing secondary trauma and burnout for this part icular population. One strength of the Novoa 65 (2011) study was it was the first to study e ffectiveness of Reiki on mental health professionals, which adds to the body of literature for intervention effects studies. This study also supports directing the field to continue attempting different intervention studies in order to come closer to those that work in the reduction of symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss and vicarious traumatization in mental health workers. Limitations. All three excluded studies menti oned small sample sizes as a limitation. Small sample size increases the risk of type II error and requires caution when interpreting results (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). C ohen et al. (2006) intended to target all social workers that were employed in two different hospitals but not all agreed to participate. Cohen's study in cluded 53 participants but did not represent social workers as a whole in Israel, where the study was carried out. Van der Vennet (2002) used a small, non-random, convenience sample (N =12) which also limits this study's generalizability as well as the interaction history and treatment. Novoa (2011) also noted that her sample size (N=67) was smaller than originally planned and the generalization of her study is limited to populations with similar demographic ch aracteristics and in similar settings. Novoa's participants were mostly Caucasian (85%), females (93%), married (36%), Christians (79%), and enrolled in an MSW program (61%) in South Louisiana. The three excluded studies all used self-re port measurement tools. Self-reporting instruments could possibly result in particip ants not answering questions truthfully by tailoring their responses to plea se the researcher or to be se en in a more favorable light. 66 All but one of Van der Vennet's (2002) instru ments to measure trauma and burnout were unvalidated. Other limitations of Van der Vennet's ( 2002) study include: using an A-B design with no control group for comparative statistic s; no posttest given of the TSI; biography of the researcher (she worked for the agency at the time of the st udy); room changes for the study and participants bei ng ill/attendance; and time cons traints for the therapy group (Van der Vennet, 2002). Additional limitati ons of Novoa's (2011) study include: Reiki research outcome studies are limited; some part icipants had stated that they felt deceived by being in the placebo group; attrition in the placebo group (five participants left); participant maturation and time pa ssage (study lasted 16 months); the long term effect of Reiki is unknown, therefore the difference in da ys since the last treatment to the posttest may not reflect the true out come of study (Novoa, 2011). Related Studies Of the 159 studies retrieved and screened fo r basic eligibility cr iteria, 31 (19%) of these studies measured levels or symptoms of distress associated with compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress or vicari ous traumatization. Eight of the 159 studies (5%) were intervention effects studies (which consist of the two included studies and the three excluded studies summari zed above). Twenty-three (74 %) of the 31 studies were unpublished dissertations. Of these 31 studies , 21 (68%) were specific to particular categories of mental health workers. These categories were: social workers, therapists (trauma treatment, therapists of traumati zed children), psychotherapists, counselors (telephone, employee assistance program, and substance abuse), mental health 67 professionals, sex offender treatment providers , psychologists, community mental health practitioners, and Critical Incident Stress Ma nagement (CISM) clinicians. The remaining 10 (32%) studies did not include 100% of mental health wo rkers as their subjects. Specifically, these studies included crisis intervention workers, combat deploying chaplains, domestic violen ce shelter staff, psychiatric nurses, psychology students, hospice workers and department of me ntal health workers/volunteers. Intervention Effects Studies Without 100 % Mental Health Worker Participants In addition to the two included studies and the three studies that were excluded due to reasons cited above after study scr eening and coding, there were three unpublished dissertation studies that assessed interv ention effects on decreasing symptoms of compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress. These studies were excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria requirem ent of participants being mental health workers, but these studies are important to the future of this field of study and are summarized in the following paragraphs. In an unpublished dissertation, Shew ( 2010) carried out a quasi-experimental study to determine the effectiv eness of vicarious resiliency training with 25 professionals who were determined to be a high risk for the development of vicarious traumatization solely due to their occupa tions involving work with in dividuals who have been traumatized and not according to any data co llected that could determine risk. The participants (N=25) were from community ag encies, hospitals, public health centers, the court system, church affiliations, and a refugee resettlement agency. The author collected data through questionnaires a nd followed a pre, post, and follow-up design where all 68 participants served as the c ontrol and experimental groups. The questionnaires included: a profile questionnaire; Traumatic Stress R eaction questionnaire; an evaluation of the Secondary Traumatic Resilience Training; a nd a Global Rating of Training. A post-test of the same questionnaires were given to participants to complete four-weeks after the training. Shew (2010) found that 71% of the pa rticipants reported a positive change in their vicarious trauma symptoms. The author concluded that \"res iliency training is a potent way of mitigating the effects of vicar ious trauma...and supports that resiliency training promotes awareness of vicarious trau ma as a means to reduce the consequences of vicarious trauma\" (p. 4). In a second unpublished dissertation, Wl odarczyk (2010) carried out the first study of its kind to examine the effect of a single-session music therapy group intervention on feelings of disenfranchised grief as experienced by hospice workers. Doka (1989) introduced disenfra nchised grief and defines it as when one experiences a loss that cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially accepted. The secondary purpose of the study was to determ ine whether this group could also have an effect on hospice workers' risk for compassion fatigue and their per ception of their work environment one month after participation in the group. This study was a pre-test posttest randomized control group design with a second posttest administered 30 days after initial data collection. Participants (N=68) were divided into two equal groups: an assigned experimental group and an assigne d control group. The experimental group completed pre-test and posttest measures be fore and after particip ation in an hour-long music therapy group intervention. The contro l group completed the posttest only with no 69 participation in a group. The results show ed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups 30 days afte r the initial data co llection and the overall risk for burnout and compassion fatigue wa s found to be low, as measured by the Compassion Satisfaction/Fatigue Se lf-Test (Figley & Stamm, 1996). The third intervention study was the first to investigate the impact of working with domestic violence victims on domes tic violence shelter workers (N=230) by examining levels of secondary traumatization in relation to the inte rvention of feedback (Jeffrey, 1999). The interventions utilized in this study to atte mpt to ameliorate symptoms of secondary traumatic stress were providing feedback and feedback with suggestions for improvement. Feedback was in the form of reports given to participants that varied according to whet her they were in the experimental or control groups. No significant effects were found in the amelioration of secondary traumatic stress symptoms post-treatment. Excluded Comparison Study A fourth study worth discussion, though not an intervention effects study, is Ringenbach's (2009) on-line survey study that compared licensed professional counselors' (N=164) levels of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, burnout, and self-compassion according to whether or not they practiced meditation. According to Neff (2003a), self-compassion refers to an em otionally positive self -attitude that may serve to protect the individual from negativ e self-evaluations, a nxiety and depression. Ringenbach defined the meditation group's meditation experience as engaging in meditation at least 60 minutes per week for at least six consecutive months. The non- 70 meditation group was defined as no meditation practice or experien ce. Participants completed three on-line surv eys that included: a dem ographic questionnaire; the Professional Quality of Life Scale (Pro QOL; Stamm, 2005); and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003b). The study found th e meditation practice group (N=62) having significantly higher levels of self-compassion and showing lo wer levels of burnout than the non-meditation group (N=102). The study fu rther reported that measures of self- compassion were positively associated with measures of compassion satisfaction and negatively associated with measures of burnout and compassion fatigue. Summary The six excluded intervention effects studies represent a wide range of interventions which include: supervision and debriefing, Reiki, music therapy, feedback, art therapy and vicarious resi liency training. Not one study ha s been replicated which is essential in determining which interventions are truly effective and worth implementing in order to reduce symptoms of compassion fa tigue, secondary trau matic stress, and/or vicarious traumatization in me ntal health workers. Only two of the six intervention studies found positive results. The positive re sults for decreasing symptoms of secondary traumatic stress and burnout were found in Van der Vennet's (2002) art therapy intervention study and in Shew 's (2010) study for decreasi ng the effects of vicarious trauma through vicarious resiliency traini ng. Since Ringenbach's (2009) study found that the meditation practice group had significantl y higher levels of self-compassion and lower levels of burnout than the non-me ditating group, although no intervention was 71 performed by the researcher, th is study would be worth pursing further as an intervention effects study in the very near future. Data Extraction and Coding Procedures The two studies that met the inclusio n criteria were coded using a coding instrument designed by the author (see A ppendix C). The coding instrument was comprised of six sections: (1) source descri ptors and study context; (2) description of participants; (3) treatment/intervention descript ors; (4) research methods and quality; (5) effect size level coding, preliminary da ta; and (6) outcome/effect size data. To ensure reliability of coding procedures , all studies included in this review were independently coded by this author and a second coder utilizing the data coding instrument discussed above. Any discre pancies in the codes were reviewed and discussed by authors. Discrepancie s were resolved through consensus. Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was designed to produce descriptive information on the characteristics of the studies included, the mean effect size of the interventions, the heterogeneity of effect sizes around those mean s, and the relationship between effect size and methodological qualities as well as substantive characteristics of the samples and interventions. Although mode rator analyses were planned, and variables we re identified and extracted during the data coding stage, moderator analysis was not possible due to only two studies meeting eligibility criteria for this review. Thus the relationship between effect sizes and met hodological, substantive, and sa mple characteristics was not explored. 72 Calculation of Effect Sizes Effect sizes were calculated for compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout as both included studies measured al l three of these outcomes. To maintain statistical independence, only one effect size was computed for each outcome of interest (Littell, 2008). The effect sizes were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) 2.0 (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2005) by inputting the pre-test mean, post-test mean, sample size and paired groups t-values for each outcome in both studies. For the Landis study, the author did not report adequate statistics in the original report to calculate effect sizes. I sent a query to the author requesting the needed data and the author provided the raw data from the study fo r each participant. In this case, the pre- and post-test means and the paired groups ' t-value was calculated using SPSS v.20 (IBM Corp., 2011) and then entered into CMA. Because both studies reported pre-post contrasts of a single group, the standardized me an gain effect size statistic was utilized. The standardized mean gain was calculated by subtracting the post- test mean from the pre-test mean divided by the pooled standard deviation of th e Time 1 and Time 2 scores (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Statistical Analysis of Effect Sizes Meta-analysis was performed in CMA 2.0 to quantitatively synthesize the effects of the two included studies to calculate a grand mean effect size and confidence intervals around the mean effect size fo r each of the three outcome s of interest: compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassi on satisfaction. A random-effects model using the method of inverse variance weighting was used. Weighted effect sizes were calculated by 73 multiplying each effect size by its inverse vari ance, giving studies with larger sample sizes greater weight. A random effects m odel assumes that the variability between studies is due to subject level sampling error as well as another random component assumed to be at the study-level (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Between study variance using a random effects model is conceived to be unsystematic and thus cannot be explained, whereas between study variance using a fixed effects model is conceived as being a function of study or interventi on characteristic s that can be systematically explained (Hedges, 1992). It was anticipated prior to c onducting this meta-analysis that there would be significant variability between studies due to the diversity of inte rventions as well as participant and methodol ogical characteristics of the st udies, thus it was anticipated a priori that a random effects model would be assumed. Also, due to tests of heterogeneity, as described below, utilizi ng a random effects m odel was justified. Test of Homogeneity A test of homogeneity ( Q-test) was conducted to comp are the observed variance between studies to what would be e xpected from sampling error. The Q statistic is distributed as a chi-square with k-1 degrees of freedom (k = the number of effect sizes) (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The Q statistic is calculated by adding the squared deviations of each study's effect size from the mean effect size, weighing their contribution by its inverse variance. A significant Q rejects the null hypothesis, i ndicating that the variability of effect sizes between studies is greater than what would be expected by sampling error alone. In the case of a significant Q-value, a random effects model is employed as it assumes the variability between studies is due to not only subject level sampling error, 74 but also due to an additional random com ponent at the study-level (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Tests of homogeneity for each outcome were conducted in CMA. Publication Bias Publication bias can occur as a result of decisions on the part of authors as well as editors to publish studies with positive and significant effect s at a greater frequency than publishing studies when findings may be insign ificant, or run counter to the hypothesis or conventional wisdom (Cooper, 2010). Incl uding only published studies in a meta- analysis could likely introduce an upward bias into the e ffect sizes (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Therefore, it is recommended that meta-analysis include both published and unpublished studies to minimize this bias (Cooper, 2010; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). This review made every attempt to include both published and unpublished reports to minimize the occurrence of publication bias. Because this review included only two studies, one published and one unpublished, cond ucting formal analysis of publication bias (i.e., a scatterplot) was not possible. CHAPTER FOUR RESULTS This chapter begins with a description of the studies included in this review and meta-analysis. Descriptive information re garding study characteristics, participant characteristics and intervention characteristics will be summarized for all of the studies included in the review. In the second part of the chapter, the results of the meta-analysis, including effect sizes and grand mean effect sizes of each outcome of interest will be presented. In total, this chapter presents findi ngs on 88 mental health workers who were participants in two independent samples reported in two studies of interventions intended to decrease symptoms of compassion fatigue and secondary trauma in mental health workers. Both studies were singl e group pre-posttest studies (SGPP). Descriptive Analysis Study Characteristics Table 2 summarizes the characteristic s of the included studies, which were published in 2004 (Study 1; Gentry, Bagge rly, & Baranowsky, 2004) and 2010 (Study 2; Landis, 2010). Both studies were conducted in the United States. Researchers and practitioners from social work and psychol ogy authored the studies included in this synthesis. Of the two studies included, St udy 1 was published in a peer-reviewed journal and Study 2 was an unpublished dissertation. Sample sizes of the included studies were 75 76 Table 2: Summary of Study Characteristics Author Intervention (year) Publication Type N Country of Study Discipline of First AuthorMeasures Length of Intervention Gentry, Certified Compassion Baggerly, & Fatigue Specialist Barranowsky Training (training-as- (2004) treatment) Landis Sharevision; 6 expressive (2010) arts-integrated workshops Peer reviewed journal Dissertation 83 5 US US LMHC Licensed Mental Health Counselor LMFT Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist CSFST CSFST, T RS, SRS , GCS 17-20 hours (over 2-3 day period) 18.75 hours (over 12 wk period) 77 fairly small. The mean sample size of the two included SGPP studies was 44 (range 5- 83; SD=39). Attrition was not a problem in e ither of the studies. Study 2 reported that the intention was to obtain a much larger samp le size, but the researcher was not able to recruit the number of participants she had originally planned. Study 1 (Gentry, Baggerly, & Baranowsky, 2004) examined the treatment effectiveness of a demonstration, training- as-treatment program called the Certified Compassion Fatigue Specialist Training (CCFST) in decreas ing symptoms of compassion fatigue. Study 2 (Landis, 2010) examined th e impact of a collabo rative-reflective, expressive arts intervention on decreasing s econdary trauma through a research project that combined six expressive arts-integ rated workshops and an intervention called Sharevision (see Appendix D). Both in cluded studies est of compa ssion satisfaction, comp assion fatigue, and burnout (see Appendix A). Study 2 also incl uded three additional measures: (1) the Trauma Recovery Scale (TRS) which Gentry developed in 1996 to measure whether respondents met criteria for post-traumatic st ress disorder (PTSD) and their potential ability to recover from trauma (Gentry, 1999; Appendix E); the Silencing Response Scale (SRS) (Baranowsky, 2002; Appendix F) to identify selective li stening and active avoidance on the part of the therapist; a nd (3) the Global Check Set (GCS) (Baranowsky & Gentry, 1998; Appendix G) which evaluates aspects of clinicians' mental health in order to identify any signif icant psychopathology (Gentry, 2008). The length of time 78 researchers measured symptoms of comp assion fatigue, compassion satisfaction and burnout at post-test ranged from 2 days to 12 weeks. There are no reports of any follow- up data that was collected. Both studies measured three outcomes ba sed on the subscales of the CSFST. The CSFST is a scale originally developed by Figley (1995) and was la ter revised by Figley & Stamm (1996). This 66-item scale a ssesses for compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction and burnout with a 6- point Likert scale (0 = never , 5 = very often ). Reported internal consistency reliability alphas range from 0.86 to 0.96 on two subscales from this instrument (i.e., compassion fatigue and burnout ) and a structural reliability coefficient (Tuckers) of .91 was found (Figley & Stam m, 1996; Jenkins & Baird, 2002). Good evidence of reliability and internal consis tency alpha scores for each of the three subscales has been found in the psychometric properties of the CSFST (Bride, Radey, Figley, 2007; Stamm, 2002). The CSFST is the only known instrument that measures both compassion fatigue and compassion sa tisfaction (Gentry et al., 2004). The outcomes of interest for this review include: compassion fatigue, burnout and compassion satisfaction. The first subscale of compassion fatigue is viewed as a component of secondary traumatic stress. A ccording to Stamm (2010), CF has two parts. The first part involves symptoms such as e xhaustion, frustration, anger and depression. The second part concerns feeli ngs that are driven by fear as well as work-related trauma, which can be a combination of both primar y and secondary trauma. Other symptoms include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having intrusive and upsetting 79 thoughts/images, or avoiding situ ations that remind one of the trauma. These symptoms are seen typically as having a rapid onset. Higher scores indicate th at one might want to examine how one might feel about thei r work and their work environment. Burnout is identified in the CSFST as being associated with feelings of hopelessness and having difficulties in managing work responsibilities or in performing in one's job effectively (Sta mm, 2010). These symptoms usually have a gradual onset and can be associated with a high workload or an unsupportive work environment. These symptoms can also reflect feelings of self-unimportance as related to the work environment. Higher scores on this scale indica te that one is at a higher risk for burnout. Compassion satisfaction, the third subscal e, measures the pleasure derived from having the ability to do one's work well (Stamm, 2002). Higher scores on this scale represent a greater satisfaction related to one's ability to be an effective caregiver in one's job. Table 3 further summarizes how the subsca le scores are interpreted as defined by the developers of the scale (Fig ley, 1995; Figley & Stamm, 1996). Table 3: Ranges of CSFST Subscale Scores Level of Risk/Potential Burnout Level Compassion Fatigue Level Compassion Satisfaction Level Extremely High 76-85 41 and above 118 and above High Moderate 37-50 31-35 82-99 Low 27-30 64-81 Extremely Low 36 or less 26 or less 63 or less 80 Although burnout, compassion fatigue a nd compassion satisfaction are the outcomes of interest in this synthesis, and the only outcomes for which effect sizes were calculated, it is interesting to note the other outcomes authors measured. Table 4 lists the other outcomes that were measured in Study 2.

Of those participating in the two studi es, four mental health work ers and one graduate student received the collaborative-reflective, expressive arts-integrated workshops and Sharevision and 83 mental health workers participated in the Certified Compassion Fatigue Specialist Training. Study 1 collected demographic data on only seven of their 83 participants. Table 5 summarizes the characteristics of the participants of the included studies. 81 Table 5: Participant Characteristics Characteristics N (%) # of Participants Mean age Training Level Master's and Doctorate level Bachelor's level Sex Female** Male** Mean years of clinical experience* Place of work at time of study Community human service organization Not given 88 45.7* 47** 87 (99%) 1 (1%) (94%) Notes: *Data from 7of 83 participants in Study 1 only. **Data from Study 2 only. In Study 1, the mean age of 45.7 was calcula ted by the researchers for just seven of their 83 participants due to lack of demographic information collected for the remaining 76 participants. Study 2 had a mean age of 47 years old of the five participants. The studies incl uded a mixture of training levels which integrated master's level social workers and counselors, docto rate level psycholo gists, a counseling psychology intern, and \"mental health professi onals.\" Neither study included statistical information about race/ethnicity. One author stated that all participants \"appeared to be\" Caucasian. Study 1 reported 100% (n=7) fe male participants of the seven of 83 participants that completed demographic in formation. Female participants comprised 82 80% (n=4) of the Study 2 sample. Study 1 repor ted 17 mean years of clinical experience of seven of their 83 participants. Study 2 did not include information related to the number of years of clinical experience per participant. Neither study included information regarding participants havi ng specialized traini ng with traumatized individuals prior to the intervention. Neither study reported information on demographics of participants' caseloads. Neither study reported information on the ages of clients they work with in the field. Study 1 recruited their pa rticipants from the International Traumatology Institute's marke ting and advertising efforts which included mailings of over 5,000 brochures, radio, and periodical advertisement, as well as dissemination through the Intern ational Traumatology Institute 's website; while Study 2 recruited participants from one community human service organization. Intervention Characteristics The interventions in this review represent a very limited range of modalities, components, providers, and settings due to the limited number of studies that met inclusion criteria. This review examined indicated interventions for mental health workers who have identified symptoms of co mpassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and/or vicarious traumatization. Modalities and Componen ts of Interventions Two different interventions were evaluated in the studies include d in this review. One modality was a specialized training-as-t reatment intervention where participants took part in a Certified Comp assion Fatigue Specialist Training (CCFST). The second 83 modality, which was an art therapy inte rvention, had several components. The participants took part in six collaborative-reflective, expres sive arts-integrated workshops over a six week period then participated in a facilitated group led by the researcher called Sharevision on alternating week s. During the non-facilita tor Sharevision weeks, the group met and ran their own Sharevision meeti ng. Peer supervision, peer support groups, group case consultations, specialized trai nings (Sharevision), a psychoeducational seminar on secondary trauma, and various expr essive arts projects were all components of Study 2. The treatment format in both studies included both individual and group components. Table 6 provides a list of the interventions the two studies. Table 6: Type of Intervention Type of Intervention Study Certified Compassion Fatigue Specialist Training (CCFST) Collaborative-reflective, expressive arts-integrated workshops Sharevision Study 1 Study 2 Study 2 The coding protocol for the review in cluded numerous items to capture the various components of interventions. Both studi es utilized a specializ ed training as part or all of the interven tion. The author of Study 2 was c ontacted via email by this writer in order to ensure that all components of th e intervention were accounted for through the coding process. This information was verifi ed and all components were identified. This writer also attempted to c ontact the second author of Study 1, who was listed as the 84 contact person, but the email failed to send due to perhaps the email address no longer being valid. Certified Compassion Fatigue Specialist Training The Certified Compassion Fatigue Sp ecialist Training (CCFST) (Gentry & Baranowsky, 1998) is a manualized protocol that is designed for mental health care professionals with at least a Master's degree (or an M.A. in progress), or four years of counseling work with on-going supervision. Th e training objective is to supply the tools necessary for the participant to implement interventions to decrease the effects of compassion fatigue in other caregivers as we ll as execute the five-session manualized and copyrighted Accelerated Recovery Program pr otocol (Gentry et al., 2004). This study was well defined. Although the treatment prot ocol was not included in the study, it is available through Corporate Crisis Manage ment at www.CorporateCrisis.net which makes this study replicable (Gentry et al., 2004). The CCFST is a combined course of didactic and experiential learning. Participants are taught theory and research on compassion fatigue, countertransference, posttraumatic stress disorder, secondary traumatic stress, vicarious traumatization and burnout (Gentry et al., 2004). Study 1 incl uded two days of CCFST training. Day 1 explained the history etiology and phenom enology of compassion fatigue. A guided imagery exercise and ARP program overview followed. Next, an assessment, mission statement (small group exercise) and \"telli ng the story\" (dyadic exercise) were completed. Finally, a group discussion, closure and homework were given. 85 On day 2, anxiety management and resolution of secondary traumatic stress was taught. Participants then completed a self-assessment of anxiety and their own graphic time line. Next, Callahan's (1995) thought fiel d therapy technique of tapping algorithms to release blocked energy and the Neuro Li nguistic Programming anchoring technique for the desensitization and reprocessing of s econdary traumatic stress were taught. Following these techniques, a large group de briefing was given. Self-supervision was subsequently instructed (coercion vs. guidanc e) via audio-dialogue as well as Gentry and Baranowsky's (1998) self-direc ted resiliency and anxiet y reduction protocol of PATHWAYS. Finally, discus sion, closure and a post-test concluded the two day training. Once the CCFST training is completed, the participant will be certified as a Compassion Fatigue Specia list by the Traumatology Institute in Canada (www.psychink.com ). Sharevision and Collaborative-Reflective Expressive Arts-Integrated Workshops Study 2 was determined through the analysis to be considered a research project and was based on a pilot study written by the st udy's author (Landis, 2007). This study was comprised of (1) six collaborative-reflec tive, expressive arts-integrated workshops (with the researcher/facilitator present); and (2) Sharevision on alternating weeks (without the researcher/facilitator present). The six workshops entailed: (1) learning the collaborative-reflective design; (2) exploring participant's ow n experiences of secondary trauma; (3) communicating through expressive arts materials (puppet making, costume making, group expressive arts project); and (4) developing, performing and reflecting on 86 an arts-integrated group action pr oject that represents their co llective effort to interrupt the cycle of violence (Landis, 2010). Th rough telephone contact with Ellen Landis by this author, it was determined that these co mponents of the intervention were present in Study 2: peer supervision; peer support groups; group case c onsultations; and a psychoeducational seminar on secondary trauma. The author's operationalization of the treatment procedures in Study 2 was very clear and well defined. This treatment could also be replicated based on the de scription provided in the study. Setting The setting of Study 1 was not able to be determined due to lack of information provided in the report. Study 2 was conducte d in a small conference room in the community human service organization where the participants worked. Setting Delivery: Providers The authors of both included studies were involved in the delivery of the interventions they were testing. In Study 1, two of the three re searchers provided six separate CCFST interventions. One research er (Gentry) at the time of the study was a Licensed Mental Health Couns elor, doctoral candidate, a nd Master Traumatologist. Gentry provided four of the six total trainings given to the participants. The second researcher (Baranowsky) in Study 1 was a Ph D in Clinical Psychology and a Registered Traumatologist and provided instruction at one of the trainings. On e of the six trainings was co-facilitated by both researchers. It is unclear if these resear chers had supervision at any point during or after the im plementation of the intervention. 87 In Study 2, the researcher provided one part of the intervention (6 collaborative- reflective, expressive arts interventions on alternating weeks) and the participants provided the second portion of the intervention to each other in a peer group (Sharevision) held without th e researcher. The research er in Study 2 was a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and a doctora l candidate in expressive arts. This researcher also had regular weekly supervision during the in terventions and she continued supervision after the interventions were completed. Funding Sources and Cost per Participant The funding sources and cost per par ticipant in Study 1 were unable to be determined due to lack of information. In Study 2, the researcher was offering the program for research towards her PhD, thus there was no cost associated with delivering the program other than the researcher's time. Duration of Treatment The intervention in Study 1 was a 2- day and 3-day training-as-treatment intervention. The CCFST was delivered six diffe rent times to a total of 83 participants. The original training was offered in a 20 hour , 3-day format, but later was revised to a shorter version offered in a 17 hour, 2-day fo rmat. Three hours were eliminated by (a) participants completing the informed consen ts, pre-training instruments, and the mission statement exercise prior to the training; (b) th e dyadic exercise of sharing a chronological narrative of participants' prof essional experiences with a partner was shortened by one- half hour; and (c) the self-supervision exercise were shortened by one-half hour (Gentry 88 et al., 2004). A paired sample t-test was utilized to compare the CCFST 17-hour participants' The paired sample between the 17-hour participan ts' and the 20-hour participants' scores, therefore the authors combined the participants' scores to obtain a larger sample size for the analysis (Gentry et al., 2004). The second study evaluated an on-going intervention with a12-week duration. Six workshops were held with the facilitator that lasted 1.5 hours every other week. Six workshops were held without the facilitator that lasted 1.5 hours ev ery other week. Exit interviews were held with the facilitator that lasted .75 hours per participant individually. The mean number of hours of total contact with the facilitator present was 6.75 hours. The total dosage of treatment, or the mean number of total hour s of contact between participants, was 18.75 hours. Effect Size Analysis The standardized mean gain effect si ze was calculated for the three outcomes measured and reported by both studies. Meta-analysis was conducted, assuming a random effects model, to synthesize the effect s on each of the three out comes of interest. These outcomes include compassion fati gue, compassion satisfaction and burnout (CSFST; Figley, 1995; Figley & Stamm, 1996). Overall, both studies demonstrated positive and significant effects on all three outcomes with the exception of the Landis study on the compassion satisfaction outcome. The grand mean effect size for each of the 89 three outcomes was large, but not significant; however, there were only two studies in the meta-analysis and significant variance betw een the studies was found, thus the grand mean effect size must be in terpreted with much caution. Results on each outcome are presented below. Mean Effects of Interventions on Compassion Fatigue The Gentry, Baggerly, and Baranows ky study and the Landis study results indicate a large and si gnificant effect on compassion fati gue. The mean effect of the Sharevision and collaborative-reflective, expressive arts-integrated workshops intervention was 3.2, a very large effect, wh ile the mean effect size of the CCFST intervention was .96, also consid ered a large effect. The gr and mean effect, 1.83, is also large; however, the confidence interval incl udes zero (CI -.34-4.00) indicating the mean effect size is not significant. Due to the small sample size of this synthesis and the included studies, as well as the variance found between the studies (discussed further below), the mean effect size is not very mean ingful and must be cautiously interpreted. The homogeneity of the effect size distri bution was assessed. The results of the statistical test for homogene ity on burnout was significant (Q =4.11, df (1), p < .05), thus rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. The significant Q value indicates that there is substantial variance among the effects, more so than would be expected from sampling error alone. This was anticipated as these two interventions are quite different in terms of both intervention characteristics and sample ch aracteristics as it relates to the mean pre- 90 test scores of the samples. Further analysis to assess the reasons for the variance was not possible due to the small sample size of this review.

(2004) study results indicate a large and sign ificant effect on compassion satisfaction. The Landis study resu lts indicate a small and non-significant effect ( p=.743) on compassion satisfaction. The mean effect of the Sharevision and collaborative-reflective, expres sive arts-integrated intervention was .15, a small effect, while the mean effect of the CCFST intervention was 1.30, consid ered a very large effect. The grand mean effect, .80, is also large; how ever, the confidence interval includes zero (CI -.32-1.92) indicating the mean effect size is not significant. Again, due to the sample size of this synthesis and the included studi es, as well as the va riance found between the studies, the mean effect size is not very mean ingful and must be cautiously interpreted. The homogeneity of the effect size distribu tion was assessed. The results of the statistical test for homogene ity on burnout was significant (Q = 5.94, df (1), p < .05), thus rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. The significant Q value indicates that there is substantial variance among the effects, more so than would be expected from sampling 91 error alone. This was anticipated, as these tw o interventions are quite different in terms of both intervention characteristic s and sample characteristics, particularly as it relates to the mean pre-test scores of the samples. Fu rther analysis to asse ss the reasons for the variance was not possible due to the small sample size of this review.

(2004) study indicates a medium and significant effect on burnout. The Landis study indicates a very larg e and significant eff ect on burnout. The mean effect of the Sharevision and collabora tive-reflective, expre ssive arts-integrated intervention was 3.25, a very large effect, while the mean effect of the CCFST intervention was .761, which is considered a medium effect. The grand mean effect, 1.76, is large; however the conf idence interval includes zero (CI -.63-4.15) indicating the mean effect size is not significant. As in th e other two outcomes, the mean effect size is not very meaningful and again must be cauti ously interpreted due to the small sample size of this synthesis and the included studi es, as well as the va riance found between the studies. 92 The homogeneity of the effect size distribu tion was assessed. The results of the statistical test for homogene ity on burnout was significant (Q = 4.87, df (1), p < .05), thus rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity. The significant Q value indicates that there is substantial variance among the effects, more so than would be expected from sampling error alone. This was anticipated, as these tw o interventions are quite different in terms of both intervention characteristics and sample characteristics as it relates to the mean pre-test scores of the samples. Further analysis to assess the reasons for the variance was not possible due to the small sample size of this review.

Although a small number of studies were expected due to significant re search prior to the actual systematic review, it is alarming that only two studies met the inclusion criteria. With the constructs of compassion fatigue , secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization being heavily present in the lit erature for the past two decades, it seems warranted to locate more research regarding in tervention effectiveness on this topic as the constructs relate to ment al health workers. 93 The sample sizes varied significan tly among the two studies, although both samples are considered small. Each of the two study's pool of participants were similar, all coming from a mental health background. Almost all of the participants were female with only one male. The partic ipants from the study with th e intervention of Sharevision and the collaborative-reflective, expressive ar ts intervention were all recruited from the same place of work, which was a community human service organization in Massachusetts; however, the CCFST pool of participants' net was cast more widely through the International Traumatology Instit ute's marketing and advertising efforts, which included mailings of over 5,000 brochures, radio, and periodical advertisement, as well as information provided through their we bsite. This mass recruitment could allow for a more diverse pool of par ticipants with various types of mental health backgrounds. Surprisingly, neither study provided thor ough demographic data such as age, race, years of clinical experience, or type of clients treated. Study 1 did record demographic data only on seven of the 83 participants. Th e explanation for this by Gentry et al. (2004) was that the remaining 76 participants had participated in the 20-hour CCFST and the demographic data was simply not collected for this group. Having this additional demographic information could assist with the explanation and correlation of treatment effects and could provide further data in steering the direction of future studies. The method in which the interventions we re delivered in the two studies differed significantly. In Study 1, six separate CC FST 2-day (17-hours) and 3-day (20-hours) interventions were performed with six different groups of participants. Of those six, one 94 researcher led four CCFSTs, the second researcher led one CCFST and both researchers co-led the last CCFST. In St udy 2, the researcher provided one part of the intervention (6 collaborative-reflective, expr essive arts-integrated workshops) and the participants themselves provided the second part of th e intervention (Share vision) without the researcher present. There are also fundamental differences in these two interv entions besides the manner in which they were delivered. Th e CCFST intervention in Study 1 was a seminar format where the researchers led trainings on several different subjects and then the participants took part in small group and dyadi c exercises. The original goal of the CCFST was to provide training to other helpi ng professionals in order to implement the Accelerated Recovery Program (A RP). It was hypothesized by Gentry et al. (2004) that the CCFST would reduce compassion fatigue symp toms in participants of the training since the ARP had demonstrated effectiv eness in decreasing compassion fatigue symptoms in caregivers. The six workshops in Study 2 were art oriented in which participants created certain objects with supplies su ch as scissors, fabric, paper, glue and yarn along with pre- determined topics for group discussions led by the researcher. The Sharevision intervention in Study 2 was a group process dire cted by an agenda of questions created by the group and involved time limits with a time-keeper. According to Landis (2010), power is shared among the participants and a ma in goal of the interventions is to develop 95 new awareness that assists mental hea lth workers in continuously building understandings of beliefs and patterns to impr ove their own lives and the lives of others. The two included studies u tilized the CSFST to measur e outcomes based on the three subscales: compassion satisfacti on, compassion fatigue and burnout. One study also employed three other measures to identify other outcomes of interest. The length of time researchers measured symptoms of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction and burnout varied greatly between studies. One study's post-test was on day two, the last day of the intervention; whereas the second study's post-test was given 12-weeks after the start of the intervention. The results of the homogeneity tests in the two studies found significant heterogeneity among effect sizes for all three outc omes of interest. This indicates that the observed variance is significantly different from what would be expected by sampling error alone and that the mean effect size does not estimate the common population mean (Cooper, 1998; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Further discussion of the findings as well as the implications for practice, research and social work education will be presented in the following chapter. CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSION This study presents the first systematic review and meta-ana lysis of indicated interventions for decreasing sy mptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and/or vicarious traumatization. While several narrative reviews have been written in the past, this systematic review provides a mo re comprehensive search and less biased review than had been conducted in the past . Moreover, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative synthesis of inte rvention outcomes that had been missing from the literature, although only two studies met the inclusion criteria which will be a later point of discussion. The purpose of this study was to locate and retrieve outcome studies of indicated interventions targeting mental health workers who have symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss, or vicarious traumatization to (1) determine what this often confusing a nd overlapping body of research on compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vi carious traumatization has produced and provide a descriptive overview of the current research; (2) examine the effects of these interventions on symptoms of compassion fati gue, secondary traumatic stress, and/or vicarious traumatization in mental health workers; (3) provide evidence-based recommendations to inform social work practice; and (4) recommend priorities for future research. This chapter will provide a discus sion of the findings of the review and meta- 96 97 analysis and discuss implications for social work practice a nd research. An examination of the strengths and limitations of the study will follow. Overview of Findings This review and meta-analysis incl uded one published and one unpublished study measuring three distinct outcomes of indicat ed interventions targ eting symptoms of compassion fatigue, burnout and compassion sa tisfaction among ment al health workers who had pre-identified sympto ms of compassion fatigue. After a comprehensive and exhaustive search for studies, only two si ngle group pre-posttest (SGPP) studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. There is a strong call for research in this area. We are not helping the helpers. If we do not help the helpers, how can mental health workers possibly help their clients? The two studies in this review and me ta-analysis represent the best empirical evidence currently available for outcomes of indicated interventions targeting mental health workers with symptoms of compa ssion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress or vicarious traumatization. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the current available research provides just a starting point to understanding effects interventions are having on decreasing symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization since conclusions cannot be made with such a small sample size. Moreover, systematic reviews and meta-analyses also provide a more transparent and valid analysis strategy than the alternative means of narrative re views and vote counting methods (Valentine, Pigott, & Rothstein, 2010). In addition, it provid es an inventory of 98 current evidence and a means to more syst ematically uncovering the gaps in the knowledge base (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). As evidenced by the lack of rigorous out come research in this area, there is limited evidence of the effect s of interventions to reduce symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue and vi carious traumatization among mental health workers. The two included studies, both of which utilized a within-group research design, can provide some evidence of pr omise of effectiveness, but due to methodological deficiencies, particularly related to internal va lidity, we cannot infer that the interventions were causally related to the large and mostly significant effects found. The mean effects of the interventions in cluded in this review, 1.83 for compassion fatigue, .80 for compassion satisfaction and 1.76 for burnout, were large but not significantly different from zero. Moreover, the large amount of heterogeneity and the small number of studies included in th e meta-analysis significantly limits the interpretation of the mean effect of the included studies. However, when examined individually, the studies demonstrate some pr omise in achieving their desired effects. The approaches of the two interventions were rather different and the study methodologies and quality varied as well. The strengths a nd limitations of both studies will be further discussed in the following section. Strengths and Limitations of Included Studies The two included studies in this meta -analysis were quite diverse in their methodologies, although both st udies reported a decrease in compassion fatigue symptoms. The results of Gent ry et al.'s (2004) CCFST stud y suggest that the protocol 99 provides an effective intervention in the fo rm of training-as-treatment. The training participants in this study experienced a reduction in compassion fatigue symptoms while learning how to implement the Accelerated Recovery Program (ARP) through the Certified Compassion Fatigue Specialist Trai ning. The goal of the ARP is to reduce compassion fatigue symptoms in the participan ts of that program. The CCFST study not only demonstrated statistical significance in reduction of compa ssion fatigue symptoms but clinical significance as we ll. The CSFST measure that wa s utilized in this study is valid and reliable and is al so the only known instrument th at measures both compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction (Figley, 1995; Figley & Stamm, 1996). A further strength of the CCFST study is the accessibl e step-by-step protocol which makes this study replicable. The Landis (2010) Sharevision/collaborativ e-reflective, expressive arts-integrated study also utilized the CSFST tool which is considered valid and reliable and the only tool in existence that measures compassi on fatigue and compassi on satisfaction (Figley, 1995; Figley & Stamm, 1996). An additional strength of this study was the inclusion of a qualitative component where the researcher ha d three people code the transcript and well as included full transcripts to avoid abstra ction and serve as ev idence to support the legitimacy of identified emergent themes (L andis, 2010). This qualitative component added a more in depth understanding of the CS FST results for each participant. Finally, a Sharevision protocol is pr ovided which also makes th is study replicable. Limitations 100 Though an encouraging start of the additi on of intervention effectiveness studies in the literature, there were several limita tions of the two included studies. The CCFST study had a small sample size (N=83) and la cked a randomized control and comparison group, therefore the results cannot be genera lized to the entire population of mental health professionals and causal inferences cannot be made. Since the CCFST is considered a naturalistic, professional trai ning program, random sampling or assignment procedures would be difficult. This study also did not reco rd demographic data from 76 of the 83 participants which could have allowe d further analysis such as correlations and predictive factors. Finally, the use of only one measurement tool which is also a self- reporting could be interpreted as a limitation, although the res earchers point out that the CSFST is the only instrument that measures symptoms of compassion fatigue (Gentry et al., 2004; Figley, 1995; Figley & Stamm, 1996). The limitations of the Landis (2010) Sh arevision/collaborative-reflective, expressive arts-integrated intervention study include the study's small sample size (N=5) and the lack of a randomized control and comp arison group. Therefore the results of this study also cannot be generalized to the entire mental health worker population and causal inferences cannot be made. A second lim itation is that Landis was a non-neutral participant-observer with a bias toward the intervention approach. It could be possible that participants felt the need to please the researcher and censored or exaggerated their responses in their exit interviews. Finally, the researcher did not record demographics such as age or race which could have allo wed for further analysis regarding predictive factors or correlations between variables. 101 102 Barriers to Research Upon initial observation, it a ppears that a barrier to re search is the fact that opportunities are not readily available in th e implementation of intervention research studies among mental health workers. According to Figley and Landis (in email exchanges with this writer), this is due in part to lack of funding. If mental health workers were monetarily supported in their que st to determine interv ention effectiveness on compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic st ress and vicarious traumatization, then more research may be possible. In many of the studies examined in the process of this review and meta-analysis, the availability and willingness of mental health workers to commit to participating in research due to thei r busy schedules was described as a barrier. Landis (2010) and Wlodarczyk (2010) both made mention of having groups during the participants' lunch hour in order to acco mmodate their busy schedules and having the ability to follow-through with the research study. If organizations that work with traumatized clients were more open to allowi ng studies to be performed and supportive of the research process, more time could be allotted specifically for research purposes within those organizations. Bober and Regehr (2006) point out that th ere is little support within the workplace for psychotherapists who work with traumatized clients. Accepting and normalizing the fact that mental health workers do indeed suffer from compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicar ious traumatization would assist with removing this barrier to research. 103 Implications for Practice It is difficult to make well-founded r ecommendations for practice based on the limited intervention effectiveness studies in the cu rrent literature and in this synthesis. In practical terms, the research can be summarized and will add to the meager intervention effectiveness studies in the literature. Bober and Regehr (2006) point out that too much attention has been paid to individually focused interventions and coping rather than organizati onal approaches. Of the four studies that had positive outcomes, all involved a group dynamic as well as a training of some kind. It follows that group interventions appear to be not only more effective at this juncture, but also steers aw ay from blaming the victim. Mental health worker's responses to a client's traumatic ma terial should not be pathologized, according to McCann and Pearlman (1990), rather it should be normalized. By providing group interventions within organiza tions, workers receive the message that they are supported and that they are not alone in their sufferi ng. The provision of intervention groups also can give hope and allow workers to feel optimistic when faced with client's traumatic material. Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995) have r ecommended supervision to provide an avenue for mental health workers to confid entially and emotionally process the traumatic information from their clients. Supervisi on is helpful when group opportunities are not available and facilitates the worker in f eeling supported and cont ributes to normalizing the situation. Rosenbloom, Pratt, and Pear lman (1999) suggest mental health workers have time for lunch, walks during the work day, and personal phone calls to help in 104 preventing and ameliorating symptoms of secondary traumatic stress. They also recommend that organizations provide vacati ons and flexible hours to improve mental health worker's job related experiences as they attend to individuals who have been traumatized. Landis (2010) suggests that organizations provide opportunities for employees to build connections that can foster a positive sense of community, which in turn can help to alleviate symptoms of co mpassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization. Intervention programs should be em bedded in organizations' policies and procedures where all new employees are subj ect to a training-as-treatment type of program, such as the Accelerated Recovery Program (ARP). These programs should also be provided on an on-going basi s as refresher courses, pe rhaps every six months, for \"tune-ups\" and education on current research. Implications for Research Traumatic incidents are occurring all around the world on a daily basis. War, gun violence, natural disasters and even techno logical traumatic incidents such as cyber- bullying and accidents related to texting and dr iving are just naming a few. While these incidents are primary traumas causing posttrauma tic stress in an individual, mental health professionals who work with traumatized indi viduals are also exposed to this trauma through hearing their clients' stories and w itnessing the emotional responses. This secondary exposure to trauma can lead to pr oblematic symptoms in the mental health professional and is a serious concern in the fi eld of mental health and social work. The mid-nineties was the heyday for studies attempting to understand the phenomenon and 105 identify causes and correlates of compassi on fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization. Inte rvention effectiveness studies began to emerge in the early 2000's; however, intervention research in th is area remains sparse and the serious methodological deficiencies within the exta nt research is concerning. Continuing to expand and improve intervention effectiveness research can lead the mental health field closer to more effectively managing and preventing symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization. The interventions tested by Landis (2010) and Gentry et al. (2004) showed some promise in decreasing symptoms of comp assion fatigue and bu rnout and increasing compassion satisfaction; however, these interv entions need to be examined with more rigorous study designs. Majo r changes are recommended in or der to further substantiate these studies. Both studies would be more e ffective with participant groups that are large enough to be generalized. Quasi-experimental conditions should be implemented, such as multiple baseline or wait-list control groups in order to determine if the treatment effect was due entirely to the intervention or other intervening va riables. Complete demographic data should be collected on all participants. Gentry et al. (2004) contend that participant interviews added into th eir study could assist with distilling the information gathered from the CCFST's eff ectiveness. Qualitative approaches in all studies can ensure a more in-depth analysis and insight of the participants' experiences through the exploration of their responses. Gentry's study also includes a recommendation for future research to meas ure the effectiveness of the Accelerated 106 Recovery Program (ARP) in reducing compassion fatigue on the individual receiving the treatment. Consideration of prospective longitudina l studies to examine compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious tr aumatization over time could add to our understanding of secondary trauma in ment al health workers and more effectively identify the prevalence and severity as well as factors related to risk and resilience. Greater understanding of risk and protective f actors as well as the developmental course of secondary trauma could better inform th e development of preven tion and intervention. Another area of future research could be fo cused on resilience of me ntal health workers who regularly work with traumatized indivi duals but do not themselves appear to be negatively impacted. Understand ing individual and organizati onal characteristics, as well as strategies employed by resilient professi onals, could also aid in the development of prevention and intervention efforts. Strengths and Limitations As a practical implication, this study provides benefits to the enhancement of knowledge and improvement in interventions targeted at decreasing symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stre ss and vicarious traumatization as well as increasing compassion satisfa ction among mental health professionals and other vulnerable professionals. Although a numb er of literature reviews on compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic st ress and vicarious traumatizat ion had been done in the past, this study improved upon prior reviews in two ways. First, this review applied a systematic and transparent process for sear ching, retrieving and coding studies to be 107 included in the review. Utilizing a systematic method to conduct the review of outcome research limits bias and reduces chance effects, leading to more reliable results (Higgins & Green, 2006). Utilizing an explicit and transparent descri ption of the review process allows for the review to be re plicated. It also allows for the expansion of the review, either by other reviewers who want to expand upon the criteria estab lished by the original reviewer or by adding additional studies in the fu ture to the original review as more data becomes available (Higgins & Green, 2006). Second, a comprehensive search method was u tilized to locate and retrieve studies which allowed for an unpublished study to be included in this review. Some prior reviews did not use the grey literature in their reviews. Reviews that include only published studies risk having findings that are upwardly biased (Glass et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 2001). Limitations Although an exhaustive search was undertak en, merely two studi es met eligibility criteria for this review. The analysis in cludes only two studies due to the exclusion criteria of limiting to mental health workers, as well as larg ely due to a lack of empirical studies assessing effectiveness of interventi ons targeting compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization. Both studies included in this analysis met criteria as indicated interventions with the aim of decreasing symptoms of compa ssion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress or vicarious traumatization; however, the ch aracteristics of the samples and the interventions varied considerably. In a ddition, although the grand mean effect size for 108 each of the three outcomes (compassion fati gue, burnout and compassion satisfaction) were large, but not significant, there were only two studies in the meta-analysis and significant variance between stud ies was found; therefore the gr and mean effect size must be interpreted with much caution. As in all research, the research questi ons asked and the way in which the problem under study is defined limits the study to the bounds determined by the question and problem definition. In research synthesis and meta-analysis, the study is both limited by the questions, problem definition and inclus ion/exclusion criteria determined by the meta-analyst as well as the questions, problem definition and inclusion/exclusion criteria determined by the researchers of the included studies. This meta-analysis was limited to indicated interventions; only interventions with a stated goal of decreasing symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and/or vicarious trau matization in mental health workers who had identified symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and/or vicarious traumatization was in cluded. This allowed the study to focus on a particular population of helpers, but it also limited the study. Including all intervention effects studies that assess CF, STS and VT on all occupations woul d give a clearer and richer view of what studies are out there and which interven tions seem to be working. The methodological shortcomings of the studies pose another limitation. The included studies had methodological deficiencies, including inadequate reporting of sample characteristics and lack of rigorous rese arch designs. Both studies were single- group pre and post-test designs which are vulnera ble to threats of internal validity such as: statistical regression, maturation, selection bias a nd testing effects (Littell et al., 109 2008). Single-group pre and post-test (SGPP) design studies are ty pically excluded from systematic reviews and meta-analyses due to th ese threats. Since this systematic review and meta-analysis only found two eligible st udies that happen to be SGPP studies, a decision was made to include these studies in order to provide a baseline for future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Conclusions As an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) th erapist, all walks of life were either required by their employer to discuss adverse events that occurred on the job or came in voluntarily to discuss certain tr aumas that they have experienced either recently or in their past to this researcher. It was here wh ere I realized that I ha d to take this trauma with me as I walked to the train, as I ate my dinner, as I took care of my children, and as I went on with my own life as I knew it. Bu t who was going to help me deal with my secondary trauma? How do I cope with these visions and thoughts that now permeate my daily life? Yes, I could go seek my own ther apy, but true to form of a self-proclaimed compassionate therapist, I was concerned about contaminating the other therapist. In my mind, it seemed to be a vicious cycle. Determining \"what works\" became a mission in my research. Finding what interventions are effective in decreasing co mpassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization could benefit so many helpers. Is compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vi carious traumatization the silent killer of mental health professionals' occupational future ? I have been told this by a helper in the field, but refused see the finality of it all. If ment al health workers do not get help for their 110 symptoms of CF, STS or VT, do they lose their ability to hear the cries of their clients? Yes. This phenomenon is called the Silencing Response (SR). It is defined as \"a reaction which guide(s) the caregiver to redirect, shut down, minimize or neglect the disturbing information brought by the individual to the caregiver\" (Bar anowsky, 2002, p. 155). Would they lose their ability for assisting with problem solving with their clients? Would mental health workers be unable to think pos itively and motivate their clients in making positive changes if they did not have an intervention to decrease or prevent their future symptoms of CF, STS and/or VT? Yes. Empi rical research has established that helpers do suffer deleterious effects of CF, STS and VT when working with traumatized clients. What is more disturbing is why are \"we\" as mental health workers not more concerned about our own and our colleagues' futures in th is profession? If we suffer from CF, STS and VT, will our clients suffer as well? Yes. This defeats our w hole purpose as helpers in this field. Are mental health workers feeding into the stigma about getting mental health help by not helping themselves? Are we being good role models for our clients? While the constructs of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicarious traumatization are heavily researched as far as their definitions and causes and correlates, empirical studies are significantly lacking in the area of intervention effects on mental health workers. Are studies so overly focused on the clie nt that we ne glect to help the helpers? Does it take a significant amount of time for sy mptoms to surface, where in the past interventions were not necessary, but they are needed now? Or were the symptoms in mental health workers just ignor ed in the past? What has happened over the past twenty years that has cau sed mental health workers to feel more symptoms of CF, 111 STS or VT? Or are we just finally acknow ledging that something must be done about ameliorating these symptoms? Is inte rvention and prevention an individual responsibility? Do we want to know how mu ch or how little mental health workers may be suffering and how to mitigate the symptoms? Do mental health workers choose not to participate in studies because they do not want to face their own issues? There should be a push for intervention and prevention on an organizational level. If mental health workers are expected to he lp others, then it should be expected that organizations help their employees and a ssist with ensuring longevity and good, solid mental health in their careers. Adhering to the coping skills and self-care techniques highlighted in Chapter Two of this study are important, but as many authors have pointed out, CF, STS, and VT should not be an indivi dual's problem to solve. This would be blaming the victim and mental health worker s need to be provided the opportunity for intervention and the support necessary to feel mentally stable in a sometimes unpredictable world of the client's traumatic stories. The many discrepancies in the literature regarding definitional issues of these constructs, CF, STS and VT, continues to make this area of research confusing and what Stamm (2010) brillian tly labeled a \"taxonomical conundr um\". Many researchers have attempted to delineate these terms, but overall have been unsuccessful. Showing support for mental health workers by providing interventions to re duce symptoms of compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicar ious traumatization normalizes this very serious problem and helps in reducing the st igma of having to seek treatment. How do we expect to continue our work with client s if we are affected by what we hear and 112 experience through our clients? We, as mental health workers, need to practice what we preach and not continue to sweep our need s under the rug. We need to voice our concerns about the lack of research be ing done on intervention effects on compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress and vicar ious traumatization and mental health workers and get this research moving in a positive direction. Additional and more rigor ous research is desperately needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions that decrease symptoms of CF, STS and VT in order for mental health workers and their employers to have the ability to choose a good fit, evidence based program for their agency to im plement. Mental health workers who often put their own needs aside in order to help ot hers should no longer have to sacrifice their own mental health in order to treat their c lients. There is much to gain from further research in this field for mental health workers, organiza tions as a whole, and their clients.

Check-In 3. Create the agenda together 4. Divide up the time for each agenda item 5. Choose a time-keeper 6. First person presents her question 7. The time she uses leaves the amount of time remaining for others' input. For example, if the presenter has 15 minute s and introduces her question/situation in 3 minutes, the group has 11 minutes to divide equally between them. The presenter always gets a minute or 2 of that time to make a final statement. 8. If there is time left over, divide up the time for a second go-round about the same question. 9. Next person with an agenda item presents her question, gets reflections (same as above) until all agenda topics have been presented and everyone in the meeting has shared their ideas, reflections , feelings about each topic, given the agreed upon amount of time. Guidelines Be consistent about the time (time-k eeper gives a warning, sharing time equally allows everyone a chance to be heard). Talk about yourself, tell a story or describe your own experiences or thoughts. Give examples of what you have trie d and found rather than give advice. Give each person her full time, rather than engage in back and forth talk. Focus on listening not rehearsing what you are going to say ahead of time. Focus on understanding what others are saying while listening. Be brief, concise with what you have to say, practice saying things simply. The person who puts the topic on the agenda and/or presents the question is in charge of her section of the meeting and the process. Variations When there is time left over, feel free to suggest a dialogue (if it is your time). If someone else's question is similar to yours, feel free to suggest that you combine the time and have longer go -rounds (be sure both people have a chance to have a final word after th e group has each shared their thoughts).

PART II: History of traumatic experiences PART III: Relative recovery and stabiliz ation from traumatic experiences. Scoring PARTS I & II do not require scoring. PART III: Take the mean of the two answe rs for item #5 and add to the scores on all other items. Divide by ten and you will arrive at a mean score. If score is < 50 then significant traumatic stre ss; If score is > 75 then significant recovery (or minimal traumatic stress).
