Beretania Street, Suite 200, Honolulu, Hawaii 96814 Phone (808) 9:20 a.m. Conference Room 211 To: COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS Senator David Y. Ige, Chair Senator Michelle Kidani, Vice Chair From: Hawaii Medical Association Dr. Morris Mitsunaga, MD, President Linda Rasmussen, MD, Legislative Co-Chair Dr. Joseph Zobian, MD, Legislative Co-Chair Dr. Christopher Flanders, DO, Executive Director Lauren Zirbel, Community and Government Relations Re: SB 122 RELATING TO NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS In Opposition. Chairs & Committee Members: A Primary Care Provider is tasked with the very important duty of being a patient's medical home. A Primary Care Provider must coordinate care between specialists. If the Primary Care Provider and the Specialists that the patient is receive care from have not been trained in the same line of medicine, this can become very problematic and dangerous. To quote an article written by a Naturopath, \"A good portion of my practice involves taking patients OFF of statins (Lipitor), anti-inflammatories (Celebrex) and antidepressants (Prozac, Cymbalta and Zoloft) in order to promote true health and vitality. In Naturopathic Medicine we call this \"removing a barrier to cure.\" In most cases, prescription medications become the barrier to cure.;' I hope the committee can realize that this can have potentially deadly consequences and that Physician Specialists spend 4-8 years of extra training in residency to be able to appropriately care for patients with life threatening conditions. Now that it is legal for Naturopaths to call themselves Physicians in Hawaii, and to prescribe almost a\" drugs in Hawaii, it will be very confusing for patients to differentiate who to listen to about which drugs and treatments they need. This legislation puts inadequately trained individuals in charge of important preventative health monitoring, such as mamograms. . NOs are only required to take 7 credits of 'pharmacology' for graduation. Why should insurance companies be forced to pay for prescriptive consultation from individuals who are not trained in this field? Most states refuse to even license Naturopaths as medical providers (only 15 States/Territories do) and Hawaii has already given them unrestrained OFFICERS PRESIDENT -MORRIS MITSUNAGA, MD PRESIDENT-ELECT -ROGER KIMURA, MD SECRETARY -DR. ROBERT C. MARVIT, MD TREASURER -STEPHEN KEMBLE, MD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -CHRISTOPHER FLANDERS, DO prescriptive authority for all non-controlled substances with no requirement for continuing medical education. This is very dangerous and should be redressed. Multiple state legislative reports have unearthed specific shortcomings in the education, training and competency testing of naturopaths: 1. The Colorado Office of Examination Services found in 2005 that \"[T]here is little generalizable evidence that NPLEX2 Part II clinical licensing examinations actually measure clinical competence.\" In comparison: the U.S. MedicalLicensing Examination and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination each specifically assess whether the examinee can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine. 2. A 2004 sunrise report from the State of Florida concluded that there is \"potential risk from licensing naturopathic physicians to allow them to provide a broad range of primary care services.\" In 2006, a Missouri Senate committee report questioned the education and standardized testing of naturopaths, noting that the main naturopathic accrediting body has fallen \"in and out of favor with the U.S. Department of Education.\" There is no consistent application of evidenced-based principles and scientific study for naturopathic treatments: 1. Some naturopathic-recommended treatments, such as using St. John's wort for HIV\u00ad positive individuals, has been found by the National Institutes of Health to interact with protease inhibitors and significantly decrease their concentration in the blood. 2. The claim that a treatment has been used \"for hundreds of years,\" is not a substitute for randomized clinical trials and other rigorous scientific inquiry. 3. In several studies funded by the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, the efficacy of naturopathic treatments is not supported by clinical evidence. (For example: Ginkgo extract was found to produce no reduction in progression to dementia compared to a placebo; and shark cartilage supplement does not extend lives of lung cancer patients.) Naturopathy may have been in existence for more than 100 years, but modern accreditation standards as well as education and training standards show several shortcomings: 1. No entrance exam, such as the Medical College Admissions Test is required of applicants to schools of naturopathy. Compared to medical school and residency training, naturopathy has relatively few contact hours of study on pharmacological treatment of disease and little clinical reinforcement of pharmaceutical intervention on patients during clinical rotations or optional post-graduate training. 2. Graduates of four-year naturopathic programs take a standard examination that only measures their competency compared to other naturopathic practitioners -without regard to any equivalency with medical board licensing. 3. Clinical education for naturopaths typically begins in the third year of study, and graduates only are required to complete 720 hours of direct patient care over two years. In comparison, that is roughly two months of study of a first-year resident for a graduate of an accredited U.S. medical or osteopathic school of medicine. People in Hawaii deserve better protection than this. This bill has major public health and safety implications. Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony.

Dear Chairperson Ige, Vice-Chair Kidani, and members of the committee: My name is Cynthia Yamaguchi and I live in Hilo. Even though my healthcare insurance does not cover naturopathic physicians, and it's difficult to afford their care, I have chosen to use a naturopathic physician. This decision has turned out to be a good one, both financially and, most importantly, for my quality of life. As a migraine sufferer for over 30 years that typically involved anywhere from nine to fifteen headaches per month (ranging from two to five per week), I have seen numerous primary care physicians, neurologists, and even a pain management physician to try to get relief. I have also had to go to the emergency room a number of times when a migraine became too severe. Throughout the years I have had multiple blood and allergy tests and CT scans to try to diagnose the cause. Without any definitive results the doctors progressed through the standard treatment protocols of simple and combined analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-migraines, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and anticonvulsants. However, none of the medications worked, plus they usually had unpleasant side-effects. Eventually, I was placed on Imitrex 100 mg. to help stop the pain at the onset of a migraine but this was not a preventative and I continued to have migraines on a regular basis. In February 2010 I began going to a naturopathic physician who prescribed a strict vegan diet and a number of home treatments, including herbal preparations and therapeutic activities. Within eight months the migraines have significantly decreased and I continue to see marked improvement, to the point where I haven't had a migraine in one month! Because of the decreased number of migraines I no longer have to take Imitrex on a weekly basis, sometimes in multiple doses which is not good for my health. This means that I don't have to refill my prescription as often (or maybe no longer!), which means not only a savings for me on co-pays but the large amount (approx. $250.00) that the insurance company has to pay per month for my prescription. Plus, I no longer have to see the doctor as much to receive treatment or to renew my prescription. So, going to see a naturopath has turned out to be a savings. The services provided by naturopathic physicians are an important component of comprehensive health care. Plus, in the context of Hawaii's chronic shortage of qualified health care providers, naturopathic physicians can playa role in expanding access to primary health care within the State.

I have been practicing in Hilo, HI for the past 8 years. Hilo has a critical shortage of primary care providers. Each week a receive calls from desperate people who are unable to find a primary care doctor. The local community health clinics, Bay Clinics, have a 1-2 month waiting period for new patients and even these visits may not be available. People resort to using urgent care and emergency department visits for conditions that could easily be addressed with a standard office visit. Hawaii needs to utilize all of its primary care physicians. Naturopathic medicine is safe and cost effective. Naturopathic physicians emphasize lifestyle changes over pharmaceutical interventions leading to lower costs and less risk of side effects. With increasing levels of obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, naturopathic services are not a luxury for Hawaii's population; they are a necessity. Many people are unable to afford healthcare without insurance coverage. These people deserve the choice to use Naturopathic services.

This would presumably mean greater access for you. The bill passed its first hearing and is on to the second this Tuesday, March 1st. For those of you who heard that it would be pushed offuntil next year, well, not anymore! Written testimony can do a lot for passage of bills and I'm asking for your support. Please insert your name and city into the blank spaces of the paragraph below, cut and paste into an email, and send to the listed email address with the listed subject heading. These are due tomorrow, Monday, February 28th at 4pm. It will take 30 seconds to do it now and I would not ask if it was not incredibly important for affordable access to naturopathic care. Hopefully this will make it easier for you and your family. Please forward this to anyone who may want to help. Mahalo!

I feel like Hawaii should be leading the pack. We are a culturally diverse, and progressive society, and we need to stop falling so far behind when it comes to our doctors. We are struggling to meet the medical needs of Hawaii's people. Currently on the Big Island MD's can only treat 2/3rd,s of our residents. Our Emergency rooms are over run with patients. Our doctors are not taking new patients. And people are flying to Oahu to see a doctor that is covered by their insurance. Meanwhile we have Naturopathic physicians here with room to see patients. The state has recognized them as licensed primary care physicians, but insurance companies are not compensating them for patient visits. If accepted by insurance companies, people could be seeing a Naturopath for many ailments and preventative therapies that would open up the schedules of MD's to do what they do best. This is cooperative care, and it is where we need to be as a State. Please move this bill forward as quick as possible. This will be a much larger problem if we wait for the next legislative session.

Sincerely, Darlene Ashley Fagan, Ph.D. Licensed Psychologist 1 February 27,2011 To: Senator Ige, Chair Senator Kidani, Vice-Chair Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection RE: Testimony Supporting State Senate Bill 122 Relating to Naturopathic Physicians Dear Chairperson Ige, Vice-Chair Kidani, and members of the committee: I write in strong support of SB 122 as it will provide much more comprehensive access to healthcare for the citizens of this state. In the past four years I have had three different primary care providers, none of which share the same holistic or natural healthcare model which I choose to maintain my health. Why so many? The first two, like so many other physicians, left the state. I now find myself paying $700 per month (30% increase over last year) for bare bones HMO coverage (no dental, vision or drug) for my husband and myself, and still yet have to payout of pocket for medical care because I choose naturopathic care. I have seen greater improvement in my health status since seeking the care of naturopaths. They regard my health in its entirety, paying particular attention to how all my systems are actually functioning, and do not disregard any aspect of my health which I report. I have sought and actually received care for issues I had been reporting to my allopathic doctors for years, but had either not received any response, or a pharmaceutical prescription which I explained I did not wish to take. Naturopaths prescribe simple and inexpensive changes or additions to help correct whatever imbalance I experience to not only improve my overall health, but keep my systems on track as I age. Individuals like me, who are conscientious about their health, generally gravitate toward more natural methods of healthcare, choosing dietary and herbal therapy as well as changes in physical activity over pharmaceuticals and surgery. We should be allowed to care for our bodies in the manner we see best fits us, and not be penalized financially by our health insurance providers for doing so.

I am also Clinical Dean at the Traditional Chinese Medical College of Hawaii, as well as a practicing acupuncturist. As a licensed healthcare provider and administrator in this state, I frequently consult with and refer patients to Naturopathic physicians. It is an economic hardship for many of our patients that their insurance does not cover naturopathic care. It is a hardship for our patients if the only available physician is a naturopath and their healthcare insurance will only cover an M.D. Passage of this bill will do much to make quality healthcare truly available to our insured citizens.

Dear Chairperson Ige, Vice Chair Kidani, and Members of the Committee: Please support the passage of SB122_S01. I practice part time on the Big Island as a naturopathic physician. Often the treatment I am able to provide will either prevent major health problems in the future or get to the root causes of health problems and correct them less expensively and more effectively than conventional treatment. Unfortunately, when patients do not have insurance coverage for naturopathic medical care, sometimes the only option they can afford is to avoid seeing a physician at all until their medical condition is serious, and then to accept the treatment which their insurance covers, which may be more expensive and less effective in the long run. Equal insurance coverage is fair, patients want it, and it and makes good financial sense. Thank you so much for your work on this issue and for considering my thoughts.

I see the impact of not having insurance companies recognize our dedicated natural physicians on both a personal and a professional level every day. My husband works off island to provide for his family. We pay dearly for insurance coverage that does not recognize naturopathic care. Therefore, we have one more burden placed on our lives -that of paying for healthcare out of our pocket. We turn potential patients away everyday that seek the care of our Naturopathic Physician here at our office, because she is not allowed to accept the major carriers.

Dear Chairperson Ige, Vice-Chair Kidani, and members of the committee: I am Michael Traub, ND. As Chair of the Legislative Committee, I am representing the Hawaii Society of Naturopathic Physicians and we are seeking your support of SB 122_SD 1 The purposes of this legislation are to: End many years of discrimination on the part of insurance plans that have not included benefits for naturopathic medicine; 2. Help solve the critical shortage of primary care providers by providing insurance coverage for patients to see naturopathic physicians. Background: Although considered primary care physicians, naturopathic medicine has been excluded for many years in the health care insurance plans in Hawaii. Currently, only HMAA offers such a benefit, and it is limited to $500 of services annually with that benefit shared with chiropractic and acupuncture. Workers compensation and motor vehicle personal injury cases allow for naturopathic care. However, despite many years of repeated efforts to interest the other insurers in Hawaii, namely HMSA, Kaiser, and UHA, to provide coverage for naturopathic medicine, they have failed to do so. This is unfair to the members of these health plans, and does not make sense. The time has come to rectify this inequity through legislation. Facts: In the past forty years, the stature of naturopathic medical education has evolved to be comparable in breadth and scope of medical doctors and osteopaths, and exceeds that of nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, chiropractic, acupuncturists and massage therapists. Naturopathic medicine is not an add-on service to insurance plans. It is a cost-effective type of health care that can replace more expensive care and provide for cost savings in both the short term and long term through its focus on well ness, prevention, and the limited use of expensive medications and procedures. Access to primary care providers is critically limited in Hawaii, particularly on the neighbor islands. We believe that a Legislative Auditor's Report is not necessary for this bill, since naturopathic physicians are already licensed, since this would have a minimal cost impact, since more and more peop Ie are asking for NO services, and since a rider is not a mandate. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into federal law. It contains a provision to prohibit non-discrimination in health care insurance that becomes effective in 2014 (Section 2706): (a) Providers- A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall not discriminate with respect to partiCipation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider's license or certification under applicable State law. This section shall not require that a group health plan or health insurance issuer contract with any health care provider willing to abide by the terms and conditions for participation established by the plan or issuer. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan, a health insurance issuer, or the Secretary from establishing varying reimbursement rates based on 1 quality or performance measures. (b) Individuals- The provisions of section 1558 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (relating to non\u00ad discrimination) shall apply with respect to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage. In 2007, the state of Vermont enacted a law that mandated coverage for naturopathic physicians. (Title 8, Banking and Insurance, Chapter 1 07: HEALTH INSURANCE \u00a7 4088d. Coverage for covered seNices provided by naturopathic physicians). As a result of this law, all insurance companies that are regulated by the state of Vermont are required to reimburse for the seNices of a naturopathic physician in the same way and to the same extent that they reimburse for the seNices of any physician. This includes Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Vermont, CIGNA, Medicaid, and others. This law does not apply to Medicare, out-of-state plans, and certain self-insured employers. The Vermont law does not add any seNices, expand the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians, nor mandate the coverage of non-prescription natural medicines such as herbal or nutritional supplements. Similar laws prohibiting discrimination against naturopathic medicine exist in Alaska (Statute 21.26.090 Item D), Connecticut (Statute 38A 551G, 38A 816, item 10), Montana (MAC 33-22-111) and Washington (RCW 48.43.045). These laws have not increased the cost of health care nor led to insurance rate hikes in any of these states. Washington State's Commissioner of Health testified on this issue, where there are over 1000 practicing naturopathic physicians (Hawaii has less than 100). Studies done in Washington State 1 n 1995, the state of Washington passed a law which requires insurance reimbursement for naturopathic seNices. The actual claims data is now available. A group at the University of Washington has analyzed the claims data from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of WA, the state's two largest insurers. They have published two studies assessing the cost impact. Study #1: Financial impact of the law on cost of pediatric care. 1 % of the pediatric population saw an N.D. Of the $185,368,687 spent on pediatric health care, only $394,059 -or 2.1 tenths of one percent (0.21 %) were spent on naturopathic seNices. Average # of visits for the year to different professionals among users: o Conventional provider: 3 o Naturopathic physician 2 Reasons for seeing an N.D.-same spectrum of diagnoses as conventional providers (ie. respiratory infections, allergies). Because of this pattern, visits to N.D. likely replaced that of a visit to a conventional provider. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that there was an overall increase in cost, even by the 0.2%, but more likely, close to a net zero effect (Bellas A, Lafferty WE, Lind B, Tyree PT. Frequency, predictors, and expenditures for pediatric insurance claims for complementary and alternative medical professionals in Washington State. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2005 Apr; 159(4):367-72) Study #2: Study of Insured Patients with Cancer in Washington State General Statistics -441,841 all insured (not just cancer) ages 18-64 2 -of the 346,428 that had health claims, 2.1 % of the general population with health claims sought care from an N.D. Patients with Cancer (this study represents the extreme of patients who use both conventional and naturopathic care for the same condition) -7915 patients with cancer had claims -4% of patients with cancer saw an N.D. (total of 318 cancer patients) -average billed amount per year per patient for naturopathic care: $413, representing 1.0% of those patient's mean total billed amount for health care year 2000. Discussion: In these two studies, we are presented with a lot of information about the usage and costs of naturopathic medicine. 1% of children use it, accounting for 0% (0.213% to be exact) of their health costs. 2% of adults in general use it. Of adults with a cancer diagnosis, 4% use naturopathic medicine, resulting in 1 % of the health care costs of that population. These populations represent perhaps the two extremes of use pattern: children requiring the least amount, and cancer patients the most. It is reasonable to assume that the non-cancer adult claims fall between these two groups: or somewhere between 0.2% and 1 % of total health costs. Neither of these studies looked at the costs offset by the use of naturopathic physicians. If they had, we might very well be looking at a net zero effect, or even an immediate cost savings. In the instance of the pediatric patients, the documented use patterns suggest that the parents took their child to the ND instead of the MD for their sore throats, allergies etc. In the instance of the patients with cancer, patients almost certainly used both: they saw their oncologist, and an N.D. too. Patients of naturopathic phYSicians routinely report a decreased need for prescription drugs to counteract side effects of conventional treatments. One example of cost savings is the ability of cancer patients to complete chemotherapy with fewer or no injections to boost white blood cell counts when they are receiving naturopathic adjunctive treatment. Each pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) shot costs $3,200. That represents a savings of $12,800 for four shots, which are commonly required for patients to complete a chemotherapy regimen. The lead researcher in both of these studies is William Lafferty, M.D. of the University of Washington. Dr. Lafferty is probably the current world's top expert in the cost impact of insuring naturopathic physicians. In his words, costs associated with coverage of naturopathic physicians by the top two insurance carriers in Washington State were \"miniscule\", lithe proverbial drop in the bucket\" and \"not a threat to insurers.\" Devlin SM, Andersen MR, Diehr PK. Complementary and alternative medicine provider use and expenditures by cancer treatment phase. Am J Manag Care. 2008 May; 14(5):326-34) Study #3: Lafferty and his group evaluated how insured people used Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) providers and what role this played in healthcare utilization and expenditures in Western Washington in 2002. They analyzed insurance demographic data, claims files, benefit information, diagnoses, CAM and conventional provider utilization, and healthcare expenditures for 3 large health insurance companies. The results were as follows: Among more than 600,000 enrollees, 13.7% made CAM claims. This included 1.3% of enrollees with claims for acupuncture, 1.6% for naturopathic medicine, 2.4% for massage, and 10.9% for chiropractic. Patients enrolled in preferred provider organizations and point-of-service products were notably more likely to use CAM than those with health maintenance organization coverage. The CAM provider visits usually focused on musculoskeletal complaints except for naturopathic physicians, who treated a broader array of problems. The median per-visit expenditures were 39.00 dollars for CAM care and 74.40 dollars for conventional outpatient care. The total expenditures per enrollee were 2589 dollars, of which 75 dollars (2.9%) was spent on CAM. The authors concluded: liThe number of people using 3 CAM insurance benefits was substantial; the effect on insurance expenditures was modest.\" (Lafferty WE, Tyree PT, Sellas AS, Watts CA, Lind SK, Sherman KJ, Cherkin DC, Grembowski DE. Insurance coverage and subsequent utilization of complementary and alternative medicine providers. Am J Manag Care. 2006 Jul;12(7):397-404). Study #4: Internal report, produced by Blue Shield of WA in response to the law passed in 1995. (\"King County Medical Blue Shield Phase I Final Report, Alternative Healthcare Project Steering Committee\") The company wanted to know how best to implement the legislation: how to credential NOs, and how to best use them in order to have the best effects on costs. Blue Shield voluntarily chose to credential NOs as primary care providers in their HMO product. Blue Shield of Washington knew that using NOs as PCPs would save money, and were implementing these findings at the same time that the company tried to overturn the law, claiming it would increase costs. This document was subpoenaed from the company during their appeals, which failed in the U.S. Supreme 10th Circuit Court, and this document was part of the reason. It showed that what the insurance industry said about cost increases, it didn't even believe itself. Finally, testimony on the Vermont legislation was received from Dr. Laura Patton, Director of Alternative Services at Group Health, the third largest insurance carrier in Washington State, in which she reported the results of a survey to their customers who specifically use naturopathic physicians: \"59% of them reported decreased visits to (conventional) primary care physicians, and about 48% reported decreased visits to specialists. And then another major driver of health care costs, over 50% reported decreased use of prescription medications.\" These figures support the cost savings that Blue Shield projected in its 1995 internal report, which stated \"An effective NO PCP centered managed care program could cut the costs of chronic and stress related illness by up to 40% and lower the costs of specialist utilization by 30%.\" You may receive testimony in opposition to this bill from parties claiming that naturopathic physicians are not sufficiently trained as primary care providers, do not collaborate with conventional medical professionals, and a lack of evidence for naturopathic treatments. I suggest that you carefully consider the accuracy of these allegations. You will find that they do not stand up to close inspection. In conclusion, the facts speak for themselves: Insurance plans should not discriminate against naturopathic physicians. Including benefits for naturopathic care will help to solve the critical shortage of primary care providers, at a miniscule cost to insurers, and could actually cut the costs of healthcare significantly.

Please support the passage of S8122 S01. 1 Dear Chairperson Ige, Vice-Chair Kidani, and members of the committee, Please support SB122!!! My name is Dr Sarah Strong and I am a naturopathic physician in Hilo. Over the recent years the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians in Hawaii has been updated to allow them to practice as trained. However, while licensed and practicing as primary care physicians, there is still very limited insurance coverage. This means that access to these physicians is greatly limited, which is especially critical on the outer islands where primary care physicians are in great shortage. The insurance companies that do cover naturopathic visits (such as HMAA) only offer $500 a year for visits, which must be shared between naturopathic care, acupuncture, and chiropractic. Insurance companies, such as HMSA, Kaiser, and UHA have failed to offer coverage for naturopathic primary care physicians. This is at a point where legislative action needs to be taken. As a naturopathic physician practicing in the Big Island, it is with great frustration that my office has to turn away clients on a daily basis that have insurance but cannot afford to pay out-of-pocket for their primary care needs. Often they are not able to even find a physician in the area that is taking new patients. On Hawaii Public Radio just this morning they stated that there are only enough primary care physicians on the Big Island to cover 2/3 of the population. Coverage of NDs would certainly help fill this need. Naturopathic training has evolved over the years to be comparable to other primary care physicians, such as MDs and DOs, greatly exceeding that of other practitioners (such as NPs) that are covered by insurance plans. While our opposition may testify to our lack of training, I urge you to please look into the details of this and to not take their figures at face value. I would be happy to provide you with extensive cited literature attesting to our training, even comparing it to MDs and DOs. However, as this is not the nature of this bill I am omitting it from testimony at this time. This bill is about naturopathic care being reimbursed at a reasonable rate that would allow us to continue serving the community of Hawaii. Recent studies done in Washington state show that coverage of NDs does not have any negative impact on health insurance rates. Please help the residents of Hawaii gain access to better primary care and naturopathic options and pass SB122! J ----_ r Testimony S8122_SD1, March 1,2011,9:20 a.m. IN SUPPORT.

SB 122 SD1 -Strong Support Aloha Chair Senator Ige, Vice Chair Senator Kidani and other Committee Members: I am Dr. Darrow Hand, a licensed naturopathic physician, practicing in the State of Hawai'i. I am writing to strongly urge your support of SB 122 SD1 relating to insurance. I have had the privilege to help patients recover from injuries suffered in car accidents in which their insurance reimbursed for my services. My patients were glad to have the choice to see me, knowing that naturopathic treatment is covered by Hawai'i auto policies. Some patients may want to choose a naturopathic physician as their primary care physician, but cannot because their insurance carrier doesn't cover our services in Hawai'i. HMSA, Kaiser and UHA do not reimburse for naturopathic care. HMAA does reimburse, but limits the type of services and coverage amounts. For example their maximum reimbursement is less than the auto polices would reimburse a naturopath for even a short \"typical 10 minute\" visit (CPT Code 99212 -$50.31), and they do not cover for manual therapy (CPT Code 97140) which the auto policies do. When patients need lab tests, I will often recommend they see their medical doctors if they have one so that the tests will be covered by insurance. This seems like an unnece~sary delay for patients in getting quality care. Washington State mandates coverage for all licensed health care providers. A study published in the journal Cancer (2004) found out of 7,915 Washington claimants diagnosed with cancer, 318 (4%) made a claim for naturopathic treatment. The study concluded that the cost was modest compared to conventional care charges. In 2007, Vermont enacted a law to mandate coverage for naturopathic physicians. Similar laws prohibiting discrimination exist in Alaska and Connecticut. These laws have not increased the cost of health care nor led to insurance hikes in any of these states. If naturopathic care is covered by insurance carriers, then it likely will not significantly effect premium costs in Hawai'i, and may decrease billed amounts. In 1989, the Legislative Auditor of the State of Hawai'i contracted the Wyatt Company for actuarial services, which surveyed 24 underwriters of indemnity medical plans. Wyatt found that eight carriers added no premium costs to individual or group plans, two carriers added $0.01 for individuals, $0.03 for families and added nothing for group coverage. Wyatt reported: \"some carriers feel plans that include naturopathic services will save money.\" (Report #89-25, Dec.'89.) These findings are consistent with more recent studies done in Washington and Vermont. Thank you for the opportunity to testify Sincerely, Darrow M.

I have been greatly helped by the advice,care and wisdom of these practitioners. I have gone through stage 1 melanoma and a lumpechtomy for breast cancer. Integrative medicine has been fantastic for me. I take supplements under the care of my naturopath and use acupuncture,massage,chiropractic and Chinese medicine. I am a very healthy active,soon to be 7e year old in incredible health for my age and having gone through the two challenges mentioned successfully. My oncologist is awesome and works alongside of a excellent naturopath. I feel totally confident in their care together. Frustratingly,I have had to pay for all of my non alopathic care out of pocket and that has been very difficult for me. We will have a healthier,wiser population if we have access to the best of all medical care. Please pass this bill so I can stay healthy and have peace of mind. I wish all patients could have access to such care and knowledge of all the excellent healing arts, in conjunction with alopathic medicine. There is an incredible amount of living proof! My life is a testimony. I am also learning to deal with stress thanks to my Christian Faith and ancient Chinese Qi Gong practices. There must be a balance we can achieve in our choices of medical treatment by qualified professionals. We need our insurance which we have paid for all of our lives to help pay for this. I ask for this for the future of our children. I am mother of 9(six adopted) so I am experienced at care giving and have paid lots of medical bills!
