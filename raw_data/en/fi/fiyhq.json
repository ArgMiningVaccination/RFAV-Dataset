(Shaw) on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the Colonie FUSRAP Site (Site) located at 1130 Central Avenue in the Town of Colonie, Albany County, New York (Figure 1- 1). Shaw has completed the so il removal action at the Site. The Record of Decision (ROD) fo r groundwater was issued on Apri l 9, 2010. As detailed in the ROD, Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) with land use controls and groundwater sampling to assess the progress of MNA was identified as th e remedial approach that would be suitable for remediation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the groundwater at the Site. Shaw is completing the groundwater sampling program sp ecified in this ROD under Delivery Order Number 0031 for Contract Number W912DR-05- D-0026 in accordance with the Modification 001 to the Scope of Work (SOW) for Groundwater Sampling for Natural Attenuation issued by the USACE on January 14, 2008. The sampling e ffort falls under the USACE's Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUS RAP), which was established to identify, investigate, and clean up or control sites pr eviously used by the At omic Energy Commission (AEC) and its predecessor, the Ma nhattan Engineeri ng District. Shaw submitted a revised estimate and schedul e for completion of the LTM SOW, which was approved by the USACE on April 14, 2008. On June 3, 2010, USACE requested that Shaw extend the groundwater monitoring program to include eight c onsecutive quarterly post-ROD sampling events and modify the sampling program to match the requirements of the ROD. This LTMWP has been prepared in accord ance with the modified LTM SOW. 1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE MNA with land use controls has been selected as the remedial alternative for the remediation of VOCs in the groundwater at the Si te. Because the available groundw ater analytical data set was insufficient to demonstrate that the in situ bi odegradation component of the MNA processes are active, long term monitoring was proposed in the ROD to evaluate the efficacy of MNA. This LTMWP provides detailed directions and gui des the design, performance and evaluation of groundwater sampling for MNA at the Site. The LTMWP incorporates th e MNA data collection techniques and evaluation approaches recommended in the following references: Guidance for Evaluation of Federal Agency Demonstrations t hat Remedial Actions are Operating Properly and Successfully Under C ERCLA Section 120(h)(3) (USEPA 1996a); Technical Protocol for Evaluating Natural Attenuation of Ch lorinated Solvents in Ground Water (Wiedemeier et al. 1998) ; Performance Monitoring of MNA Re medies for VOCs in Groundwater (USEPA, 2004a); Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-2 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final Designing Monitoring Programs to Effectively Evaluate the Perfor mance of Natural Attenuation (AFCEE, 2000); and A Decision Flowchart for the Use of Monitored Natural Attenuation and Enhanced Attenuation at Sites wi th Chlorinated Organic Plumes , (ITRC, 2007). The performance period for LTM is two years as established in the signed ROD. The LTM data collected over this period will supplement th e existing Site data collected through May 2009. The data collection will be performed during the years 2010 through 2012, and will be used to document the progress of natural attenua tion in groundwater at the Site. The LTMWP will be used to accomplish the following: Specify the LTM performance objectives; Identify data needs and collection methods; Identify data analys is techniques; and Establish monitoring endpoints. The LTMWP provides detailed procedures that will be utilized for meeting the overall objectives of natural attenuation monitoring in accordan ce with the requirements of the ROD. 1.2 SITE BACKGROUND Industrial operations began on the Site in approximately 1923 when the Embossing Company purchased a portion of the presen t day Site to construct a fac ility to manufacture wood products and toys. In 1927, Magnus Metal Company, Inc. (MMC) converted the facility to a brass foundry for manufacturing railroa d components. MMC cast the brass components in sand molds and manufactured brass bearing housings with surf aces of babbitt metal (an alloy of lead, copper, and antimony). In 1937, National Lead Industries (NL) purchased the facility and continued the brass foundry operations initiated by MMC. At some point before 1941, NL pur chased an adjacent lot that contained a portion of Patroon La ke and began filling Patroon Lake with used casting sand. After World War II, the operations began casting aluminum parts and frames for aircraft. In 1958, the nuclear division of NL began manufactur ing items from uranium and thorium at the facility under a license issued by the AEC. NL discontinued its brass foundry operation in 1960. From 1958 through 1984 NL carried out a number of manufacturing proce sses using radioactive materials consisting primarily of depleted uranium, but also thorium and enriched uranium. The plant handled enriched uranium from approxi mately 1960 to 1972. From 1966 to 1972, NL held Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-3 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final several contracts to manufacture fuel from enrich ed uranium for experimental nuclear reactors. Operations were conducted at th e plant to reduce depleted uran ium-tetra fluoride to depleted uranium metal, which was then fabricated into shielding components, ballast weights, and projectiles. Other processes conducted at the plant included an electroplating operati on for plating uranium with nickel and cadmium. Chemicals used in th e plating operation incl uded nickel sulfamate, sodium cyanide, phosphate, iridite (chromium nickel metal, boric acid, and tetr achloroethylene (PCE). How or where most of these materials were disposed is unknown; very few disposal r ecords have been located. NL letters indicate that under an AEC license approx imately 42 cubic meters (cm) of graphite, slag, refractory, uranium oxide, insoluble oil, metal sc rap, and combustible tras h were buried in the Patroon Lake area in 1961. Chemi cal wastes and packaged chemi cals used at the Site have included acids, bases, degreas ing agents, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), cyanide, and asbestos. The ch emicals present on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Part A application permit were removed from the Site as part of this facility's closure as a designated \"interim RCRA st orage facility.\" This closure was documented in the 1995 RCRA Closure Report certified by both the Department of Energy (DOE) and an independent New York Stat e Professional Engineer. New York State officials closed NL in 1984, at which time Congress authorized the DOE to remediate the property. In February 1984 the S ecretary of Energy accepted an offer from NL to acquire the land, buildings, and equipment in or der to help expedite the cleanup. The DOE accepted the property on February 29, 1984. In 1985 the DOE acquired a portion of the Niagara Mohawk Electrical Power Station (NiMo) prope rty bordering the Site and subsequently designated it as part of the Site. From 1984 to 1988 remedial efforts were comp leted by the DOE for 53 of the 56 Vicinity Properties. From 1992 to 1996 the remaining NL buildings were demolished by DOE. Various debris, waste materials, and machinery associated with demolition of the main building were left on site at the time the USACE and their contract ors initiated their remedial efforts. USACE completed the removal action at the site in September 2007. 1.3 SITE DESCRIPTION As shown on Figure 1-1 the Site is located at 1130 Central Avenue (New York State Route 5) in the Town of Colonie, Albany County, New Yor k. The Site is an 11.2 acre parcel located immediately north and west of the Albany City line. The CSX Transportation (CSXT) vicinity Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-4 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final property located adjacent to the Site on the southern property line is entirely within the limits of the City of Albany. At the time of the USACE's init ial mobilization in 1998, approximate ly 4 acres of the Site were paved with asphalt in varying physical conditions; approximately 4 acres were vegetated with grasslands and/or tree/brushy areas. The slab of the main building covered the remaining portions of the parcel, approximate ly 3.2 acres in the central/south ern portions of the Site. The Site is bounded by a heavily wooded lot on th e west (7 Railroad Ave), CSXT rail tracks on the southwest and south, active commercial prope rties on the east/northeast, New York State Route 5/Central Avenue on the north, and a NiMo electrical substation on the northwest. The surrounding area consists of mixed resi dential and commercial properties. NiMo owns a revised easement for the high volta ge lines in the western portion of the Site passing over the storm water draina ge channel, located in the west ernmost portion of the Site. The high voltage power lines and poles were installed in the new easement in 2000. 1.3.1 Climate and Precipitation The climate at the Site is ty pical of upstate New York. Th e average annual daily maximum temperature is 57.6 degrees Fahr enheit (\u00baF), and the average da ily minimum is 36.8\u00baF. The highest average monthly temperature is 83.2\u00baF (J uly), and the lowest is 11.9\u00baF (January). Average annual precipitation is 35.7 inches, w ith an average annual snowfall of 65.1 inches. Winds in the area blow predominantly out of the south-southeast to south sector and west to west-northwest sector. The m ean wind speed from these sector s is 10 miles per hour (mph). Light winds (0-3 mph) blowing in no specified direction are al so generally prevalent (Bechtel National, Inc. [BNI], 1992). 1.3.2 Geologic Setting The primary geologic feature in the vicinity of the Site is the Col onie Channel, which is a buried, glacially-scoured valley that occupies the Hu dson-Champlain Lowlands of east-central New York. Like the Hudson River Valley of today, th e Colonie Channel was the main artery of the river system draining the lowlands of eastern New York during pre- glacial times. Most of the unconsolidated sediments above the bedrock present at the Site were deposited in glacial Lake Albany created during continental glacier adva nces and retreats in the Hudson Valley. A brief description of the geol ogical units, from the uppermost unit to the lowermost unit, is provided below. Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-5 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final Artificial Fill and Fl ood Plain Sediments: This unit consists of fill materials placed at the Site, including Patroon Lake, and consists of gravel, sand, brick fragments, metal barrels, glass, foundry tools, foundry slag, and disturbed sedime nt. The Flood Plain Sediments unit represents thin deposits of materials related to sedimentatio n in the former Patroon Lake and from floods of the unnamed tributary of Patroon Creek. Dune Sand: This unit is fine-grained sand that is light yellow-brown and cross-laminated. Regionally, it is the unit that makes up the Pine Bu sh Aquifer. Based on lithologic logs, this unit thins from northwest to southwest across the Site and occurs near the ground surface, predominantly above the water table. Upper Silt: Previously referred to as the Upper Sand. This unit is composed of lake silt and sand. Grain size analyses consistently show signi ficant silt fractions in samples collected from this unit. Upper Clay: This unit is most easily identified in conductivity logs and consists of a varied sequence of clay and silt. Lower Silt: Previously referred to as Lower Sand. Th is unit consists predominantly of silt with some clay and lies above the Lower Clay. Lower Clay: At the Site, the Lower Clay is approximately 100 feet thick. The clay is observed to be olive gray and very homogenous, showing few signs of silt or sand interbeds. Based on geophysical surveys, it was determ ined that no major channel cut features or topographic divides were apparent along the top of the Lower Clay. The apparent absence of these features further supports background geological information and ge otechnical testing that identify the Lower Clay as the basal hydrogeologic boundary. Till: This unit is described as da rk gray and poorly sorted ( 10 percent sand, 40 percent gravel, and 50 percent clay). One Site bo rehole penetrated the till at a depth of 160 feet below grade. Bedrock underlies this till. The Upper Silt forms the shallow sa turated zone at the Site (hereafter referred to as the upper groundwater zone). The base of the upper gr oundwater zone ranges from elevations of approximately 202 to 205 feet mean sea level (m sl) in the western por tion of the Site. Water levels indicate a saturated thickness of over 20 feet in the north to less than 15 feet in the south near the property line. The thickness of the Uppe r Clay in the western portion of the Site ranges from approximately 12 to 15 feet. The top surface of the Lower Silt (hereafter referred to as the Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-6 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final lower groundwater zone) is typi cally encountered at approximate ly 190 feet msl and ranges from 10 feet to approximately 15 feet thick. Permeabilities obtained from field tests conducted in 1984 and 1988 ranged from 0.04 to 109 feet/day in the upper gr oundwater zone (mean and medi an of 1.5 and 1.3 feet/day, respectively), and 0.29 to 31 feet/day in the lo wer groundwater zone (mean and median of 6.4 and 0.68 feet/day, respectively). 1.3.3 Groundwater Hydrology Groundwater levels at the Site have been rout inely measured since 1988. Generally, shallow groundwater in the upper groundwater zone at the Site is encountered less than 10 feet below grade. Water level measurements recorded at th e Site indicate that groundwater flow across the Site is to the southeast. Generally, there is a downward vertical gr adient over the northern portions of the Site, with an upward vertical gradient near the unnamed tributary and toward Patroon Creek. Groundwater level da ta provided in the Remedial I nvestigation indicate that the hydraulic gradient and general direction of groundwater flow in the lower groundwater zone closely resembles that in the upper groundwater z one. The upper groundwater zone likely drains to the unnamed tributary and to Patroon Creek. To support excavation activities on the eastern portion of the S ite, approximately 260 linear feet of sheet pile wall was installed near the CSX railroad tracks in July 2005 to depths varying between 30 and 50 feet below groun d surface. The location of the sheet pile wall is shown on Figure 1-2. Along with providing structural stabili ty, the sheet pile wall impedes groundwater to the southeast, creating a zone of stagnation directly behind the wall as groundwater levels equilibrate with up-gradient points. Groundwater flow direct ions may shift over time as migration pathways around the stagnation zone are established. 1.4 EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION A number of studies have been performed at the Site since 1984 to i nvestigate hydrogeologic conditions and evaluate the nature and extent of groundwater impacted by past operations. The upper groundwater zone beneath the Site has been impacted by historical releases of chlorinated Volatile Organic Compounds (cVOCs). Information presented in the Groundwater Remedial Investigation (RI) (Shaw, 2003) indicates that the areas of impact have expanded laterally from the source areas toward the ra ilroad tracks, near by buildings, and the unnamed tributary of Patroon Creek, consistent with th e natural direction of groundwater flow. A decrease in the extent of groundwater contamination at the Site has been observed since 2003, with significantly Section 1.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 1-7 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final lower levels of contaminants generally bein g reported in the areas where excavation and dewatering were performed to address soil s impacted with radioactive debris. The soil removal action is now complete and has resulted in the remova l of more than 135,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the Site (URS, 2008). To facilitate excavation activities, an on-site temporary water treatment system was constructed for the management of groundwater generated from dewatering wells and storm water that accumulated within excavations. A combined volume of approximate ly 31 million gallons of groundwater and storm water were treated in this system and discharged from the Site in accordance with the approved State Pollutant Discharge Elimin ation System Permit. The RI results and groundwater sampling performed through May 2009 indicate that VOCs ha ve not impacted the lower groundwater zone at concentrations greater than the groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations listed in the ROD. Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-1 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 2.0 LONG-TERM MONITORING PLAN 2.1 DATA NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES 2.1.1 Performance Objectives The objectives for groundwat er performance monitori ng at the Site are: Demonstrate that natural attenuation is occurring according to the expectation of providing a reduction in VOC concentrations; Detect changes in environmental conditions (e.g., hydrogeologic, ge ochemical, or other changes) that may reduce the efficacy of any of the natural attenuation processes; Identify any potentially toxic and/ or mobile transformation products; Verify that the plume(s) is not expa nding downgradient or laterally; and Verify attainment of remediation objectives. The Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) for th e groundwater established in the ROD are as follows: Limit exposure of potential future onsite urba n residents to VOC constituents that may migrate into homes via th e vapor intrusion pathway. Reduce the concentrations of VO Cs in onsite groundwater to le vels that are protective of future onsite urban residents who may be exposed to these compounds via the vapor intrusion pathway. The RAOs are based on limiting the excess cancer ri sk due to inhalation of vapors intruding into a hypothetical onsite residence to less than one in one million (1x10-6). This risk reduction will be achieved by reducing the conc entrations of groundwater cont aminants to the following RAO- based target cleanup goal concen trations for the following contam inants of concern (COCs) in the Chloride (VC) - \u00b5g/L Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-2 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final The USACE acknowledges the NYSDEC's opposition to utilizing the target cleanup goal of 1,800 ug/L for cis-1,2-DCE (which is in the signed Record of D ecision), rather than the New York state MCL of 5 ug/L. Therefore we will work the DEC and cis-1,2-DCE will be evaluated against both the target cl eanup goal of 1,800 ug/L and the state MCL of 5 ug/L. Radiological constituents are also elevated in groundwater in one monitoring well bordering the Site, but not pose a potential human health risk primarily because there is no complete pathway for human exposure to these constituents. Radiol ogical constituents, metals (total and dissolved lead), and VOCs [daughter products of COCs: tr ans-1,2-DCE and 1,1-DCE] other than those listed as COCs above will be monitored as cons tituents of interest (COIs) for informational purposes only since the COIs do not have RAO- based target cleanup goal concentrations - associated with them. The COIs will be sc reened against the screening values listed in NYSDEC Part 703: Surface Water and Groundwater Q uality Class GA Standards and Groundwater Effluent Limitations (NYSDEC, 1999) and USEPA Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) (US EPA, 2004 b, c), if the NYSDEC Part 703 screening values are not available. An analyte list along with RAO-based target cl eanup goal concentrations and other applicable screening values are presented in Table 2-1 . The natural attenuation data will be evaluated using the approach presented in Technical Protocol for Evaluating Natural Attenuation of Chlorinated Solvents in Ground Water (Wiedemeier et al., 1998) . Data quality objectives (DQOs) were developed for the data to be collected during the LTM. The data quality objectives proce ss helps define the purpose for which environmental data from the Site will be used, and provide s guidelines for designing a data collection program that will provide data suitable for its intended use while meeting regulatory objectives. The data quality objectives process identifies the end use of the data for which the samples are collected, which is to monitor the performance of na tural attenuation, mainly consisting of intrinsic biodegradation, over an extended period of time, and to conf irm that the soil removal action has reduced concentrations of COCs in groundwater. The pr ocess also provides a logical, objective, and quantitative framework for establishing the quality le vel that data must meet to support decisions made during the implementation and maintena nce of MNA. Developing the DQO process consists of seven stages: State the problem; Identify the objective(s); Identify inputs to the objective(s); Define the study boundaries; Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-3 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final Develop a decision rule; Specify limits on decision errors; and Optimize the design for obtaining data. The overall DQO is to develop and implement pro cedures for sample and data collection, sample shipment, and reporting that will allow reviewer s to determine whether the field and laboratory data collected during the LTM at the Site meet the criteria and the monitoring endpoints established in the LTMWP. The DQOs will be achieved through the implementation of specific procedures for sampling, field data collection, calibration, internal qu ality control, audits, preventive maintenance, and corrective actions as described in this document. Site-specific DQOs for Site groundwater LTM are presented in the Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) (Appendix A). An additional DQO is to document that the soil remova l action at the Site resulted in COC concentration reduction. 2.1.2 Data Needs A performance monitoring plan that measures contaminant concentrations, geochemical parameters (e.g., oxidation-reduct ion [redox] parameters, pH), and hydrologic parameters is being implemented. The data will be used to evaluate Site hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions over time including: Changes in COC plume boundaries; Changes in the geochemical parameters that may be indicative of groundwater changes potentially affecting the rate and ex tent of natural attenuation; and Contaminant mass and/or concentration reductio ns indicative of progress toward meeting the RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations. Plume behavior can then be evaluated to judge the effec tiveness of the MNA remedy, the adequacy of the monitoring program, and the ad equacy of the conceptual model for MNA. Performance monitoring for MNA will continue until RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations or other monitoring end point s specified in Section 4.0 have been met. The DQO process presented in the QAPP (Appendix A, Table 3-2) id entified the need to collect groundwater data to determine the extent to whic h COCs are migrating and/or degrading and to determine if natural attenuation remains a viable remedial alternative to address the observed concentrations of chlorinated solvents. Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-4 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final Data will be collected to meet requirements fo r the following analyses and interpretations: Measurement of COC concentrations to dete rmine COC plume center of mass, size, and changes in center of mass and size. Verification that natural attenuation is continui ng at an acceptable rate and to identify the point when RAO-based target cleanup goal concentrations are attained. Early recognition of changes in the natural a ttenuation process that require supplemental responsive action to meet RAO-based targ et cleanup objectives for the Site. Provide COC contaminant profiles, biodegradat ion products, and indicators of biological activity. Assess the natural attenuation pr ocesses and the effectiveness of those processes with respect to achieving RAOs. Analytical data to be collected include both physical meas urements taken in the field and laboratory analysis. This LTMWP, along with the QAPP ( Appendix A ), present the type of monitoring data and data collection techniques that will be used. The following sections and appendices present the data collection system design a nd include the following: Number and location of sampling points (wells to be sampled); Sampling frequency; Sampling parameters (COC, COI, and MNA parameters); Sample collection techniques; and Sample handling, shipping and chain-of-custody procedures. 2.2 MONITORING WELLS SEL ECTED FOR THE LTM PLAN The LTM Program will consist of sampling 15 uppe r groundwater zone monitoring wells and seven lower groundwater zone moni toring wells. The 22 monitoring wells selected for the LTM plan at the Site consist of monitoring MW- 32M, MW-37M, MW-41M, MW-42M and MW-43M in the lower groundwater zone. A Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-5 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final summary of well information (location, depth, etc. ) for the 22 wells selected for this LTMWP is presented as Table 2-2. The location of the selected monitoring wells is presented as Figure 1-2 . The monitoring wells selected to document th e concentrations of COCs and the natural attenuation parameters are at the following locations: (1) In the groundwater with the highest ob served historic concentrations of COCs; (2) In the leading edge of the contaminated groundwater; (3) Downgradient of the contaminated groundwater; and (4) Upgradient of the contaminated groundwater. Only data from the upper groundwater zone will be used to determine compliance with the ROD. 2.3 SAMPLING FREQUENCY Groundwater sampling of the selected upper groundwat er zone monitoring wells at the Site for VOCs and MNA parameters will be conducted on a quarterly basis for the first two years of MNA implementation (i.e., post ROD approval). Th is sampling schedule is required to assess the effectiveness of MNA in achieving Site RAO-based target clea nup goal concentrations, verifying COC plume stability, and establishing degradation rates for the COCs. In addition, semi-annual groundwater sampling for VOCs will be conducted in the lo wer groundwater zone for the first two years of MNA implementation at the Site. The lower groundwater zone VOC data will be collected for informational pur poses only to document the reduction in VOC concentration in the former source areas even t hough it is not a requirement of the ROD. After the first two years, the sampling frequency will be evaluated and adjusted, as necessary, until a five-year demonstration period is completed. Sampling of total and dissolved lead and radionuclides will be conducted on a semi-annual basis for the first two years. Recommendations for adjustments to the sampling frequency will be based on results from the monitoring events. These recommendations will be included in annual reports. 2.4 CHEMICAL PARAMETERS FOR ANALYSIS The chemical analyses to be performed by the off-site laboratory for groundwater samples collected from the selected m dissolved lead, and radiol ogical parameters using EPA approved methodologies including USEPA SW-846 (USEPA, 2007), Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes (USEPA, 1983), and USEPA Prescribed Procedures for Measurement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water (USEPA, 1980) where applicable. The Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-6 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final radiological analysis to be pe rformed by the off-site laborator y includes gross alpha and gross beta (total and dissolved), combined radium ( 226+228) (total and dissolved), and uranium (total and dissolved). The MNA geochemical parameters analysis will also be performed on samples collected from selected monitoring wells in th e upper groundwater zone. The MNA geochemical parameters include: ethene; total organic carbon (TOC); chloride; Dissolved Oxygen (DO) via field measurement; pH (field measurement); temperature via field measurement; specific conductance via field measurement; oxidation/reduction potential (ORP ) via field measurement; and, turbidity field measurement A summary of the analyses for the LTM program for the Site are presented in Table 2-3 . The on-site coordinator will provide sampling containers and preservatives, and coordinate sampling procedures with the field sampling crew in accordance with the requirements in the QAPP ( Appendix A ). The specific suite of analyses to be performed is based on the COCs and COIs present in Site groundwater, and the geoc hemical parameters required to evaluate the occurrence of natural attenuation processes. The geochemical parameters collected via field measurement will be analyzed at the time of gr oundwater sample collection. The ferrous iron and soluble manganese analyses will be performed in the field using Hach kits Groundwater samples will also be collected for an alyses by a fixed laboratory. The following is a comprehensive list of parameters that will be analyzed in a fixed laboratory. A complete description of anal ytical methods and procedures is presented Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-7 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final gross alpha and gross beta (total and dissolved) ; uranium (total and dissolved); and, combined radium 226 + 228 (total and dissolved). Changes to the analytical parameters may be recommended in future annual reports. 2.5 SAMPLING PROCEDURES During each of the groundw ater sampling events, field personnel will measure the static depth to water, obtain field measurements (i.e. DO, pH, temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, and ORP), and collect groundwater sa mples utilizing low-flow sampling devices from the selected monitoring wells following procedures described in the QAPP ( Appendix A ). Field work will be performed in accordance with the Site Sa fety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan (Appendix B ). Examples of well purging and sampling forms are included in Appendix C of the QAPP ( Appendix A of this report). Completed forms w ill be included in the quarterly reports. The selected monitoring wells will be sampled us ing low-flow purge methods. Samples will be collected from each well in ac cordance with the USACE EM-200-1-3 guidelines (USACE, 2001) and the American Society for Testing and Materi als (ASTM) standard op erating procedures for low flow groundwater sampling (ASTM, 2002). Chain-of-custody practices will follow the USACE EM-200-1-3 guidelines. The groundwater samples collected will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Section 2.4 of the LTMWP in accordance with EPA methodology. Details regarding the sample bottles and preservatives to be used are provided in Table 3-6 of the QAPP. VOCs will be collected in 40-millil iter vials preserved with hydrochloric acid. The total lead sample will be collected in 1-liter polyethylene bottles and preserved with nitric acid (HNO 3). Although the low-flow purge method allows fo r minimal disturbance of the groundwater, a second lead sample will be collected from each well in unpreserved 1-liter polyethylene bottles for laboratory analysis of dissolved lead. Th e laboratory will filter these samples upon receipt using a 0.45 micron filter, and then preserve the filtrate with HNO 3. Radiological samples will be collected in 1-liter containers and preserved with nitric acid (HNO 3). The sample containers will arrive from the laboratory previously preserve d, if required. Each sample container will be labeled indicating the well number, sampling date, sample collection time, the individual collecting the sample, the parameters being anal yzed, and the preservative used. The lead and VOC samples will be shipped to an off-site laboratory on ice to preserve the integrity of the samples. The radiological samples will not requi re ice preservation. Details regarding the sample bottles and preservatives to be used are provided in Table 3-6 of the QAPP. Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-8 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final Two samples from each well will be obtained for lead analysis. The first sample from each well (total matrix) will be an unfiltered sample, and the second sample (dissolved matrix) will be filtered at the laboratory through a 0.45 micron filter prior to preservation by the laboratory. Natural attenuation parameters will be collec ted in accordance with the low flow sampling protocols and collection techniques as noted above. Preservatives will be used, as applicable, to retard the hydrolysis of chemical compounds and complexes, to reduce volatility of constituents, and to retard biological action during transit and storage prior to laboratory analysis. Samples will be placed in a cooler with ice in the fiel d as the samples are collected and shipped at 4oC. Details regarding the sample bottles and preservatives to be used are provid ed in Table 3-6 of the QAPP. VOCs and dissolved gases (i.e. ethane, ethe ne, and methane) will be collected directly in acidified zero headspace vials af ter stabilization. Ferrous ir on [Fe(II)] and soluble manganese [Mn(II)] will also be measured in the field with the use of field test kits. Per EPA protocols, nitrates will be analyzed within 48 hours; sulfates, and chlorides will be analyzed within 28 days; and ethane, ethene, and methane will be analyzed within 7 days. Lab filtered samples for dissolved fractions will be filtered and preserved (as applicable) within 72 hours. For every twenty samples collected, one repli cate sample, one matrix spike sample, and one matrix spike duplicate will be collected for off- site analysis for radiological and chemical analysis. Rinse blanks for water samples will onl y be required when non-dedicated or re-usable sampling equipment is used. As such, rinse blanks will not normally be obtained due to the use of dedicated equipment. Trip blanks will be required for every sampling event where analyses for VOCs are performed. One trip blank will acco mpany each cooler of samples sent off site for analysis. Prior to the beginning of each sampling event, a r ound of static water levels will be collected from all Site wells using an electronic water leve l indicator. The location of the pump intake (distance from the top of the screen) will be identified prior to beginning the sampling process. During each sampling event, a QED MP20 micro purge flow cell water quality meter, or equivalent, will be used to monitor the water quality parameters in the selected monitoring wells. Readings for ferrous iron (for MNA samples), soluble manganese (for MNA samples), DO, pH, temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, and ORP will be recorded on a water quality data sheet. Depth to water measurements using an el ectronic water level indi cator will be obtained during the purging of the wells to monitor water level fluctuation and record drawdown. Depth to water measurements will be made continuously during the purging and the sampling process until the water level in the well is stable and drawdown ceases. The pumping rate will be measured and adjusted, as necessary, to allow th e water level to stabilize. The drawdown will Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-9 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final not be allowed to exceed 25 percent of the dist ance between the top of the well screen or the static water level, whichever is lower, and the pump intake. The water quality meter will be calibrated and ma intained as per manufacturer's specifications. The water quality monitoring equipment will be t horoughly decontaminated using the procedures outlined in the QAPP ( Appendix A ). The following procedures will be used to measur e water levels using an electronic water level detector. Decontaminate the water level probe and the portion of cable that enters the water column with a non-phosphate detergent wash followed by a distilled water rinse. Dry using clean paper towels. Test the water level meter to ensure that the batteries are charged a nd that it is operating properly. If necessary, place plastic sheeting on the ground around the well to ensure that the measuring equipment does not contact the ground. Unlock the protective casing lo cking cap, remove the monito ring well cap, and place it on the plastic. Lower the probe into the well slowly until the alarm indicates that water has been reached. Read the depth to water from the gradua ted cable using the surveyed and marked measuring point on the monitoring well casing. This measurement should be made to the nearest 100th of a foot. Confirm the measurement by repeating the reading. Record the depth to water on the well sampling log or in the field notebook. Slowly remove the probe from the monito ring well and decontaminate the probe and portion of the cable that enters the wa ter column, as previously described. Replace the monitoring well cap and protectiv e-casing locking cap, and lock the well. Water quality parameters must be stable for th ree consecutive readings taken several minutes apart before water samples will be collected. Stability for these parameters is defined as follows: pH \u00b1 0.2 units Temperature \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C Turbidity \u00b1 10 percent or 5 NTUs, whichever is greater Specific conductivity \u00b1 3 percent DO \u00b1 10 percent of the reading or 0.2 mg/L, whichever is greater Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-10 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final ORP \u00b1 20 mV. If after three consecu tive readings the above criteria cannot be met, sampling will commence based on the judgment of the field sampling team leader. The following is an outline of the groundwater monitoring well sample collection procedure. Clearly label each sample container with a waterproof marker (pen for volatiles). Spread plastic sheeting on the ground around the well. Unlock and carefully remove the well cover to avoid having any foreign material enter the well. Using an electronic water le vel detector, measure the wa ter level from below the measuring point on the top of the casing. Use the previously recorded depth to the bottom of the well to estimate the height of the water column in the well. Determine the volume of water in the well based on the water column and diameter of the well. Decontaminate the end of the probe between wells by washing with Alconox and water, and rinsing with deionized water. Purge the well using a dedicated pump. Groundwater samples will be collected in accordance with Low Flow Groundwater Sampling Procedures presented in the QAPP ( Appendix A ). In the case of wells that recharge slowly, sample as s oon as adequate recharge has oc curred. If a well does not contain or yield sufficient volume for all requi red laboratory analyti cal testing, including quality control, prioritize sample analyses. After well purging is completed and/or the we ll has sufficiently recharged, fill the sample containers with a minimum of sample agitation. Collect the samples in the general order of the sensitivity of the parameters to volatilization and the low flow sampling procedures. Field measurements, (i.e. DO, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, temperature, and ORP) will be collected continuously during the well purging. The preferred collectio n order for the remaining parameters and analyses after measuring depth to water a nd stabilization parameters is as follows: 1) Ferrous Iron (Field Test Kit): Hach 8146 analysis 2) Soluble Manganese (Field Hach 8149 analysis 3) Methane/ethane/ethene and VOCs 4) Lead, radiological and all re maining chemical parameters. Sound the well to determine the depth. Decontaminate the end of the probe between wells by washing with Alconox and water, and rinsing with deionized water. Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-11 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 2.6 INSPECTION AND WELL MAINTENANCE The selected monitoring wells included in the LTMWP are installed in a very fine grained aquifer consisting predominantly of silts and some sands . It has been observed that silt and sediment accumulate at the bottom of the well s over time and reduce the length of the screen through which groundwater can flow from the aquife r into the well. Peri odic silt and sediment removal is required in order to assure that repr esentative groundwater sa mples can be collected from the monitoring wells. In order to maintain consistent data quality and track the progress of natural attenuation processes ove r an extended period of time, th e selected monitoring wells at the Site will be maintained by removing the accu mulated sediment and developing the wells. The sediment removal and well development activiti es will be performed annually, prior to the first and the fifth quarterly sampling events. This section presents the well maintenance plan for the selected monitoring wells at the Site. 2.6.1 Sediment Removal Sediment removal will be performed at the 22 selected monitoring wells in the LTM program according to the USACE standard EM 1110-1-4000 (11/98) procedures. Pumps and tubing will be removed, and total depth will be recorded prior to and after sediment removal by a Shaw representative. The sediment will be removed us ing a bottom loading bailer, with rapid short upward and downward motions near the bottom of th e well causing the sediment to be stirred up and enter the bailer. Sedime nts will be containerized in drums supplied by the drilling contractor. Once the sediment removal has been completed, the bailers will be removed to prevent accidental bailer release down the well, and well development will proceed using gentle mechanical surging as outlined in Section 2.6.2. 2.6.2 Well Redevelopment Based on the post-ROD sampling requirements, 22 selected monitoring wells will be redeveloped to remove and reduce sediment build- up in the wells and to turbidity of the water being produced by the wells. The se lected monitoring wells will be redeveloped prior to the first and the fifth quarterly sampling events. Well redevelopment will be conducted in accordance with USACE EM 1110-1-4000 (11/98), Section 6-3, Mechanical Surgi ng. Wells will be redeveloped by conducting gentle mechanical surging, which involves a surge block attached to a drill rod or stem and using an up and down motion (\"surging\") similar to the bottom loading bailer procedure outlined in Section 2.6.1. This up and down motion will force water in and out of the well bore, mobilizing the particulates so that they can be removed. The surging will be gen tle to assure that water can come into the well Section 2.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 2-12 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final and to prevent damage of the well screen. Well redevelopment will continue until the criteria stated in Section 6-4 of the USACE EM 1110-1-4000 are met, or until three hours are spent on each well, whichever occurs first. Redevelopment will continue until indica tor parameters, i.e., pH, conductivity, temperature, ORP, DO, or turb idity have stabilized. Acco rding to the USACE criteria, \"Generally three successive readings should be within \u00b10 .2 for pH, \u00b10.3 percent for conductivity, \u00b110mV for ORP, \u00b11 degree Celsius for temperature, and \u00b110 percent for turbidity and DO\". The well water is clear to the unaided eye an d the turbidity of the water removed is at some specified level. It may be required that the turbidity be below 5 NTU's. This may not be possible. It should be noted that natu ral turbidity levels in groundwater at the Site may exceed 10 NTU's. It is imperative that th e sample is representative of water flowing through that well. The sediment thickness remaining in the well is less than one percen t of the screen length or less than 30 mm (0.1 ft) for screens e qual to or less than 3m (10 ft) long. In addition, a minimum of th ree times the standing water vo lume in the well (to include the well screen and casing plus saturated annulus) will be removed from the well. Water removed from the selected monitoring wells during redevelopment w ill be containerized in drums supplied by th e drilling contractor. Section 3.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 3-1 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3.0 DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES The LTM data analysis will incorporate the MN A data evaluation approaches recommended in the Guidance for Evaluation of Federal Agency De monstrations that Re medial Actions are Operating Properly and Successfully Under CERCLA Section 120(h)(3) (USEPA 1996a); Technical Protocol for Evaluating Natural Atte nuation of Chlorinated Solvents in Ground Water (Wiedemeier et al. 1998) ; Performance Monitoring of MNA Remedies for VOCs in Groundwater (USEPA, 2004a), Designing Monitoring Programs to Effec tively Evaluate the Performance of Natural Attenuation (AFCEE, 2000), and A Decision Flowchart for the Use of Monitored Natural Attenuation and Enhanced Attenuation at Sites with Chlorinated Organic Plumes (ITRC, 2007). In order to evaluate the extent to which COCs in groundwater are migrating and/or degrading, Shaw will compile and evaluate the groundwater analytical and MNA geochemical parameters data collected during the implementation of th e of the LTMWP. Shaw will also review the existing Site data, with emphasis on the post so il excavation groundwater data documented in the Final 2006 Groundwater Sampling Report (Shaw, 2007a) and the Draft Final 2007 Groundwater Sampling Report (Shaw, 2007b) and groundwater anal ytical and geochemical data collected at the Site in 2008 and 2009 (Sha w 2009a, Shaw 2009b, Shaw 2009c and Shaw 2009d). A number of spatial and temporal data analysis techniques will be used to document the progress of natural attenuation in groundwater at the Site. Data analysis and in terpretation will focus on the detection of changes or trends in the data, and assessment of the cha nges or trends in the context of their impact on the potential for MNA to achieve Site-related goals. The data analysis techniques are described in the following sections. 3.1 DATA BASE DEVELOPMENT A database will be constructed and updated with quarterly data collected during the performance of the LTM program. The database will provide tabulated analytical results, including the following: 1. and VC), total and dissolved lead, gross alpha and gross beta (total and dissolved), uranium (total and dissolved), and combined radium 226 + 228 (total and dissolved). 2. Natural attenuation parameters - nitrate (NO 3), soluble manganese [Mn(II)], [Fe(II)], sulfate, methane, ethane, ethene, TOC, chloride. Section 3.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 3-2 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3. Field measurements such as DO, pH, temp erature, conductivity, ORP, and turbidity. 4. Relevant historical data collected at the Site prior to initiation of LTM. The data tables will include a comparison of COC concentrations with the RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal co ncentrations and a comparison of COI concentrations with applicable screening values. 3.2 GRAPHICAL TECHNIQUES 3.2.1 Groundwater Flow Evaluation Groundwater elevation contour maps will be prep ared using the groundwater elevation data collected during each of the quarterly sampling ev ents. Any changes in the groundwater flow directions and gradients over time will be documented. Of particular interest will be the changes in groundwater flow caused by the sheet pile wall. 3.2.2 Isoconcentration Maps A series of isoconcentration contour maps will be prepared for each of the quarterly sampling events to present data showing changes in COC concentrations and plume configuration for each COC whose concentration exceeds its respectiv e RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations regulatory acceptanc e criteria. Isoconcentration ma ps will be prepared for the upper groundwater zone only, since the data in th e lower groundwater zone is being collected for informational purposes only. The isoconcentration maps will be prepared for the following analytes: COCs PCE, the data distribu tion justifies it. 3.2.3 Temporal Trends Trends in parameter concentrations measur ed in groundwater samples over time will be evaluated as indicators of plum e stability and progress toward CO C reduction. If applicable or necessary, trends will be analyzed by plotting concentration data versus time on semi-log paper with log concentration being plotted against lin ear time. Plotting the concentration data on the log scale counters the relatively large ch anges in concentration data over time. Data will be compared to determine if temporal trends exist within the plume and in surrounding areas. In addition to trends in parameter c oncentrations, electron acceptors and donors, ORP, and other general geochemical indicators will be presented. Inferences will be drawn from Section 3.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 3-3 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final trend-to-trend comparisons (e.g., a decreasing tre nd in PCE compared to an increasing trend in TCE in the same groundwater zone may i ndicate degradation of PCE to TCE). Temporal trends will be plotted for the following parameters: VOCs - PCE, if justified by the frequency of det ections in the reported data Total and dissolved lead; Gross alpha and gross beta (total and dissolved); Uranium (total and dissolved); Combined radium 226 + 228 (total and dissolved); and MNA geochemical parameters - some or a ll of the parameters including DO, ORP, nitrate (NO 3), soluble manganese [Mn(II)], ferrous methane, ethane, ethene, TOC, and chloride may be plotted if the data distribution justifies it. 3.2.4 Spatial Trends COC concentrations versus distan ce plots will be prepared for so me of the selected monitoring wells along the groundwater flow path over several sampling events. Monitoring wells considered for plotting will incl ude those located within the VOC plume (defined by exceedance of RAOs) and wells located upgradient and downgrad ient of the plume. In addition, temporal trend plots developed as part of the evaluati on proposed in Section 3.2.3 will be clustered based on their spatial location. An evaluation of trends in data from selected monitoring wells located within the VOC plume, to be identified based on comparison of measured concentrations with the RAOs, will determine if the plume exhibits stability or reduction in COC concentrations. Similarly, data from a group of monitoring wells at the downgradie nt limits of a plume may be compared to data from previous sampling rounds to determine if the plume seems to be stable, shrinking, or expanding. 3.3 STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES The temporal and spatial trend analysis pres ented in Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 can be used to evaluate plume stability (i.e., stable, dimi nishing, or expanding plume). While plotting concentration data versus time and/or distance is a valuable tool for any plume stability analysis, discerning trends in the plotted da ta can often be a subjective proce ss, particularly if the data do not display a uniform trend, but show some vari ability over time or spac e. In these cases, a statistical test such as the Mann-Whitney U Te st, the Mann-Kendall Test, or a linear regression Section 3.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 3-4 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final analysis can be useful. The fo llowing sections provide details of the statistical data evaluation approaches that will be applied to the LTM data. 3.3.1 The Mann-Whitney U Test This statistical test will be performed for the COCs (PCE, TCE, ci s-1,2-DCE and VC) at monitoring wells where the COC concentrations exceed the RAOs provided there are several quarters of data exceeding thei r respective detection limits. The test is nonparametric, which means that the outcome of the test is not determ ined by the overall magnitude of the data points but rather the ranking of individual data points. The test will be conducted at the end of the eighth LTM sampling event, as it requires eight consecutive quar ters of analytical data. Typically, the eight consecutive quarters of monitoring data are di vided into two groups representing the first four quarters and the last four quarters. The Mann-Whitney U method tests the hypothesis that the two data groups are statistically equivale nt. The test is conducted by vertically ranking the eight data points from lowest to highes t, with the lowest value on top and greatest value on the bottom. The test will be used to determine with at least 90 percent confidence whether the concentration for the i ndividual COC at that well has decreased over time. 3.3.2 The Mann-Kendall Test This is another nonparametric test that may be us ed to define the stability of a solute plume based on concentration trends at individual wells. The test will be applied to data for the COCs (PCE, TCE, cis-1,2-DCE, and VC) at the selected monitoring wells, where the COC concentrations exceed the RAOs provided there are several quarters of data exceeding the respective detection limits. To evaluate plume st ability, four or more measured concentrations (higher than detection limits) over six sampli ng events are required. The evaluation will be performed using computer modeling software such as the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) Monitoring and Remediation Optimization System (MAROS), Version 2.2. The Mann-Kendall statistic (S) will be used to qualify the data tr ends as increasing, decreasing, or lacking trend, and provide a quantitative indicator of the strength of the trend. 3.3.3 Moments Analysis The AFCEE MAROS software tool will be used to evaluate COC stability by performing an analysis of the location and movement of the center of mass of the plume. An analysis of moments will be utilized to resolve plume tre nds; with the zeroth moment showing change in dissolved mass over time, the firs t moment showing the change in the center of mass location over time, and the second moment showing the spread of the plume over time. Section 3.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 3-5 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final In addition to providing a relati ve measure of plume stability and condition, the moment analysis will also be used to evaluate the potential eff ect of removing wells from the LTM program. This will be used to identify redundant wells that may be proposed to be removed from the LTM program in the future. 3.4 REMEDIAL TIME FRAME ESTIMATION Remedial time frames using MNA will be estimat ed for the COCs. Where applicable, the time- trend data will be used to calculate Site-specifi c degradation/attenuation rates for the COCs. The calculated degradation/attenuation rates will be us ed to make predictions of the time required for the individual COCs to meet the RAO based gr oundwater target cleanup goal concentrations. Changes in COC attenuation rates ov er time will be documented. 3.5 NATURAL ATTENUATION VIABILITY ASSESSMENT The USEPA utilizes a score sheet to assess the likelihood that anaerobic biodegradation is occurring at a site (Wiedemeier, et. al., 1998). This method relies on the fact that biodegradation will cause predictable changes in groundwater ch emistry. Based on the geochemical conditions defined by each of the MNA parameters measured at the Site, points are aw arded on a scale of -3 to 3. For example, if the DO concentration in the area of the plume with the highest COC concentration is less than 0.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L), 3 points are added (+3 points awarded). On the other hand, if the DO concentration in the area of the plume with the highest COC concentration is greater than 5 mg/L, 3 points are subtracted (-3 points awarded). The sum total of points awarded constitutes the biodegradation likelihood assessment score. The score is interpreted in accordance with the method descri bed in Wiedemeier, et. al., (1998) as follows: 0 to 5 points - Inadequate evidence for anaerobic biodegradation of COCs; 6 to 14 points - Limited evidence for anaerobic biodegrad ation of COCs; 15 to 20 points - Adequate evidence for anaerobic biodegradation of COCs; and Greater than 20 points - Strong evidence for anaerobic biodegradation of COCs. The geochemical data collected during the LTM will be used to develop a score for the Site in order to assess the viability of natural attenuation and track the changes in conditions supporting biodegradation over time. Section 4.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 4-1 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 4.0 MONITORING END POINTS 4.1 RAO BASED MONITORING END POINT The remedial action will be considered complete when COC concentrations have met the RAO- based groundwater target cleanup goal concen trations in wells in the LTM groundwater monitoring program on a consistent basis. In order to make this determination, only data from the eight quarters of post-exc avation groundwater monitoring fo r the15 selected monitoring wells in the upper groundwater zone, as require d by the ROD, will be relied upon. In addition, limited groundwater sampling will be conducted in the lower groundwater zone for COCs on a semi-annual basis for the first two years of MNA implementation at the Site. The lower groundwater zone COC data will be collected for informationa l purpose only to document the COC concentration reduction in the former sour ce areas although it is not a requirement of the ROD. Therefore, the lower groundwat er zone data will not be used to verify the attainment of the monitoring end point. After eight quarters of monitori ng, data from the upper zone LTM groundwater monitoring wells will be evaluated statistically using the collect ed post-excavation data and any subsequently collected rounds of data. Trend analysis will be conducted to determine if COC concentrations are decreasing, have reached an asymptotic state, or are in a state of flux. Monitoring wells that have COC concentrations that are consistent ly less than the RAO-ba sed groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations will be considered to have met the ROD requirements and further monitoring of these wells will be discontinued. The LTM end point is the demonstration of attainment of the RAOs. At the end of two y ears of LTM, analytical results from groundwater monitoring will be compared to the RAO based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations to determine ROD compliance. Groundwater m onitoring over the next two years of the LTM program may or may not result in COC con centrations meeting th e RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations; however, the LTM program will allow the tracking of remedial progress toward compliance with RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations by assessing the rate of MNA processes and evaluating the suitability of geochemical conditions with regard to th e viability of natu ral attenuation. If the analytical results do not show compliance with RAO-base d groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations , but show progress or a trend towards mee ting the goals, the LTM program may be continued (on a reduced basis; semi-annual to annual monitoring) for three additional years in accordance with the requirements of the ROD. The ROD anticipates the performance monitoring period for the LTM to be between two and five years, dependent on analytical results Section 4.0 Field Sampling Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 4-2 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final of the groundwater sampling. The ROD also assu mes that, after the initial performance period, annual groundwater monitoring for COCs will be conducted through Year 15, with one final year (Year 16) of quarterly COC sampling designed to document attainment of the RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations in the selected monitoring wells in the LTM program. At the end of the five years of LTM, an assessmen t will be made to judge the effectiveness of the MNA remedy, the adequacy of the monitoring program, the possibility of off-site plume migration, and the time frame for the attainment of the RAO-based gro undwater target cleanup goals. On the basis of these judgments, recomme ndations may be made for subsequent phases of remedy implementation including: Continue the performance monitoring prog ram beyond the five year period without change; Modify the performance monitoring program; Terminate performance monitoring; or Use an alternate monitoring end point. 4.2 ALTERNATE MONITORING END POINT At the end of five years of LTM, the data will be evaluated to determine if alternate monitoring end points in lieu of the RAO-based groundwate r target cleanup goal concentrations are necessary in consultation with the state regulato rs. The alternate monitoring end points will be based on the following lines of evidence generated during the course of the LTM implementation: Evidence that COC concentra tions at the property boundaries and downgradient are less than the RAO-based groundwater ta rget cleanup goal concentrations; Evidence from the temporal, spatial, and statis tical analysis of LTM data that the COC plumes are stable or shrinking (redu ction in COC volume and mass); and Evidence that COC concentrations at the Site have attained equilibrium conditions at levels exceeding RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations. Based on the above lines of evidence, if it can be demonstrated that further reductions in COC concentrations are not feasible, the USACE may petition NYSDEC that \"no further action\" status be granted based on the impracticality of achieving the RAO-based groundwater target cleanup goal concentrations at all select ed monitoring wells in the LTM program.

Each year, the results of the fourth quarterly samp ling event will be incorporated into the annual report, along with the results of the first th ree quarters. The Quarterly Data Summary Letter Reports will provide the following: A brief description of the sampling event; Deviations from the work plan; Field and laboratory data in table format along with data validation qualifiers; Identification of sample results that exceed the RAO-based groundwat er target cleanup goal concentrations or applicable New York State groundwater sta ndards and/or guidance values, if available; and Plots of trends graphs incorporating data from preceding quarter(s) for wells with detections above standard s and/or guidance values. Data validation will address the usability of laboratory data. For the purposes of the LTM, un-useable data will be defined to include rejected data points (\"R\" qualifier). Those data points determined to be due to blank contamination will be considered as \"non-detects\" (\"U\" qualifier). All other qualified data will be usable with qua lifications as noted in the QAPP. The percent completeness will be evaluated and any im pacts will be noted in the reports. 5.2 ANNUAL REPORTS Shaw will prepare annual LTM reports at the end of the first and the second years of quarterly sampling. The LTM reports will summarize the data collected during the first and the second years of the LTM program and present an evaluati on of the performance of MNA at the Site. The LTM reports will contain the following. A summary of data collection activities pe rformed during the four quarterly sampling events preceding the report. Tabulated analytical results including CO C and COI concentrations, MNA parameters, and field parameters including re levant historical data collected at the Site prior to initiation of LTM. Section 5.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 5-2 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final A comparison of COC concentrations with the RAO-based groundw ater target cleanup goal concentrations and COI concentrations with the applicable screening values. Site-specific natural attenuation rates a nd any changes in the rate over time. Time frames for attaining the RAO-based groun dwater target cleanup goal concentrations for COCs. Identification of potentially t oxic and/or mobile transfor mation products, specifically verifying that the natural attenuation da ughter products (e.g., cis-1,2-DCE, trans-1,2- DCE, and VC) do not pose additional risks. Plume and stability analysis with verifi cation that the plume(s) is not expanding downgradient or laterally. Graphical and stat istical evaluation methods will be used to demonstrate that natural a ttenuation is occurring. An evaluation of groundwater geochemical data to demonstrate that natural attenuation, and specifically intrinsic bioremediation, is occurring according to expectations and to identify changes in geochemical conditions th at may reduce the efficacy of the natural attenuation process. An assessment of the effectiveness of the MNA remedy, the adequacy of the monitoring program, the possibility of off-site pl ume migration, and the time frame for the attainment of the regulat ory acceptance criteria. Recommendations for subsequent phases of remedy implementation such as proposed changes to the performance monitoring pr ogram, or termination of performance monitoring upon attainment of the ROD-based groundwat er target cleanup goal concentrations Section 6.0 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 6-1 Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev. 1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 6.0 SCHEDULE The schedule for LTM implementation (groundwa ter sampling for MNA) and the associated reporting is shown on Figure 6-1 .

Inherent in the QA program is the implementation of quality c ontrol measures. These measures provide assurance that the monitoring of quality-related events has occurred, and that the data gathered in support of the project are complete, accurate, a nd precise. Implementation of this QAPP will help ensure the validity of th e data collected and will establish a firm foundation for decisions regarding the GW MNA LTM. This document was developed in accordance with specifications contained in the USACE, Requirements for the Preparation of Sampling and Analysis Plans, EM 200-1-3, (USACE, 2001), USEPA Data Quality Objectives Process for Hazardous Waste Site Investigations EPA QA/G-4HW (USEPA, 2000b), and the DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009) (DoD QSM). Sample collection will be performed in accord ance with established Shaw SOPs designed to ensure the collection of representative samples. Shaw SOPs may be found in Appendix C . A subcontractor laboratory that is approved by the USACE will perform the analytical sample analysis. Laboratory analytical methods will be performed in accordance with USEPA protocols and methods. Shaw will have the laboratory da ta validated according to the QAPP requirements, DoD QSM requirements, the analytical method, a nd laboratory SOPs. Data validation qualifiers will be consistent with the USEPA Region II SO Ps and other USEPA and multi-agency guidance documents. Further discussion for regard ing data validation may be found in Section 3.9.3 . 3.1 Quality Assurance Project Objectives Quality assurance is defined as the overall system of activities for assuring the reliability of data produced. The system integrates the quality planning, assessment, and corrective actions of various groups in the organization to provide th e independent QA program necessary to establish and maintain an effective syst em for collection and analysis of environmental samples and related activities. The program en compasses the generation of comple te data with its subsequent review, validation, and documentation. 3.1.1 Data Quality Objectives The overall QA objective is to develop and implement procedures for sample and data collection, evaluation, and reporting that will allow reviewers to determine whether the field and laboratory procedures meet the criteria a nd endpoints established in the Data Quality Objectives (DQOs). DQOs are qualitative and quantitative statements that outline the decision making process and Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-2specify the data required to s upport corrective actions. DQOs speci fy the level of uncertainty that will be accepted in results de rived from environmental data. The DQO process used for developing data quality criteria and performance specifications for decision making is consistent with the Data Quality Objectives Process for Hazardous Waste Investigations , USEPA QA/G-4HW (USEPA, 2000b). The DQO process consists of the seven steps below. A phased approach has been adopted for LTM to opt imize resource utilization and minimize decision errors. Each phase is br oken out in the following DQO elements. DQO elements common to all investigative areas are included following each process step. The components of project-specific DQOs are defined on Table 3-1 . Project-specific be found on Table 3-2 .

(2) Samples will be analyzed using USEPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846), Update IV (USEPA, 2007), USEPA Prescribed Procedures for Measurement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water (USEPA, 1980), Methods for Chemical Anal ysis of Water and Wastes (USEPA, 1983), and the DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009) methodology where applicable. Refer to Section 3.5 . (3) The groundwater action levels are based on the Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) identified in the Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan; Rev1 for the compounds of concern and for informational purposes the NY State GA GW standards Part 703 and Federal DW MCLs for the non-compounds of concern . The natural attenuation data will be compared to Wiedemeier et al. (1996) Conditions for Supporting Natural Attenuation for Chlorinated Solvents ( Table 3-4 ). (4) Field sampling will be performed in accordan ce with the Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev1, Groundwater Sampling for Natura l Attenuation Colonie, FUSRAP Site. 4. Define the Boundaries: Define decision statement spa tial and temporal boundaries. This step specifies (1) the spatial boundary, (2) popula tion characteristics, applicable geographic areas and associated homogeneous characteristic s, and (3) constraints on sample collection. All Areas: (1, 2, 3) Refer to Table 3-2 . 5. Develop a Decision Rule: Define the (1) parameters of interest, (2) action levels, and (3) develop a decision rule. (1) Parameters of interest are listed in the decision inputs. See Table 3-2 . (2) The groundwater action levels are based on Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) identified in the Long-Term Monitoring Work Plan, Rev. 1 for the compounds of concern and for informational purposes th e New York State GA GW standards Part 703 and Federal DW MCLs for the non- compounds of concern. The natural attenuation data will be compared to Wiedemeier et al. (1996) Conditions for Supporting Natural Attenuation fo r Chlorinated Solvents ( Table 3-4 ). (3) These will be developed in LTM annual report. 6. Specify Acceptable Limits on Decision Errors: Specify the decision maker's tolerable limits on decision errors. This step of the proces s includes (1) parameter range of interest, (2) decision errors, (3) potential parameter values, and (4) the probability tolerance for decision errors identified during this phase. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-10 (1) Parameter ranges are no t defined at this time. (2) Decision errors include: (1a)(i) Deciding that groundwater contamin ants were degrading and conducive for natural attenuation and not migrating when they were non-conducive and migrating, and (ii) Deciding that groundwater contaminan ts were not degrading and non-conducive for natural attenuation when they were conducive and degradi ng. The consequences of deciding that the groundwate r contaminants were not de grading and non-conducive for natural attenuation when they are will result in unnecessary monitoring and remedial actions. The consequences of deciding that the groundwater contaminants were degrading and conducive for natural attenuatio n and not migrating when they are will result in liabilities associated with future damages and possible environmental clean-up costs. Additionally, public opinion will be compromised. (1b) The true state when the most seve re decision error occurs (the groundwater contaminants were degrading and conducive for natural attenuation and not migrating when they are) is that groundwater contam inants are not degrading, non-conducive for natural attenuation, and migrating across the s ite. The true state when the less severe decision error occurs (the groundwater contaminants were not degrading and non- conducive for natural attenuation when they ar e) is that groundwater contaminants are degrading and conducive fo r natural attenuation. (1c) The null hypothesis (H0) is: Groundwater contaminants were non-conducive for natural attenuation and not degraded while mi grating across the site warranting additional monitoring and alternative remediation. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is: Groundwater contaminants degraded and were conducive fo r natural attenuation while not migrating across the site and not warranting an y further alternative remediation. (1d) The false positive decision error o ccurs when H0 is erroneously rejected corresponding to decision error I. The false negative decision error occurs when Ha is erroneously accepted corresponding to decision erro r II. Project specific Type I and Type II error rates are 0.05 and 0.2, respectively. (3,4) The consequence of decision errors and acceptable probability wi ll be determined as part of the LTM annual report. 7. Optimize Data Design: Identify data collection activities commensurate with data quality specifications. This final step in the pro cess consists of (1) reviewing DQO outputs and existing environmental data, (2) developing data collection design alternatives, (3) formulating mathematical expressions to reso lve design problems for e ach alternative, (4) selecting cost-effective data design capable of achieving DQOs, and (5) documentation of operational details and theoretical assumptions. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-11 (1) This QAPP contains the proposed LTM and MNA sampling design program. A phased approach has been adopted for site characte rization to optimize re source utilization and minimize decision errors for each area. DQO refinement will be an iterative process throughout the project life cycle. (2) The development of the data collection alte rnatives was performed with Shaw, USACE, USEPA, and NYSDEC during the project pla nning session. Systematic sampling will be performed to collect additional data need ed to complete the groundwater long-term monitoring and monitored natu ral attenuation. Further discussion as to the sampling program may be found in LTM Work Pla n, Rev1, Groundwater Sampling for Natural Attenuation, Colonie FUSRAP Site. (3) Qualitative assessments will be established during the refinement process. (4) This QAPP contains the proposed LTM sa mpling design program based on cost and project DQOs. (5) Refer to LTM Work Plan, Rev. 1, Groundwat er Sampling for Natural Attenuation, Colonie FUSRAP Site. The overall QA objective is to develop and implement procedures for sample and data collection, sample shipment, and reporting that will allow QA reviewers to determine whether the field and laboratory data collected during the LTM at the Colonie site meet th e criteria and endpoints established in the DQOs. The QA objective will be achieved through the implementation of specific procedures for sampling, field data collection, COC, ca libration, internal QC, audits, preventive maintenance, and corrective ac tions as described in this document. 3.2 Accuracy, Precision, Representativene ss, Completeness, Comparability, and Sensitivity The DQO process will be used to ensure chemical data will be of known defensible quality appropriate to achieving project objectives. Project data needs wi ll be defined in terms of a qualitative assessment of requirements expresse d as accuracy, precision, representativeness, completeness, comparability, and sensitivity. Laboratory data will be evaluated against the QAPP requirements which includes the DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009) and the USEPA anal ytical method requirements. Laboratory data found to be outside of the criteri a will be flagged in accordance with USEPA Region II SOPs and other USEPA and multi-agen cy guidance documents. Further discussion may be found in Section 3.9 of this QAPP. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-12 3.2.1.1 Precision Precision refers to the level of agreement among re peated measurements of the same parameter. It is usually stated in terms of standard devi ation, relative standard devi ation, relative error ratio (RER), relative percent difference (RPD), range, or relative range. The overall precision of data is a mixture of sampling and analytical factors. The analytical precision is easier to control and quantify because the laboratory is a controlle d, and therefore, measurable environment. Sampling precision is unique to each site, making it harder to control and quantify. The goals for each factor are addressed below. Sampling precision will be evaluated by obtaining one duplicate sample for every 20 samples collected for each type of media (5% frequency). For chemical data, precision will be evaluated by calculating the RPD as follows: RPD = |R1 - R2| / [(R1+R2)/2] R1 = original sample result R2 = duplicate sample result Criteria = RPD 25% for inorganic parameters = RPD 50% for organic parameters For radiological data, precisi on control criterion will be evaluated by calculating the RER equivalency as follows: RER = |R1 - R2| / (SQRT [(TPU12)+(TPU22)]) R1 = original sample result R2 = duplicate sample result TPU1 = total propagated uncertainty of the original sample result (1 ) TPU2 = total propagated uncertainty of the duplicate sample result (1 ) Criteria = RER 1.5 The RPD or RER will be calculated for both the field duplicates and laboratory duplicates for where each analytical parameter that was detected in both samples. It is expected that the field and laboratory duplicates for ground water matrices will have a RP D less than 25% for inorganic and less than 50% for organic parameters and will have a RER less than 1.5 for radiological parameters. If these criteria are not met for the field duplicates, a caref ul examination of the sampling techniques, sample media, and analyti cal procedure will be conducted to identify the cause of the high RPD or high RER a nd the usefulness of the data. Actual laboratory control limits will be based upon the method performance based data ( Table 3- 3). If the precision criteria are not met for labor atory duplicates, an examination of the data will be conducted to determine the cause of the vari ability and usefulness of the data. Laboratory Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-13 analytical precision will also be performed by the an alysis of matrix spikes (MSs) / matrix spike duplicates (MSDs), as well as laboratory contro l samples (LCSs) / laboratory control sample duplicates (LCSDs). 3.2.1.2 Accuracy Accuracy values can be presented in a variety of ways. Average error is one way of presenting this information, however; more commonly, accuracy is presented as perc ent bias or percent recovery. Percent bias is a standardized average error (the average error divided by the actual or spiked concentration and converted to a percen tage). Percent bias is unit-less and allows accuracy of analytical procedures to be compared easily. Percent recovery provides the same information as percent bias. The accuracy of sa mpling activities will be qualitatively controlled through the use of SOPs that have been develope d to standardize the coll ection of measurements and samples. For chemical data, accuracy of the extraction and analysis procedures will be checked quantitatively through the use of matrix spikes (MS), la boratory control samples (LCS), surrogate spikes, and blanks as applicable to th e analytical method perfor med. Percent recovery is defined as: For surrogate and internal QC sample % Recovery = (R/S) x 100 Where: S = Spiked surrogate or internal QC sample concentration R = Reported surrogate or inte rnal QC sample concentration % Bias = % Recovery - 100 For matrix spike % Recovery = (R-I/S) x 100 Where: S = Spiked spike concentration R = Reported spike concentration I = Initial spiked sample concentration % Bias = % Recovery - 100 The spiked test concentration \"S\" is the resu ltant concentration found for the MS/MSD or LCS samples. The initial spiked sample concentration \"I\" is the original sample concentration for the MS/MSD samples and is usually zero for the inte rnal QC LCS and surrogate samples. Actual laboratory control limits w ill be based upon the method performance based data ( Table 3-3 ). LCSs will be analyzed to assess general method performance by the ability of the laboratory to successfully recover the target analytes from a control matrix. The LCS is similar in composition to the method blank. For aqueous anal yses, spiked analyte-free reagent water will be used. The LCS is spiked with single-component target analytes before it is carried through Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-14 the preparation, cleanup, and determinative procedur es. LCSs are performed at a rate of one per preparation batch per matrix. When samples are not subjected to a separate preparatory procedure (i.e., purge and trap VOC analyses), the continuing calibration verification (CCV) may be used as the LCS, provided the CCV acceptance limits are used for evaluation. The results of the LCS will be evaluated, in conjunction with ot her QC information during the data validation process to ascertain the accepta bility of the data generated for that batch of samples. MSs and MSDs are used to assess the performan ce of the method as applied to a particular project matrix. A MS is an environmental sa mple to which known concentrations of certain target analytes have been added before sample manipulation from the preparation, cleanup, and determinative procedures have been implemented. The original field sample is mixed or shaken to ensure homogeneous fractions when allowed by the method. MSs are performed by the lab at a rate of one per preparation batch per matrix. Project MS/MSD will be collected for groundwater samples at a 5 percent (1 per 20) fre quency. The results of the MS are evaluated, in conjunction with other QC informa tion during the valida tion process to assess the effect of the matrix on the bias of the analysis. Documentation protocols for field sampling and measurements are outlined in SOPs as presented in Appendix C . Field inspection performed by the Sh aw QA/QC Manager will be used to identify deviations and execute corrective ac tions. Consistent and proper calibration of equipment throughout the field exercises, as desc ribed in this QAPP, will ensure measurement accuracy. 3.2.1.3 Representativeness Representativeness is a qualitative parameter that expresses the degree to which sample data accurately and precisely re present actual conditions and is a measure of the degree to which the measured results accurately reflect the medium being sampled. In the field, the representativeness of the data depends on selec tion of appropriate sampling locations, collection of an adequate number of samples, and use of consistent sampling procedures to ensure the material collected is as a \"sample\" of the whole. Field handling protocols (i.e., storage, handling in the field, and shipping) have also been designed to protect the re presentativeness of the collected samples. Proper field documentation and QC inspections will be used to establish th at protocols have been followed and that sample identification and integrity have been maintaine d. The sampling procedures, as described in the work plan, are designed with the goal of obtaining representative samples for each of the different matrices. In the analytical laboratory, the representativene ss of the analytical data is a function of the procedures used in processing th e samples. The objective for re presentativeness is to provide Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-15 data of the same high quality as other analyses of similar samples using the same methods during the same time period within the laboratory. Representativeness is determined by comparing the quality control data for these samples against othe r data for similar samples analyzed at the same time. 3.2.1.4 Completeness Completeness is a measure of the amount of inform ation that must be collected during the field investigation to allow for succe ssful achievement of the object ives. An adequate amount and type of data must be collected for conclusion s to be useable. Mi ssing data may reduce the precision of estimates or introduce bias, thus lo wering the confidence level of the conclusions. While completeness has been historically presented as a percentage of the data that is considered useable, this does not take into account critical samp le locations or critical analytical parameters. The amount and type of data that may be lost due to sampling or analytical error cannot be predicted or evaluated in advance. The importance of any lost or suspect data will be evaluated in terms of the sample location, analytical parame ter, nature of the problem, decision to be made, and the consequence of an erroneous decision. Crit ical locations or parameters for which data is determined to be inadequate will either be re -sampled and reanalyzed or the data will be appropriately qualified based on the decision of the Project Officer. The completeness goal percentage of useable data is set at 90% for the Colonie GW LTM Program. Completeness will be inferred from records revi ew and data validation. Sampling completeness is assessed through evaluation of the total number of samples proposed for collection versus the actual number of samples collect ed and analyzed. Analytical completeness is assessed by comparing the number of useable data points collected to the total number of data points generated. For the purposes of the LTM, un-useable data will be defined to include rejected data points (\"R\" qualifier). Those data points determin ed to be resultant due to blank contamination will be considered as \"non-detects\" (\"U\" qualifier). All other qualified data will be usable with qualifications as noted in Table 3-17 . The analytical completeness may be calculated on a parameter basis as well as an overall basis to pinpoint any usability issues based upon the resulting data validation. Completeness is calculated using the following equations: % Sampling Completeness = Number of Actual Samples Collected Number of Proposed Samples % Analytical Completeness = Number of Useable Data Number of Requested Analyses Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-16 3.2.1.5 Comparability Comparability is a qualitative parameter expres sing the confidence with which one data set can be compared with another. Comparability will be controlled through the use of SOPs that have been developed to standardize the collecti on of measurements and samples and approved analytical technique with defined QC criteria. Consistent and proper calibration of equipment throughout the field exercises, as described in th is QAPP, will assist in the comparability of measurements. Field documentation will be used during this project to establish that protocols for sampling and measurement follow appropriate SOPs. Analytical results are comparable to results of other laboratories with the use of the following procedures/programs: instrument standards tra ceable to National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST), USEPA, or NYSDEC sources; the use of standard methodology; reporting results from similar matrices in consistent units; applying appropriate levels of quality control within the context of the laboratory quality assurance program; and pa rticipation in inter- laboratory studies to document laboratory performance. By using traceable standards and standard methods, the analytical results can be compared to other laborato ries operating similarly. The QA program documents internal performance and the inter-laboratory studies document performance compared to other laborato ries. Periodic laborator y proficiency studies are instituted as a means of monito ring intra-laboratory performance. 3.2.1.6 Sensitivity The term \"sensitivity\" is used broadly to describe the method detection limit (MDL), minimum detectable concentrations (MDCs), minimum de tectable activity (MDA), quantitation limit (QL), and method reporting limits (MRL) established to meet project-specifi c DQOs; and not limited to the definition which describes the capability of a method or instrument to discriminate between measurement responses. Methods are selected based upon their sensitivity, technological, and economical considerations while keeping the screening values and available methodology in mind and were sufficient in mee ting the given levels of concern (LOCs). Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-17 (MDC for radiol ogical) and MDLs (MDA for radiological) for each target analyte of interest and are compared at the onset of the project. The MDL or MDC is the minimum concentration of an analyte that can be measured and reported with a 99 percent confidence that the analyte is above zero and is identified from the analysis of a sample in a given matrix containing the analyte. MDLs are derived by the method as described in 40 code of federal regulations (CFR) Chapter 136 Appendix B. The laboratory has de veloped statistically derived MDLs below the established QLs. The MDL and MDA values differ and change periodically because each is laboratory, inst rument, analyst, matrix, and method (sample volumes, dilutions, counts, etc.) specific. In so me cases for the chemical analyses, the more conservative MDLs are reported by the lab for each analyte for the chemical parameters. The QLs are the values at which the laboratory has dem onstrated the ability to reliably quantitate the target value of an analyte for the method perf ormed and are based upon the lowest calibration standard used for the initial calibration curve or the lowest verification standard performed. The QLs must be at least 3 times the MDL. Table 3-3 lists the QLs to be used for this long-term monitoring and MNA scope. The LOCs desire d for this project dictate the sensitivity requirements and are listed as well. The co nditions for supporting na tural attenuation for chlorinated solvents are presented in Table 3-4 . The laboratory uses a MRL and MDC to repor t non-detects for each sample. The MRL and MDC are terms to express a sample quantitation li mit. The reporting limit is the threshold value below which the laboratory reports non-detected values as \"U,\" \"ND,\" or \"<\" and will vary for each sample based upon dilutions, sample volumes, percent moistures (for solids), and the method performed. For chemical parameters, any MRL must be at least three times the MDL to be reliable. Data is sometimes calculated over a linear range. The highest concentrati on of the standards is truncated until linearity is achieved (minimum of three concentration levels must remain). The resulting highest concentration within the linea r range represents the upper quantitation limit. Each target compound for every sa mple was reported at a specific level. The target analytes detected above the MDL or MDA, but less than the MRL, MDC, or 3 times the MDL (whichever is greater), are treated as estimated values \"J\". Target analytes de tected above the upper calibration standard are diluted and analyzed within establishe d calibration windows. The units for aqueous samples may be expressed as 1) parts per million (ppm) as milligrams per liter (mg/L); 2) parts per billion (ppb) as micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L) or; 3) picocuries per liter (pCi/L), depending upon the analysis performed.

The VOC target list trans-1,2-DCE, 1,1-DCE, and VC. The radionuclide analysis includes gross alpha and gross beta (total and dissolve d), combined radium (226+228) (total and dissolved), and total uranium (tot al and dissolved). The MNA anal ysis to be performed includes, methane, ethene, ethane, sulfate, chloride, nitrat e, total organic carbon, ferrous iron (in field), and soluble manganese (in field). The ferrous iron and soluble ma nganese are to be performed in Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-27 the field using Hach kits and the remaining natural attenuation parameters are to be performed by the off-site laboratory. The off-site analytical preparatory and determin ative methods, analyte lists, project MQLs, and screening values to be performe d for Colonie LTM are provided on Table 3-3 . All samples will be performed following the method requi rements as outlined in the cited USEPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Test Methods fo r Evaluating Solid Waste Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846), Update IV (USEPA, 2007), USEPA EMSL Prescribed Procedures for Measurement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water (USEPA, 1980), Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes (USEPA, 1983), and the DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009). When difficult matrices are present or uncom mon analytes requeste d, the laboratory may perform required and appropriate modifications. SOPs for methods and any modifications used on this project must be submitted to Shaw prior to sample analysis. The laboratory must meet all of the USEPA and DOD QSM QC crit eria cited above as well as the project specific criteria as noted in Section 3.6 . 3.5.1 Volatile Organic Compounds Samples will be analyzed for the select VOCs using USEPA SW-846 Method 5030B/8260B for aqueous samples using purge and trap technol ogy. Aqueous samples will be sent to the laboratory in zero headspace vials. An inert gas is bubbled through a 25 milliliters (mL) aqueous sample contained at ambient temperature. Th e vapor is swept through a sorbent column where the purgeable compounds were trapped. After purg ing is completed for the aqueous samples, the sorbent column is heated and b ack flushed with the inert gas to desorb the purgeable compounds onto a gas chromatograph programmed to separa te the purgeable compounds, which are then detected with a mass spectrometer. The gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) instrument is calibrated for a series of targ et analytes using chem ical standards of known concentration and purity. Quantific ation of these target analytes is performed against specific internal standards as identified in the respective method. Identification of these target analytes is based on a comparison of the analyte to the chemi cal standards used durin g calibration based on the analyte's retention time and mass spectra. 3.5.2 Lead (Total and Dissolved) Lead is analyzed using inductivel y coupled plasma (ICP) technique . Samples for dissolved lead are to be filtered by the laboratory with a 0.45 micron filter prior to acidification. Lead is analyzed for aqueous samples using USEPA SW-846 Method 3010A/6010B. The lab may use the hot block digestion in order to get lower de tection limits as well as reducing contamination Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-28 issues that occur from hot plate or microwav e digestion procedures. The ICP method involves the simultaneous or sequential multi-element assessment of trace elements in solution. The basis of the method is the measurement of atomic emission by optical spectrometry. Samples are nebulized and the aerosol that was produced was transported to the plasma torch where excitation occurs. Characteristic atomic-line em ission spectra are produced by a radio-frequency ICP. A background correction technique is util ized to compensate for variable background contribution for the assessment of trace elements. 3.5.3 Gross Alpha and Gross Beta (Total and Dissolved) Samples will be analyzed fo r Gross Alpha and Gross Beta by USEPA Method 900.0. Samples for dissolved Gross Alpha and Gross Beta are to be filtered by the labor atory with a 0.45 micron filter prior to acidification. An al iquot of a preserved sample is evaporated to a small volume and transferred quantitatively to a tarred 2-in. stainl ess steel counting planchet. The sample residue is dried to constant weight, reweighed to determin e dry residue weight, and then counted for alpha and/or beta radioactivity . Counting efficiencies for both alpha and beta particle activities are selected according to the amount of sample soli ds from counting efficiency vs. sample solids standard curves. 3.5.4 Combined Radium 226 + 228 (Total and Dissolved) Samples will be analyzed for combined radium through the addition of radium 226 and radium 228 isotopes together. Samples for dissolved combined radium are to be filtered by the laboratory with a 0.45 micron filt er prior to acidification. Samples will be analyzed for Radium 226 by USEPA Method 903.0 Mod. The radium in the sample is collected by co-precipitation with barium and lead sulf ate and purified by re- precipitation from EDTA solution. Citric acid is added to the water sample to assure that complete interchange occurs before the first precipitation step. The final BaSO4 precipitate, which includes radium-226, radium-224, and radium -223, is alpha counted to determine the total disintegration rate of the radium isotopes. The radium activities are counted in an alpha counter where efficiency for determining radium-226 ha s been calibrated with a standard of known radium-226 activity. By making a correction for th e in-growth of alpha activity in radium-226 for the elapsed time after separation, one can de termine radium activity in the sample. Because some daughter in-growth can occur before the se parated radium is counted, it is necessary to make activity corrections for the count rate. Samples will be analyzed for Radium 228 by USEPA Method 904 Mod. The radium in the sample is collected by co-precipitation with barium and lead sulf ate and purified by re- precipitation from EDTA soluti on. After a 36-hr in-growth of actinium-228 the actinium-228 is carried on yttrium oxalate , purified and counted for beta activity. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-29 3.5.5 Uranium (Total and Dissolved) Total uranium will be analyzed using inductive ly coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP/MS) using USEPA SW-846 Methods 3010A (Mod.)/6020 for aqueous samples. Samples for dissolved uranium are to be filtered by the laboratory with a 0.45 micron filter prior to acidification. The modifications to the preparatory methods for th e ICP/MS analysis include the use of a hot block digestion step. The lab may us e the hot block digestion in order to get lower detection limits as well as reducing contamin ation issues that may occur from hot plate or microwave digestion procedures. The ICP/MS method involves the simultaneous or sequential multi-element assessment of trace elements in solution. The basis of the method is the measurement of atomic emission by optical spectr ometry. Samples are nebulized and the aerosol that was produced was transported to the plasma torch where excitation occurs. Characteristic atomic-line emission spectra are produced by a radio-frequency ICP. A background correction technique is utilized to compensate for variab le background contribution for the assessment of trace elements. Identification of uranium is based on the analyte's retention time and mass spectra. 3.5.6 Ethene, Methane, and Ethane Samples will be analyzed for ethene, methan e, and ethane using USEPA Method 3810/RSK 175. This method uses a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. An inert gas is bubbled through a 25 mL sample contained in a specifically designed purging chamber at ambient temperature. The va por is swept through a sorbent column where the purgeable compounds are trapped. After purging is completed for aqueous samples, the sorbent column is heated and back flushed with the inert gas to desorb th e purgeable compounds onto a gas chromatography programmed to separate the purg eable compounds that are then detected with the thermal conductivity detector. 3.5.7 Total Organic Carbon Samples will be analyzed for Total Organi c Carbon (TOC) using USEPA SW-846 Method 9060A. Aqueous samples are subjected to either a catalytic combustion or wet chemical oxidation to convert the organic carbon in the sample to car bon dioxide. The carbon dioxide formed is then measured directly by an infrared detector or converted to methane and measured by a flame ionization detector. The amount of ca rbon dioxide or methane produced is directly proportional to the concentrati on of carbonaceous material. 3.5.8 Chloride, Sulfate, and Nitrate Aqueous samples will be analyzed for chloride, sulfate, and nitrate using ion chromatography method USEPA 300. The anions of interest are se parated on the basis of their relative affinities for a low capacity, strong basic anion exchange r when they are converted to their highly Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project 3-30 conductive acid forms and meas ured by conductivity on the basis of retention times. Concentrations are determined from a linear curv e for each anion based on peak height or area under each peak produced. 3.6 On-Site Analytical Procedures The chemical analysis to be performed on-site includes ferrous iron a nd soluble manganese. Ferrous iron and soluble manganese are to be performed in the field using Hach kits and the remaining natural attenuation parameters are to be performed by the o ff-site laboratory as described in the prior section. 3.6.1 Ferrous Iron (Field Test Kit) Samples will be analyzed in the field for fe rrous iron using Hach method 8146. This procedure is a colorimetric determination. The 1,10-phena nthroline indicator in Ferrous Iron Reagent reacts with ferrous iron in the sample to form an orange color in proportion to the iron concentration. Ferric iron doe s not react. The ferric iron (F e3+) concentration can be determined by subtracting the ferrous iron concen tration from the results of a total iron test. A chelation occurs produci ng an orange-red color. 3.6.2 Soluble Manganese (Field Test Kit) Samples will be analyzed for soluble ma nganese using Hach method 8149. The 1-(2- Pyridylazo)-2-Naphthol (PAN) method is a highly sensitive and rapid procedure for detecting low levels of manganese. An ascorbic acid reagen t is used initially to reduce all oxidized forms of manganese to Mn2+. An alkaline-cyanid e reagent is added to mask any potential interferences. PAN Indicat or is then added to combine with th e Mn2+ to form an orange-colored complex. 3.7 Calibration Procedures 3.7.1 Field Equipment Calibration Field equipment that may be used during collection of environmenta l samples at the site includes the Horiba U-10 Water Quality Checker or equiva lent, a photoionization detector (PID) equipped with an 10.6 eV lamp, an MSA Passport combustible gas indicator or equivalent, and an MIE personal DataRAM (pDR) or equivalent (to measure r eal-time concentrations of airborne particulates). Field QC check control limits (pH, conductivit y, and turbidity) for th e Horiba U-10 Water Quality Checker are outlined below. In addition, field determinations of pH, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and oxidation/reduction potent ial are obtained in Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-31 duplicate once for every 20 aqueous samples collect ed. Water quality parameters are considered to be stable for sample collection for when there are three consecutive readings as defined as follows: pH \u00b1 0.2 units Temperature \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C Turbidity \u00b1 10 percent or 5 NTUs, whichever is greater Specific conductivity \u00b1 3 percent of reading Dissolved oxygen \u00b1 10 percen t of reading or 0.2 mg/L, whichever is greater Redox Potential (ORP or Eh) \u00b1 20 mV 3.7.1.1 Horiba (or equivalent) The Horiba (or equivalent) will be calibrated upon arrival to the site and daily while in the field. The calibration of pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and reduction oxidation potential will include a daily initial measurement prior to calibration, a measurement after calibration, and measurement at the end of the day. Measurements will be documented in the field logbook or on a separate calibration log form by the fi eld personnel performing the calibration. pH: If the pH QC sample (pH 7.0 or pH 10.0 buffer after initial automatic calibration with pH 4.0 buffer) exceeds \u00b10.5 pH units from the true value, the so urce of the error is determined and the instrument re-calibrate d. If a continuing calibration check with pH 7.0 buffer is off by \u00b10.5 pH unit, the instrument is re-calibrated. Conductivity: QC samples must be within \u00b110% of the true values. The true value for conductivity in the auto matic calibration solution is 4,490 umhos/cm. 3.7.1.2 Turbidity Meter The turbidity meter will be calibra ted upon arrival and departure of th e site and daily while in the field. The calibration of the turbidity meters w ill include a daily initial measurement prior to calibration, a measurement after calibration, and measurement at the end of the day. Measurements will be documented in the field logbook or on a separate calibration log form by the field personnel performing the calibration. QC samples must be within \u00b110% of the true values. Turbidity QC samples are commercially prepared polymer standards such as those available from Advanced Polyme r System, Inc. or equivalent. 3.7.1.3 Other Field Equipment The PID, Passport and pDR are each calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions at the beginning of the day, whenever the instrument is turned off for more than two hours, and at the discretion of the Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO). The Hach test kit calibration and Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-32 maintenance procedures for ferrous iron and solu ble manganese may be found in the field SOPs located in Appendix C 3.7.1.4 Field Equipment Maintenance Prior to field sampling events, each piece of fi eld equipment is inspected to ensure it is operational. If necessary, the equipment is servi ced. Meters that require charged batteries are fully charged or have fresh batteries. Due to Shaw's relationship with a number of firms that rent instrumentation and safety and sampling equipment, signifi cant downtime shoul d not occur. In addition to this, key spare parts and equipm ent are available on-site to prevent downtime. The proper calibration and documenta tion of field equipment are desi gned to assure that the field equipment is functioning optimally. Equipmen t logbooks are required to record usage, maintenance, calibration, and repair. Further deta ils as to field calibra tions and equipment use may be found in Shaw's field SOPs located in Appendix C . 3.7.2 Laboratory Calibration Prior to sample analysis, chemical calibrati on of each target analyte/compound must be performed to ensure analytical instrumentation is functioning within the established sensitivity range. Laboratory calibration steps include th e performing of solution validation, initial calibration, daily calib ration, and continuing calibration proc edures. Protocols defining the QC procedures, rounding rules, correct ive actions, and QC measurements for instrument calibration should be done in accordance with criteria spec ified in the analytical method, laboratory QA plan, and the prime contractor's SOPs. The units and QLs for the analytical methods to be used are found on Table 3-3 . The QA/QC method calibration requirements may be found in Tables 3-7 through 3-13 .

The intended use of the data and the as sociated acceptance criter ia for data quality will be determined before the data collection effo rt begins. Reported data will include, when appropriate, statements of precision, accuracy, re presentativeness, completeness, comparability, and sensitivity. Data processing procedures wi ll be documented, review ed, and revised by the QC Manager, as required to meet USEPA data quality requirements. The laboratory QA Manager will be responsible for data processing at the contract laboratory. 3.9.1 Lab Data Collection Data are initially collected, converted to standa rd reporting units and recorded by the laboratory chemist. The laboratory chemist conducts prelimin ary data analyses using a variety of methods and procedures. Because many analytical instruments are microprocessor controlled, some of the requisite analyses can be performed directly in the instrument's operating or outputting mode. Those instruments interfaced to stand-alone co mputers or microprocessors often permit data analysis programs to be written and modified to produce data formats sp ecifically suited to end user requirements. Data requiring manual r ecording, integration, and/or analysis may be converted to a more appropriate format prior to subsequent an alyses. Through all stages and aspects of data processing, the data are double-check ed for translation or tr anscription errors and are initialed by both the recorder and the ch ecker. The laboratory QA Manager or other designated individual not directly involved in the analysis re views the data for acceptability. 3.9.2 Lab Data Reduction Data reduction frequently includes computation of analytical resu lts from raw instrument data and summary statistics, including standard errors, confid ence intervals, test of hypotheses relative to the parameters, and model valida tion. Data reduction procedures address the reliability of computations and the overall accu racy of the data reduction. The numerical transformation algorithms used for data reduction will be verified against a known problem set to ensure that the reducti on methods are correct. The equati ons and the typical calculation sequence that should be followed to reduce the data to the acceptable format are instrument and method-specific. Where standard methods are modified, data reduction techniques will be described in a report accompanying the data. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 FUSRAP Final 3-45 3.9.3 Data Validation Data validation is the process whereby data ar e determined to be of acceptable or unacceptable quality based on a set of predefined criteria by Shaw. These criteria depend upon the type(s) of data involved and the purpose for which data are collected. Data packages will be validated to ensure project compliance with specified analytical, QA, and data reduction procedures; data reporting requirements; and required accuracy, precision, and completeness criteria. All parameters of interest for the long-term monitoring samples will be fully validated for the Colonie LTM-. The monitored natural attenua tion will have a limited validated. Specific validation levels may be found in the DQOs tables in Section 3.1.1 . Data validation results will be reported with the final findings. Data will be validated using a combination of the following criteria: Project specific Work Plan, Rev 1. and/or QAPP criteria; DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environm ental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009); Method-specific criteria following USEPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846), Update IV (USEPA, 2007), Methods for Chemical Analys is of Water and Wastes (USEPA, 1983), and USEPA EMSL Prescribed Procedures for Measur ement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water (USEPA, 1980), and Subcontract Laboratory SOPs. Table 3-17 present the laboratory and the data validation qualifiers to be used for the Colonie LTM and are to be applied as applicable. The laboratory qualifiers are as per DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmenta l Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009) and the data validation qualifiers are consistent with the following USEPA, Region II, and multi-agency guidance (as applicable): USEPA Hazardous Waste Support Branch Validating Volatile Organic Compounds by Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometr y SW-846 Method 8260B, Revision 2 (SOP HW-24), (USEPA, 2008a), USEPA Contract Laboratory Program National Functional Guidelines for Superfund Organic Methods Data Review (USEPA, 2008b), USEPA, aboratory Analytical Protocols Manual, Chapter 8 (July 2004), USEPA Region II Evaluation of Metals Data for the Contract Laborator y Program, Revision 13 (SOP HW-2, September, 2006), and USEPA Contract Laboratory Program Functi onal Guidelines for Inorganic Data Review (February, 2004). Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 3-46 Table and Data Validation Qualifiers Qualifier Definition Laboratory Qualifiers1 U Undetected at the limit of detection: Th e associated data value is the limit of detection, adjusted by any dilution factor used in the analysis. J Estimated: The analyte was positively identified; the quantitation is an estimation. B Blank contamination: The analyte wa s detected above one-half the reporting limit in an associated blank. N Non-target analyte: The analyte is a tentatively identified compound (using mass spectroscopy). Q One or more quality control criteria failed. USEPA Data Validation Qualifiers2 U The analyte was analyzed for, but wa s not detected above the level of the reported sample quantitation limit due to blank contamination. J The positive result is an estimated quantity. The associated numerical value is the appropriate concentration of the analyte in the sample. J+ The result is an estimated quantity, but the result may be biased high. J- The result is an estimated quantity, but the result may be biased low. N The analysis indicates the present of an analyte for which there is presumptive evidence to make a \"tentative identification\". NJ The analysis indicates the presence of an analyte that has been \"tentatively identified\" and the associated numeri cal value represents its approximate concentration. R The data are unusable. The sample results are rejected due to serious deficiencies in the ability to analyze the sample and meeting the Quality Control criteria. The analyte may or may not be present in the sample. UJ The analyte was analyzed for, but was not detected above the reported sample quantitation limit. The reported quantitation limit is approximate and may be inaccurate or imprecise. 1 The noted laboratory qualifiers are a minimum. If a laboratory has more and they are consistent with DoD and properly defined, the laboratory may use them. Data qualifiers may be combined when appropriate. Ref.: DoD Quality Systems Manual for Environmental Laboratories, Final Version 4.1 (DoD, 2009). 2 The USEPA data validation qualifiers are compilation from USEPA Hazardous Waste Support Branch Validating Volatile Organic Compounds by Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometr y SW-846 2008a), USEPA Contract Laborator y Program National Functional Guidelines fo r Superfund Organic Methods Data Review (U SEPA, 2008b), USEPA, USDOD , USDOE, USNRC, et al., Multi-Agency Radiological Laboratory A nalytical Protocols Manual, Chapter 8 (J uly 2004), USEPA Region II Evaluation of Met als Data for the Contract Laboratory Program, Revision 13 (SOP HW-2, Se ptember, 2006), and USEPA Contract Laboratory Program Functional Guidelines for Inorganic Data Review (February, 2004). Data generated requiring limited validation effort (see Table 3-2 ) will be performed to assess laboratory performance, including a review of: completeness, ch ain-of-custody, holding times, QC results reported on summary forms (LCS, Me thod blanks, MS/MSD, and equipment blank), detection and reporting limits, and other contractua l items. Data generated requiring full level data validation (see Table 3-2 ) will be assessed for accuracy, precision, comparability, representativeness, completeness, and sensitivit y. Blank contamination assessment is discussed in the Section 3.9.4 . The subcontract laboratory will provide an Excel spreadsheets and/or Access databases (or equivalent) which will be used by Shaw to assist in the hardcopy validation of the following elements as applicable: Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-47 Holding Times Blank Analysis; Initial Calibration; and Matrix Spike Duplicate Recoveries; Laboratory Sample Duplicate; Field Duplicate Sample Analysis; Laboratory Control Samples and Quantitation Verification. For the purposes of the LTM, un-useable data will be defined to include rejected data points (\"R\" qualifier). Those data points determined to be resultant due to blank contamination will be considered as \"non-detects\" (\"U\" qualifier). All other qualified data will be usable with qualifications as noted in Table 3-17 . 3.9.4 Blank Contamination Assessment Blank contamination assessment will be performed for the chemical and radiological analysis to determine the impact of field sampling and labora tory analysis environments on data quality. Field and laboratory QC blank data will be reviewed in accordance with fore-mentioned validation guidance and the USEPA Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund Volume I Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part A) (USEPA, 1989) as part of the fu ll validation efforts. Method blanks, calibration blanks, trip blanks, and rinse blanks (if required) will be evaluated for the groundwater samples collected under this QAPP in accordance with the project specified DQOs. This includes all parameters of interest for the long-term monitoring samples. After data qualification, any flagged data will be evaluated against the USEPA Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund Volume I Human Hea lth Evaluation Manual (Part A) (USEPA, 1989) for usability. From a data usability standpoint, samp les found due to blank contamination will be considered non-detect at the reporting limit or le vel of contamination (whichever is higher) due to the probability that concentrations are from an external laboratory and/or field contamination and not necessarily indicative at the site. This is consistent with USEPA guidance and previous blank assessments conducted. Labor atory and field blanks will be collected and pr ocessed at the frequencies specified in Tables 3-14, 3-15, and 3-16 . Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-48 The criterion for the evaluation of blank contamin ation applies to any bla nk associated with the samples, and states that no contamination should be in the blank. If cont amination is detected, data associated with the blank wi ll be carefully evaluated to dete rmine if there is an inherent variability in the data for the lot, or if the pr oblem is an isolated o ccurrence not affecting all samples in the lot. The Shaw PM will make project decisions (use qualified data, resample, reanalyze) based upon the analytical limitations of the data. The following criteria apply for blank assessment for where blank co ntamination qualification applies: Radiological and Inorganic: Any detected analyte in the enviro nmental sample at less than five times the concentration in the associated blank will be qualified \"U.\" Organic : The sample result is qualified \"U,\" when the compound concentration is greater than the reporting limit but less than five times the amount in the blank. For common laboratory contaminants, the concentration level is ten times the amount in any blank (i.e., methylene chloride , acetone, toluene, cyclohexane, and 2-butanone). Action levels for groundwater samples will be ba sed upon a 1x dilution factor and adjusted for each sample as appropriate. In cases where more than one blank is associated with a given sample, qualification will be based upon a compar ison with the associated blank having the highest concentration of the contaminant. Bla nk qualification is part of the data validation process and the Shaw PM will assess da ta usefulness based on the project DQOs. 3.9.4.1 Rinse Blanks Rinse blanks will only be required when non-dedicat ed or re-usable sampling equipment is used. The integrity of decontamination events and sample cross-contamination will be evaluated by the rinse blank for all sampled parameters for the LTM if using non-dedicated or re-usable sampling equipment. If needed, a rinse blank will be coll ected at a frequency of five percent (1 per 20) of the total number of samples collected or per sampling event, whichever is greater per sampling technique. All target analyt es for the rinse blanks should be <\u00bd MRL (<MRL for cyclohe xane, and 2-butanone). The blank contamination assessment for rinse blanks will be performed to assess the impact of contaminant contributions origin ating from non-point sources, such as field sampling equipment decontamination procedures. Rinse blanks are intended to identify cross-contamination between samples as a result of sampling equipment decontamination procedures. Rinse blanks will be collected by pouring the required volume of de -ionized, organic-free water over the equipment and collecting the water in the appropriate sample containers. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-49 The rinse blank results are evaluated for the analyt es of concern to ascertain the efficiency of decontamination and assess the po tential for cross-contamination. The blank assessment for rinse blanks (if required) will be treated as described in Section 3.9.4 . 3.9.4.2 Trip Blanks The integrity of sample storage and transport an d sample cross-contamination will be evaluated by the trip blank for all aqueous VOC samples for the LTM. A trip blank will be included at a frequency of one per cooler of aqueous VOC samp les transported to the laboratory. All target analytes for the trip blanks should be <\u00bd MRL; cyclohexane, and 2-butanone. The blank contamination assessment for trip blanks will be performed to assess the impact of VOC contaminant contributions originating from non-point sources during sample storage and transport to the laboratory. The blank assessment for trip blanks will be treated as described in Section 3.9.4 . 3.9.4.3 Laboratory Blanks Method blanks will be used to determine th e potential contamination from the laboratory environment and analytical method used to process the sample. Me thod blanks will be processed at the beginning of each analytical run by the laboratory to determine whether the internal laboratory environment, reagents used duri ng analyses, analytical techniques, or the instrumentation system are sources of contaminati on that could affect the integrity of the sample. The method blank contamination assessment will be evaluated during the data validation process. A method blank is a volume of analyte- free water that is processed through the entire analytical scheme (i.e., extraction, digestion, concentration, and analysis) as with the actual samples. Method blanks are compared against the same matr ix environmental samples on a batch specific basis; therefore, no unit conversio ns were necessary for method bla nks since they were treated in the same manner as the samples. Calibration blanks will also compared against the environmental samples. Calibration blanks are aqueous samples and are reported in g/L or mg/L units. The blank assessment for laboratory blanks will be treat ed as described in Section 3.9.4 . 3.9.5 Data Reporting The contract laboratory will pr ovide electronic and ha rd copy chemistry data to Shaw. The hardcopy data is to be provided in CLP-like fo rmat (Shaw Level IV) to meet USEPA full data validation requirements necessary for risk assessment s. The standard electr onic data deliverable Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-50 (EDD) format for this project will also be pr ovided in an ASCII comma delimited format or an Excel spreadsheet format to facilitate th e data evaluation and validation processes. All non-detects will be reported as \"less than\" the reporting limit (<MDL for metals and <MDC for radiological) for each analyte. See Section 3.2.1.6 for further discussion on sensitivity. Any positive value below the MRL or MDC and a bove the MDL or MDA will be reported as estimated \"J\". In some cases, metals will be reported at the MDL level. Any positive value above the MDL must be reported for the method blanks. Values detected above the reporting limit will be reported as determined to no more than three significant figures. The units for aqueous samples may be expressed as 1) parts per million (ppm) as milligrams per liter (mg/L); 2) parts per billion (ppb) as micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L) or; 3) picocuries per liter (pCi/L), depending upon the analysis performed. Fo r radiological data expressed as pCi/L, the associated estimated 2 sigma error is to be reported for each result. 3.9.6 Data Management Data management will begin when the contractor tr ansmits a request for analytical services to the laboratory, stating the number, type, sample numbers, methods for analysis, and any other information necessary for the laboratory to analy ze and document a particular job. Data files of initial input information, sample IDs, parameters , dates, etc. will be established as sample containers and COC documentation are prepared for shipment from the field sampling team. Once the samples arrive at the laboratory, this information will be used to create a laboratory database for each sample delivery group (SDG). Status information (i.e., date sampled, date received, data extraction/analysis due dates, et c.) will form a part of the record. Supporting analytical based records will be generated and stored by the laboratory. This includes, as applicable, sample preparation and analysis info rmation logs, instrument logs, storage records, sample custody records, sample raw data reports, graphs, and chromatograms. From these records data, hard-copy deliverables will be generated from the labor atory to Shaw. Further data deliverable requirements may be found in the laboratory statemen t of work (SOW). Shaw will maintain the laboratory documentation until work assignment closeout, when records will be transferred to USACE. 3.9.7 Laboratory Turnaround Time The laboratory is required to meet the deliver able turnaround time (TAT) for the project as specified in the laboratory SOW. If for any reason the laboratory realizes that the TAT will not be met, Shaw must be notified of the affected samples, analysis , reason for lateness, and revised due dates prior to the original due date. The TAT starts from the time of receipt the samples at the laboratory. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-51 3.10 Corrective Action Procedures Corrective action will be initia ted through the development a nd implementation of routine internal QC checks. Specifi c limits beyond which corrective action is required will be established for each system. Corrective action requirements will be implemented in response to deficiencies encountered during system inspectio ns. A closed-loop corrective action system will be used to address system and data quality i ssues. Steps comprising a closed-loop corrective action system include: Defining the problem; Assigning responsibility for problem investigation; Investigating and determini ng the cause of the problem; Assigning responsibility for problem resolution; and Verifying that the resoluti on has corrected the problem. Documentation will be done on al l of the steps of the correctiv e action system, including the dates and parties involved. Such documentation w ill be reviewed during system inspections. Problems identified by assessment procedures will be resolved at the level it occurred with support from upper management. Problems that canno t be resolved at this level will be reported to the QC Manager for resolution, who will dete rmine at which management level the problem can best be resolved, and will notify the appropriate manager. Corrective actions will be categorized as either routine or non-routine and will require short-term or long-term action. Both types will require administrative coordination between the person initiating the corrective action and the QC staff. 3.10.1 Routine Corrective Action Work plans and SOPs will establish technical pro cedures and the associated QC requirements. Where possible, SOPs will include specific criter ia for determining the expected quality and examples of the appropriate corrective action proce dures that may be taken if the criteria are not met. Routine corrective action will involve eith er short-term action for sporadic problems or long-term action for more chronic problems. Corre ctive action initiated at the project level will be reported to the QC Manager to ensure corrective action is implemented and the problem is resolved. 3.10.2 Non-routine Corrective Action Activities that are not covered by a specific SOP require an iterative process whereby the systems and QC specifications are estimated prio r to the activity, and adjustments are made, as needed, during the course of th e activity. Documentation on th e corrective action requirements, Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-52 the assignment of responsibility for corrective action, due date s for completion of corrective action, and validation of completion will be main tained. Such documenta tion will be reviewed during system inspections. Problems identified by assessment procedures will be resolved at the level it occurred with support from upper management. Problems that canno t be resolved at this level will be reported to the QC Manager for resolution, who will dete rmine at which management level the problem can best be resolved, and will notify the appropriate manager. 3.10.3 Quality Improvement The Shaw Quality Improvement Process (QIP) comp rises the internal systems that evaluate our quality program's effectiveness in ensuring and continually impr oving the quality of our work. The primary goals of our QIP and the QC program defined in this document are to prevent non- conformances and facilitate cont inual process improvement. The Shaw QIP is based on problem prevention, resolution, and correc tive action. QIP goals include the timely identification and resolution of the quality problems in manner that minimizes their impact on work products and prevents their reoccurrence. To the extent that the first of these goals is not achieved, identified deficiencies or non-conformances are to be co rrected in a timely and cost-effective manner and with the intent of preventing their recurrence. This QC Plan includes provisions for preventing quality problems and facilita ting process improvements as well as for identifying, documenting, and tracking deficiencies until corrective action has been verified. Project staff is encouraged to provide recomm endations for improvements in established work processes and techniques. The intent is to id entify activities that are compliant but can be performed in a more efficient or cost-eff ective manner. Typical quality improvement recommendations include identifying an existi ng practice that should be improved (i.e., a bottleneck in production) and/or recommending an alternative practice that provides a benefit without compromising prescribed standards of qualit y. Project staff is enc ouraged to bring their recommendations to the attenti on of project management or th e QC staff through verbal or written means. Deviations from established pr otocols will not be implemented without prior written approval by the USACE Pr oject Manager and concurren ce of the Shaw Contractor Quality Control (CQC) Systems Manager. Prior to receipt of such approvals, the Shaw PM will determine whether the change requires a modifi cation to the Work Plan or a generation of a Project Procedure. If so, proposed changes to th e Work Plan and protocols will be evaluated and implemented in accordance with the process de scribed herein. Where a staff-initiated recommendation results in a tangible benefit to the project, acknowledgment will be given by the Shaw PM. Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-53 3.10.4 Problem Prevention The preventive action program is intended to id entify problems before they are adverse to quality. Inspections, self-assessmen ts, and peer review are exampl es of the tools that will be used by the project staff to identify potential quality problems. Input regarding project operations will be regularly sought from clients, subcontractors, and staff. The Project Manager will foster a no-fault attitude for problem identification, and st aff is encouraged to identify process improvement opportunities, problems, and solutions. While the en tire QC program is directed towards problem prevention, certain elem ents of the program have greater potential to be pro-active. The primary tools for problem prev ention on this project and the specific sections of this QAPP where they are addressed include : a project organization, instrument calibration, preventive maintenance, and QC data checks and inspections. Should thes e preventive measures fail, tracking and communicating deficiencies provides a mechanism for preventing their recurrence. 3.10.5 Stop Work Protocols All Shaw personnel have the auth ority to issue a stop work orde r. A stop work order will be issued under conditions when the quality of work jeopardizes the attainment of the project objectives. A stop work order must not create an operational, safety, public health, or environmental hazard. Under a stop work order, work may not be conducted within affected activities until the responsible manager acknowle dges the implementation of a corrective action in accordance with the resolution criteria of the order. Immediate notification of work stoppage must be made to the PM, SSHO, QA Manager, CQC System Manager and Program Manager. Proper notification will also be made to the USACE. 3.10.6 Deficiency Identification, R esolution, and Documentation Deficiency identification and resolution are primar y responsibilities of th e operational staff (both Shaw and its subcontractors) and the PM. In th e interest of timeliness of corrective actions, a Corrective Action Request (CAR) ca n occur by any member of the project staff, whether a Shaw or subcontractor employee. De ficiencies are to be documente d using CARs and the Daily QC Report. If the individual recommending a CAR is also responsible for correcting the problem, then he or she should do so and document the results. Otherwise, the CAR will be forwarded to the Shaw QC Specialist and the Shaw PM, who will then be responsi ble for evaluating the validity of the request, formulating a resolution and prevention strategy, assigning personnel and resources, and specifying and enforcing a sche dule for corrective actions. Once a corrective action has been completed, the CAR and supporting information are to be forwarded to the QC Specialist and/or the CQC Systems Manager for clos ure. An example of a Shaw CAR format is provided as Table 3-18 . Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-54 While deficiency identification and resolution o ccurs primarily at the operational level, QC inspections of data, field reco rds, and procedures provide a backup mechanism to address problems that either are not identified or canno t be resolved at the operational level. Through implementation of an inspection program, the fi eld and QC staff are responsible for verifying that deficiencies are identified, documented as prescribed herein, and corrected in a timely manner. Deficiencies identified by either pr oject or QC staff are to be corrected by the operational staff and docum ented by the QC staff. In addition to observing actual work operations, th e QC staff is responsible for reviewing CARs during follow-up QC inspections. The purpose of th ese reviews are to verify whether established protocols are being implemented properly an d corrective action commitments are met; to determine whether corrective actions are effectiv e in resolving problems, to identify trends within and among similar work units ; and to facilitate system r oot cause analysis of larger problems. Particular attention will be given by th e QC Specialist or designee to work units that generate either an unusually large or unusua lly small number of CARs. The CQC Systems Manager and his staff have full authority to stop work for unresolved quality deficiencies. Problems that cannot be resolved at this level are documented by the QC Specialist or designee. Minor deficiencies that are identified during a QC inspection but which can be readily corrected and verified in the field are to be documented in the Daily QC Report. Deficiencies identified in a QC inspection but that cannot be readily corrected are to be documented by the QC Specialist or designee on a CAR and in the Daily QC Report. Copies of CARs are to be referenced in and attached to the Daily QC Report. 3.10.7 Reports The QC Specialist will report to the Shaw PM and CQC Systems Manager regarding QC activities on-site. The Daily QC report is the main tool of the QC Specialist for evaluating field reconnaissance activit ies. A field logbook will also be main tained. The weekly QC report will contain information on the total number of man-hours worked, lost-time accidents, and the amount of time lost to accidents. The daily and weekly QC reports will be submitted to the Shaw PM no later than the next working day. 3.11 Quality Assessments This section discusses the inspec tion program used to monitor the total measurement system and to evaluate the quality of operation in the field and at the laboratory. A performance inspection is a planned independent check of the operation of a system to obtain a quantitative measure of the quality of data generated, a nd involves the use of standard reference samples or materials which are certified as to their chemical com position or physical charac teristics. Systems Section 3 Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-55 inspection is of a qualitative nature and consists of on-site review of a system's QA system and physical facilities for sampling/anal ysis, calibration, and measurement. 3.11.1 Document Review Project plans will be reviewed and approved prior to implementation. The PM and QC Manager will provide a qualitative self-evaluation for es tablishing whether the prevailing management structure, polices, practices, and procedures are adequate to ensuring that the results needed are obtained. The PM will provide an independent qualitative eval uation of a particular program operation and/or organization to es tablish whether the prevailing ma nagement structure, policies, practices, and procedures are adequate for en suring that the results needed are obtained.

The program includes a numerical document control system, document inve ntory procedure, and a central filing system with a designated person(s) responsible for its maintenance. Documents used or generated during the course of the projec t are accounted for and become a part of the project files upon completion of the task. These may include but are not limited to the following: Project Deliverables; Investigation Requirements; Reports and correspondence material; and Contract Documents. 3.11.3 Field System Audits Field system audits of site activities may be performed at the disc retion of the Shaw QC Manager. The Shaw technical audi t team would perform an inspection of all field site activities. If elected to be performed, the audit team will compare current field practices with procedures outlined in the project work plans (i.e., Work Plan, QAPP). The following elements would be evaluated during LTM- ac tivities at Colonie: Overall level of organiza tion and professionalism; Project activities; Document control and management; Level of QC conducted per each field team; and Task specific activities. After audit completion, deficiencies would be disc ussed with the field staff and corrections will be identified. If any of these deficiencies could affect the data integrity, the audit team will inform the Project Manager so corrections can be implemented immediately. Corrective action procedures are outlined in Section 3.10 . 3.11.4 Daily QC Reports The field operations are to be implem ented through the following basic elements: Correction of deficiencies id entified and documented prior and during field operations and meetings; Ongoing evaluation of field operatio ns by the CQC Representative to ensure compliance with the established protocols, requirements, and DQOs of the field sampling program; and Section 3Quality Assurance Project Plan W912DR-05-D-0026 Quality Assurance Project Plan; Rev1 Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Project August 2010 Final 3-58 Ongoing audits of field and labor atory operations (if performed) to provide an independent assessment of compliance with es tablished protocols and DQOs. In order to ensure that all elements are eval uated, Daily Quality Control Reports (DQCRs) are completed. These reports may include the general areas of field sampling a nd off-site laboratory operations. The components as they occu r for the DQCR will include the following: Summary of sampling events; The sampling task manager and associated sampling personnel for the sampling event; Sampling summary to include associated field QC samples; Summary of COCs generated with copies attached; Summary of Phase Checklists (if applicable) (Pre-Field Operati ons, Preparatory, Initial, and Follow-up) generated with cross-referen ce to the associated sampling event; Summary of Corrective Action Report s issued with copies attached; Summary of all audit reports completed with copies attached; Notification of revisions to field sampling SOPs; Notification of revisions to analytical SOPs; Laboratory sample status with a summary form for the status of in house samples attached; Health and Safety status including violations , corrective instructions given, and corrective actions taken; Communication summary (primarily between th e client, NYDEC, USACE, and Shaw) which would have a impact on existing protocols, SOPs, or DQOs; and Documentation of conflicts on-site with respect to interpretation of protocols and specifications as well as action taken. Figure 3-1 presents a basic example template for the DQCR that would be submitted for operations involving the LTM.

If data-collection forms are in use, the information on the form need not be duplicated in the field logbook. However, any forms used to record site information must be referenced in the field logbook. \u0083 Information must be factual and unbiased. \u0083 Do not start a new page until the previous one is full or has been marked with a single diagonal line so that additional entries cannot be made. Use both sides of each page. \u0083 Write in black or dark blue indelible ink. \u0083 Do not erase, scribble over, or blot out any entry. Do not use White-Out or like correction items. Before an entry has been signed and dated, changes may be made; however, care must be taken not to obliterate what was written originally. Indicate any deletion by a single line through the material to be deleted. Any change shall be init ialed and dated. Error codes (Attachment 1) should be added to the end of the deleted entry . All error codes should be circled. \u0083 Do not remove any pages from the book. \u0083 Do not use loose paper and copy into the field logbook later. \u0083 Record sufficient information to completely document field activities and all significant details/events applicable to the project/task(s) covered by the logbook. \u0083 All entries should be neat and legible. Specific requirements for field l ogbook entries include the following: \u0083 Initial and date each page. \u0083 Sign and date the final page of entries for each day. \u0083 Initial, date, and if used, code all changes properly. \u0083 Draw a diagonal line through the remainder of the final page at the end of the day. \u0083 Record the following information on a daily basis: a) Date and time b) Name of individual making entry c) Detailed description of activity being conduc ted including well, boring, sampling, location number as appropriate d) Unusual site conditions e) Weather conditions (i.e., temperature, cloud co ver, precipitation, wi nd direction and speed) and other pertinent data f) Sample pickup (chain-of-custody form numbers, carrier, time) g) Sampling activities/sample log sheet numbers h) Start and completion of borehole/trench/monitoring well installation or sampling activity Procedure No. EI-FS001 Revision No. 1 Date of Revision 9/8/06 Page 4 of 5 This document contains proprietary information of Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure Inc. Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure , Inc. retains all rights associated with theses ma terials, which may not be reproduced wi thout express written permission of the comp any. i) Health and Safety issues, such as PPE upgrades, monitoring results, near-misses, and incidents associated with the logbook areas j) Instrumentation calibration details Entries into the field logbook shall be preceded with t he time of the observation. The time should be recorded frequently and at the point of events or meas urements that are critical to the activity being logged. All measurements made and samples collected must be recorded unless they are documented by automatic methods (e.g., data logge r) or on a separate form required by an operating procedure. In such cases, the field logbook must reference the automatic data record or form. While sampling, make sure to record observations such as color and odor. Indicate the locations from which samples are being taken, sample identification numbers, the order of filling bottles, sample volumes, and parameters to be analyzed. If field duplicate samples are being collected, note the duplicate pair sample identification numbers. If samples are collected that will be used for matrix spike and/or matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate anal ysis, record that information in the field logbook. A sketch of the station location may be warranted. All maps or sketches made in the field logbook should have descriptions of the features shown and a direction indicator. There must be at least one fixed point with measurements on any map drawn. Maps and sketches should be oriented so that north is towards the top of the page. Other events and observations that should be recorded include (but are not limited to) the following: \u0083 Changes in weather that impact field activities \u0083 Visitors to the site associated with the covered task(s). Note their time of arrival and departure and provide a brief summary of their purpose on site. \u0083 Subcontractor activities applicable to the covered task(s) \u0083 Deviations from procedures outlined in any governing documents, including the reason for the deviation. Deviations from procedures must be accompanied with the proper authorization. \u0083 Significant events that may influence data, such as vehicles in the vicinity of VOC sampling efforts \u0083 Problems, downtime, or delays \u0083 Upgrade or downgrade of personal protective equipment 6.5 Post-Operation To guard against loss of data due to damage or disappearance of field logbooks, all original completed logbooks shall be securely stored by the project.

Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure , Inc. retains all rights associated with theses materials, which may not be reproduced without express written permission of the comp any. \u0083 The Sampler(s) names should be provided on the appropriate line. This line should include all persons whose initials appear on any of the sample containers, to provide the laboratory a means of cross-referencing containers. \u0083 The \"Send Report To\" information should be comp leted. If multiple reports/locations are needed, the information should be provided on a separate page included with the Chain of Custody documents. 6.4 Sample Information Section-Including on Continuation Page(s) During actual sampling, each sample must be enter ed on the COC form at the time of collection in order to document possession. The sampler mu st not wait until sampling is completed before entering samples on the COC. \u0083 Complete the Sample ID Number for each line. If there are multiple container types for a sample, use additional lines to indicate the needed information. \u0083 Ensure that the Sample Description matches the description on the sample label-the laboratory will use this inform ation for cross-referencing. \u0083 Provide the Collection Date and Time . These must match those on the sample label and Field Logbook/Logsheets. \u0083 Indicate whether the sample is a Grab or Composite sample. \u0083 Indicate the Matrix of the sample. Use the Matrix Codes listed on the Chain of Custody form. \u0083 Indicate the Number of Containers and the Container Type . If a sample has multiple container types, use multiple lines and cross-out the information spaces to the left of the container blocks. Failure to do this may cause the laboratory to log-in each container type as a separate sample/lab-ID, resulting in a confused report and invoice. - Alternatively, if each sample has the same number/type container types, use \"various\" in the Container Type block and provide detail in the Special Instructions section, e.g., \"Each sample consists of one 16-oz jar, two pre-weighed VOC w/DI water, and one pre- weighed VOC w/Methanol.\" \u0083 Check the appropriate Preservative box for each line/container type. \u0083 Write in and check the Analyses Requested boxes for each line/container type.

All corrections must be made using standard single-line cross-out methods, and the initials of the individual making the change must be included beside the corrected entry. \u0083 Each Custody Seal attached must be completed by writing the Date , at a minimum, and signing with full signature by the person responsible for the sealing of the sample. \u0083 If a space is provided, the Time should also be added. 6.2 Attaching the Custody Seals Whenever possible, custody seals should be attached over the sample container lids during actual sampling and not when the samples are packaged for shipment. This will provide confidence in legal custody and will demonstrate non-tampering during the sample collection process. Do not attach custody seals to VOC sample cont ainers, as contamination may occur. For these samples, the custody seal should be used to seal the folded plastic zip bag that holds the sample containers. \u0083 For sample jars, the completed Custody Seal sh ould be placed across the top of the lid with the edges below the lid/jar interface and attached to the jar material. This will require the visible breaking of the seal in order to open the container. \u0083 Sample coolers and shipping containers shoul d have Custody Seals attached in such a manner that the seal extends lengthwise from the top edge of the lid to the side of the cooler/container. 7.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Subject: Shipping and Packaging of Non Hazardous Samples 1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide general instructions in the packaging and shipping of non- hazardous samples. The primary use of this procedure is for the transportation of samples collected on site to be sent off site for physica l, chemical, and/or radiological analysis. 2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the shipping and packagi ng of all non-hazardous samples. Non-hazardous samples are those that do not meet any hazard class definitions found in 49 CFR 107-178, including materials designated as Class 9 materials and mate rials that represent Reportable Quantities (hazardous substances) and/or materi als that are not classified as Dangerous Goods under current IATA regulations. In general most soil, air, and aqueous samples, includi ng those that are acid or caustic preserved do not qualify as hazardous materials or dangerous goods . An exception is methanolic soil VOC vials: these containers are flammable in any quantity and must be packaged, shipped, and declared as Dangerous Goods whenever transported by air. The Class 9 \"Environmentally Hazardous\" designation should only be applied to samples if they are known or suspected (via screening) to contain a sufficient concentration of contaminant to pose a health and/ or environmental risk if spilled in transport. Samples for which screening has shown a potential hazard (i.e. flammability) or those that are derived from a known hazard, including a site/facility with confirmed contamination by an infectious substance must also be shipped in accordance with the applicable DOT/IATA requirements. Refer to Shaw E & I SOP FS013. Improper shipment of hazardous materials, espec ially willful misrepresentation and shipment as non- hazardous materials, is a violation of feder al law and is punishable by fines and possible imprisonment of the guilty parties. It is also a violation of Shaw E & I policy and can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 3.

PROCEDURE Two techniques are discussed below: the measur ing-tape method and the electronic method. 6.1 Equipment The following equipment should be used when measuring groundwater levels: \u0083 Decontaminated, weighted tape with graduations to 0.01 feet. The weight should be sufficient to ensure plumbness of the tape, but slender enough so as not to raise the water level significantly when submerged in the water. \u0083 Decontaminated, commercial electr onic water-level measuring device. \u0083 Engineer's rule, graduated to 0.01 feet. \u0083 Oil/water interface probe and meter. 6.2 Weighted Steel Tape The following procedure should be used when measuring groundwater levels with a measuring tape: 1. Unlock the well cover and remove the cap. 2. Locate the reference point on the riser pipe. 3. Don a pair of clean gloves. 4. Slowly lower the weighted tape down the we ll until the bottom is reached, indicated by a bump and sudden slack in the line. 5. Straighten the tape out, removing the slack, and measure the distance at the reference point. 6. Record the reading at the reference point as Depth to Bottom (DTB). 7. Withdraw the tape from the well and record the reading at the wet/dry interface as Depth to Water (DTW). 8. The difference between the two measurements is the depth of the water column (DWC). 9. Dry and decontaminate the wetted portion of the tape. 6.3 Electronic Measurement The following procedure should be used when measuring groundwater levels with an electronic water-level measuring device: 1. Check for proper instrument response by inse rting the probe in water. Fix or replace the instrument as needed. 2. Unlock the well cover and remove the cap. 3. Locate the reference point on the riser pipe.

Remove the probe from the well and decontaminate it. 6.4 Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids Oil or other light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) may be floating on the water in selected wells. If so, measure the LNAPL level and the wa ter level using an oil/water interface probe as follows: 1. Check for proper instrument response by insert ing the probe in water. Instruments typically indicate LNAPL with a steady indicator light and tone, while water is indicated by an intermittent light and tone. 2. Unlock the well cover and remove the cap. 3. Locate the reference point on the riser pipe. 4. Don a pair of clean gloves. 5. Slowly lower the oil/water interface probe down the well until the signal indicates that LNAPL has been contacted (typically a steady indicator light and tone). 6. Record the reading at the reference point as DTNAPL. 7. Continue lowering the probe until the signal indi cates that water has been contacted (typically an intermittent light and tone). 8. Record the reading at the reference point as DTW. 9. Determine the depth of LNAPL as (DTW-DTNAPL) and record it. 10. Withdraw the probe and repeat steps 5 & 6. Duplicate measurements should agree within 0.02 feet. If not, continue with measurements until 0.02 feet precision is achieved. 11. Lower the probe until the bottom of the well is reached, as indicated by slack in the line. 12. Pull slightly to remove the slack, measur e at the reference point, and record as DTB. 13.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Subject: Low Flow/Micro-Purge Well Sampling 1. PURPOSE This procedure is intended to provide method s for low-flow sampling of groundwater from monitoring wells. Low-flow or micro-purge sampling is a method of collecting samples from a well that does not require the removal of large volu mes of water from the well and therefore does not overly agitate the water and suspended particles or potentially aspirate VOCs. The method entails the removal of water directly from the screened interval without disturbing any stagnant water above the screen by pumping the well at low enough flow rates to maintain minimal drawdown of the water column followed by in-line sample collection. Typical flow rates for low- flow sampling range from 0.1 L/min to 0.5 L/ min depending on site characteristics. 2. SCOPE This procedure is applicable to all Shaw E & I projects where groundwater samples will be collected from a monitoring well using low- flow or micro-purge methods and where no project/program specific procedure is in use. 3.

Purging removes the stagnant groundwater from the column allowing the groundwater surrounding the well screen to enter the collection zone. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES 5.1 Procedure Responsibility The Field Sampling Discipline Lead is responsible for maintenance, management, and revision of this procedure. Questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this technical SOP should be directed to the Field Sampling Discipline Lead. 5.2 Project Responsibility Shaw employees performing this task, or any po rtion thereof, are responsible for meeting the requirements of this procedure and utilizing material s of a construction specified in the project plans or applicable to the contaminants of conc ern and other aspects of the sampling effort. These aspects may include well diameter, well construction materials, depth to water, and the presence of DNAPL or LNAPL contaminants. Shaw employees conducting technical review of task performance are also responsible for following appropriate portions of this SOP. For those projects where the activities of this SOP are conducted, the Project Manager, or designee, is responsible for ensuring that those ac tivities are conducted in accordance with this and other appropriate procedures. Project pa rticipants are responsible for documenting information in sufficient detail to provide objec tive documentation (checkprints, calculations, reports, etc.) that the requir ements of this SOP have been met. Such documentation shall be retained as project records. 6. PROCEDURE Low-flow/micro-purge sampling involves removing water directly from the screened interval without disturbing any stagnant water above the scr een or without lowering the water table. Since it is not based upon the removal of well volumes, it requires in-line monitoring of water quality parameters which may include pH, specific conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and redox potential to determine when the groundwater sample zone has stabilized. The sample is then collected using the same pump directly from the discharge tubing. 6.1 Considerations The following variables should be reviewed in planning for low-flow purging and sampling: \u0083 Recharge capacity of each well: The recharge capacity of a well will determine how fast the well should be purged. The purge rate should be no greater than the recharge rate of the groundwater zone to prevent water table drawdown. \u0083 Well construction details, including well depth, diameter, screened interval, screen size, material of construction, and depth to water table: The diameter and well depth will determine the size of the pump and the location from which the pump will operate. Peristaltic and suction draw pumps are only viable at depths of less than 25 feet. The pump intake should be placed within the well screen.

Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure , Inc. retains all rights associated with theses materials, which may not be reproduced without express written permission of the comp any. \u0083 Pump: Low-flow purging and sampling can be used in any well that can be pumped at a constant rate of not more than 1.0 L/min. Continuous discharge and cycle discharge pumps with adjustable flow rate controls should be used to avoid causing co ntinuous drawdown. Whenever possible, dedicated pumps should be installed to avoid disturbing the water column. \u0083 Groundwater quality, including type and concentration of chemical compounds present: Low-flow methods can be used for all types of aqueous-phase contamination, including VOCs, SVOCs, metals, pesticides, PCBs, radionuclides, and microbiological constituents. Pump parts and tubing should be ma de of materials that are compatible with the analytes of interest. 6.2 Equipment The following equipment is recommended for use in conducting well purging: \u0083 Pump capable of <1.0L/min draw rates \u0083 Discharge line constructed of material compatib le with the contaminants of interest. Enough for a fresh line to be used at each well \u0083 Water level indicator \u0083 Flow-through Water Quality Meter (pH, specific conductance, screening for VOCs is required) \u0083 Drums or tanks to contain the purge water \u0083 Field log book \u0083 Calculator \u0083 Plastic sheeting \u0083 Sample containers and preservatives Ice and Ziploc-type bags 6.3 Pre-Sampling To prevent cross-contaminati on of other wells on-site, upgradient and background wells should be addressed first. It is also a good idea to use fresh discharge line for each well as the low-flows make it difficult to flush contaminants between samples. The procedure for pre-sampling is as follows: \u0083 Prepare the area surrounding the well by placing plastic sheeting on the ground surface to prevent potential cross-contam ination of the pump and discharge hose or sample equipment and materials. \u0083 Place and secure the drum, tank, or suitable pu rge water container in close proximity to the well for the collection and storage of purge water. Purge water must be containerized and disposed of in the manner specified in the proj ect/program plan or as the client directs. Never return purge water to the well. If in doubt or where requirements are not specified, handle all purge water as waste and dispose of it accordingly.

Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure , Inc. retains all rights associated with theses materials, which may not be reproduced without express written permission of the comp any. \u0083 If performing VOC screening, measure and re cord the background organic vapors in the ambient air using a PID, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. \u0083 Open the well casing, remove the well cap, and immediately measure and record the organic vapor levels from the head space within the we ll casing using a PID, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. \u0083 Measure the depth to the static water level usi ng the water level indicator in accordance with Procedure EI-FS108, Water Level Measurements . 6.4 Well Purging The procedure for well purging is as follows: \u0083 Review and understand the proper operating and maintenance instruction for each type of pump that is used prior to placing the pump in the well. Each pump type has specific operating procedures. \u0083 Some wells may include a dedicated pump that is already placed in the well along the well screen. If this is the case, review well construc tion data to verify the proper placement of the pump intake. Inspect the location where the discharge line and pump support cable exit the well to determine that they are in the proper po sition (markings should be present at the well head to show this). \u0083 Assemble the pump and clean discharge line in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Ensure the pump discharge line is long enough so that the pump intake can be located within the well screen area and the discharge end can reach the purge water container. \u0083 Slowly lower the pump into the well until it is submerged and at the desired pumping depth. \u0083 Connect the pump discharge to the flow-throu gh water quality meter system in accordance with the manufacturer's procedure. \u0083 Start the pump and begin monitoring discharge rates and volume collected. Adjust flows if necessary to remain in a range of 0.1 to 0.5L/ min without exceeding the well discharge rate. \u0083 Monitor and record the pH, conductivity, temp erature, dissolved oxy gen, redox potential, and turbidity at set intervals (2 to 10 minutes). \u0083 Collect the sample following the procedure below when all monitored water quality parameters are stable, as indicated by three consecutive readings differing by less than 10 percent. For pH use +/-0.3 units as the standard. 6.5 Sample Collection The procedure for sample collection is as follows: \u0083 Prepare the sample bottles and preservatives required for the sampling. \u0083 Don a pair of clean gloves. \u0083 Collect the sample immediately after purging through the pump discharge line. - Fill VOA vials first (reduce the flow rate of the pump discharge) allowing the liquid to slowly fill the container without agitation and obtain a meniscus slightly above the top of the vial. - Cap and check all VOA vials for entrained air by slowly tipping and observing for bubbles. If any are present, discard the sample and collect again as above.

Note that most sample bottles come with preservatives already added. If such is the case, do not overfill the bottles. \u0083 Replace the well cap, if required, and lock the cover. \u0083 Record the sampling information. \u0083 For a dedicated down-hole pumping system, do not decontaminate the pump but rinse the water quality meter's flow-cell and probes with distilled water. \u0083 If using a non-dedicated pump and meter system, decontaminate the pump and meter. - Retrieve the pump and remove and dispose of the discharge line, including the line leading to and from the water quality meter system. - Rinse the water quality meter system with distilled water. - Attach a few feet of clean line to the pump and water quality meter system with a discharge end into the purge waste container. - Place the pump into a container of distilled water, adjust the flow to its maximum, and allow the entire system to flush with distilled wa ter for at least 5 minutes or longer if the waste does not appear to be clean. \u0083 Secure the area by removing equipment and materi als, properly dispose of plastic sheeting and other disposable sampling materials, and close the purge water container(s). \u0083 Proceed to the next well and repeat the proces s using clean discharge tubing for each well sampled. 7.

EMAX was founded to fill a need within the California marketplace for a flexible, reliable, and cost -effective analytical laboratory for consulting firms involved in the early stages of site inv estigation and remediation. EMAX provided fundamental services for the developm ent of statewide and regional environmental compliance, enforcement, and remedial action programs. Similarly, EMAX had the opportunity to provide large -scale analytical support to the initial and then burgeoning environmental restoration programs of the b ranches of the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. EMAX occupies a state -of-the-art, 27,000 square foot physical plant in Torrance, California. The industry EMAX support s has undergone pe riods of growth, uncertainty, and consolidation. EMAX however, has maintained level s of stability and consistency. With a strong dedication to the continuation of our technical proficiency, we place extreme emphasis on in -house training, third -party review of procedures and protocols, and the audit and peer - review processes. Over the years, EMAX has distinguished itself within the laboratory services industry by its stability in staff, its recognized technical proficiency, and its commitment to providing a nalytical deliverables in a wide variety of either agency -specified or client -developed reporting formats. We must share a large portion of our success in these areas with our clients, for it is a product of their dedication, input, and communication with us. EMAX , a woman -owned business (WBE/SDB ), has been evaluated and audited by numerous governmental agencies and private -sector clients , and has provided analytical services in support of the overall environmental programs of: \u00a4 The United States Environme ntal Protection Agency \u00a4 The United States Air Force, The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence \u00a4 The United States Army, Army Corps of Engineers \u00a4 The United States Navy, and \u00a4 The United States Department of Energy DOCUMENT FORMAT This manual is designed to complement and implement the DoD QSM and the NELAC Chapter 5 (Quality Systems ) where the NELAC Chapter 5 serves as the primary text for th is manual. The section numbering is similar to the DoD QSM. For the same purpose as the DoD QSM the numbering has been slightly changed from that of NELAC Chapter 5, as the manual is meant to be a stand -alone document. The number 5 has been eliminated from all section and subsection headings. However, second -level numbering has been retained to maintain an organizatio n parallel to the NELAC Quality Systems requirements. For instance, Section 5.4.2 in NELAC Chapter 5 is equivalent to Section 4.2 i n this manual. In fulfillment of the DoD requirements, the DoD clarifications boxes are incorporated in this manual as well. In addition, NELAC appendices and DoD appendices are included.

Document Control SOP (EMAX -Page 20 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 DM02) is established to cover document identification, filing, distribution, control, changes, retention, protection, preservation, archival, retrieval, and disposal of controlled documents. Document co ntrol policies and procedures related to or supplementary to analytical processes (e.g. calibration of support instruments) are imbedded in the analytical SOPs or in SOPs specific to the activity being performed . The control of data related to environmenta l testing is covered in 5.4.7. The control of records is covered in 4.12. 4.3.2 Document Approval and Issue 4.3.2.1 All documents in the laboratory as part of the quality system are reviewed and approved by authorized personnel for use prior to issue. EMAX Browser was e stablished to provide an easy access to these documents for laboratory personnel. The QA Department controls the documents loaded in the Browser so that only the most recent edition is available for use to preclude the use of invalid and/or obsolete docume nts. A database is also maintained to list the SOPS, its current version and the latest document review date. Other distributions are recorded on the document control ledger kept with the original SOP . 4.3.2.2 The procedure(s) adopted ensure that: a) authorized edit ions of appropriate documents are downloaded to EMAX Browser a vailab le at network computers located in the laboratory where they are easily accessed by laboratory personnel ; b) documents are periodically reviewed and, where necessary, revised to ensure contin uing suitability and compliance with applicable requirements; c) invalid or obsolete documents can not be accessed by the laboratory personnel. d) obsolete documents are marked \"VOID\" and retained by the QA Department for either legal or knowledge preservation p urposes . 4.3.2.3 Quality system documents are uniquely identified. Such identification includes the date of issue and/or revision identification, page numbering, the total number of pages, and the issuing authority( ies). 4.3.3 Document Changes 4.3.3.1 Changes to documents are r eviewed and approved by the same function that performed the original review unless specifically designated otherwise. The designated personnel obtain pertinent background information upon which to base their review and approval. 4.3.3.2 Where practicable, addendu m to the document is generated and the change is identified in the document or the appropriate attachments. 4.3.3.3 Where amendment of documents is done by hand, pending the re -issue of the documents, the QA Manager or the Laboratory Director authorizes the change and the EMAX Browser copy is updated accordingly. Amendments are clearly marked, initialed and dated. Revised documents are re -issued as soon as practicable. 4.3.3.4 Changes in documents maintained in computerized systems are controlled by the QA Department. Proc edures for such changes are detailed in EMAX -DM02. Page 21 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 4.4 Review of Requests, Tenders and Contracts 4.4.1 EMAX Project Management SOP (EMAX -QA01) describes the procedures for the review of requests, tenders and contracts. The policies and procedures of this SOP include s: a) Project Specific Requirements (PSR), including the methods to be used, quality control procedures, reporting formats, deliverables and other requirements to fulfill contract agreement. b) A process to ensure that the laboratory has the capability and resou rces to meet the PSR; Where new methods are to be developed or additional analytes are required by a project, the Operations Manager is consulted purposely to review capability that the laboratory possesses the necessary physical, personnel and informatio n resources, and that the laboratory's personnel have the skills and expertise necessary for the performance of the environmental tests in question. The review process includes demonstration of capability, successful participation of proficiency testing (P T) and/or the running of trial environmental test programs using samples or items of known value in order to determine uncertainties of measurement, detection limits, confidence limits, or other essential quality control requirements. The Project Man ager ( PM) where applicable, reviews current accreditation status of the laboratory and informs the client of the results of this review if it indicates any potential conflict, deficiency, lack of appropriate accreditation status, or inability on the laboratory's part to complete the client's work. c) Appropriate selection of environmental test method to meet the PSR. Any differences between the request or tender and the contract are resolved before any work commences. Each contract shall be acceptable both to the la boratory and the client. A contract may be any written or oral agreement to provide a client with environmental testing services. Oral agreements are followed by written statement (i.e., email, fax or letter) clarifying the agreement. 4.4.2 Records of reviews, including any significant changes, are maintained by the Project Man agers. Discussions with a client relating to the client's requirements or the results of the work during the period of execution of the contract are maintained. Phone conversations providi ng instructions and/or changes are followed by a written statement (i.e., email, fax or letter) to demonstrate a clear understanding on how to proceed with the project. Changes are initiated by the designated PM, and are initialed and dated. Where changes impact generation of deliverables (e.g. analyses, report forms, EDDs, etc.), the PM is required to discuss the matter with the Laboratory Director and the Operations Manager. 4.4.3 Where part of the project is subcontracted, the PM is responsible for the revie w of contract requirement and make sure that the sub -tier lab is capable of providing the requirements of the project. 4.4.4 The PM is responsible for informing the client of any deviation from the contract. 4.4.5 If a contract needs to be amended after work has comme nced, PM performs the same contract review process and communicate s any amendments to all affected personnel. The PM informs the client when suspension of accreditation, revocation of accreditation, or voluntary withdrawal of accreditation occurs. 4.5 Subcontr acting of Environmental Tests 4.5.1 When work is subcontracted , this work is placed with an accredited laboratory that meets applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for performing the tests and submitting the results of tests performed. Where project requirement include NELAP accreditation, specific DoD Component laboratory approval process, or other program acceptance process is required, the laboratory performing the subcontracted work is indicated in Page 22 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 the final report and non -NELAP accredited work is c learly identified. Where on -site assessment is required, the PM arranges a schedule with the QA Manager, the client and the subcontractor representative. 4.5.2 The PM obtains project -specific approval from the client before work is subcontracted, preferably in w riting. In the event that oral approval was provided, the PM shall send a written statement (i.e., email, fax or letter) confirming the verbal approval. 4.5.3 EMAX is responsible to the client for the subcontractor's work, except in the case where the client or a regulatory authority specifies which subcontractor is to be used. 4.5.4 A register of all subcontractors that EMAX uses for environmental tests and a record of the ev idence of compliance are maintained by the designated PM. 4.6 Purchasing Services and Supplies 4.6.1 Purchasing SOP (EMAX -QA09) describes the policies and procedures for the selection and purchasing of services and supplies EMAX uses. This SOP includes the purchase, reception and storage of reagents and laboratory consumable materials relevant for the enviro nmental tests. 4.6.2 Purchased supplies, reagents and consumable materials that affect the quality of environmental tests are not used until they have been inspected or otherwise verified as complying with standard specifications or requirements defined in the m ethods for the environmental tests concerned. Chemical QC SOP details the policies and procedures for acceptance/rejection of chemicals prior to its use. These services and supplies used are established and implemented to comply with specified requirements . Records of actions taken to check compliance are endorsed and maintained by the QA Department. 4.6.3 Purchase orders for items affecting the quality of laboratory output contain description of the services and supplies ordered. These purchasing documents are r eviewed and approved for technical content prior to release. These documents include date of receipt, expiration date (where applicable) ; source (i.e., provider or supplier), lot number, and calibration and verification records and certifications for whate ver services and supplies may affect the quality of associated test results. 4.6.4 The Operations Manager evaluates suppliers of critical consumables, supplies and services which affect the quality of environmental testing, and maintains records of these evalua tions and list those approved. 4.7 Service to the Client A PM is designated for each project to clarify the client's request and to monitor the laboratory's performance in relation to the work performed. Where multi -projects are assigned to a PM, confidentiali ty to other clients is mandatory. This service is also expected to provide proactive engagement. Client notification is observed when the following situations are encountered: Use of alternative method, technique, and/or monitoring analytes (e.g., surroga te standard, Internal Standard, etc.) other than specified by the project. The need to optimize methods to ensure achievement of QAPP (e.g. difficult matrix, poor performing analyte) Lack of project guidance documents, such as the QAPP, or the need for cla rification of requirements in the document (e.g. action levels, detection and quantitation capabilities) Page 23 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Problems with samples or analysis that may impact results (e.g. sample preservation, holding time, turn-around -time) 4.8 Complaints EMAX treats customer sa tisfaction with high priority. All customer complaints are entertained and assessed appropriately. The designated PM serves as an interface between the customer and EMAX. The PM is responsible in making sure that issues are resolved from the time sampling supplies are ordered to the time the data deliverables are delivered. The PM is also responsible for responding to future questions that may arise from submitted data, hard copy and/or electronic. Corrective Action SOP (EMAX -QA08) includes policy and pro cedure for the resolution of complaints received from clients or other parties. Complaints are treated on a case by case basis. Lessons learned from these incidents are incorporated in the improvement process, where new policies may be implemented to preve nt recurrence. Records are maintained of all complaints and of the investigations and corrective actions taken by the laboratory. 4.9 Control of Non -conforming Environmental Testing Work 4.9.1 When discrepancies or any aspect of the environmental testing work, or th e results of this work, do not conform to its own procedures or the agreed requirements of the client occur, the following steps are implemented: a) The Operations Man ager informs the Project Manager of the nonconforming event with recommendation(s) on how to resolve the issue. Where data quality is affected, the QA Manager is also involved to provide guidance on how to proceed. Where necessary, work may be temporarily halted until issue of concern is resolved. b) An evaluation of the significance of the nonconf orming work is assessed. c) Corrective action is taken in a timely manner d) Where data quality is or may be impacted, the PM notifies the client. e) When work was halted, resumption of work is authorized by the official that ordered it or the QA Manager. 4.9.2 Where th e evaluation by either of the involved parties (The PM, The QA, and/or Operations) indicates that the non-conforming work could recur or that there is doubt about the compliance to policies and procedures launch corrective action as described in Section 4. 10. 4.10 Corrective Action 4.10.1 General When established corrective action policies and procedures do not rectify the non -conforming event or departures from the policies and procedures in the quality system or technical operations have been identified, a case stud y is initiated by the QA Manager. 4.10.2 Cause Analysis The purpose of cause analysis is to explore and understand the root and/or rationale behind the noncompliant event. Page 24 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 4.10.3 Selection and Implementation of Corrective Actions The cause analysis is expected to iden tify potential corrective actions. Selection of corrective action is based on the effectiveness to eliminate the problem and to prevent recurrence. The extent of corrective actions is bounded to a degree appropriate to the magnitude and the risk of the problem. The QA Manager maintains documentation of the entire case study and to include summary of the findings and any required changes resulting from corrective action investigations. 4.10.4 Monitoring of Corrective Actions The Operations Manager is responsible for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the corrective action. In the event that corrective action implemented is unsuccessful, the Operations Man ager confers with the QA Manager to revisit the issues of concern and find measures to resolve the issue. 4.10.5 Additional Audits Where the identification of non -conformance or departures casts doubts on the laboratory's compliance with established policies and procedures or on its compliance with this manual, the QA Manager conducts an audit on appropria te areas of activity in accordance with Section 4.13 of this manual as soon as possible. 4.10.6 Technical Corrective Action a) Analytical Quality Control Procedure (QCP) is incorporated in every work order. The QCP includes corrective action for quality control para meters. In the event that other anomalies occur or corrective action in the QCP does not resolve the problem, the Supervisor is informed and non -conformance report is initiated. This process is an integral part of Corrective Action SOP (EMAX -QA08) and it i ncludes: 1) Event description; corrective action recommendation (CAR) corrective action taken (CAT). The event description is initiated by the person that discovered the non -conforming event and informs the Supervisor or the responsible person for initiating CAR (e.g., the PM, if it requires client notification, the QA if it concerns data quality, PT). The CAR is initiated by the Supervisor or the responsible party. The CAT is initiated by the person responsible for implementing the CAR. 2) The Supervisor is resp onsible in making sure that actions are taken in a timely manner as well as the acceptability of course of action. Where data quality is or maybe jeopardize, the PM is informed so that the client is notified. 3) These non -conformance events are logged in a da tabase maintained by the QA Department. 4) The QA Manager performs a periodic review to check for appropriateness of the CAT and trending analysis or recurring problems. Where the QA Man ager observes inappropriate CAT, trending or recurring events, the issue is brought to the Operations Manager and when necessary with the Laboratory Director for verification, evaluation and discuss probable cure to the existing concern. b) To the extent possible, samples are reported only if all quality control measures are accep table. If a quality control measure is found to be out of control, and the data is to be reported, all samples associated with the failed quality control measure are reported with the appropriate project specific defined data qualifier(s). Refer to appendi ces for specific program qualifiers. Page 25 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 4.11 Preventive Action EMAX has established pro -active processes where identified potential sources of non -conformances or probable cause of problems may occur. These processes include but not limited to the following: 4.11.1 Stand ard Operating Procedures are established so that proper course of action is followed across the board. 4.11.2 Chemicals used are passed through quality control prior to its use to prevent accidental use of underrated or adulterated chemicals. 4.11.3 Operations capacity is verified prior to accepting work and turning down work when project specifications are not within EMAX capability. 4.11.4 Appropriate personnel training and adequacy of commissioned equipment. 4.11.5 Continuous quality systems improvement obtained from technical expe rience, customer satisfaction, and participation of performance testing, and internal and external assessments. 4.12 Control of Records Laboratory logbooks are controlled and issued by the QA Department. These logbooks are uniquely identified, paginated, and bound with a seal. They are designed to suit particular laboratory activit ies and comply with any applicable regulation. They are primarily used to record original observations, calculations and derived data calibration records. These records are expected t o produce unequivocal and accurate data. All of these laboratory records and copies of test reports are maintained for a minimum period of five years. Sample custody documentations are based on client project specification. In the event that a new project specifies other than EMAX current Sample Management SOPs, addendum to the existing SOP or a new SOP shall be generated to comply with the requirement. 4.12.1 General 4.12.1.1 Every data package generated archives with it all per tinent information necessary for the entire data generation process . This data archive includes but not limited to a copy of the chain of custody, PSR for the work order, relevant logbook pages, calibrations, raw data, test reports, non -conformance report (if any) , and review records, These records are identified by EMAX Control Number (ECN) and are chronologically archived and indexed according to the ECN. These documents are controlled and maintained by the Data Management Department. A logbook is use d to record archiving, access and disposal of th ese records. Quality records are maintained by the QA Department. These records include reports from internal audits and management reviews as well as records of corrective and preventive actions. 4.12.1.2 All records are expected to be legible. They are stored an d retained in such a way that they are readily retrievable in a suitable environment to prevent damage or deterioration and to prevent loss. These records are retained for a minimum period of five years. 4.12.1.3 Access to these records is limited to authorize d personnel only. The records warehouse is held secured and in confidence. 4.12.1.4 Likewise, access controls to electronic records are established for LIMS and administrative files. All users of Company data must be authorized to access the appropriate systems and thei r resources. Access is controlled and monitored in accordance with Company policy. Copies of data, regardless of location, have the same data security and access control requirements as operational data. The elements involved in controlling and Page 26 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 monitoring this access include identification, authentication, and authorization. Access levels are determined by the user's or user group's data access privileges. Access is granted by means of a computer account, which serves as identification. A computer accoun t is created based on an approved request for network account. All critical LIMS and administrative data are backed up on a regular basis. Files stored in servers are backed up daily. Workstation data are backed up at a frequency established by the user who generates the data. This frequency is influenced by the rate of generation of new data, the rate with which the data changes and the effort required to recreate information, if it is lost. Backup and archival methods shall be defined for all data files. Backup data shall be used to recover data when files have been destroyed. Archived data shall be kept for future reference. Retention times shall be defined for archived data. Provisions shall be made for off -site storage of daily and archival back up s. 4.12.1.5 All laboratory activities are recorded to allow historical reconstruction of how the resultant sample analytical data was produced. Laboratory logbooks or forms related to the laboratory activity are integrated with the specific SOP. Internal chain of c ustody records the history of inter -laboratory transfers of samples and/or extracts. These records include: a) The identity of personnel involved in sample endorsement/receipt, preparation, or testing. b) Equipment identification, analytical test methods, and re lated laboratory activities, such as sample receipt, sample preparation, or data verification. c) Data file names, electronic data location to facilitate the retrieval of all working files and archived records for inspection and verification purposes. d) All cha nges to records signed or initialed by responsible staff clearly identifying the reason for the signature or initials, e.g. \"prepared by,\" or \"reviewed by.\" e) All generated data except those that are generated by automated data collection systems, are record ed directly, promptly and legibly in permanent ink. f) Entries in records are not be obliterated by methods such as erasures, overwritten files or markings. All corrections to record -keeping errors are made by one line marked through the error. The individual making the correction signs (or initial s) and date s the correction. These criteria also shall apply to electronically maintained records where applicable. g) Refer to 5.4.7.2 for Computer and Electronic Data. 4.12.2 Technical Records 4.12.2.1 Records of original observation s, derived data and sufficient information to establish an audit trail, calibration records, staff records and a copy of each test report issued, are retained for a defined period. The records for each environmental test contain sufficient information to f acilitate identification of factors affecting the uncertainty and to enable the environmental test to be repeated under conditions as close as possible to the original. The records include the identity of personnel responsible for the sample preparation, p erformance of each environmental test and checking of results. 4.12.2.2 Observations, data and calculations are recorded at the time they are made and are identifiable to the specific task. 4.12.2.3 When mistakes occur in records, each mistake are crossed out, not erased, m ade illegible or deleted, and the correct value entered alongside. All such alterations to records are signed or initialed by the person making the correction. In the case of records stored electronically, equivalent measures are taken, e.g., changes are n oted in the laboratory logbook to avoid loss or change of original data. Page 27 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 When corrections are due to reasons other than transcription errors, the reason s for the correction are documented. 4.12.2.4 Records Management and Storage a) All records (including those pertain ing to test equipment), certificates and reports are safely stored, held secure and in confidence to the client. These records are available to the accrediting authority. b) All records, including those specified in 4.12.2.5 are retained for a minimum of five years from generation of the last entry in the records. All information necessary for the historical reconstruction of data are maintained by EMAX. Records which are stored only on electronic media are supported by the hardware and software necessary for their retrieval. c) Records that are stored or generated by computers or personal computers have hard copy or write - protected backup copies. d) Record management system for control of laboratory notebooks, instrument logbooks, standards logbooks, and records for data reduction, validation, storage and reporting is integrated in SOPs relevant to the activity. e) Access to archived information is documented with an access log.

Technical audits verify compliance with method - specific requirements, as well as operations related to the analytical process, data reduction , and data review. The process includes all actions related to data generation a nd the assurance of its quality. Systems audits verify compliance with the laboratory's quality system, based on the NELAC Quality System, DOD Quality System, and regulatory systems required to accomplish existing projects. Part of the systems audit would be a review of the policies and procedures for Quality Assurance, Quality Control, Sample Management, Data Management, Project Management , and Information Systems. The QA Manager or a designee arranges internal audits to verify that EMAX operations contin ue to comply with the requirements of the laboratory's quality system. It is the responsibility of the QA Manager to plan and organize audits not only as required by a predetermined schedule but also as requested by management. Such audits shall be carried out by the QA Manager or qualified personnel who are, wherever resources permit, independent of the activity to be audited. Personnel shall not audit their own activities except when it can be demonstrated that an effective audit will be carried out. Personnel performing an internal audit shall complete the audit under the direction of the quality manager, however named. To be considered \"trained and qualified,\" the internal auditor shall be trained and qualified in conducting the type of audit under revie w An audit schedule shall be established such that all elements/areas of the laboratory a re reviewed over the course of one year. 4.13.2 Where the audit findings cast doubt on the correctness or validity of the laboratory's calibrations or test results, the labor atory shall take immediate corrective action and immediately notify in writing any client whose work may have been affected. 4.13.3 The area of activity audited, the audit findings , and corrective actions that arise from them are recorded. Refer to Internal Asses sment SOP (EMAX -QA07) for procedures in documenting internal audit. The Operations Manager and the Laboratory Director receive a copy of the Internal assessment report. The Operations Manager is responsible that the corrective actions are discharged within the agreed time frame as indicated in the report. Time frame for corrective actions is based on the magnitude of the finding and its impact on the defensibility and use of data. 4.13.4 It is the responsibility of the QA Manager to follow -up, verify , and record t he implementation and effectiveness of the corrective action taken. Where resolution or timeliness of the implementation of corrective actions is in question, the Operations Manager must inform the QA Manager and the Laboratory Director for re-evaluation a nd/or redirection. 4.14 Management Reviews 4.14.1 In preparation of management review, the members of executive management submit their annual report to the QA Manager. The QA Manager consolidates the annual management review and submits to the Laboratory Director. Th e Laboratory Director or a designee arranges an executive meeting to review the laboratory's Page 30 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 quality system and environmental testing activities, their continuing suitability and effectiveness, and to introduce necessary changes or improvements. The review shall take account of: a) the suitability of policies and procedures; b) reports from managerial and supervisory personnel; c) the outcome of recent internal audits; d) corrective and preventi ve actions; e) assessments by external bodies; f) the results of inter -laboratory comparisons or proficiency tests; g) changes in the volume and type of the work; h) client feedback; i) complaints; and j) other relevant factors, such as quality control activities, resources , and staff training. 4.14.2 Findings from management reviews and the actions that arise from them are included in the report. The Laboratory Director presides the executive meeting and directs course of action where changes are necessary. The Operation s Manager is responsible to en sure that identified action items concerning operatio ns (e.g., initiate hiring or reshuffling of personnel, purchase or repair of equipments, facility improvement or maintenance, and other action items related to operations) are carried out within an appropriate and agreed timescale. The QA Ma nager is respon sible to en sure that identified action items concerning quality systems (e.g., policies and procedures, trainings, quality controls, and other action items related to quality systems improvement) are carried out within an appropriate and agreed timescale. 4.14.3 As part of their overall internal auditing program, the management review is conducted with respect to any evidence of inappropriate actions or vulnerabilities related to data integrity. Discovery of potential issues shall be handled in a confidential mann er until such time as a follow up evaluation, full investigation, or other appropriate actions have been completed and the issues clarified. All investigations that result in finding of inappropriate activity shall be documented and shall include any disci plinary actions involved, corrective actions taken, and all appropriate notifications of clients. All documentation of these investigation and actions taken shall be maintained for at least five years. 5.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 5.1 General 5.1.1 Factors affecting corre ctness and reliability of environmental tests results. a) human factors (5.2); Page 31 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 b) accommodation and environmental conditions (5.3); c) environmental test methods and method validation (5.4); d) equipment (5.5); e) measurement traceability (5.6); f) sampling (5.7); and g) handl ing of samples (5.8). 5.1.2 The extent to which the factors contribute to the total uncertainty of measurement differs considerably between (types of) environmental tests. To minimize disparity of test results, EMAX established environmental test methods and pro cedures, standardized training , and qualification of personnel, and in conjunction to daily equipment check, subscribe to service contracts for major equipment. EMAX designed its facility considering factors that may effect stability of equipment, minimize probable sources of contamination, health and safety of its workers , and ease for maintaining tidiness and cleanliness. 5.2 Personnel 5.2.1 All o f EMAX technical staff undergo training regardless of its educational attainment and/or experience. All who operate spec ific equipment, perform environmental tests, evaluate results, and sign test reports shall demonstrate competence prior to working on their own. Staff on training may participate in sample analysis, as long as appropriate supervision is provided. Personnel performing specific tasks are qualified on the basis of appropriate education, training, experi ence and/or demonstrated skills as required. EMAX employs sufficient personnel with the necessary education, training, technical knowledge , and experience for t heir assigned functions. All personnel are trained to be responsible for complying with all quality assurance/quality control requirements that pertain to their function may it be technical or non -technical. Each technical staff member is positioned to hav e a combination of experience and education to adequately demonstra te a specific knowledge of his or her particular function and a general knowledge of laboratory operations, test methods, quality assurance/quality control procedures , and records managemen t. Employed Technical Directors are qualified in accordance to the specification of the NELAC Standard1 as well as the DoD QSM2 (Grey box 26). 5.2.2 Training SOP (EMAX -QA05) details the general process of conducting training. The Supervisor formulates the goals with respect to the education, training and skills of the personnel and conducts the training or assigns a mentor. The Supervisor also identifies the SOPs needed for the training as well as all the necessary training needs to successfully execute and compl ete the training. In general , the training program is geared relevant to the present and anticipated tasks of the laboratory. 5.2.3 Most of EMAX personnel are employed fulltime. Where contracted and additional technical and key support personnel are used, they u ndergo the same training, supervision and qualification process as the fulltime employees and must work in accordance with the laboratory's quality system. 5.2.4 Current job descriptions for all personnel who manage, perform, or verify work affecting the quali ty of the environmental tests are maintained and evaluated periodically. 1 Based On NELAC Voted Revision - 5 June 2003 2 DoD Quality Systems Manual - Version 3 Final Page 32 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 5.2.5 Training records are forwarded to the QA Department for evaluation and certification to authorize specific personnel to perform particular types of environmental testing. The certificat ion qualifies them to conduct the first level of review on test results, give opinions , and interpretations to test results, and to operate equipment specific to the test performed. The certification is approved by the Laboratory Director and the QA Manage r. Training records are maintained by the QA Department. These records include relevant authorization(s), competence, educational and professional qualifications, training, skills , and experience. This information shall be readily available and shall incl ude the date on which authorization and/or competence is confirmed. 5.2.6 The management is responsible for: a) hiring personnel to meet the defined minimum level of qualification, experience , and skills necessary for all positions in the laboratory. In addition to education and/or experience, basic laboratory skills such as using a balance, micropipette, thermometers, qualitative and quantitative techniques are considered; b) ensuring that all technical laboratory staff have demonstrated capability in the activities f or which they are responsible. Such demonstration is documented and maintained in their training files. Note: Where a sample process (e.g. preparation, extraction , and analysis) is to be completed by a group of individuals to perform a method, otherwise k nown as a \"work cell\", each individual is certified to perform his or her specific task in order for the group working as a unit meets the above criteria. This demonstration of capability is documented in the individual training file. c) ensuring that the tra ining of each member of the technical staff is kept up -to-date as described in EMAX -QA05 where: 1) Evidence must be on file that demonstrates that each employee has read, understood, and is using the latest version of the laboratory's in -house quality documen tation, which relates to his/her job responsibilities. 2) Training courses or workshops on specific equipment, analytical techniques or laboratory procedures are included in the training files. 3) Analyst training is considered up to date if an employee training file contains a certification that the technical personnel has read, understood , and agreed to perform the most recent version of the test method (the approved method or standard operating procedure as defined by the document control system, 4.2.3.d) and documentation of continued proficiency by at least one of the following per year: i. acceptable performance of a blind sample (single blind to the analyst). Note: successful analysis of a blind performance sample on a similar test method using the same techn ology (e.g., GC/MS volatiles by purge and trap for Methods 524.2, 624 or 5030/8260) would only require documentation for one of the test methods. The laboratory must determine the acceptable limits of the blind performance sample prior to analysis; ii. an init ial measurement system evaluation or another demonstration of capability; iii. at least four consecutive laboratory control samples with acceptable levels of precision and accuracy. The laboratory must determine the acceptable limits for precision and accuracy prior to analysis; or iv. if i-iii cannot be performed, analysis of authentic samples with results statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by another trained analyst. d) documenting all analytical and operational activities of the laboratory; e) supervis ing all personnel employed by the laboratory; Page 33 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 f) ensuring that all sample acceptance criteria (Section 5.8) are verified and that samples are logged into the sample tracking system and properly labeled and stored; and g) documenting the quality of all data repor ted by the laboratory; 5.2.7 Data integrity training is provided as a formal part of new employee orientation and provided on an annual basis for all current employees. Ethics Program SOP (EMAX -QA10) details EMAX business ethics, its policies and procedures, the critical need for honesty and full disclosure of analytical results, how and when to report data integrity issues, as well as record keeping. Employees are required to understand their obligations related to data integrity , that any infractions of the lab oratory data integrity procedures will result in a detailed investigation that could lead to disciplinary action including immediate termination or be brought in the court of law. Data integrity trainings are authenticated by the participant 's dated signat ure. Senior managers acknowledge their support of these procedures by 1) upholding the spirit and intent of the organization's data integrity procedures and 2) effectively implementing the specific requirements of the procedures. Training shall include di scussion regarding all data integrity procedures, data integrity training documentation, in-depth data monitoring , and data integrity procedure documentation. Other relevant ethics training materials (e.g. examples of breaches of ethical behavior should b e discussed including improper data manipulations, adjustments of instrument time clocks, and inappropriate changes in concentrations of standards) are developed by the QA Department to augment the Ethics Program SOP. 5.3 Accommodation and Environmental Condi tions 5.3.1 Significance of every facet of the laboratory was taken into consideration when EMAX designed its facilities. Its energy sources, lighting and environmental conditions, are planned and constructed to facilitate correct performance of the environmenta l tests. To ensure that environmental conditions do not invalidate the results or adversely affect the required quality of any measurement, controls are established and monitored. Fume hoods are adequately provided so that particular care when sub -sampling and environmental testing are undertaken. Technical requirements for accommodation and environmental conditions that can affect the results of environmental tests are monitored and documented. 5.3.2 All environmental conditions that require control are monitore d and documented in accordance with the relevant specifications, methods and procedures or where they influence the quality of the results. Due attention are paid as appropriate to the technical activities concerned (e.g. Leaching requires controlled tempe rature, D oE lab requires frisking, etc.). Environmental tests shall be stopped when the environmental conditions jeopardize the results of the environmental tests. In instances where monitoring or controls of any of the above -mentioned items are specified in a test method or by regulation, a course of action is included in the SOP relevant to the activity being performed to meet and document adherence to the laboratory facility requirements. 5.3.3 The laboratories were constructed to have effective separation bet ween neighboring areas in which there are incompatible activities. Volatiles Laboratory is located farthest from the extraction lab and has independent mechanical controls; laboratories for D oE samples are isolated with independent mechanical controls and restricted entries. All foreseen measures are taken to prevent cross -contamination. Sample storage for Volatiles is located in the Volatiles Laboratory. Samples from D oE sights that are identified as restricted sample s are stored in the D oE Laborat ory. Page 34 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 5.3.4 Access to and use of areas affecting the quality of the environmental tests are controlled. Specific areas in the lab can only be accessed by authorized personnel. 5.3.5 Measures are taken to ensure good housekeeping in the laboratory. The Supervisors are responsi ble to make sure that their work area s are properly maintained to prevent cross -contamination and/or health hazard to staff members. 5.3.6 Workspaces are available and workers assigned to specific areas are responsible to clear their respective work areas. Maint enance of work areas are enumerated below: a) access and entryways to the laboratory are maintained clear by the Facilities Manager; b) sample receipt areas are maintained by the Sample Management Department; c) sample storage areas are maintained by the Sample Man agement Department; d) chemical and waste storage area s are maintained by the Waste Management Unit. e) data handling and storage areas are maintained by the Data Management Department. 5.4 Environmental Test Methods and Method Validation 5.4.1 General EMAX has establishe d appropriate methods and procedures for all environmental tests within its capability. These include handling, transport, storage , and preparation of samples, and, where appropriate, an estimation of the measurement uncertainty as well as statistical tech niques for analysis of environmental test data. Analytical SOPs have instructions on the use and operation of all relevant equipment, and on the handling and preparation of samples where the absence of such instructions could jeopardize the results of envi ronmental tests. All instructions, standards, manuals and reference data relevant to the work of the laboratory are kept up to date and are readily available to personnel (see 4.3). Deviation from environmental test methods occur only if the deviation has been documented, technically justified, authorized, and accepted by the client. All SOPs are reviewed for accuracy and adequacy at least annually and whenever procedural method changes occur , they are updated as appropriate 5.4.1.1 Standard Operating Procedures (S OPs) EMAX maintains SOPs that accurately reflect all phases of current laboratory activities such as assessing data integrity, corrective actions, handling customer complaints, and all test methods. a) These documents contain adequate details t o allow qualifi ed personnel , other than the analyst, to reproduce the procedures to generate the test result. b) In the absence of internally written analytical SOPs , copies of published methods maybe used as long as any changes or selected options in the methods are docum ented and included in the methods manual (see 5.4.1.2). For DoD projects, where existing methods are specified , requirements contained within that method shall be followed. Any modifications to existing method requirements require project -specific approval by DoD project representative. c) Copies of all SOPs are downloaded in the EMAX Browser and are accessible to all personnel. d) The SOPs are organized indicative of their use. The Sample Management SOPs are policies and procedures describing how to handle samp les from cradle to grave. The Dat a Management SOPs are policies o n procedures detailing data collection from sample receiving to data packaging. The Quality Assurance SOPs Page 35 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 and Quality Control SOPs are policies and procedures detailing execution and control s for the overall quality systems. The Information Systems SOPs are policies and procedures detailing handling and management of electronic media, from hardware and software administration to backup and restoration controls. e) Each SOP clearly indicate s the effective date of the document, the revision number and the signature(s) of the approving authority. f) Analytical SOPs contain sufficient information to perform the tests. Any changes, including the use of a selected option must be documented and included i n the specific analytical SOP in the form of an addendum. All SOPs shall be archived for historical reference in accordance to Section 4.12. 5.4.1.2 Laboratory Method Manual(s) a) EMAX maintains laboratory method manuals referred to as an alytical SOPs for each accre dited analyte or test method. b) The Analytical SOPs describe the process of producing analytical results from sub -sampling to data reduction and review. These SOPs are adaptations of referenced test methods. In cases where modifications to the published met hod have been made or where the referenced test method is ambiguous or provides insufficient detail, these changes or clarifications are clearly described. Each test method include s or reference where applicable: 1) identification of the test method; 2) applicab le matrix or matrices; 3) detection limit; 4) scope and application, including components to be analyzed; 5) summary of the test method; 6) definitions; 7) interferences; 8) safety; 9) equipment and supplies; 10) reagents and standards; 11) sample collection, preservation, shipment an d storage; 12) quality control; 13) calibration and standardization; 14) procedure; 15) data analysis and calculations; 16) method performance; 17) pollution prevention; 18) data assessment and acceptance criteria for quality control measures; 19) corrective actions for out of control da ta; 20) contingencies for handling out -of-control or unacceptable data; 21) waste management; 22) references; and Page 36 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 23) any table, diagram , flowchart , and validation data. 5.4.2 Selection of Methods Project Management SOP (EMAX -QA01) describes how methods for environmental testin g, including methods for sample preparation, are dispense to meet the needs of the client and which are appropriate for the environmental tests it undertakes. 5.4.2.1 Sources of Methods a) Methods published in international, regional or national standards are prefer ably be used. EMAX ensures that it uses the latest valid edition of a standard unless it is not appropriate or possible to do so. When necessary, the standard shall be supplemented with additional details to ensure consistent application. b) When the use of s pecific methods for a sample analysis are mandated or requested, only those methods are used. c) When the client does not specify the method to be used or where methods employed are not required, the methods are fully documented and validated (see 5.4.2.2, 5. 4.5, and Appendix C), and shall be available to the client and other recipients of the relevant reports. It is of EMAX 's best interest to select appropriate methods that have been published either in international, regional or national standards, or by rep utable technical organizations, or in relevant scientific texts or journals, or as specified by the manufacturer of the equipment. Where no reference method has been established, EMAX may develop methods appropriate for the intended use. These methods shal l be fully validated and shall only be put to use with client's consent. d) EMAX shall inform the client when the method proposed by the client is considered to be inappropriate or out of date. 5.4.2.2 Demonstration of Capability Capability to perform environmental tests requires demonstration to confirm that it can be properly executed. Where method changes occur, the confirmation is repeated. a) Prior to acceptance and institution of any method, satisfactory demonstration of method capability is performed. (See Append ix C and 5.2.6.b) In general, this demonstration does not test the performance of the method in real world samples, but in the applicable and available clean quality system matrix sample (a quality system matrix in which no target analytes or interferences are present at concentrations that impact the results of a specific test method), e.g., drinking water, solids and air. In addition, for analytes which do not lend themselves to spiking, the demonstration of capability may be performed using quality contr ol samples. When available, demonstration of performance is determined using external source of information (e.g. published methods). In the absence of external source, EMAX shall use comparisons provided by the project sponsor or execute the process as sp ecified by the project data quality objectives. b) Thereafter, continuing demonstration of method performance, as per the quality control requirements in Appendix D (such as laboratory control samples) is performed. The initial and continuing demonstration of capability includes verification of method sensitivity checks (for example, through the use of quarterly method detection verification) and demonstrated measurements of accuracy and precision (such as the production and review of quality control charts). These requirements apply to each quality system matrix of concern. c) For methods that were established before July 1999, and there have been no significant changes in instrument type, personnel or method, continuing demonstration of method performance and th e analyst's documentation of continued proficiency is sufficient to demonstrate capability. Page 37 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 d) In all cases, the appropriate forms such as the Certification Statement (Appendix C) must be completed. All associated supporting data necessary to reproduce the an alytical results summarized in the Certification Statement must be retained and be available upon request. (See Appendix C for Certification Statement.) e) A demonstration of capability must be completed each time there is a change in instrument type, personn el, method, or sample matrix that may affect the precision, accuracy, sensitivity , and selectivity of the output . f) Specialized \"work cell(s)\" (a group consisting of analysts with specifically defined tasks that together perform the test method who see a sam ple through the complete process of preparation, extraction, and analysi s), each member of the group is certified specifically for his/her function in the unit. D emonstration of capability is fully documented. g) Since every individual that work in work cells are certified when there are changes in the members of the cell, the new employee(s) is assigned to work with experienced analyst(s) in that area of the work cell where they are employed and no disruption of the unit's capability to perform is expected. T he new member of the work cell must demonstrate acceptable performance through the same process. h) Currently EMAX does not certify work cell(s) as a unit but rather each member is certified individually. In the event that EMAX decides to certify work cells as a unit, the performance of the group shall be linked to the training record of the individual members of the work cell (see section 5.2.6). When there are changes in the members of the cell , the performance of the unit shall be monitored. Such performa nce must be documented and the four preparation batches following the change in personnel must not result in the failure of any batch acceptance criteria, e.g., method blank and laboratory control sample, or the demonstration of capability must be repeated . In addition, if the entire work cell is changed or replaced, the work cell must perform the demonstration of capability. 5.4.3 Laboratory -Developed Methods Method Development SOP (EMAX -QA03) details the policies and procedures to guide the users in planning th e activity for the study they are about to develop as well as the documentation required to complete the qualification of the method. This activity shall be assigned to qualified personnel equipped with adequate resources. Plans are updated as development proceeds and shall be corroborated through effective communication amongst all personnel involved and the intellectual resources of EMAX. 5.4.4 Non-Standard Methods Non-Standard Methods shall only be employed when mandated by the project. It shall include clear specification of the client's requirements as stated by the project quality objectives. The method developed shall have been validated appropriately before use. 5.4.5 Validation of Methods 5.4.5.1 EMAX validates its methods by assessing objective evidence ensuring that the particular requirements for a specific intended use are fulfilled. 5.4.5.2 Validation of non -standard methods, in -house -designed/developed methods, standard methods used outside their published scope, and amplifications and modifications of standard methods sh all confirm that the methods are fit for the intended use. The validation shall be as extensive as is necessary to meet the needs of the given application or field of application. Records of results obtained, the procedure used for the validation, and a statement as to whether the method is fit for the intended use is retained. At a minimum, requirements shall be the initial test method evaluation requirements given in Appendix C.3. 5.4.5.3 Where project requirements are known, (e.g., DoD QSM, or as stated through Basic Ordering Agreements), when validating methods the range and accuracy of the values (e.g. the uncertainty of the results, detection Page 38 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 limit, selectivity of the method, linearity, limit of repeatability and/or reproducibility, robustness against external influences and/or cross -sensitivity against interference from the matrix of the sample/test object), are assessed for the intended use and relevant to the clients' needs. In cooperation of EMAX's clients, should the client elect to use EMAX as early as th e planning phase of the project (QAPP preparation), EMAX shall ensure that the required methods are properly validated. Otherwise, the client shall be informed accordingly. 5.4.6 Estimation of Uncertainty of Measurement 5.4.6.1 Factors affecting measurement uncertainty is estimated based on the complexity of the process. Note that the analytical process is only a fraction of the total measurement uncertainty for a target analyte. Hence, EMAX can not make measurement uncertainty corrections on sample results. Laboratory control samples (LCS) are subjected to all possible sources of measurement uncertainty, (e.g., sample sub -sampling, sample preparation, sensitivity of instrumentation, instrument calibrations, qualitative and quantitative evaluation). Hence, reasonable es timation of measurement uncertainty is revealed by the statistical evaluation of the LCS results and/or validation data. In those cases where a well -recognized test method specifies limits to the values of the major sources of uncertainty of measurement an d specifies the form of presentation of calculated results, it is considered to have established estimated measurement uncertainty. 5.4.6.2 When estimating the uncertainty of measurement is required by the project, EMAX shall secure guidance for estimating measure ment uncertainty from the client to prevent misinterpretation of results. 5.4.7 Control of Data 5.4.7.1 Calculations and data transfers are subject to appropriate checks in a systematic manner. Data evaluation and review process is an integral part of every analytical S OP. In addition Data flow and Review SOP (EMAX - DM01) describes the general process of how data are generated and reviewed. These SOPs include policies and procedures: a) to ensure that the reported data are free from transcription, omissions, mistakes and qua litative and quantitative identification errors. b) to ensure that all quality control measures are reviewed, and evaluated before data are reported. c) for manual calculations including manual integrations. d) to ensure consistency with project -specific requiremen ts (e.g., method requirements, calibration requirements, quality control procedures, project limits, etc.) e) to generate case narrative that includes accurate explanation when anomalous results are encountered, the corrective actions taken and that affected data are flagged according to project specification. 5.4.7.2 Where EMAX uses computers, automated equipment, or microprocessors for the acquisition, processing, recording, reporting, storage or retrieval of environmental test data, controls are in place so that or iginal electronic data acquired are retained. EMAX also developed Information Systems SOPs. a) For computer software developed in -house, EMAX has established policies and procedures to ensure sufficient details for documentation and control. These SOPs includ e: Software Documentation (EMAX -IS01) Page 39 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Software Development Methodologies (EMAX -IS02) Software Testing and Quality Assurance (EMAX -IS03) Software Maintenance (EMAX -IS04) b) Data Security SOP (EMAX -IS08) details the policies and procedures for protecting labora tory programs and electronic data. Furthermore, EMAX has developed Ethics Program (EMAX -Q10) to uphold integrity and confidentiality of data entry or collection, data storage, data transmission and data processing. c) Hardware Maintenance SOP (EMAX -IS10) deta ils computers attached to automated equipment are maintained to ensure proper functioning and are provided with the environmental and operating conditions necessary to maintain the integrity of environmental test data; and d) Access controls, backup and arc hival, and routine disaster recovery are established and maintained by the Network Administrator to maintain security of data. Only unauthorized personnel can amend computer records. Commercial off -the-shelf software (e.g. word processing, database and sta tistical programs) in general use within their designed application range is considered to be sufficiently validated. However, laboratory software configuration or modifications must be validated as in 5.4.7.2a. 5.5 Equipment 5.5.1 EMAX has all instrumentation and s upport equipment for the environmental tests it performs (including sub - sampling, preparation of samples, processing and analysis of environmental test data). These instruments are obtained and maintained to achieve the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, an d selectivity required for the intended use of the generated data. Procedures for setup, maintenance, and adjustments to instrument operating parameters as well as documentation process are integrated with the SOPs where these instruments are used. 5.5.2 Equipme nt and its software (where applicable) are verified to comply with specifications relevant to the environmental tests requirements before being placed into service. Procedures for calibration and calibration verifications are imbedded with the SOPs where t hese instruments are utilized. Calibration requirements are divided into two parts: (1) requirements for analytical support equipment, and 2) requirements for instrument calibration. In addition, the requirements for instrument calibration are divided int o initial instrument calibration and continuing instrument calibration verification. 5.5.2.1 Support Equipment Support equipments are devices that are necessary to support laboratory operations. These include but are not limited to: balances, ovens, refrigerators, freezers, incubators, water baths, temperature measuring devices, sample preparation devices , and volumetric dispensing devices if quantitative results are dependent on their accuracy, as in standard preparation and dispensing or dilution into a specified volume. a) All support equipments are maintained in proper working order. The records of all repair and maintenance activities including service calls are kept. b) All support equipments are calibrated or verified at least annually, using NIST traceable referen ces when available, over the entire range of use. The results of such calibration or verification shall be within the specifications required of the application for which this equipment is used or: 1) the equipment is removed from service until repaired; or 2) maintain records of established correction factors to correct all measurements. Page 40 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 c) Raw data records are retained to document equipment performance. d) Prior to use on each working day, balances, ovens, refrigerators, freezers, and water baths are checked in the expected use range, with NIST traceable references where commercially available. The acceptability for use or continued use shall be according to the needs of the analysis or application for which the equipment is being used. e) Mechanical volumetric dispens ing devices including burettes (except Class A glassware) are checked for accuracy on at least a quarterly use basis. Glass microliter syringes are to be considered in the same manner as Class A glassware, but must come with a certificate attesting to esta blished accuracy otherwise, initial demonstration of accuracy is required. 5.5.2.2 Instrument Calibration The essential elements that d efine the procedures and documentation for initial instrument calibration and continuing instrument calib ration verification mus t ensure that the data is of known quality and appropriate for a given regulation or decision. 5.5.2.2.1 Initial Instrument Calibration The following items are essential elements of initial instrument calibration: a) Calibration procedures, how they are done, evaluat ed and use. These procedures are included in every EMAX Analytical SOP. These procedures shall only be superseded when other specifications are required by the project or mandated by regulation. Where instrument calibration are complex (e.g. calibration fo r multi - analytes analyzed by GC/MS, GC, or HPLC) a secondary review is required prior to its use. Initial calibration verification is also performed when applicable. b) Raw data records. These records are retained to permit reconstruction of the initial instr ument calibration, e.g., calibration date, test method, instrument, analysis date, each analyte name, analyst's initials or signature; concentration and response, calibration curve or response factor; or unique equation or coefficient used to reduce instru ment responses to concentration. When manual integrations are performed, the original and the manually integrated raw data records are retained and documented as described in Data Flow and Review SOP (EMAX -DM01). Where software of data acquisition permits, electronic data also includes complete audit trail for the manually integrated peaks. c) Quantitation Technique. Sample result quantitation is based from the initial instrument calibration, unless otherwise required by regulation, method, program , or project . d) Initial calibrations verification. Initial instrument calibration is verified with a standard obtained from a second manufacturer. The use of a standard from a second lot is acceptable when only one manufacturer of the calibration standard exists. Where commercially available, EMAX shall purchase standards that are certified and traceable to a national standard. When method specific guidance does not exist, concentration of second source standard shall be at or near the middle of the calibration range. Where stability of the standard has not been established, assessment of standard solution as well as degradation rate shall be observed from the standard preparation date when evaluating for its suitability for use. e) Acceptance Criteria. Initial instrument ca libration acceptance criteria are based on the method requirement, or project specific requirement e.g., correlation coefficient or relative standard deviation. The criteria used must be appropriate to the calibration technique employed. Page 41 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Exclusion of init ial calibration points without technical justification is not allowed. Where problem analytes are known, deviation to acceptance criteria mandates EMAX to seek for client approval. f) Limit of Quantitation (LOQ). LOQ is dependent on the sensitivity of the in strument. Where applicable, the lowest calibration standard determines the lowest concentration for which quantitative data are reported. For other instruments (e.g. pH meters), the reporting limit is based on the sensitivity of the instrument. Any data reported below the lower limit of quantitation is considered to have an increased quantitative uncertainty and shall be reported only when it is required by the project using defined qualifiers or flags as specified by the project or explained in the case na rrative. The reporting limit shall lie within the calibration range, at or above the LOQ. If the client requires a reporting limit that lies below the lowest standard of the calibration curve and below the LOQ, then method modification is required. For me thods that require only one standard (i.e., lower limit of curve is the origin), the reporting limit shall be no lower than a low -level check standard, designed to verify the integrity of the curve at the lower limits g) Quantitation Range. Where applicable, the highest calibration standard determines the highest concentration for which quantitative data are reported. Any data reported above this highest standard should be considered to have an increased quantitative uncertainty and shall be reported only when allowed by the project using defined qualifiers or flags specified by the project or explained in the case narrative. The range of the accepted initial calibration curve reflects the quantitation range of the samples (i.e., only those sample results with concentrations contained within the range of the calibration curve are considered to be quantitative). Any data reported outside the calibration range shall be qualified as an estimated value (i.e., by a data qualifier \"flag\") and explained in the case nar rative. When sample concentrations exceed the upper limit of the calibration curve, samples shall be diluted and re - analyzed (if possible) to bring them within the calibration curve. When sample concentrations exceed the upper limit of the calibration curv e or fall below the lower limit of the calibration curve, the resulting data shall be qualified as having estimated values and shall be flagged. h) Limit of Detection (LOD). The lowest calibration standard must be above the limit of detection. Noted exception : The following shall occur for instrument technology (such as ICP or ICP/MS) with validated techniques from manufacturers or methods employing standardization with a zero point and a single point calibration standard: 1) Linear Range is established as descri bed in EMAX -6010 or EMAX -6020. 2) A two -point calibration (zero point and single point calibration standard) is analyzed with each analytical batch. 3) A standard corresponding to the limit of quantitation is analyzed with each analytical batch and evaluated to meet established acceptance criteria. 4) The linearity is verified at a frequency established by the method and/or the manufacturer. i) Corrective Action. If the initial instrument calibration results are outside established acceptance criteria, corrective acti ons must be performed and all associated samples re -analyzed. If re -analysis of the samples is not possible, data associated with an unacceptable initial instrument calibration shall be reported with appropriate data qualifiers. j) If a reference or mandated method does not specify the number of calibration standards, the minimum number is five contiguous calibration points for organics and three contiguous calibration points for inorganics (one of Page 42 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 which must be at the limit of quantitation), not including bl anks or a zero standard with the noted exception of instrument technology for which it has been established by methodologies and procedures that a zero and a single point standard are appropriate for calibrations (see 5.5.2.2.1.h). All reported target ana lytes and surrogates are included in the initial calibration. For multi -component analytes (e.g. PCBs, toxaphene) , a separate initial calibration is performed. 5.5.3 Equipment are operated and maintained by authorized personnel only. Up -to-date instructions on t he use and maintenance of equipment (including any relevant manuals provided by the manufacturer of the equipment) are readily available for use by the appropriate laboratory personnel. All equipment are routinely maintained, inspected , and cleaned. Mainte nance procedures are included in the specific SOPs where the instrument is used and performed maintenance is recorded in the instrument maintenance logbook. 5.5.4 Instruments and data acquired from each instrument are uniquely identified. 5.5.5 Major item of equipmen t and its software significant to the environmental tests performed is maintained. Records include the following: a) Instrument ID and data acquisition software; b) manufacturer's name, type identification, and serial number or other unique identification; c) checks that equipment complies with the specification (see 5.5.2); d) current location; e) manufacturer's instructions, if available, or reference to their location; f) dates, results and copies of reports and certificates of all calibrations, adjustments, acceptance c riteria, and the due date of next calibration; g) maintenance plan, where appropriate, and maintenance carried out to date; documentation on all routine and non-routine maintenance activities and reference material verifications. h) any damage, malfunction, modi fication or repair to the equipment; i) date received and date placed in service (if available); and j) if available, condition when received (e.g., new, used, reconditioned); 5.5.6 Procedures for safe handling, transport, storage, use and planned maintenance of measu ring equipment to ensure proper functioning and in order to prevent contamination or deterioration. Refer to specific SOPs where instruments are used. 5.5.7 Where equipment has been subjected to overloading or mishandling, gives suspect results, or has shown defective or non -compliant to requirements, it is taken out of service. It is either isolated to prevent its use or clearly labeled or marked as being out of service, until it has been repaired and shown by calibration or test to perform correctly. The labora tory shall examine the effect of the defect or departure from specified limits on previous environmental tests and shall institute the \"Control of nonconforming work\" procedure (see 4.9). 5.5.8 Support equipment requiring calibration are labeled and identified t o indicate the status of calibration, the calibration reference (traceable to the equipment calibration record) and the next calibration due date. Page 43 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Analytical instruments calibrations are performed as described in the analytical SOPs. 5.5.9 When, for whatever re ason, equipment goes out -of-control, the instrument shall only be put back in use when its function and calibration status are verified to be in control. 5.5.10 Where applicable, validity of initial calibration is verified as specified by the analytical SOP or as required by the project. Analytical SOPs include: a) The details of the continuing instrument calibration procedure, calculations and associated statistics. b) Target analytes in the continuing instrument calibration verification. Multi -component analytes such as, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, or Toxaphene, a separate continuing calibration standard is analyzed. For Aroclors, a representative chemical related substance (e.g. 1016 and 1260) is used. c) Frequency of Instrument calibration verification: a. Where internal standards are employed, calibration verification is done at the beginning of each analytical run otherwise, calibration verification brackets the analytical sequence at the frequency that the method requires or as specified by the project. When the method s specify that calibration verification shall run at specific sample intervals (for example, every 10 samples), the count of these samples shall be of field samples only. In the absence of method or project requirement, at a minimum, calibration verificati on is performed at beginning and end of each analytical batch; b. Perform calibration verification whenever it is expected that the analytical system may be out of calibration or might not meet the verification acceptance criteria; c. Perform calibration verifi cation if the time period for calibration or the most previous calibration verification has expired (e.g. 12 -hour analytical cycle or every 20 field samples); or d. Perform calibration verification for all analytical systems that contain a calibration verific ation requirement. d) Retention of Records. Sufficient raw data records are retained to permit reconstruction of the continuing instrument calibration verification, e.g., test method, instrument, analysis date, each analyte name, concentration and response, c alibration curve or response factor, or unique equations or coefficients used to convert instrument responses into concentrations, analyst name. Continuing calibration verification records are uniquely identified to link with the initial instrument calibra tion identification. Refer to Analytical and QC Labeling SOP (EMAX -SM04) for details. Corrections to any of these records include a complete audit trail for those manipulations. e) Acceptance Criteria. Continuing calibration verification (CCV) is evaluated in accordance to the method requirement or as required by the project data quality objectives. Where no method requirements exist, CCV standards are analyzed at or below the middle of the calibration range using the same source as the initial calibration and acceptance criteria is modeled on similar analytical technology. When CCV is non -compliant, a second consecutive (immediate) calibration verification may be considered if the result is indicative that it is not due to instrumentation problem. When this op tion is exercise d, refer to the project requirements for CCV concentration level (DoD QSM requires different levels within the original calibration curve). If the CCV still fails or a second attempt is not considered, execute the corrective actions suggest ed on the specific analytical SOP. If routine corrective action procedures fail to meet the acceptance criteria, further instrument evaluation and/or maintenance is undertaken to the extent necessary to correct the problem. When the instrument's condition is restored to normal status, a new initial instrument calibration is established and validated. Samples affected by the non -compliant Page 44 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 CCVs are re -analyzed. Where re -analysis is not possible and results must be reported, data associated with non - compliant CCVs data are reported as specified by the project, otherwise the following conditions are implemented: 1) when the acceptance criteria for the continu ing calibration verification exceed ed high, i.e., high bias, and there are associated samples that are non -detects, then those non -detects may be reported. Otherwise the samples affected by the unacceptable calibration verification are flagged and explained in the case narrative 2) when the acceptance criteria for the continui ng calibration verification exceed ed low, i.e., low bias, those sample results may be reported if they exceed a maximum regulatory limit/decision level. Otherwise the samples affected by the unacceptable verification are flagged and explained in the case narrative. 5.5.11 Where calibrations give ris e to a set of correction factors, new instrument parameter settings are posted with the affected instrumentation (e.g., in computer software) where it is routinely used as checklist for instrument parameter check prior to sample analysis. 5.5.12 Limited access to laboratories is instituted so that test equipment, including both hardware and software, are safeguarded from adjustments when authorized instrument users are not around. 5.6 Measurement Traceability 5.6.1 General All equipment used for environmental tests, includi ng equipment for subsidiary measurements (e.g., for environmental conditions) having a significant effect on the accuracy or validity of the result of the environmental test or sampling are calibrated before being put into service and on a continuing basis . Quality control procedures are established systems for selecting, using, c alibrating, checking controlling , and maintaining support equipment as well as the calibration standards, (e.g. standard weights, standard thermometers). The laboratory shall have an established program and procedure for the calibration of its equipment. Calibration procedures for analytical instruments are detailed in the analytical SOPs. 5.6.2 Analytical Laboratories 5.6.2.1 Equipment measurement accuracy is dependent on its sensitiv ity. Every measuring device has uncertainty of measurement and is derived from its deviation from expected value. a) To ensure that measurements are traceable to national standards of measurement, analytical calibration standards used at EMAX are purchased traceable to NIST, calibration weights and calibration thermometers are sent to NIST calibration laboratories (or equivalent). 5.6.2.2 Where traceability of measurements to SI units is not possible and/or not relevant, the same requirements for traceability to, for example, ce rtified reference materials, agreed methods and/or consensus standards, are used. To provide satisfactory evidence of correlation of results, EMAX participates in proficiency testing, or independent analysis. 5.6.3 Reference Standards and Reference Materials 5.6.3.1 Reference Standards Reference standards (e.g., balance weights, traceable thermometers) are purchased traceable to national standard of measurement. These standards are calibrated by a NIST certified calibration laboratory (or equiva lent) at least once a year. These standards are used for calibration purposes only. 5.6.3.2 Reference Materials Page 45 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Where commercially available, all referen ce materials used at EMAX are purchased certified traceable to SI units of measurement, or to certified reference materials. Where possib le, traceability shall be to national or international standards of measurement or to national or international standard reference materials. Internal reference materials are checked as far as is technically and economically practicable. 5.6.3.3 Intermediate Check s Checks needed to maintain confidence in the status of reference, primary, transfer or working standards and reference materials are carried out according to defined procedures and schedules. 5.6.3.4 Transport and Storage Procedures for safe handling, transport, storage , and use of reference standards and materials in order to prevent contamination or deterioration and in order to protect their integrity are also included in the relevant SOPs. Refer to QC procedures for details. 5.6.4 Documentation and Labeling of Sta ndards, Reagents, and Reference Materials SOP for Purchasing (EMAX -QA09) describes the procedures for the purchase, reception , and storage of consumable materials used for the technical operations. a) Records are retained for all standards, reagents, referenc e materials , and media including the manufacturer/vendor, the manufacturer's Certificate of Analysis or purity (if supplied), the date of receipt, recommended storage conditions, and an expiration date after which the material shall not be used unless its reliability is verified by the user. b) Original containers (such as provided by the manufacturer or vendor) are labeled with an expiration date. c) Standards preparation logbooks are used to record standard and reference material preparation. These records are traceable to certificates of analysis from manufacturers indicating traceability to purchased stocks or neat compounds, reference to the method of preparation, lot numbers for the standard, date of preparation, expiration date and preparer's initials. d) All containers of prepared standards and reference materials bear a unique identifier and expiration date and linked to the documentation requirements in 5.6.4.c above. e) Analytical SOPs include the procedures for preparing reagents to meet the requirements of t he test method. The source of reagents shall comply with 5.9.2a) 6) and D.1.4b). f) All containers of prepared reagents bear identification a preparation date, expiration date , and the initials of the reagent preparer. 5.7 Sampling 5.7.1 Obtaining sample aliquots from a submitted sample is carried out as part of the test method. Procedures and appropriate techniques to obtain representative sub -samples are detailed in the analytical SOPs. 5.7.2 Where the client requires deviations, additions , or exclusions from the documented sub-sampling procedure, these are recorded referencing the source of instruction included in all documents containing environmental test results. The se instructions are included in the work order distributed in the laboratory as part of the project specif ic requirement, and shall be communicated to the appropriate personnel. 5.7.3 Sub-sampling activities are documented in the appropriate laboratory logbook. Samples taken from the sample control room for sub -sampling are recorded in the internal chain of custody (ICOC). Aliquots taken are Page 46 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 recorded in the appropriate sample preparation or analytical log. The records also include the date and initials of the personnel that executed the sub -sampling. 5.8 Handling of Samples To ensure the validity of EMAX's data the foll owing procedures are established. 5.8.1 Sample Management SOPs. These procedures describe transportation, receipt, handling, protection, storage, retention and/or disposal of samples, including all provisions necessary to protect the integrity of the sample, and to protect the interests of EMAX, the community it serves and its clients. 5.8.2 EMAX -SM01 describes the system for ident ifying samples. The identification is retained throughout the life of the sample in the laboratory. The system is designed and operated so that each container is uniquely identified, and a storage address is provided as to ensure that samples cannot be confused physically or when referred to in records or other documents. The sample storage system is designed for ease of storing and locating samples. a) Sample Management SOPs also include a system for storing samples to ensure that there can be no confusion regarding the identity of such samples at any time. This system include s identification for all samples, sub - samples and subsequent extracts and/or digestates. Samples are labeled with a unique identification (ID) code for each sample container received in the laboratory. b) This laboratory code is an unequivocal link with the unique field ID code assigned each container. c) The laboratory ID code is placed on the sample container as a durable label. d) The laboratory ID code is used in the laboratory records (see 5.8.3.1.d) as internal identification in sample transfers, sample preparation, sample analysis, sample disposal an d other related laboratory a ctivities. This identification is link ed to the field sample ID through the electronic sample login. Reports shall bear the laboratory identification and the field sample ID. e) In cases where the laboratory pre -assigns numbers to sample containers, the labor atory ID code may be the same as the field ID code. 5.8.3 SOP for sample receiving is detailed in EMAX -SM02. Upon receipt of the samples, the condition, including any abnormalities or departures from normal or specified conditions as described in the environment al test method, are recorded. When there is doubt as to the suitability of a sample for environmental test, or when a sample does not conform to the description provided, or the environmental test required is not specified in sufficient detail, the Project Manager is informed immediately so that the sample condition is communicated to the client for further instructions before proceeding. Discrepancies and instructions on how to proceed is recorded in the sample receipt form and/or attached documents to sam ple receipt forms. 5.8.3.1 Sample Receipt Protocols a) All items specified in 5.8.3.2 below are checked. 1) All samples which require thermal preservation is considered acceptable if the arrival temperature is either within 2\u00b0C of the required temperature or the method specified range. For samples with a specified temperature of 4\u00b0C, samples with a temperature ranging from just above the freezing temperature of water to 6\u00b0C shall be acceptable. Samples that are hand delivered to the laboratory on the same day that they a re collected not meeting the thermal preservation requirement shall be considered acceptable if there is evidence that the chilling process has begun such as arrival on ice. Page 47 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 Temperature measurement, when provided, shall be verified through temperature blan ks are included in the sample coolers. 2) Chemical preservation is checked using readily available techniques, such as pH or chlorine, during sample receiving. When sample chemical preservation cannot be checked (e.g., volatile samples) preservation is checke d during analysis. b) The results of all checks are recorded. c) If the sample does not meet the sample receipt acceptance criteria listed in this standard, the laboratory shall either: 1) retain correspondence and/or records of conversations concerning the final disposition of rejected samples; or 2) fully document any decision to proceed with the analysis of samples not meeting acceptance criteria. i. The conditions of these samples, at a minimum, are noted in the sample receipt forms or as specified in the project req uirement. ii. Records of instruction on how to proceed shall be retained and final report shall include these documentations when required by the project. Where there is doubt as to the sample's suitability for testing, where the sample does not conform to the description provided, or where the test required is not fully specified, the client is consulted by the Project Manager at a timely manner for further instruction before proceeding. d) Permanent chronological record such as a logbook and electronic login sy stem is used to document receipt of all sample containers. Electronic data systems shall meet the requirements specified in Section 5.4.7.2. 1) The sample receipt form (SRF) include s but not limited to: i. client/project name, ii. date and time of laboratory receipt , iii. unique laboratory ID code (see 5.8.2), and iv. signature or initials of the person making the entries. 2) Samples are logged in such a way that all pertinent information linked to the sample is traceable. All the records generated during sample receiving become permanent records, easily retrievable upon request and readily available to individuals who will process the sample. The EMAX sample control number is linked to the following: i. The field ID code which identifies each container ii. The date and time of sample collection linked to the sample container to the date and time of receipt iii. The requested analyses (including applicable approved test method numbers) iv. Any comments resulting from inspection for sample rejection Page 48 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 e) All documentation, such as memos or transmittal forms, that are transmitted to the laboratory by the sample transmitter are retained in the master folder that contains all pertinent records related to a sample delivery batch. f) The original chain of custody record form (Sections 4.12.2.5 and Appendix E), is included in the master folder. Internal chain of custody is recorded and maintained with the laboratory logbooks. 5.8.3.2 Sample Acceptance Policy Prior to project commencement, capabilities to accept new samples are confirmed with the Operations. When additio nal project requirements concerning sample acceptance (e.g., safety caution, samples needs to be filtered and preserved, etc.), implementation process are discussed with the Operations by the Project Manger. Policies and procedures for sample acceptance po licy are detailed in EMAX -SM02. This SOP clearly outlines the circumstances under which samples are accepted or rejected. Data from any samples which do not meet the following criteria are noted in the sample receipt form (SRF) clearly defining the nature and substance of the discrepancy. This SOP is also made available t o sample receiving personnel who are also trained to properly implement this SOP. Training includes, but is not limited to, the following areas of concern: a) proper, full, and complete docume ntation, which shall include sample identification, the location, date and time of collection, collector's name, preservation type, sample type and any special remarks concerning the sample; b) proper sample labeling to include unique identification and a lab eling system for the samples with requirements concerning the durability of the labels (water resistant) use of indelible ink and laboratory label does not obscure field identification; c) use of appropriate sample containers; d) adherence to specified holding t imes; e) adequate sample volume. Sufficient sample volume must be available to perform the necessary tests; and f) course of action when samples show signs of damage, contamination , or inadequate preservation. 5.8.4 Samples received at EMAX are stored as specified by the method and/or project requirement. To prevent deterioration, contamination, loss or damage to the sample during storage, handling, preparation and testing, policies and procedures are established. Monitoring of sample storage is detailed in MEAX -QC03. Sample Handling for Highly Contaminated Samples is detailed in EMAX -QC08. In the event that special handling instructions are provided by the client, these instructions are incorporated as part of the work -order instructions. When samples have to be stored or conditioned under specified environmental conditions, these conditions are maintained, monitored and recorded. All samples received at EMAX are held secured in the sample control room that protects the condition and integrity of the secured samples. a) Samples are stored according to the conditions specified in EMAX -SM01: 1) Samples which require thermal preservation are stored under refrigeration which is +/ -2 of the specified preservation temperature unless method specific criteria exist. For samples with a specified storage temperature of 4\u00b0C, samples are stored at a temperature above the freezing point of water to 6\u00b0C. To ensure that samples remain within acceptable thermal preservation, temperature and sample storage are monitored twice a day, sev en days a week. Page 49 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 2) Sample control room contain s environmental field samples only. To prevent cross -contamination, pure products, PT samples or samples that are known to have high concentrations and/or highly contaminated are segregated from the regular samples. b) Samp le fractions, extracts, leachates and other sample preparation products are stored according to 5.8.4.a above or according to specifications in the test method. 1) Sample disposal for residual samples, digestates, leachates and extracts or other sample prepar ation products is detailed in EAMX -SM03. This SOP is in conformance with Federal, State and local regulations. 5.9 Assuring the Quality of Environmental Test and Calibration Results 5.9.1 General Quality control procedures for monitoring the validity of environmenta l tests undertaken are included in the analytical SOPs. Quality control results are collected and evaluated according to EMAX -QA06, Control Chart SOP. Data is collected and appended on a database where a control chart can be plotted specific to inclusive d ates. The resulting data is use d to analyze for possible trends and statistical techniques are applied to review the results. Monitoring includes evaluation of the following: a) Laboratory Control Samples; b) Results of PT samples. c) Replicate tests results from t he same or different methods; d) Retesting of retained samples; e) Correlation of results for different characteristics of a sample (for example, total phosphate should be greater than or equal to orthophosphate). Every work order includes project QC requirement . In the absence of project QC requirement, EMAX quality control procedures are applied. These requirements are monitored and evaluated on time while samples are analyzed to evaluate the quality and usability of data. Where QC requirement is not met and pr escribed corrective action does not resolve the problem, the Supervisor and the PM are informed for further instruction. Where necessary, non -conformance report is generated. Supplemental review of these checks is performed during annual internal assessmen t. 5.9.2 Essential Quality Control Procedures These general quality control principles are applied, where appropriate. The manner in which they are implemented is dependent on the types of tests performed (refer to Appendix D). Quality control actions should be both batch -specific and time -based (i.e., those required to be conducted at specific time periods, such as for tunes and detection limit verification. Batch -specific quality control actions include sample -specific quality control actions such as surrogate spikes, LCS, duplicate samples. The standards for any given test type shall assure that the applicable principles are addressed: a) Monitoring of basic quality controls to include: 1) positive and negative controls to monitor tests such as blanks, spikes, refere nce materials; 2) tests to define the variability and/or repeatability of the laboratory results such as replicates; Page 50 of 54 EMAX -QS00 Rev. 2 Based On NELAC 2003 & DoD QSM 2006 3) measures to assure the accuracy of the test method including calibration and/or continuing calibrations, use of certified reference materials, proficiency test samples, or other measures; 4) measures to evaluate test method capability, such as limit of detection and limit of quantitation or range of applicability such as linearity; 5) selection of appropriate formulae to reduce raw data to final resul ts such as regression analysis, comparison to internal/external standard calculations, and statistical analyses; 6) selection and use of reagents and standards of appropriate quality; 7) measures to assure the selectivity of the test for its intended purpose; an d 8) measures to assure constant and consistent test conditions (both instrumental and environmental) where required by the test method such as temperature, humidity, light, or specific instrument conditions. b) On-going assessment and evaluation quality control measures and application of quality control acceptance criteria to determine the usability of the data. c) Establish procedures for the development of acceptance/rejection criteria where no method or regulatory criteria exist. (See 5.8.3.2, Sample Acceptanc e Policy.) d) Proper implementation of established quality control protocols specified in analytical SOPs (5.4.1.2). Essential standards outlined in Appendix D or mandated methods or regulations (whichever are more stringent) are incorporated in analytical SO Ps. When it is not apparent which is more stringent the QC in the ma ndated method or regulations is followed. Project specific requirement other than specified in analytical SOPs are incorporated through project management. The essential quality control me asures for testing are found in Appendix D. 5.10 Reporting the Results 5.10.1 General The results of each environmental test performed at EMAX are reported accurately, clearly, unambiguously and objectively, and in accordance with any specific instructions in the envi ronmental test and project specific requirement. EMAX data reporting system is designed to include all pertinent information. Deliverables include all of the information required by the project necessary for the interpretation of the environmental test res ults and all information required by the method used. For standard requirements, refer to 5.10.2 and 5.10.3. Where the project requires simplified deliverables, EMAX delivers what is required and archives all information on how the environmental test is ca rried out readily available.

Procedures for DOC are detailed in EMAX -QA05. Capability - Change: \"Change\" refers to any change in personnel, instrumentation, test method, or sample matrix that potentially impacts the precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity of the output (for example, a change in the detector, column, or other components of the sample analytical system, or a method revision). All new analysts, regardless of experience on that instrument in another laboratory, shall complete a demonstration of capability. Although in some areas of the laboratory, a group of individuals are needed to complete the entire analytical process, EMAX certifies its technical staff individually. Each member of the group demonstrates capability in his/her area of responsibility in the sequence. Since majority of EMAX's field samples are aqueous and soil matrices, lab control sample (LCS) or PT samples are used for demonstration of capability. In addition, for analytes which do not lend themselves to spiking, e.g., TSS, the demonstration of capability may be performed using quality control samples. All demonstrations are documented through the use of the form in this appendix. All data applicable to the demonstration are retained on a personnel file . When an analyte not currently found on the laboratory 's list of accredited analytes is added to an existing accredited test method, an initial evaluation must be performed for that analyte. General guidelines for demonstration of capability: a) Where commercially available, quality samples used for demonstratio n of capability is obtained from a secondary source as certified solutions. If not available, the QC sample s are prepared in-house using stock standards that are prepared independently from those used in instrument calibration. b) The analyte(s) are spiked in a volume of clean quality system matrix sufficient to prepare four aliquots at the LCS concentration level , or if unspecified, to a concentration of 1 -4 times the limit of quantitation. c) At least four aliquots are prepared and analyzed according to the tes t method either concurrently or over a period of days. d) The mean recovery and standard deviation of results are evaluated . When it is not possible to determine mean and standard deviations, such as for presence/absence and logarithmic values, the performanc e is assessed against the established and documented criteria. In the case where a new method is developed, acceptance criteria is determined using external source of information when available (e.g., published method). In the absence of external source of information, EMAX shall request from the project sponsor (e.g., DoD or DoE) for comparisons or guidance for acceptance criteria. e) Results are accepted based on the a cceptance criteria for precision and accuracy in the test method (if applicable) or the gen erated control limits (in the absence of established mandatory criteria). If all parameters meet the acceptance criteria, the analysis of actual samples may begin. If any one of the parameters does not meet the acceptance criteria, the performance is unacc eptable for that parameter. f) When one or more of the tested parameters fail at least one of the acceptance criteria, the analyst must : 1) Locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the test for all parameters of interest beginning with c) above ; or 2) Beginning with c) above, repeat the test for all parameters that failed to meet criteria. Repeated failure, however, confirms a general problem with the measurement system. If this occurs, locate and correct the source of the problem and repeat the tes t for all compounds of interest beginning with c).

A copy of the certification statement is retained in the personnel rec ords of each affected employee (see 5.2.5 and 4.12.2.5.4.b). All repeated incidences of testing to meet a demonstration of capability is documented and included in the submittal of demonstration of capability . Refer to EMAX -QA05 Figure 5 for DOC Certificat ion Statement. This certification form is completed each time a demonstration o f capability study is completed with proof that it is: True: Consistent with supporting data. Accurate: Based on good laboratory practices consistent with sound scientific princ iples/practices. Complete: Includes the results of all supporting performance testing. Self-Explanatory: Data properly labeled and stored so that the results are clear and require no additional explanation . C.3 INITIAL TEST METHOD EVALUATION For all test meth ods apply C.3.1 and C.3.2 . For the evaluation of precision and bias (C.3.3), the requirements of C.3.3(a) apply to standard methods. The requirements of C.3.3(b) apply to the methods referenced therein. C.3.1 Limit of Detection (LOD) a) Where quantitation is deriv ed from multi -calibration points and the analyte can be qualitatively identified at a concentration level of the lowest calibration point, the LOD is determined set at half of the lowest calibration point . All sample -processing steps of the analytical meth od are performed when verifying the LOD. b) The validity of the LOD is confirmed by qualitative identification of the analyte(s) in a QC sample in each quality system matrix containing the analyte at no more than 2 -3X the LOD for single analyte tests and 1 -4X the LOD for multiple analyte tests. This verification is performed on every instrument that is to be used for analysis of samples and reporting of data. Qualitative identification is performed as specified in the analytical SOP. c) Where an LOD study is not performed (any analyte for which spiking solutions or quality control samples are not available such as temperature, pH) or, when test results are not to be reported to the LOD, determination of LOD is not required. C.3.2 Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) a) Where quant itation is derived from multi -calibration points, the LOQ for each analyte of concern is the lowest calibration point. Otherwise, it is determined by the sensitivity of the analytical instrument. b) The LOQ study is not required for any component or property for which spiking solutions or quality control samples are not commercially available or otherwise inappropriate (e.g., pH). c) The validity of the LOQ is confirmed by successful analysis of a QC sample containing the analytes of concern in each quality syste m matrix 1 -2 times the claimed LOQ. A successful analysis is one where the recovery of each analyte is within the established test method acceptance criteria or client data quality objectives for accuracy. This single analysis is not required if the bias a nd precision of the measurement system is evaluated at the LOQ. EMAX -QS00 Revisi on 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX C Page 4 of 5 DEMONSTRATION OF CAPABILITY C.3.3 Evaluation of Precision and Bias a) Standard methods - precision and bias of a standard method for each analyte of concern for each quality system matrix is established by evaluat ing a single -concentration of four-replicate recovery study , or LCS data collected over a period of time (e.g. a year or minimum of 20 data points). b) Non-standard methods - precision and bias is established as defined at 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 . Where the method is developed fo r a certain project, precision and bias is defined as guided by the project the data quality objectives of the project, with the criteria established by the client, or the criteria given i n the reference method . Precision and bias measurements are evaluate d across the analytical calibration range of the method using t he relevant quality system matrices and process the samples through the entire measurement system for each analyte of interest. The mean percent recovery and standard deviation for the LCS for non-standard methods are calculated and compared to the project sponsor published LCS mean percent recovery and standard deviation ( e.g. DoD - Appendix D). In the absence of project sponsor published LCS, the in -house generated limits should be used. In eith er case, the calculated mean and standard deviation must be at least as good as the DoD published limits, where they exist, or as good or better than the published limits for similar methods or technologies. In no case should the lower LCS control limit be less than 10%. Guidelines for evaluat ing precision and bias : Analyze QC samples in triplicate containing the analytes of concern at or near the limit of quantitation, at the upper -range of the calibration (upper 20%) and at a mid -range concentration. Process these samples on different days as three sets of samples through the entire measurement system for each analyte of interest. Each day one QC sample at each concentration is analyzed. A separate method blank shall be subjected to the analytical method along with the QC samples on each of the three days. (Note that the three samples at the LOQ concentration can demonstrate sensitivity as well.) For each analyte, calculate the mean recovery for each day, for each level over days, and for all nine samples. Calculate the relative standard deviation for each of the separate means obtained. Compare the standard deviations for the different days and the standard deviations for the different concentrations. If the different standard deviations are all statistica lly insignificant (e.g., F -test), then compare the overall mean and standard deviation with the established criteria from above. A validation protocol such as the Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III requirements in US EPA Office of Water's Alternate Test Procedu re (ATP) approval process. C.3.4 Evaluation of Selectivity Evaluate selectivity by following the checks established within the method, which may include mass spectral tuning, second column confirmation, ICP inter -element interference checks, chromatography reten tion time windows, sample blanks, spectrochemical absorption or fluorescence profiles, co -precipitation evaluations, and electrode response factors. New Matrix: Prior to initial analysis of a new or unknown sample matrix, a minimum of 3 MS/MSD samples in s aid matrix must be analyzed. The spike concentration should be within a range of 1 -4 times the estimated concentration of the environmental samples, if known, otherwise, at the regulatory limit or mid -point of the calibration range, whichever is lower. The percent mean recoveries and standard deviations for each analyte recovered in the new matrix must be compared to the project LCS means and control limits generated for clean matrices and should be at least as good as those published by the project sponsor . Selectivity for Non -Standard Methods: When a historic selectivity check has not been identified, the most common selectivity check for a similar method or what is most typically used for the specific instrument or technology is applied.

CHEMICAL TESTING ................................ ................................ .............................. ................................ ................................ ................................ ....2 D.1.1.2 Positive Control - Method EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 APPENDIX D Page 2 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS The quality control protocols specified by the analytical SOPs (5.4.1.2) are applied unless otherwise a different requirement is specified by the project . Essential standards outlined in Appendix D are incorporated int o the analytical SOPs . All quality control measures are assessed and evaluated on an on -going basis and quality control acceptance criteria used to determine the validity of the data is distributed with every work order . Likewise, all procedures develop ed at EMAX shall have established acceptance/rejection criteria where no method or regulatory criteria exists. The requirements from 5.9.2, apply to all types of testing. The specific manner in which they are implemented is detailed in each of the following section . DoD Quality Control Requirements: Appendix DoD -D contains tables that consolidate DoD data quality requirements that apply to EPA's Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846). In addition, introductory material iden tifies definitions of QC checks and clarifies DoD's interpretation of method requirements. This appendix follows all the NELAC appendices. D.1. CHEMICAL TESTING D.1.1 Positive and Negative Controls D.1.1.1 Negative Control - Method Performance a) Purpose: The method blank is u sed to assess the preparation batch for possible contamination during the preparation and processing steps. The method blank is processed along with and under the same conditions as the associated samples to include all steps of the analytical procedure. P rocedures are in place to determine if a method blank is contaminated. Any affected samples associated with a contaminated method blank are reprocessed for analysis or the results reported with appropriate data qualifying codes. b) Frequency: The method blank is analyzed at a minimum of 1 per preparation batch. In those instances for which no separate preparation method is used (example: volatiles in water) the batch is defined as environmental samples that are analyzed together with the same method and person nel, using the same lots of reagents, not to exceed the analysis of 20 environmental samples. c) Composition: The method blank is a quality system matrix that is similar to the associated samples and is known to be free of the analytes of interest. d) Evaluation Criteria and Corrective Action: While the goal is to have no detectable contaminants, each method blank must be critically evaluated as to the nature of the interference and the effect on the analysis of each sample within the batch. The concentration of a targeted analyte in the blank is at or above the reporting limit as established by the test method or by regulation, AND is greater than 1/10 of the amount measured in any sample. For DoD sponsored projects, if the method blank contamination exceeds one-half the reporting limit, evaluate whether reprocessing of the samples is necessary based on the above criteria. The concentrations of common laboratory contaminants shall not exceed the reporting limit. Any sample associated with a blank that fail these criteria checks shall be reprocessed in a subsequent preparation batch, except when the sample analysis resulted in a non -detect. The source of contamination shall be investigated and measures are taken to minimize or eliminate the problem and affected sa mples reprocessed or data shall be appropriately qualified if: 1) If no sample volume remains for reprocessing, the results shall be reported with appropriate data qualifying codes 2) The blank contamination otherwise affects the sample results as per the test m ethod requirements or the individual project data quality objectives. EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 3 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS 3) When quality control measures fail the acceptance criteria, corrective action shall be taken based on project -specific requirements or project sponsor requirements and the magnitude of t he problem. Where applicable, c orrective actions may include: Determ ining the source of the problem Notifying the client, Reprocessing samples, Using data qualifiers to \"flag\" data, and Adding commentary in the case narrative . D.1.1.2 Positive Control - Method P erformance D.1.1.2.1 Laboratory Control Sample (LCS) a) Purpose: The LCS is used to evaluate the performance of the total analytical system, including all preparation and analysis steps. Results of the LCS are compared to established criteria . LCS found outside of thes e criteria indicates that the analytical system is \"out of control\". Any affected samples associated with an out of control LCS are reprocessed for re -analysis or the results are reported with appropriate data qualifying codes. b) Frequency: The LCS is analyz ed at a minimum of 1 per preparation batch. Exceptions would be for those analytes for which no spiking solutions are available such as total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, total volatile solids, total solids, pH, color, odor, temperature, disso lved oxygen or turbidity. In those instances for which no separate preparation method is used (example: volatiles in water) the batch shall be defined as environmental samples that are analyzed together with the same method and personnel, using the same lo ts of reagents, not to exceed the analysis of 20 environmental samples. c) Composition: The LCS is a quality system matrix, known to be free of analytes of interest, spiked with known and verified concentrations of analytes. NOTE: the matrix spike may be used in place of this control as long as the acceptance criteria are as stringent as for the LCS. Alternatively the LCS may consist of a media containing known and verified concentrations of analytes or as Certified Reference Material (CRM). All analyte concen trations shall be within the calibration range of the methods. The following shall be used in choosing components for the spike mixtures: The components to be spiked are as specified by the mandated test method or other regulatory requirement or as request ed by the client. In the absence of specified spiking components the laboratory shall spike per the following: For those components that interfere with an accurate assessment such as spiking simultaneously with technical chlordane, toxaphene and PCBs, the spike should be chosen that represents the chemistries and elution patterns of the components to be reported. For those test methods that have extremely long lists of analytes, a representative number may be chosen unless otherwise specified by the project . The analytes selected are representative of all analytes reported. The following criteria are used for determining the minimum number of analytes to be spiked . 1) For methods that include 1 -10 targets, spike all components; 2) For methods that include 11 -20 targets, spike at least 10 or 80%, whichever is greater; 3) For methods with more than 20 targets, spike at least 16 components. To ensure that all targeted components are included in the spike mixture over a 2 - year period, include all target analytes when performing PT samples. Spiking Compounds for DoD sponsored projects: EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 4 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS All target analytes must be spiked in the LCS. Target analytes are defined by the project or in Appendix DoD -C. For evaluation and acceptance criteria see Appendices DoD -B and DoD -D. For multi -component analytes (e.g. PCBs), the LCS should be spiked with the same constituents as the calibration standard. Multiple samples may be necessary to avoid interference. The concentration of the spiked compounds shall be at or below the midpoint of the calibration range or at the appropriate level of concern. d) Evaluation Criteria and Corrective Action: The results of the individual batch LCS are calculated in percent recovery unless otherwise specified by the project or the method . Calculations are do cumented and reported as specified by the project. The individual LCS is compared to the acceptance criteria as published in the mandated test method. Where there are no established criteria, the laboratory shall determine internal criteria and document th e method used to establish the limits or utilize client specified assessment criteria. DoD Laboratory Control Sample (LCS): The acceptability of LCS results within a preparatory batch shall be determined using project -specified limits or the DoD limits ( refer to Appendix DoD -D) If DoD limits are not available for certain analytes, LCS acceptability shall be based on its in -house limits. Control limits are evaluated at mean \u00b1 3 times the standard deviation of LCS percent recovery. In addition, control chart s are maintained and used to detect trends and prevent out of control conditions. Control limits are continually monitored for shifts in mean recovery, changes in standard deviation, and development of trends. Refer to EMAX -QA06 for generation and updati ng procedures of control limits and control chart evaluation. A LCS that is determined to be within the criteria effectively establishes that the analytical system is in control and validates system performance for the samples in the associated batch. Sample s analyzed along with a LCS determined to be \"out of control\" is considered questionable requiring the samples reprocessed and re -analyzed or the data reported with appropriate data qualifying codes. e) Application of Marginal Exceedance Limits (ME): If a lar ge number of analytes are in the LCS, it becomes statistically likely that a few will be outside control limits. This may not indicate that the system is out of control; therefore corrective action may not be necessary. Upper and lower marginal exceedance (ME) limits can be established to determine when corrective action is necessary. A ME is defined as being beyond the LCS control limit (3 standard deviations), but within the ME limits. ME limits is 4 standard deviations around the mean. The number of allo wable marginal exceedances is based on the number of analytes in the LCS. If more analytes exceed the LCS control limits than is allowed, or if any one analyte exceeds the ME limits, the LCS fails and corrective action is necessary. This marginal exceedanc e approach is relevant for methods with long lists of analytes. It will not apply to target analyte lists with fewer than 11 analytes. The number of allowable marginal exceedances is as follows: 1) >90 analytes in LCS, 5 allowed limit; 2) 71-90 analytes in LCS, control limit; 3) 51-70 analytes in LCS, 3 analytes control limit; 4) 31-50 analytes in LCS, 2 analytes control limit; 5) 11-30 analytes in LCS, 1 analytes control limit; 6) <11 analytes in LCS, no analytes allowed in ME of the LCS control limit; For DoD sponsored projects, application of ME does not allow any project -specific analytes of concern to exceed its LCS control limi ts, even marginally. In addition, DoD does not feel it is appropriate to control batch acceptance on poor performing analytes. EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 5 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS Marginal exceedances must be random. If the same analyte exceeds the LCS control limit repeatedly, it is an indication of a syste mic problem. The source of the error must be located and corrective action taken. All LCS results are collected and monitored including those that fall within marginal exceedance allowance to ensure random behavior. However, the same analyte exceeding the LCS control limit 2 out of 3 consecutive LCS is considered indicative of non -random behavior . D.1.1.3 Sample Specific Controls Where applicable, the effect of the sample matrix on method performance is determined with the analytical batch. These procedures relate to the analyses of matrix specific Quality Control (QC) samples and are designed as data quality indicators for a specific sample using the designated test method. Matrix specific QC include: Matrix Spike (MS); Matrix Spike Duplicate (MSD); sample duplicat es; and surrogate spikes. Evaluation of matrix managing, and handling matrix specific QC criteria including spiking appropriate components at appropriate concentrations, calculating recoveries and relative percent difference, evaluating and reporting resul ts based on performance of the QC samples. D.1.1.3.1 Matrix Spike : Matrix Spike Duplicates a) Purpose: Matrix specific QC samples indicate the effect of the sample matrix on the precision and accuracy of the results generated using the selected method. The informatio n from these controls is sample/matrix specific and would not normally be used to determine the validity of the entire batch. b) Frequency: The frequency of the analysis of matrix specific samples is dependent on the Data Quality Objectives of the project unl ess otherwise mandated by the test method. When sample amount is not adequate it shall be noted on the case narrative. c) Composition: The components of the spike are specified in the analytical SOPs unless otherwise specified by the project. Any permit speci fied analytes, as specified by regulation or client requested analytes shall also be included. For DoD projects all target analytes must be spiked in the project -specific MS and MSD. For multi -component analytes (e.g., PCBs), the project -specific MS and MSD should be spiked with the same constituents as the calibration standard. Multiple samples may be necessary to avoid interference. The concentration of the spiked compounds shall be at or below the midpoint of the calibration range or at the appropriat e level of concern. d) Evaluation Criteria and Corrective Action: The results from matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate are primarily designed to assess the precision and accuracy of analytical results in a given matrix and are expressed as percent recovery ( %R), relative percent difference (RPD), or as specified by the project. Calculations for %R and RPD are detailed in the analytical SOPs. Results are compared to project acceptance criteria. Where there are no established acceptance criteria, the in - house statistically generated MS/MSD control limits are applied. Results and calculations are reviewed and data are archived with the data package. MS/MSD recoveries outside the project limits are discussed in the case narrative unless otherwise other corrective action is mandated by the project. D.1.1.3.2 Matrix Duplicates a) Purpose: Matrix duplicates are defined as replicate aliquots of the same sample taken through the entire analytical procedure. The results from this analysis indicate the precision of the results for t he specific sample using the selected method. The matrix duplicate provides a usable measure of precision only when target analytes are found in the sample chosen for duplication. EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 6 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS b) Frequency: The frequency of the analysis of matrix duplicates is also depen dent on the Data Quality Objectives of the project unless otherwise mandated by the test method. Methods that do not require MS duplicate analysis should be performed at a minimum frequency of once per preparatory batch per matrix type. When sample amount is not adequate it shall be noted on the case narrative c) Composition: Matrix duplicates are performed on replicate aliquots of actual samples. The composition is usually not known. d) Evaluation Criteria and Corrective Action: The results from matrix duplicate s are primarily designed to assess the precision of analytical results in a given matrix and are expressed as relative percent difference (RPD) or another statistical treatment (e.g., absolute differences). Calculations for RPD are detailed in the analytic al SOPs. Results are compared to the acceptance criteria specified in the analytical SOPs unless specified by the project. Matrix duplicates results outside established criteria are discussed in the c ase narrative or as specified b y the project. D.1.1.3.3 Surrogate Spikes a) Purpose: Surrogates are used most often in organic chromatography test methods and are chosen to reflect the chemistries of the targeted components of the method. Added prior to sample preparation/extraction, they provide a measure of recovery for e very sample matrix. b) Frequency: Except where the matrix precludes its use or when not commercially available, surrogate compounds must be added to all samples, standards, and blanks for all appropriate test methods. c) Composition: Surrogate compounds chosen t o represent the various chemistries of the target are specified in the analytical SOPs. d) Evaluation Criteria and Corrective Action: The results are compared to project -specific acceptance criteria. Where there are no established criteria, the in -house stat istically generated surrogate control limits are applied. Surrogates outside the acceptance criteria are evaluated for the effect indicated for the individual sample results. The appropriate corrective action applied is guided by the data quality objective s or other site specific requirements. Results reported from analyses with surrogate recoveries outside the acceptance criteria are qualified per project requirement. D.1.2 Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation All documentation for generating and verif ying LOD and LOQ are retained and reviewed by the Operations Manager. Document s shall include all supporting data, sample preparation information, raw data, calculations and reviews. These documents are also reviewed during internal assessment and shall be available for external assessment. D.1.2.1 Limit of Detection (LOD) LOD is established as described in C.3.1. For projects requiring Method Detection Limit Study, refer to EMAX -QA04. Where applicable, results are reported at LOD with appropriate data flagging. Where analytes are identified by a recognizable pattern (for example, PCBs, toxaphene, technical -chlordane), the limit of detection is based on the concentration of the mixture at which the pattern becomes qualitatively identified. D.1.2.2 Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) a) Any established LOQ must above the LOD. EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 7 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS b) The LOQ is verified annually for each quality system matrix, method and analyte according to the procedure specified in C.3 or according to the frequency specified by the project. D.1.3 Data Reduction The procedu res for data reduction, such as use of linear regression, are detailed in the analytical SOPs. In -house developed software for automated data processing are tested and validated. Refer to Software Testing and Quality Assurance SOP (EMAX -IS03) for details. This process involves a sample data test set test and verify the correct operation of these data reduction software that include data capture, manipulation, transfer, and reporting. This process is done every time the programming code is modified or otherw ise manipulated. D.1.4 Quality of Standards and Reagents a) The source of standards shall comply with 5.6.2.2. Where available, standards are purchased as certified standard solutions traceable to NIST. b) Analytical SOPs specifies the quality of reagents required fo r the analysis. In addition, reagent and water quality are checked prior to use. 1) Reagents - Reagents are purchased as reagent grade or better. Reagents undergo quality control testing prior to use. EMAX -QC01 details the process of quality control for chemi cals. Chemicals/reagents that have passed the QC acceptance criteria shall bear a \"QC PASSED\" sticker, indicating the QC reference number traceable to the QC documentation. Reagents that do not pass the QC acceptance criteria shall be returned to the vendo r. 2) Water - Reagent Water produced in -house is monitored daily as described in EMAX -QC01. A logbook is used to record the daily monitoring. Commercially purchased reagent water undergoes the same test as any chemical/reagent and shall conform to the method specified requirements. 3) Concentration of titrants is verified in accordance with specific analytical procedures. D.1.5 Selectivity a) Selectivity of qualitative determination for each target analytes is based on the requirement of the analytical method and instru ment detector. Analyte identification is detailed in every analytical SOP. Gas and liquid chromatography shall use peak absolute retention time as qualitative identification requiring tentatively identified analyte confirmation by another column or anothe r detector. Both tentative and confirmation results shall be maintained and properly documented. Retention time window study is based on three non -consecutive measurements of retention time for each analyte within a 72 -hour period. The standard deviation ( SD) and the mean retention time are calculated. The magnitude of retention time window is establish ed by + 3 x SD. New retention time study is established when new column is installed or when there is a major change in the instrument parameter setup. b) Wher e test methods require confirmation, compound identification is confirmed through a second column or detector when positive results are detected on a sample. Such confirmations shall be performed on organic tests such as pesticides, herbicides, or acid ext ractable or when recommended by the analytical test method except when the analysis involves the use of a mass spectrometer. Confirmation may be waived by the client in cases of periodic monitoring of well -characterized media. For data that are required t o be confirmed, all results reported are confirmed or unconfirmed. If unconfirmed data are reported, they shall be identified separately in the report, with a narrative explaining why the data were not EMAX -QS00 Revision 2 04-Dec-2006 APPENDIX D Page 8 of 9 ESSENTIAL QU ALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS confirmed. Evaluation criteria for the confirmation of results shall be specified by the method, unless otherwise specified by the client. If method -specific requirements do not exist, EMAX shall develop and document acceptance criteria for the confirmation of results. Confirmation is required unless stipulat ed in writing by the client. All confirmation shall be documented. c) When analyzing an analytes using chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry, confirmation shall be evaluated by comparing the sample mass spectrum with characteristic ions in the refere nce mass spectrum. Mass spectral tuning shall be performed prior to daily calibration. Acceptance criteria are specified in the related test method SOPs. D.1.6 Constant and Consistent Test Conditions a) To maintain constant and consistent test conditions, EMAX perf orms assessment and evaluation of all quality control measures on an on -going basis. Quality control acceptance criteria determine the usability of the data. Refer to Appendix 1 of analytical procedures list the Summary of Quality Control Procedures for th e essential testing measures. These Quality Control Procedures are also detailed in each of the analytical SOP. The quality control protocols are attached to every work order distributed in the laboratory in the absence of project specific requirement. Analytical instruments undergo routine daily maintenance and calibration check prior to sample analysis. Instrument blanks are analyzed to rule -out and document probable environment and instrument contamination. D.1.6.1.1 GC/MS Performance Check Mass spectrometer perf ormance is monitored every 12 hours of operation period by measuring the mass/ion distribution of BFB (volatiles) or DFTPP (semi -volatiles). The mass/ion distribution of these compounds has to fulfill the method project 's specific requirements before anal ysis can start. Furthermore, mass assignments are checked periodically by using perfluorobutylamine to ensure that mass number is properly assigned. D.1.6.1.2 Pesticide Performance Evaluation Pesticide analysis is subjected to the following additional QC to ensure the quality of data. A mixture of DDT and Endrin is analyzed at the beginning of analysis and at a 12 -hour interval. Individual breakdown and the combined breakdown of Endrin and DDT should be less than predetermined criteria for the system to be acceptab le. D.1.6.1.3 Temperature Controlled Analyses Analyses dependent on temperature controlled environment (e.g., leaching procedures, GPC, etc.) are performed in work cells where temperature are controlled by a thermostat and temperature is recorded in the analytical l og. b) Glassware Cleaning. All reusable labwares are decontaminated prior to reuse. A copy of the SOP for glassware cleaning is posted in the glassware cleaning area.

This SHERP is prepared in accordance with the sta ndards established by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fo r regulated sites. Specifically, this SHERP complies with the appr opriate standards cont ained of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120; 29 CFR 1926.65; and the Safety and Health Requirements Manual (USACE, 2003). The safety and health measures presented are in effect for the duration of the project. This document is intended for field use by Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw) personnel and subcontractors. A ll project personnel ar e required to abide by these measures and acknowledge such by signing the SHERP Acknowledgment Form (Appendix A, \"SHERP Acknowledgment\"). Where not specifically men tioned, all project personnel are required to comply with the applicable regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910, 29 CFR 1926, and the Safety and Health Requirements Manual while conducting this work. The procedures and guidelines contained herein are based upon the best available information at the time of the plan's preparation. Specific requirements may be revi sed if new information is received or site conditions change. Any revisions to this plan will be made with the kno wledge and concurrence of Shaw and the U.S. Army Corps of Engi neers (USACE), Baltimore Division, New York District. Additions or changes to this SH ERP must be attached as a SHERP Amendment (Appendix B, \"Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Amendments\").

Past activities at the CISS have resulted in the presence of contaminants - mainly uranium, thorium, lead, and chlorinated solvents. The site is located at 1130 Central Avenue in the Town of Colonie, Albany County, NY (See Figure 1, Site Location Map). The surrounding ar ea consists of reside ntial and commercial properties. The site was owned and operated by National Lead (NL) Industries from 1937 to 1984. The New York State Supreme Court shut down the NL plant in 1984. From 1984 to fall 1997, the Colonie Site was managed by the U.S. Depa rtment of Energy (DOE). During that time, all of the NL buildings were demolished, 53 vi cinity properties were remediated and the investigation of the main site was begun. In 1997, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the site. The Corps ha s since completed the remediati on of three additional vicinity properties (VPs) and the main site. The work covered under this Scope of Work i nvolves the inspection, annual redevelopment, sampling of groundwater monitoring wells, picki ng up trash and mowing the lawn between the fence and Central Avenue (t wice a month), mowing around th e monitoring wells sampled (quarterly) as well as the prepar ation of detailed sampling reports that evaluate data trends. 1.2 Safety and Health Policy Statement Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. expects all of our employees, clients, and partners to uphold the highest environmental, health, and sa fety (EHS) standards to promote a positive and proactive safety attitude and to exhibit a heightened awareness of their surroundings both on and off the job. We must identify risks and hazards and implement appropriate controls in order to provide an injury-free work environment where people, equipment, and the environment are not placed at unreasonable threat of injury or damage. We will continually stri ve to be good citizens in our own community, as well as in every community in which we operate. The EHS Program and the components of our Occupational Health & Safety Management System have been developed to guide us in our daily activities. We also commit ourselves to continual improvement in EHS management. Furt her, I ask that you incl ude our EHS process in all aspects of your work, assist in the maintena nce of our process, and communicate this policy to all persons working for or on be half of Shaw with the intent th at they are made aware of their individual EHS obligations. Through compliance with this policy, we will all act ively participate in this process and advocate this philosophy. Together, we can accomplish our goals and exceed the minimum requirements provided by applicable laws and regulations, thus resulting in all stakeholders being proud to be W912DR-05-D-0026 1-3 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final a part of a team that truly values the impor tance of health, safety, and respect for the environment. Accordingly, we will maintain th e position as a recognized leader in all of our business endeavors through a stewardship-base d approach for our fellow employees, the environment, and the communities in which we live and work. We are committed to the spirit and intent of this EHS policy statement and the laws, rules, and regulations to which we s ubscribe at its foundation.

The names of the competent/qualified person(s) re quired for a particular ac tivity as specified by OSHA and will be identified and included in th e AHA. Proof of their competency/qualification must be submitted to the SSHO for acceptance prio r to the start of that work activity. 3.15 Job Safety Analysis Job Safety Analyses are an effective manageme nt technique for identifying hazardous conditions and unsafe acts in the workplace. A JSA is intende d to analyze the individua l steps or activities, which together create a job or specific work duty, and to detect any actual or potential hazards that may be present. Each crew must complete a JSA for each task that will be accomplished for that day, as required by Shaw Procedure No. HS 045, \"Job Safety Analysis\". The JSA shall be revised, as necessary, when unforeseen circumstances arise or work site conditions change. Any revisions shall be immediately communicated with the affected site workers. If the need to complete an unplanned task becomes necessary at any point throughout the day, a new JSA shall be prepared to cover that task. The JSAs sh all be completed using the JSA Checklist Form and JSA Worksheet Form, both of which can be found in Appendix C. W912DR-05-D-0026 3-7 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 3.16 Hazard Assessment Resolution Process Hazard Assessment Resolution Process (HARP ) shall be exercised prior to starting each task. HARP is a brief, paperless, general risk assessm ent of which the objective is to anticipate, identify and eliminate or control potential real -time workplace hazards, which could lead to an accident. HARP requires workers to take time (less than two minutes ) before starting a job to become aware of the immediate work environment so as to detect cond itions unanticipated by our work planning. This invol ves a three-step process: Assess the hazard (s) and risk (s) to identify what could go wrong a nd what is the worst thing that could happen Analyze the situation to determine how to reduce the risks. Evaluate each identified risk and implement the appropriate safe guards to control the hazards Act to ensure safe operations: Take the necessary steps to complete the job safely. Follow written standards and procedures (APP, AHAs, JSAs, etc. ). Do not proceed until it is safe. Risk reduction is a critical component of HAR P. The following risks will be avoided: Hurrying Thinking the job is routine or simple Believing nothing bad can happen Not talking about precau tions with co-workers Not raising a \"gut feel.\" The appropriate hazard resolution and corrective actions must take place before proceeding with the task: Communicate hazards and precautions to ta ke with co-workers and supervisor Eliminate or control the hazards. The implemen tation of administrative controls is sometimes effective, that is, marking the hazard with warning tape, signs, or tags If the risk is unacceptable or if a hazard cannot be satisfactorily controlled, then stop work and contact the SSHO or HSM. W912DR-05-D-0026 3-8 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 3.17 Safety Observation Program Safety observations are behavior-b ased and provide a systematic feedback process between line personnel and supervision to proactively identify opportunities for safety improvement in work areas. Employees engaged in work activities are ofte n the most knowledgeable about the hazards of their work and can provide valuable feedback on unsafe conditions and unsafe practices, which may require corrective action. The Safety Observation Program is a tool for employees to provide information on actual or potential safety hazards that they observe in th eir workplace, which if left unreported may result in an accident and or injury. This program also provides a mechanism for recommending corrective actions. The Shaw Safety Observation Program: Identifies practices that could cause accidents, injuries, or damage. Identifies specific needs for coaching and training. Checks the adequacy of the EHSP, AHAs, JSAs, and compliance with ge neral site rules and other procedures. Monitors the effectiveness of training. The SSHO must develop a schedule for conducting sa fety observations. A general guideline for the number of observations in a week is one obs ervation per 100 work hours on the project. The schedule for observation(s) shall be communicated to site personnel. The volunteer conducting the safety observation shall record their findings on the Safety Observation Reporting Card, as required by Sh aw Procedure No. HS026, \"Safety Observation Procedure\" (2010). Tasks or item s that require follow-up because of serious risk potential must be addressed immediately by the SSHO. Items with lesser risk should be discussed in the next tailgate safety meeting. The action items and co rrective actions, including dates and responsible person(s) shall be documented on the Safety a nd Occupational Health Deficiency Tracking Log (Appendix C), maintained, and available for inspection. W912DR-05-D-0026 3-9 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 3.18 Safety and Health Bulletin Board A safety and health bulletin board is not feasib le since there are no ava ilable facilities for this field effort; however, the followi ng shall be maintained by the SS HO and be made available at the project site: Map denoting the route to the nearest emergency care facility. Emergency telephone numbers. Copy of the SHERP, which will be ac cessible on the site by all workers. The OSHA Form 300A. Copy of Safety and Occupational Health Deficien cy Tracking Log, which shall be accessible by all workers upon request. Date of last lost workday injury. OSHA Safety and Health Poster. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-1 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 4.0 Project Hazards and Hazard Control Measures There are potential chemical, physical, and environm ental hazards present at the project sites. The hazards, if not properly controlled, could cause harm to project personnel, visitors, and the public. The anticipated hazards at the project sites and the recommended control measures are presented in this section. Additional informa tion on specific hazards and control measures are outlined in the AHAs (Appendix D). 4.1 Chemical Hazards Previous field investigations performed at the Colonie FUSRAP Site indicate the presence of inorganic and organic chemicals in soil and groundw ater. This section provides an overview of the chemical contaminants detected in various media at the Colonie FUSRAP Site and an assessment of the chemical hazards associat ed with each contaminant of concern. There is potential for ex posure to personnel through all routes (i.e., dermal contact, inhalation of dust and vapors, ingestion, and injection). Controls have been specified in this SHERP to reduce the risk of these potential expos ures. The use of PPE and proper decontamination procedures is required when performing work with contaminated media. A brief description of the exposure limits used is provided below: Threshold Limit Value-Time Weighted Averag e (TLV-TWA) - Airborne concentrations of substances, generally expressed as an 8-hour time-weighted average and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all worker s may be repeatedly expos ed day after day for a 40-hour workweek without adverse health effects. Threshold li mit values are guidelines for occupational exposures establ ished by the ACGIH (2010). Threshold Limit Value-Short Term Expos ure Limit (TLV-STEL) - The 15-minute time- weighted average airborne concentrations of subs tances that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8- hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. Threshold limit values are guidelines for occupational exposures established by the ACGIH (2010). Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) - The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health defines IDLH as, air co ncentrations, which represent the maximum concentration from which, in the event of respir ator failure, one could escape within 30 minutes without a respirator and without experiencing any escape-impairing or irreversible health effects. Recommended Exposure Limit - The time-weighted average concentration exposure for up to a 10-hour workday during a 40-hour workweek, recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) - The 8-hour time-weighted average, short-term exposure limit (STEL), or ceiling (C) concen tration above which workers ca nnot be exposed. Permissible exposure limits are enforceable by OSHA. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-2 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 4.1.1 Inorganic Chemicals Various inorganic chemicals have been identified as being present as contaminants in soils and waters at the Colonie FUSRAP Site. Certain chem ical contaminants in the soils and waters are classified as particularly toxic or carcinogen ic substances. The OSHA defines \"particularly hazardous substances\" as consisting of select carcinogens, reproductive toxins, and substances that have a high degree of acute toxicity. These contaminants include the following: Arsenic. Arsenic compounds target the liver, kidneys, skin, lungs, and lymphatic system (lung and lymphatic cancer). Symptoms of exposur irritation, hype r pigmentation of the skin, and degeneration of the peripheral centr al nervous system. Arsenic is considered a confirmed human carcinogen (ACGIH, 2010). (Permissible exposur e limit [PEL]-time-weighted average [TWA]: 0.01 per cubic meter [mg/m3] for inorganic arsenic; im mediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH): National Institute for Occ upational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Potential Occupational Carcinogen 5 mg/m3; TLV-TWA: 0.01 mg/m3.) TLV Basis: lung cancer (ACGIH, 2010). Copper. Copper compounds target the eyes, skin, resp iratory system, liver, kidneys (increased risk with Wilson's disease). Symptoms of e xposure include irritation eyes, Lead. Lead targets the eyes, gastrointestinal trac t, central nervous system, kidneys, blood, and gingival tissue. Symptoms of exposure incl ude lassitude (weakness, exhaustion), insomnia; facial pallor; anorexia, weight loss, malnutrition; irritation eyes; hypotension. Lead is a confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans (ACGIH, 2010). Compounds Groundwater remedial investigation activities have identified several hazardous organic compounds (volatile and semi-vola tile) present as contaminants in the soil and water at the Colonie FUSRAP Site. All of these organic chemicals are considered toxic and some are identified as being carcinogenic. Information about the organic ch emical contaminants present is summarized as follows. Benzene. Benzene targets the eyes, skin, respiratory system, blood, central nervous system, bone marrow. Symptoms of exposure include Irri tation eyes, skin, nose, respiratory system; dizziness; headache, aggered gait; dermatitis; bone marrow depression; [potential occupational carcinogen]. Benzene is a confirmed human carcinogen (ACGIH, 2010). (PEL- TWA: 1 part Basis: Leukemia (ACGIH, 2010). W912DR-05-D-0026 4-3 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 1,2-Dichloroethene. 1,2-dichloroethene targ ets the eyes, respiratory sy stem, and central nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include irritation eyes, respir atory system; central nervous system aromatic hydrocar bons target the respiratory system, skin, bladder, and kidneys [lung, kidne y, and skin cancer]. Symptoms of exposure include dermatitis and bronchitis; (potential oc cupational carcinogen) (NIOSH, 2005). Exposure limits have not been established for many specifi c polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in this large group of compounds. Coal ta r pitch volatiles are a c onfirmed human carcinogen (ACGIH, also commonly called perchloroethene, targets the liver, kidneys, respiratory system, eyes, skin, and CNS. Symptoms of exposure include irritation to the eyes, nose, throat, and respiratory system; naus damage; (potential occupational carcinogen) (NIOSH, 2005). Tetrachloroethene is a confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans (ACGIH, 2 010). (PEL-TWA: 100 pp m, PEL-C: 200 ppm, maximum Trichloroethene targets the eyes, skin, respiratory system, heart, liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Symptoms of ex posure include irritation eyes, skin; headache, visual disturbance, lassitude (weakness, exhaustion), dizziness, tremor, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting; PEL-C: 200 Vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride targets the liver, centr al nervous system, blood, respiratory system, and lymphatic system. Symptoms of ex posure include lassitude (weakness, exhaustion); abdominal pain, gastrointestinal carcinogen]. confirmed human (ACGIH, 2010). 4.1.3 Munitions and Explosives of Concern There is very little potential for Munitions and Explosives of C oncern (MEC) to be encountered during project activities. 4.1.4 Radiological Hazards The Colonie FUSRAP Site radiol ogical contaminants are uranium (primarily U-238 as depleted uranium) and thorium-232 and respective de cay products found in groundwater and well sediments. The rules that govern worker expo sure to radioactive ma terials found in 10 CFR 20 W912DR-05-D-0026 4-4 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final will be followed throughout this project. This w ill include application of as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principles. At the anticipated concentrations of these cont aminants, external exposur e is not significant and personnel will not require extern al dosimetry. Pathways for in ternal exposure are inhalation, ingestion and absorption through skin (following c ontamination of skin or clothing). However, the potential for internal exposure from radionuclides is belo w the threshold requiring personnel monitoring. Worker training, engineering and administrativ e controls, positive contamination control practices, and PPE are utilized to prevent intake of radioactive particle s into the body. The policies and objectives for control ling remediation worker exposure to radioactive material (and subsequent dose) are implement ed through HWPs. Radiation e xposure to the general public from groundwater sampling is not credible. 4.1.5 Operational Chemicals/Hazard Communication Program Hazardous chemicals will be brought on-site for us e in activities supporting the planned work. These chemicals are used as fuels, lubricants , preservatives, etc. The use of operational chemicals is regulated by OSHA under th e Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). A written hazard communication program has been established as Shaw E & I Procedure HS060, \"Hazard Communication Program,\" which includes the following elements: Container Labeling \u2014Project personnel will ensure that al l containers are labeled according to their contents. This requirement will apply to containers from manufact urers and those produced on site by operations. The labe ls on all incoming a nd outgoing containers will be checked for identity, hazard warning, and the name and address of the responsible party. Material Data Safety Sheets \u2014MSDSs will be provided on site for each hazardous chemical used or known to be present at the site. Employee Information and Training \u2014Employees will receive annua l chemical hazard safety training, supplemented by informal daily safety mee tings. Project specific chemical hazards will be communicated to employees th rough an initial site orientation meeting and daily safety meetings. The written hazard communication program will be available at the project site for personnel review and provides requirements for the safe us e of operational chemicals. Proper ventilation and personal protective equipment (PPE) sha ll be used when working with operational chemicals. Air monitoring may be performed as needed to assess and control exposures resulting from the use of operational chemicals. Both an inventory list of the operational chemicals (Hazardous Chemical Inventory List) used and a Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) W912DR-05-D-0026 4-5 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final for operational chemicals shall be made available at the project site (Appendix E). A copy of the MSDSs shall be provided to the Fuller Road Fire Department (Colonie, NY) upon request. 4.2 Physical Hazards There will be numerous physical hazards associ ated with site opera tions that require consideration. Some of these physical hazards are as follows: Noise Slips, trips, and falls Groundwater Sampling/Wells Use of small tools Use of mechanized equipment Operation of motor vehicles Material handling Hazardous energies (i.e., electr ical, mechanical, and pressure) Vehicular Traffic Portable Generator Use Active Railroad Tracks 4.2.1 Noise and Hearing Conservation There will be many sources of noise at each projec t site. Noise may be generated from the use of heavy equipment and tools, or may be from base operations. Hearing loss, resulting from occupational exposure to noise, can be prevented. Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. Procedure No. HS402, \"Hearing C onservation Program,\" shall be implemented at each project site whenever there is employee noise exposures equal to or exceeds an eight-hour TWA of 85 dBA (decibels, A-scale). As part of the criter ia for a hearing conservation program, audiometric testing of personnel must be conducted annually. Personnel shall wear hearing protection when working with or around heavy equipment, power tool s, as noise monitoring i ndicates, or in areas posted as such. 4.2.2 Slips, Trips, and Falls The following details procedures to prevent slips, trips, and falls: Personnel shall keep working areas clean and orderl y. Tools, equipment, and materials shall be used and stored in a fashion to minimize tripping hazards. Small objects, tools, and debris shall not be left lying around in any place, particularly in areas where personnel walk. Spills shall be cleaned up immediately. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-6 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Personnel are prohibited from walking or working on surfaces or equipment that are not intended as walking or working surfaces. Personnel shall take extra precautions, such as establishing firm handholds, wearing suitable footwear, and walking slowly when walking on surfaces during wet, snowy, or icy weather. Personnel shall not jump from elevated places or equipment. Personnel using hand and mechanical tools shall position themselves properly and consider the events if a tool slip s or suddenly moves. Electrical extension cords and electrical wiring sh all be kept clear of walking and working areas and/or covered, buried, or otherwise secured. Running is prohibited on job sites unless under emergency conditions. Employees exposed to fall hazards shall be prot ected by standard guardrail, catch platforms, temporary floors, safety nets, pe rsonal fall protectio n devices, or the equi valent. No employee may be exposed to a fall of over 6 feet without being adequately protected. Shaw Environmental & Infrastr ucture, Inc. Procedure No. HS 301, \"Fall Protection,\" shall be followed when there is a fall h azard of six feet or greater. 4.2.3 Groundwater Sampling/Wells Contamination avoidance will be practiced at all times. The sampling team will review the sampling work plan, AHA, JSA, emergency procedures, and the location of emergency equipment with everyone before the task to avoid skin, eye, and inhalation contact with contaminated groundwater and/or soil. Stand upwind when conducting tasks and minimi ze possible inhalation exposure, especially when first opening monitoring wells. Conduct air monitoring in breathing zone to de termine level of resp iratory protection. Use engineering controls such as portable air movers to draw away or blow away chemical vapors. Perform personal decontamination after sampling. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-7 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 4.2.4 Use of Small Tools Hand and power tools shall be used, inspec ted, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions a nd recommendations and will be used only for the purpose for which designed. A copy of the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations shall be maintained at the project site. The following requirements shall be adhered to: Tools designed to accommodate guards will be equipped with such guards when in use. Tools shall be inspected to ascer tain safe operating conditions and are to be kept clean and free of accumulated dirt. Electric power tools and extensi on cords shall be used with ground fault circuit interrupter. Portable power cords will be designated as hard usage or extra hard usage and shall not be used if damaged, patched, oil-soaked, worn, or frayed. Hand tools, such as hammers and chisels, shall be inspected and dressed if necessary to remove mushroomed heads, which may separa te and become pr ojectile hazards. 4.2.5 Use of Cutting Tools Proper cutting tools, such as scissors, snips, side cutters, etc., are to be us ed when possible in lieu of box cutters or knives. Furthermore, if box cutters are determin ed to be the appropriate tool for the job, the only type that should be used is the design that has a self-retracting blad e capability. Employees must utilize appropriate PPE (leather gl oves) to allow for further protection. There are many cutting tool manufacturers that offer a variety of safety knives, which are available for all types of cutting. The Field Supervisor shall ev aluate each cutting task in order to determine that the safest and most appropria te cutting tool is used. The Fi eld Supervisor shall also provide training in the proper use of the selected cutting tool. The follo wing evaluation shall be made for each cutting task: Determine that hand knives are actually the most pr actical tool for the task. Where possible, use the safest cutting tool for the job (e.g., scissors, snip s, or wire strippers). If a knife happens to be the correct tool, keep the knife sharp and clean. A dull blade can cause accidents because more force is needed to cut an object. However, a knife or any other unprotected blade tool must be the last resort when choosing a cutting tool. Maintain a supply of either replacement knives and/ or blades and make them readily available. Cut away from yourself, ending the knife stroke away from your body. Hold the item you are cutting firmly, and do not cut downwards and to wards your body. Cut into the air or onto hard surface. Confirm that appropriate PPE (e.g., gloves) specif ic to the task is available to employees and used when the possibility of injury exists. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-8 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Personal knives (e.g., pocketknives) shall not be considered as a t ool for any type of work-related cutting. Employees are required to ask for a cutti ng tool from their supervisor, thereby resulting in an additional review of using th e right cutting tool for the job. The Field Supervisor is to inspect material cut ting activities to verify that leather gloves are being used to protect hands. 4.2.6 Use of Mechanized Equipment A drill rig or other types of specialized equipmen t may be used to accomplish the work at the project. Additionally, a high weed mower or brus h cutter will be used for mowing activities. The use of mechanized equipment can be dangerous . Extra care shall be ex ercised in its use and while working in the vicinity of this equipment. 4.2.6.1 Drill Rig Use All drilling operations are to comply with Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS316, \"Drill Rig Operations.\" All members of the drilling crew(s ) shall receive site-specific training prior to beginning work. The Field Supe rvisor must have successfully completed Shaw's in-house training pertinent to competent pe rson drilling oversight (CPDO Trai ning). The Field Supervisor is required not only to have su ccessfully completed CPDO Training, but to have an appropriate educational background, coupled with field expe rience and the authority to make changes to correct deficiencies, or to stop th e job if need be. Th e driller is responsible for the safe operation of the drill rig, as well as the crew's adherence to the requirements of this SHERP. The driller is to verify that all safety equipment is in prope r condition and is properly used. The members of the crew shall follow all instructions provided by the manufacturer of the drill rig, wear the required PPE, and be aware of all hazards and control procedures. The drill crews shall participate in the daily tailgate safety meeti ng and be aware of all emergency procedures. All drilling activities must comply w ith Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS308, \"Underground/Overhead Utility Contact Prevention.\" 4.2.7 Operation of Motor Vehicles All company owned, leased, or rented vehicle oper ations shall comply with the requirements of Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS80 0, \"Motor Vehicle Operation: General Requirements\" and Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS810, \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Operation and Maintenance.\" Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc., vehi cles shall be inspected on a daily basis. Additionally, all Shaw vehicles sha ll be inspected prior to any trip, which is 50 miles or greater. Vehicle inspections shall be documented on the Vehicle Inspection form (Appendix C). Subcontractors operating motor vehicl es at projects shall comply with all federal, state, and local traffic regulations. Subcontractor s shall only use vehicles that ar e in good condition and safe to operate. Subcontractors shall inspect their vehi cles on a daily basis and submit the inspection W912DR-05-D-0026 4-9 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final documentation to the Field Supervisor. Vehicle inspections shall be documented on the Vehicle Inspection form (Appendix C). All personnel must observe the maximum-posted speed limits on the base roadways and parking lots. All personnel shall drive de fensively and wear seat belts wh ile vehicles are in motion. All Shaw employees are required to atte nd a defensive driving training course. Operators of vehicles may only use cellular tele phones with hands-free de vices while the vehicle is in motion. Prior to using a hand-held cellular telephone, drivers shall find a safe place to bring their vehicle to a stop. This requirement doe s not preclude passenger(s) from using cellular telephones while the vehicle is in motion. The use of headphones and earphones for music or radio is prohibited while operating a motor vehicle. Since backing accidents at these types of project s are frequent, the following guidelines shall be observed: Backing of vehicles shall be avoided when possible. Extra care shall be taken to b ack vehicles when unavoidable. Back-up slowly and back-up the shortest distance necessary to accomplish the maneuver. When parking vehicles, vehicles shall be backed into the spac e whenever possible. Before entering a vehicle, which has been park ed, the driver should first physically perform a 360\u00b0 walk around the vehicle to observe all areas and especially the area behind the vehicle. Spotters shall be used to back vehi cles whenever possible or necessary. 4.2.8 Material Handling Various materials and equipment may be hand led manually during project operations. Care should be taken when lifting and handling heavy or bulky items to avoid back injuries. The following fundamentals address the proper lifting techniques that ar e essential in preventing back injuries: Size, shape, and weight of the object to be lif ted shall first be considered. No individual employee is permitted to lift any object that weighs over 60-pounds. Multiple employees or the use of mechanical lifting devices is required for objects over the 60-pound limit. Anticipated path to be taken by the lifter should be inspected for the presence of slip, trip, and fall hazards. Feet shall be placed far enough ap art for good balance and stability (typically shoulder width). Worker shall get as close to the load as po ssible. Legs shall be bent at the knees. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-10 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Back shall be kept as straight as possibl e and abdominal muscles should be tightened. Twisting motions should be avoi ded when performing manual lifts. To lift the object, the legs are straightened from their bending position. Take small turning steps without tw isting the knees or the back if it is necessary to turn with the load. A worker shall never carry a load that cannot be seen over or around. When placing an object down, the stance and position are identical to that for lifting. The legs are bent at the knees and the object lowered. When two or more workers are required to handl e the same object, coordi nation is essential for sharing the weight between the individuals carryi ng the load and to make a uniform lift. When carrying the object, each worker, if possible, shall face the direction in which the object is being carried. In handling bulky or heavy items, the following guidelines shall be followed to avoid injury to the hands and fingers: A firm grip on the object is essential; le ather gloves shall be used as necessary. Hands and the object shall be free of oil, grease, and water, which might prevent a firm grip. Fingers shall be kept away from any points that could cause them to be pinched or crushed, especially when setting the object down. Item shall be inspected for metal slivers, shar p or jagged edges, burrs, and rough or slippery surfaces prior to being lifted. 4.2.9 Hazardous Energies (Electrical, Mech anical, and Pressurized Systems) All portable electrical equipment and extension cords shall be protected with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) as part of the circuit. Applicable OS HA standards for electrical power, 29 CFR 1926 Subpart K and Section 11 of the Safety and Health Requirements Manual (USACE, 2003) apply. Only qualified electricians may work on electrical circuits. Qualified personnel shall be trained with the proper use of the special precautionary techniques, PPE, including arc-flash, insulating and shielding materials, and insu lated tools and test equipment. Live parts to which an employee might be exposed shall be put into an electrically safe work condition (de-energized) before an employee works on or near them, unless it can be demonstrated that de-energizing introduces additiona l or increased hazards or is infeasible due to equipment design or operational limitations. This rule applies to all electrical work, including changing a light bulb. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-11 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Where work is performed in locations containing un-insulated energized overhead lines that are not guarded or isolated, precautions shall be ta ken to prevent employees from contacting such lines directly with any unguarded parts of their body or indirectly throu gh conductive materials, tools, or equipment. Refer to Table 2, \"Minim um Clearance from Energized Overhead Electric Lines\" when working near overhead power lines. Where the work to be performed is such that contact with un-insulated energized overhead lines is possible, th e lines shall be de-energized and visibly grounded at the point of work, or suitably guarded. Only hard or extra-hard usage extension cords sh all be used. Extension cords, power tools, and lighting equipment shall be inspected before each use, protected from damage, and kept out of wet areas. The handling of compressed gas cylinders shall comply with the requirements established in Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS304. Lockout/tagout procedures are to be implemente d during servicing or maintenance of machines and equipment to preclude the une xpected release of stored energy or inadvertent energization. These procedures are contained in Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS315, \"Control of Hazardous Energy Sources,\" and comply with the requirements established in 29 CFR 1926.417. Subcontractors may implement their own lockout/t agout procedure if the Field Supervisor has approved its use and verifies th at it is no less protective than the Shaw E & I Procedure. 4.2.10 Vehicular Traffic Observe the following procedures and prac tices regarding vehicular traffic Wear Class 2 high-visibility safety vest when working near road. Stay off road when mowing or removing litter. Use cones, flags, barricades, and cau tion tape to define work area. Engage police detail for high-traffic situations. Always use a spotter in tight or congested areas. Review Shaw Procedure HS800, Motor Vehicle Operation. 4.2.11 Portable Generator Use Refer to the generator manufacturer's instructi ons for safe operation. Never use a generator in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces due to the quick build-up of hi gh levels of carbon monoxide. The concentration of carbon monoxide sh all be monitored when using generators in areas of poor ventilation. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the work area shall not be allowed to exceed 25 ppm. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-12 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Keep the generator dry and do not use in rain or wet conditions . To protect from moisture, operate it on a dry surface under an open, canopy-like structure. Dry your hands, if wet, before touching the generator. Use a heavy duty, outdoor-ra ted extension cord that is rated (in watts or amps) at least equal to the sum of the connected appliance loads. Check that the entire cord is free of cuts or tears and that the plug has all thr ee prongs, especially a grounding pin. Ground generators by using a hand-inserted ground -rod, if recommended by the manufacturer. Before refueling the generator, turn it off and le t it cool down. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could ignite. A 20-B:C fire extinguisher shall be readily availa ble in locations where a generator is being used. Use hearing protection when working near a generator. 4.2.12 Active Railroad Tracks Work near railroad tracks poses a danger to personnel from being struck by locomotives, cars, or other track-based equipment. Personnel operati ng near tracks also present a hazard to the passing train if their work equipment strikes it or if the operation compro mises track integrity. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has esta blished regulations to protect to personnel working near railroad tracks. Compliance with FRA regulations is required when people are working or equipment is positioned within four (4 ) feet of the track, which is referred to as \"fouling\" the track. CSX has broadened the FRA definition of fouling the track to people or equipment within 15 feet of the track. Personnel working within the foul area of railroad track will empl oy the following critical safety practices: Advise the CSX Point of Contact (POC) of planned work in the foul zone. Do not begin operations in the foul zone until th e Employee in Charge (EIC) arrives at the site. Expect train movement at any ti me, in any direction, on any track. Do not foul track unless the task requires it. Verify appropriate track protec tion is in place, such as wa tchman/lookout or working limits. Cross a minimum of 25 feet in fron t of or behind standing equipment. Participate in the job briefing/JSA. Know the location of the designated place of safety or rally point. Complete the required FRA on-tr ack safety training for contract or roadway workers on an annual basis. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-13 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final FRA Training Rules Card for each individual in the foul zone must be read ily available; workers must know where a copy of the rail road operating rule s is located. 4.3 General Work Rules While all the procedures outlined in this SHER P are required, the following list presents general work rules that must be strictly enforced by th e Field Supervisor and Su bcontractor Supervisors: Personnel are not allowed on site without the prior knowledge and c onsent of the Field Supervisor. Loose jewelry, clothing, or long ha ir is not permitted on or near equipment with moving parts. Personnel shall not en ter a restricted area unless authorized. All work zones, as established on the site, shall be observed. All required PPE shall be worn prior to entering these zones. Legible and understandable labels shall be affixed prominently to the containers of waste materials. An emergency eyewash capable of delivering at least 0.4 gall ons per minute for at least 15 minutes shall be located immediately ad jacent to employees who handle hazardous or corrosive materials, such as sample preservatives. If on-site activities continue later than dusk, adequate lighting shall be provided. Field activities shall be suspe nded during severe weather such as thunderstorms , lightning, and tornado warnings. Damaged PPE shall be immediately repa ired or replaced, as appropriate. Personnel shall thoroughly wash their hands and face before eating, smoking, or drinking. Unauthorized removal of material s from the project is prohibited. Possession of controlled substances and prohibited items, such as alc ohol, illicit drugs, firearms, and weapons while working on si te is strictly prohibited. Operations involving the potential for fire hazards shall be conducte d in a manner as to minimize the risk of fire. Overhead and underground utility hazards shall be identified and/or located prior to conducting operations. 4.4 Buddy System The \"buddy system\" will be used at all times while working on-site - this requires that personnel maintain visual, voice, cellular te lephone, or radio communication. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-14 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 4.5 Environmental Hazards In addition to chemical and physical hazards, there are environmental hazards that may be present. For the purposes of this SHERP, the environmental hazards are comprised of extreme ambient temperatures, insects, spiders, rodents, poisonous plants, and sunburn. 4.5.1 Heat Stress Heat stress is of concern for worker safety dur ing the summer months or when working in areas containing steam lines or other h eat generating equipment. Heat stress is caused by a number of interacting factors, including environmental conditions, clothi ng, PPE, workload, and individual characteristics. Heat stress can cause physical discomfort, loss of efficiency, or personal illness/injury. Individuals vary in their suscepti bility to heat stress. Factors that may predispose individuals to heat stress include the following: Lack of physical fitness and/or obesity Insufficient acclimation Age Dehydration Alcohol and/or drug use Infection Sunburn Diarrhea Chronic disease Medical conditions and/or the use of some me dications, such as beta-blockers for high blood pressure The amount and type of PPE worn, directly influe nces reduced work tolerance and the increased risk of heat stress. Personal protective equipment adds weight, bulk, reduces the body's capability for physiological thermoregulation (suc h as, evaporation, convection, and radiation), and increases energy expenditure. 4.5.1.1 Signs and Symptoms of Heat Stress If the body's physiological processes fail to ma intain a normal body temperature because of excessive heat, a number of physical reactions can occur - ranging from mild to fatal. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-15 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final These physical reactions to excessi ve heat include the following: Heat rash is caused by continuous exposure to heat and humid ity and aggravated by chafing clothes. Heat rash decreases th e body's ability to tolerate heat in addition to being a nuisance. Heat cramps are caused by profuse perspiration with inadequate electrolytic fluid replacement. Heat cramps cause painful muscle spasms and pain in the extremities and abdomen. Heat exhaustion is caused by increased stress on various organs to meet increased demand to cool the body. Heat exhausti on causes shallow breathing; pale , cool, moist skin; profuse sweating; and dizziness. Heat stroke is the most severe form of heat stre ss. Heat stroke symptoms include hot, dry skin; no perspiration; nausea; dizziness; confusion; strong, rapid pulse; coma; and sometimes death. Heat stroke is a serious medical emergency. The affected person shall be cooled down rapidly and medical attention must be given immedi ately (Section 4.5.1.4 for heat stroke first aid treatment). The American Conference of Governmental Indust rial Hygienist (2010) st ates that excessive heat stress may be marked by one or more of the following symptoms, and an individual's exposure to heat stress should be disconti nued when any of the following occur: Sustained (several minutes) heart rate is in exces s of 180 beats per minute minus the individual's age in years (180 minus age), for individuals with assessed normal cardiac performance Body core temperature is greate r than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit ( F) for medically selected and acclimatized personnel; or greater than 100.4 F in unselected, unacclimatized workers Recovery heart rate at one (1) minute after a peak work effort is greater than 110 beats per minute There are symptoms of sudden and severe fa tigue, nausea, dizziness, or lightheadedness An individual may be at great er risk of heat stress if: Profuse sweating is sustained over several hours Weight loss over a shift is greater than 1.5 percent of body weight 24-hour urinary sodium excretion is less than 50 millimoles (ACGIH, 2010) 4.5.1.2 Heat Stress Prevention The following practices will help prevent heat stress: Acclimatize workers to hot working conditions. Provide plenty of liquids to re place the body fluids lost by perspi ration. Fluid intake should be forced because, under conditions of heat stress, the normal thirst mechanism is not adequate to bring about a voluntary replacement of lost fluids. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-16 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Provide personal cooling devices. Conduct strenuous field operations in the early morning and provide shade when possible. Train personnel to recognize the signs and symptoms of heat stre ss, its prevention, and treatment. Rotate personnel to various job duties a nd establish adequate work/rest cycles. Provide shade or shelte r during rest periods. 4.5.1.3 Heat Stress Treatment Workers expressing the symptoms of heat stress shall notify the Field Supervisor immediately. At the onset of heat related illness, activities must be halted and treatment initiated. Early detection and treatment of heat stress helps to prevent further serious illness or injury. Individuals that have experienced heat rela ted illness could become more sensitive and predisposed to additional future heat stress related problems. Heat exhaustion can be alleviated by having the affected person rest in a cool, shaded location and have them drink cool water. To cool down the affected person's body: Remove impermeable PPE Remove worker from direct sunshine Apply copious amounts of cool , not cold, water on them Have them drink cool water, not cold, if conscious 4.5.1.4 Heat Stroke Treatment Heat stroke is a true medical emergency. In a heat stroke s ituation, the body must be cooled immediately to prevent severe injury or death - medical attention must be immediately obtained. The following shall be performed if heat stroke is suspected: Transportation of the victim to a medical facility must not be delayed - seek immediate medical attention. Apply cold packs, if available; place under th e arms, around the neck, or any other place where they can cool large surface blood vessels. If transportation to a medical facility is delayed, reduce body temperature by immersing victim in a cool water bath (however, be careful not to over-chill the victim once body temperature is reduced below 102 F). If this is not possible, continuous ly douse victim with cool water and fan for evaporative cooling. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-17 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 or a cclimatizing pers onnel to hot conditions is extremely important. Supervisors shall provide the necessary time fo r adequate worker acclim atization, due to each individual's physical condition a nd his or her ability to work in hot and humid environments. 4.5.1.6 Physiological Monitoring Adequate work/rest periods shall be implemente d as necessary to prevent heat stress on personnel. However, since individuals vary in th eir susceptibility to heat stress, Shaw will also utilize physiological monitoring to aid in measur ing each individual's res ponse to heat stress. The initiation of physiological monitoring will be required when empl oyees are working in environments exceeding 90 F ambient air temperatures. P hysiological monitoring is also required when ambient temperatures exceed 70 F and impermeable garments are worn. Ambient air temperatures shall be recorded on the Am bient Air Temperature Log (Appendix C) when ambient temperatures exceed 70 F. The two physiological parame ters that each individual will monitor are as follows: Heart Rate Each individual will count hi s/her radial (wrist) pulse as early as possible during each rest period. If the heart rate of any i ndividual exceeds 75 percent of their calculated maximum heart rate (maximum he art rate equals 200 minus age) at the beginning of the rest period, then the work cycle will be decreased by one-third. The rest period will remain the same. An individual is not permitted to return to work until his/her sustained heart rate is below 75 percent of their calculated maximum heart rate. Body Temperature Each individual will measure his/her b ody temperature with an intra-aural (ear) thermometer, as directed by the thermome ter manufacturer's inst ructions, as early as possible in the first rest period. If the temperature exceeds 99.6 F at the beginning of the rest period, then the work cycle shal l be decreased by one-third. Th e rest period will remain the same. An individual is not permitted to return to work if his/her temperature exceeds 100.4 F. Physiological monitoring data will be record ed on the Employee Physiological Monitoring Record for Heat Stress (Appendix C). 4.5.1.7 Training Personnel (including subcontractor employees ) who may be exposed to hot working environments shall be trained on the following: Employees: Sources of heat stress, influence of protective clothing, and importance of acclimatization How the body handles heat W912DR-05-D-0026 4-18 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Heat-related illnesses and their recognition (signs and symptoms) Preventive/corrective measures Individual factors, such as age, weight, gender, level of acclimatization, etc. that may predispose some workers to heat stress Medical conditions and use of prescription drugs, such as beta blockers, that may modify a worker's ability to adap t physiologically to heat stress Physiological monitoring, record keeping of oral temperature/pulse, and establishment of work-rest regimes First aid procedures Supervisors: Physiological monitoring, record keeping of oral temperature/pulse, and establishment of work-rest regimes First aid procedures 4.5.2 Cold Stress Observe Shaw Procedure HS401. In addition, obser ve the following procedures and practices regarding cold stress: Wear suitably layered clothing, includi ng hardhat liner, boots, and gloves as appropriate for the actua l conditions present. Take breaks in heated shelters or vehicles when working in extremely cold temperatures. Upon entering the shelter, remove the outer la yer of clothing and loosen other layers to promote evaporation of perspiration. Drink warm liquids to reduce the susceptibility to cold stress. Be aware of cold stress symptoms, incl uding shivering, numbness in the extremities, and sluggishness. Follow cold stress procedures in Shaw Procedure HS401. 4.5.3 Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases Working in tall grass, especially in or at the edge of wooded areas, increases the potential for ticks to bite workers. Ticks can be particul arly numerous in the spri ng and fall. Ticks are vectors of many different dise ases including Rocky Mountai n spotted fever, Q fever, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, Lyme , and Lyme like disease. Ticks attach to the skin and intravenously feed on blood, crea ting an opportunity for disease transmission. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-19 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final The symptoms of tick-borne diseases are high fe ver, head and joint ach es, nausea, and vomiting. Additionally, persons inf ected with Rocky Mountain spotted fever may develop a red, spotty rash. Symptoms of tularemia may also incl ude occasional cough, ches t pain, swollen lymph glands, and severe pneumonia. Lyme disease usua lly (60 to 80 percent of the cases) presents a distinctive bull's eye rash at the site of the b ite in addition to flu-like symptoms and swollen lymph nodes. If tick-borne diseases are not prope rly treated with the a ppropriate antibiotic(s), then arthritis, heart disease, brain/nerve disorder s, liver damage, and kidney damage are possible. Wearing long-sleeved, light-colored shirts, light-colored trousers tucked into the socks, and the use of insect repellent contai ning N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) help prevent tick bites. Periodically during the workday, em ployees should inspect themselves for the presence of ticks. If a tick is discovered, th e following procedure should be used to remove it: Do not try to detach a tick with your bare finge rs; bacteria from a crushed tick may be able to penetrate even unbroken skin. Fine -tipped tweezers should be used. Grip the tick as close to your skin as possible and gently pull it straight away from you until it releases its hold. Do not twist the tick as you pull and do not squeeze its body. That may actually inject bacteria into your skin. Thoroughly wash your hands and the bite area with so ap and water, and then apply an antiseptic to the bite area. Save the tick in a small container noting the date and the location on the body of the bite. Notify the SSHO, Project CIH, and Project Mana ger of any tick bites as soon as possible. It may be determined that personnel sustaining a tick bite will need to consult a physician. Consult http://www.osha.gov for more information concerning ticks and tick-borne illnesses. 4.5.4 Chiggers Chiggers may be a problem while working at proj ect locations. Chiggers, also known as \"red- bugs\" or \"harvest mites,\" are the immature stages of a tiny red mite. They inhabit areas of tall grass, associated with low, we t spots, ponds and stream banks, wild berry patches, and forest underbrush. The larvae attach themselves to the clothing of people or to the fur of passing animals. Before settling down to feed, chiggers move to a cons triction, such as sock tops, W912DR-05-D-0026 4-20 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final waistbands, or armpits. Feeding chiggers inject a salivary fluid, which di ssolves the host's cells, and then they suck up the liquefied tissue. With in a few hours, small, reddish, intensely itching welts appear. These bites may continue to itch for several days up to two weeks after the chigger is dislodged. Following are suggestions that sh ould provide some prot ection from chiggers: Stay out of areas where chiggers are likely to be present including wood lots, pastures, roadside ditches, or other areas with tall grasses and w eeds. Chiggers are especially common in moist low-lying areas. Wear loose-fitting clothing (if possible) when work ing outdoors. Vehicles should be frequently vacuumed to reduce the number of chi ggers that may have been deposited. Apply a repellent containing DEET to shoes, socks, and trousers before entering chigger infested areas. Caution: some individuals may be se nsitive to DEET - always read and follow label directions. Immediately after possible exposure to chiggers , take a bath, thoroughl y scrubbing the body with hot soapy water. This will kill or dislodge many of the chiggers. The clothes that were worn when the bite(s) occurred should be placed in a plastic bag for temporary storage until they can be laundered. When bites begin to itch, one course of treatme nt is to apply rubbing alcohol, followed by one of the nonprescription loca l anesthetics. A baking soda paste, calamine lotion, or product such as \"After-Bite\" or \"Chigarid\" also will help reduce discomfort. Avoi d scratching bi tes since this only increases irritation and may lead to a secondary infection of the bite. 4.5.5 Poisonous Plants Three or five leaves radiating from a stem is the rule of thumb for identifying poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Poison ivy is in the form of a vine (and sometime s low-lying) while oak and sumac are bush-like. All of these plants ca n produce a delayed allergic reaction. The plant tissues have an oleoresin, which is active in live , dead, and dried plants. The oleoresin may be carried through smoke, dust, contaminated articles, and the hair of animals. Additionally, when operating a chain saw to clear brush in the winter or early spring, saw dust may be contaminated with enough oleoresin to cause a severe ras h. Symptoms usually occur 24 to 48 hours after exposure resulting in rashes that itch and blister. Should exposure to any of these plants occur, wash the affected area with a mild soap and water within one-half h our, but do not scrub the area. The best preventative m easure for poisonous plants is rec ognition and avoidance. The use of disposable gloves and Tyvek\u00ae coveralls can help prevent skin contact with these plants. 4.5.6 Flying Insects Flying insects such as mosquitoes, wasps, hornets, and bees may be encountered while working at the Colonie FUSRAP Site. Personnel who ar e allergic to bee sti ngs should notify their supervisor and the SSHO. Mosquito bites can be effectively prevente d by the use of insect W912DR-05-D-0026 4-21 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final repellants containing DEET. Insect repellant containing DEET shall be available to personnel while working on site. Additiona lly, special insecticide preparat ions, such as Repel Permanone, shall be available for treating wo rker's clothing. Comm ercially prepared oi ntments for treatment of insect bites and bee stings shall be available on site. All personnel shall immediately report any bee stings to their supervisor and the SSHO. 4.5.7 West Nile Virus/West Nile Encephalitis The following sections discuss West Nile Virus/West Nile Encephalitis. 4.5.7.1 Background Information on West Nile Virus and West Nile Encephalitis West Nile Virus/West Nile Encephalitis is ra pidly becoming a significant health issue in the United States. West Nile Virus was first identif ied in the New York area in 1999, and is closely related to the St. Louis Encephalitis Virus, which is routinely found in the United States. Both of these viruses belong to the genus Flavivirus and causes diseases that are similar to one another. \"Encephalitis\" means an inflammation of the brai n and it can be caused by viral and bacterial infections. West Nile Encephalitis can be a serious or even fatal illness. 4.5.7.2 Transmission of the Disease West Nile Encephalitis is a viral infection of the brain transmitted through the bite of a mosquito, which has previously fed on birds and/or horses that were infected with West Nile Virus. Dead birds in an area may mean that West Nile Vi rus is circulating between the birds and the mosquitoes in that area. West Nile Virus is not transmitted from one person to another. Human illness from West Nile Virus is relatively rare, even in areas where the virus has been reported. 4.5.7.3 Symptoms of Exposure Most people who become infected with West Nile Virus will have either no symptoms or only mild ones, with higher susceptibility in thos e over 50 years old. Symptoms of West Nile Encephalitis include high fever, headache, confusion, muscle aches and weakness, seizures, or paralysis. At its most serious, the infection can result in coma, permanent neurological damage, and death. Symptoms usually oc cur 5 to 15 days following the bite of an infected mosquito. Because West Nile Encephalitis is a viral infection, antibiotics are not effective and there is no specific treatment available othe r than general support therapy. 4.5.7.4 Protective Measures There is currently no vaccine to protect human s against West Nile Virus, although some drug companies are working on producing one. Individuals at project si tes can reduce their risk from being infected with West Nile Virus by taking th e following actions to protect against mosquito bites: Review the hazards of West Nile Virus pe riodically in morning safety meetings. W912DR-05-D-0026 4-22 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Increase protective measures when working at dawn, dusk, and in the early evening. Reduce the area of exposed skin when working outdoors. Long-sleeved shirts with sleeves rolled down are recommended. Unde rstand that mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so personnel should evaluate the actual Level D cl othing worn, for example, heavy long sleeve work shirts and heavy dungarees/jeans may be indi cated. Activity at projects where disposable coverall-use (i.e., Tyvek\u00ae) is specified furt her reduces the risk of mosquito bites. For activities where only Level D PPE is specif ied, consider using dis posable coveralls when working in wooded, highly vegetated, or swampy areas. Use an insect repellent contai ning approximately 30 percent DEET. In concentrations greater than 35 percent DEET provides no additional pr otection. Use the repellent according to the manufacturer's directions provide d on the container. Frequent re-application or saturation is unnecessary for effectiveness. Avoid prolonged and excessive use of DEET. When additional protection against mosquitoes is necessary, commercially prepared \"clothing and gear\" insect repellants containing 0.5 percen t permethrin may be used. These repellants, such as Repel Permanone are available in the sporting goods department s at major retailers. Clothing and gear insect repellants are not for use on skin. Use the repellent according to the manufacturer's recommendations provided on the container. After returning from outdoor fi eld activities, wash treated skin with soap and water. Personnel should report flu-like symptoms to the SSHO. 4.5.8 Spiders Personnel shall be alert to the pote ntial for spider bites. Spiders sometimes establish residence in dark places, stored clothing, and PPE. It is ad visable for personnel to inspect clothing and PPE for spiders prior to donning. If a spider bite is sustained, perso nnel shall report it to the SSHO. 4.5.9 Sunburn Personnel working in direct sunlight, are encourag ed to wear wide-brim hats (where hard hats are not a requirement) and apply sunscreen to al l unprotected skin surfaces. The benefits of preventing sunburn and skin cancer are self-evide nt. Sunscreen will be provided for use by project personnel while working on site. W912DR-05-D-0026 5-1 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 5.0 Personal Protective Equipment When engineering and administrativ e controls are not feasible or adequate to protect personnel from the hazards associated with proj ect activities, PPE use will be required. 5.1 Respiratory Protection Respiratory protection equipment shall be NIOSH-approved and resp irator use will conform to American National Standards Institute Z88.2 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 requirements. Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. Procedur e No. HS601, \"Respiratory Protection Program,\" details the medical qualification and training requirements, as well as the selection, use, inspection, cleaning, maintenance, st orage, and fit testing of resp iratory protection equipment. This procedure complies with the requirement s contained within 29 CFR 1910.134 and will be maintained in the project office along with other pertinent Shaw Safety and Health Procedures. All personnel (including visitors ) using respiratory protection, sh all possess a written opinion by the medical examiner of the person's ability to use the necessary respiratory protective equipment and shall have successfully passed a resp irator fit test in accord ance with Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS601 within the last 12 months. Fit testing and any training related to respiratory protection for site personnel will be documented on the Training Acknowledgment Form (Appendix C). 5.2 Levels of Protection The following is a description of the PPE that will be required duri ng project activities. 5.2.1 Level B Personal Protective Equipment Level B PPE shall be worn by personnel if air m onitoring action levels are exceeded, or as directed by the SSHO. Supplied air respirator (SAR): airline respirator s with 5-minute egress bo ttles or self-contained breathing apparatus. Work clothing as prescribed by weather. Safety-toed work boots meeti ng ANSI coveralls with hoods, elastic wr (as resistant (polyvinyl ch loride [PVC]/latex) boot covers.

Level D - modified protection generally consists of the following PPE: Safety glasses with side shield s meeting ANSI Z87.1 specifications. Safety-toed work boots meeti ng preservatives. Nitrile disposable surgical gl oves (double pair when sampling). Hearing protection (if ne cessary or required). Hard hat meeting ANSI Z89.1 specifications. High visibility vests - Class 2 (whe n working near ve hicular traffic). Tyvek\u00ae coveralls with hoods, elastic wr ists, and ankles (as necessary). 5.2.3 Level D Protection Level D protection is the minimum level of protecti on that will be used for all other activities at the project. Level D PPE shall, at a minimum, consist of: Safety-toed work boots meeti ng ANSI Z41 specifications. Safety glasses with side shield s meeting ANSI Z87.1 specifications. Hard hat meeting ANSI Z89.1 specifications. Hearing protection (if ne cessary or required). High visibility vests - Class 2 (whe n working near ve hicular traffic). Work gloves, such as leather, cotton, or other material that provides cu t/abrasion resistance (as necessary). 5.3 Respiratory Protection Respiratory protection equipment shall be NIOSH-approved and resp irator use will conform to American National Standards Institute Z88.2 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 requirements. Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc. Procedur e No. HS601, \"Respiratory Protection Program,\" details the medical qualification and training requirements, as well as the selection, use, W912DR-05-D-0026 5-3 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final inspection, cleaning, maintenance, st orage, and fit testing of resp iratory protection equipment. This procedure complies with the re quirements contained within 29 CFR 1910.134. All personnel (including visitors ) using respiratory protection, sh all possess a written opinion by the medical examiner of the person's ability to use the necessary respiratory protective equipment and shall have successfully passed a re spirator fit test (Section 5.2.2) in accordance with Shaw E&I Procedure No. HS 601 within the last 12 months. Fit testing and any training related to respiratory protection for site personnel will be documented on the Training Acknowledgment Form (Appendix C). 5.3.1 Breathing Air Quality Supplied breathing air will meet the requirements of the specification for Grade D breathing air as described in the ANSI/CGA Specification G-7.1-1997. A certific ate of analysis from the vendors of breathing air in order to show that the air meets this st andard is required. Breathing air will be preferentially obtaine d in cylinders; however, site-gen erated breathing air may be used if the air is properly compressed, filtered, monitored, and used as required by 29 CFR 1910.134(i) and ANSI/CGA Specification G-7.1-1997. 5.3.2 Respirator Inspection and Cleaning Respirators shall be checked periodically by a qu alified individual and inspected before each use by the wearer. All respirators and associated eq uipment will be decontaminated and hygienically cleaned after each use. 5.3.3 Respirator Fit Testing Annual respirator fit tests are re quired of all personnel wearing re spirators. The test will use isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke. The fit test must be for the style and size of the respirator to be used. Quantitative fit-testing is required for us e of respirators in chemical environments where the respirator effective use limit exceeds 10 (expos ure of 1 ppm inside th e respirator for 10 ppm outside the respirator). Therefore, quantitativ e fit-testing is dependent on the PEL/TLV of the chemical substance involved. Quantitative fi t-testing is required fo r potential exposure to airborne particulate levels that exceed 10 times the established PEL/TLV. 5.3.4 Facial Hair No personnel who have facial hair, which interferes with the respirator's sealing surface, will be permitted to wear a respirator and will not be permitted to work in areas requiring respirator use. 5.3.5 Corrective Lenses Normal eyeglasses cannot be worn under full-face re spirators because the temple bars interfere with the respirator's sealing surfaces. For work ers requiring corrective le nses, special spectacles designed for use with resp irators will be provided. W912DR-05-D-0026 5-4 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 5.3.6 Medical Certification Only workers who have been certified by a physici an as being physically capable of respirator usage will be issued a respirator. Personnel una ble to pass a respiratory fit test or without medical clearance for respirator use will not be pe rmitted to enter or work in areas on site that require respiratory protection. Employees will r eceive a written physicians opinion that they are fit for general hazardous waste ope rations as per 29 CFR 1910.120(f)(7). 5.4 Activity-Specific Levels of Protection The required level of personal protection is sp ecific to the activity being conducted and are outlined in Table 3, \"Task Protection Levels\". Levels of PPE are subject to change or to modification. Upgrading of PPE may occur when air monitoring action levels are exceeded or when specified by the SSHO. Levels of PPE shall not be downgraded without prior approval from the SSHO or Project CIH (S ection 8.2). Levels of PPE shall not be downgraded without prior approval from the Project CIH. 5.5 Donning/Doffing Personal Protective Equipment All persons entering an Exclusion Zone shall be wearing the requi red PPE in accordance with the requirements of this SHERP. When leaving the Exclusion Zone, PPE will be removed in accordance with the procedures listed in Sect ion 7.1, in order to minimize the spread of contamination. W912DR-05-D-0026 6-1 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 6.0 Site Control and Work Zones The purpose of site control is to minimize chem ical exposures to workers, protect the public from hazards due to site activities, and preven t vandalism. The work areas that pose chemical and physical hazards to personnel may be regarded as regulated or restricted. To prevent both exposures to unprotected personnel and migration of contaminati on due to tracking by personnel or equipment, work areas known to contain chem ical contamination will be clearly identified. Shaw Environmental, Inc. will designate wo rk zones at the proj ect as suggested in Occupational Safety and Health Guidance Manual for Hazardous Waste Site Activities (NIOSH et al., 1985). Regulated work areas are divided into the following three zones: Exclusion Zone CRZ Support Zone 6.1 Exclusion Zone The Exclusion Zone is, in general, the ar ea where chemical, physi cal, or other hazards occur/exist during project work. All employees ar e required to follow the established procedures when working in these areas. Fencing, banner tape, signs, or other appropriate means will identify the location of the Exclusion Zone. An Exclusion Zone Entr y Log (Appendix C) shall be kept daily, which records the time of entry and exit from the Exclusion Zone for each person. Unauthorized personnel shall not be allowed in the Exclusion Zone. 6.2 Contamination Reduction Zone Personnel and equipment decontamination will be performed in the CRZ. All personnel and equipment entering or leaving the Exclusion Zone will pass through the CRZ in order to prevent cross contamination and for the purpose of account ability. Personal protective equipment will be removed in the CRZ, cleaned, and properly stored or disposed of. All water generated from equipment and personal decontamination will be contained on site and disposed of in an appropriate manner. 6.3 Support Zone The Support Zone, or clean zone, will be the area outside the Exclusion Zone and CRZ and within the geographic perimeters of the site.

Site personnel will be advised of appr opriate spill/discharge control measures. Appropriate secondary containment structures w ill be used for storage of hazardous materials and wastes on site. Storage containment shall be examined daily. 11.6.2 Spill Response If a hazardous material or waste release is obser ved at the site, the Field Supervisor will be immediately notified. If fuel was spilled, the Fu ller Road Fire Department (Colonie, NY) shall then be notified by the Field Supervisor. An assessment will be made of the magnitude and potential impact of the release. If it is safe to do so, trained site personnel will attempt to locate the source of the release, prevent further release, and contain the spilled a nd/or affected materials as follows: The spill or release area will be approached from upwind. Hazards will be identified based on availabl e information from witnesses or material identification documents. The po tential hazards will be evaluated to determine the proper personal protection levels, methods, a nd equipment necessary for response. Eliminate possible ignition sources for flammabl e material spills (e. g., turn power off, no smoking). As necessary, the release area will be evacuated, isolated, and secured. Eliminate routes to water by cl osing/blocking storm drains. Work zones, including a decontam ination station, shall be set up. If possible, spill containment will initially be made without entering th e immediate hazard area. W912DR-05-D-0026 11-6 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Entry to the release area will be made by personnel with the PPE, training, methods, and equipment necessary to perform the work. Haza rdous spill containment and collection will be performed as follows: - Contain the spill with absorbent socks, booms, granules, or construction of temporary dikes. - Control the spill at the source by closing valves, plugging leaks, up righting containers, over packing contai ners, or transferring conten ts of a leaking container. - Collect the spilled material with shovels, pumps, or heavy equipment as necessary. The decontamination procedures established in Section 7.0 shall be used after the response is complete. Refer to Section 7.5 for information on procedures for emergency decontamination. If site personnel cannot safely respond to an en vironmental release, evacuation of the area may be warranted. Upon their arrival at the site, the Field Supervisor will brief emergency responders of the status and any potential hazards. 11.7 Site Evacuation Procedures Voice, radio, or cellular telephon e communication may be used to alert site workers and provide special instructions on site evacuation. Pers onnel shall evacuate to a designated safe, upwind location and perform a \"head count.\" The Field Supe rvisor is to remain in frequent contact for proper execution of the evacuation procedures. Situations requiring evacuation may include unusually severe weather conditions or fires. In the event of project evacuation, other than weathe r related, the Fuller Road Fire Department (Colonie, NY) will be notified immediately. 11.8 Adverse Weather Conditi ons/Natural Disasters Personnel should be aware of the possibility for th e occurrence of severe w eather such as winter storms/blizzards, lightning, thunderstorms, or hi gh winds. Local weather broadcasts will be monitored by the Field Supervisor when the lik elihood for severe weather exists. Generally, voice or cellular telephone communica tion will be utilized to alert crews to threatening weather. A severe weather shelter shall be identified and the location communicated with the crew(s) upon project mobilization. Observe the following procedures and pr actices regarding inclement weather: Stop outdoor work during electrical storms, hailstorms, and other extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat or cold. Take cover indoors or in vehicle. W912DR-05-D-0026 11-7 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Listen to local forecasts for warning about sp ecific weather hazards such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, and flash floods. 11.9 Lightning Safety Outdoor activities will be suspe nded when the potential for lig htning occurs. The following measures, offered by the National Lightning Safety Institute of Louisville, Colorado shall be taken to minimize the possibility of injury to personnel by lightning: The Field Supervisor is responsib le to monitor weather conditions. Upon seeing lightning or heari ng thunder, outdoor activities sha ll be suspended and personnel shall be evacuated to safe areas (i .e., inside vehicles or buildings ). When clouds with dark bases and wind speeds pick up, anticipate thunderstorms. Those who have been struck by lightning did not seek cover in a timely fashion. The Field Supervisor will continue to monitor weather conditions. Outdoor activities may resume 30- minutes after the last bolt of lightning was observed and the last clap of thunder was heard. People who have been struck by lightning do not carry an electrical charge and are safe to handle. Apply first aid immediately, if you are qualified to do so. Get emergency help promptly. SAFE AREAS INCLUDE: Fully enclosed metal-topped vehicles with windows up Substantial and permanent buildings UNSAFE AREAS INCLUDE: Small structures including huts and rain shelters Nearby metallic objects like fences, gates, instrume ntation and electrical equipment, wires, and power poles The following shall be avoided when lightning is in the area: Trees Water Open fields Using hard-wired telephones and headsets W912DR-05-D-0026 11-8 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final If hopelessly isolated from shelter during close-in lightning, adopt a low crouching position with feet together (up on toes, if possi ble) and hands on ears. If hair stands on end or rises on back of neck, a lightning strike is imminent. Remember the warning phrase from the National Li ghtning Safety Institut e: \"If you can see it (lightning), flee it; if you can hear it (thunder), clear it.\" 11.10 Emergency Equipment At a minimum, the following emergency equipment shall be maintained at the project site(s): Fire extinguishers First aid kits Blood-borne pathogen control supplies or kit Emergency eyewash Spill control Communication devices This equipment is to be inspected by the Field S upervisor on a weekly basis to verify that they are in good condition, ready to use, and easily accessi ble. Note: a seal may be maintained on first aid kits to indicate if the kit has been accesse d within the precedin g week. The weekly inspection of the first aid kit will only be necessary if the se al has been broken. 11.11 Critique and Follow-up of Emergency Procedures The USACE shall be verbally not ified immediately and receive a written notification within 24 hours of all accidents or incidents including re leases, fires, or explosions.

W912DR-05-D-0026 12-1 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Plan Blood-borne pathogens are microorga nisms (i.e., bacteria, virus) sometimes present in blood and certain body fluids, which are capable of causing human disease or death. These pathogens can also be present on objects and su rfaces that have had contact w ith infected blood or certain body fluids. Blood-borne pathogens are also capable of causing human disease or death to unprotected people who are exposed to infected blood or body fluids. Diseases caused by blood- borne pathogens include, but are not limited to, he patitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a nd other sexually transmitted diseases. The most significant of these and of great est concern are hepatitis B and AIDS. Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which attacks the liver. The virus can cause lifelong infectio n, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liv er, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Exposure symptoms include fever, fa tigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, loss of appetite, and jaundice (yellowing of the eyes or sk in). Hepatitis diagnosis is difficult because some symptoms are similar to the flu and may remain mild for an extended period. The HBV can remain infectious for up to 10 days, even in dried blood. Hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to pr event HBV infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the viru s that causes AIDS. People with HIV have what is called HIV infection. Some of these people will develop AIDS because of their HIV infection. Humans may be infected with HIV for many years without experiencing any symptoms. Upon development of AIDS, symptoms may include we ight loss, skin lesions, dry cough, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, swelling of the lym ph glands, and death. Presently, no cure exists for HIV or AIDS, and no vaccination is currently available. A hazard exists for blood and other bodily fluids to be infected with dangerous, infectious pathogens. Employees could become infected if they are exposed to these blood-borne pathogens. The purpose of this Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan is to provide the information, procedures, and requirements necessary to prev ent employee exposure to blood-borne pathogens. 12.1 Regulatory, Requirement, and Policy Compliance This Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Control Pl an has been prepared in compliance with: 29 CFR 1910.1030, Blood-borne Manual (USACE, 2003), Section A.03.06 Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS512 W912DR-05-D-0026 12-2 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final 12.2 Exposure Determination OSHA requires employers to perform an expo sure determination, identifying employees who may incur occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials. The exposure determination is made without regard to the use of PPE. For exposure determination purposes, employees are considered to be exposed, even if they wear PPE. In general, it is anticipated th at project activities will not present a high risk of employee exposure to blood or other body fluids. An excepti on to this would be under circumstances when personnel administer first aid ca re or CPR to injured workers and when personnel clean-up areas and equipment that may have been exposed to blood because of the incident. In these cases, there is reasonable potential for employee skin, eye, mucous memb rane, or potentia l contact with blood or other bodily fluids. The OSHA requires a listing of jo b classifications with identification of tasks performed in which some employees may have potential for occupational e xposure. This requirement is for employees to clearly understand the tasks that they may perform have a potential for occupational exposure to infectious materials. The job classificat ions and associated tasks with an exposure potential are as follows: Field Supervisor Administer first aid or CPR; decontam inate or disinfect surfaces and articles that have contacted infectious materials, and prepare biohazard waste fo r temporary storage and subsequent disposal. Subcontractor Supervisors Administer first aid or CPR; dec ontaminate or disinfect surfaces and articles that have contacted infectious materi als, and prepare biohazard waste for temporary storage and subsequent disposal. LaborerAdminister first aid or CPR; decontaminate or disinfect surfaces a nd articles that have contacted infectious materials, and prepar e biohazard waste for temporary storage and subsequent disposal. These employees have potential for exposure to blood-borne pathoge ns when administering first aid or CPR and when performing post-acciden t clean-up operations due to the following: Contact or absorption of blood or blood-contaminat ed objects through open or broken skin (i.e., cuts, scratches, and rashes) Blood splashes to their eyes, nose, or mouth, or other mucous membranes Punctures through the skin w ith a contaminated sharp object (such as, scissors) W912DR-05-D-0026 12-3 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Workers can reduce their risk of contactin g blood-borne pathogens by implementing the recommended work practices (ou tlined in this plan) before, during, and afte r responding to emergency medical incidents primar ily involving personal injuries. 12.3 Schedule of Implementation The procedures in this Blood- borne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan are to be implemented immediately. Implementation includes: Verifying personnel who are available to voluntar ily provide first aid ca re and CPR hold a valid training certificate from a repu table training provider (American Red Cross or American Heart Association). The Field Supervisor is responsible for verifyin g that an appropriate nu mber of personnel have been trained in and hold valid certific ation to perform first aid and CPR. Verifying that personnel voluntarily providin g first aid care, CPR, post-accident clean-up operations, and biohazard wa ste handling have received the sp ecialized training meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1030; EM 385-1-1, Safety and Health Requirements Manual (USACE, 2003), Section A.03.06; and Shaw E & I Procedure N o. HS512. This training is required for applicable personnel prior to the commencement of work and at least annually thereafter. This training sha ll cover the following elements: Copy of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and this procedure including an explanation of the contents General explanation of the epidemiology and symptoms of bl ood-borne diseases Explanation of the modes of tran smission of blood-borne pathogens Explanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and ot her activities that may involve exposure to blood and othe r potentially infectious materials Explanation of the use and lim itations of practices that wi ll prevent or reduce exposure including appropriate en gineering controls, wo rk practices, and PPE Information of the types, proper use, lo cation, removal, handling, decontamination, and/or disposal of PPE Explanation of the basi s for selection of PPE Information on the hepatitis B vaccine, in cluding information on its efficacy, safety, and the benefits of being vaccinated Information on the appropriate actions to take and persons to cont act in an emergency W912DR-05-D-0026 12-4 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Explanation of the procedure to follow if an exposure incident occurs incl uding the method of reporting the incident and the medical follow-up that will be made available Information on the medical counseling that is provided for exposed individuals Explanation of required signs and labels The Field Supervisor is responsible for veri fying that this blood-bor ne pathogen training has occurred. Verifying that engineering controls are readily available at the project for use in an emergency. Engineering controls for this project include the following: Red-bags for temporary storage of c ontaminated PPE and cleaning materials Appropriately labeled, 30-gallon hard-plastic container for the temporary storage of red-bagged waste Whisk-broom and dust pan for cleaning up contaminated broken glass Gallon container of Clorox\u00ae household bleach Large utility sponge Rolls of paper towels Container of liquid disinfectant hand soap \"Biohazard\" warning labels Individually packaged disinfectant towelettes CPR barriers The Field Supervisor is res ponsible for verifying that th is inventory of engineering controls is readily avai lable at the project si te for emergency use. Personal protective equipment is necessary to prevent employ ee exposures to infectious materials. The necessary PPE, wh ich shall be maintained separately for use in an emergency include the following: P-100 Particulate filtering face-piece respirator (3-M 8293 or equivalent) Face-shields with ratcheting head-suspension Safety glasses with clear lens Disposable nitrile examination gloves PVC Monkey Grip work gloves Poly-coated or Saran-coated disposable Tyvek\u00ae cove ralls with attached hood W912DR-05-D-0026 12-5 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Vinyl or latex disposable boot covers Fluid-resistant surgical hoods The Field Supervisor is responsible for veri fying that the above inventory of PPE is readily available at the project site for emergency use. 12.4 Work Practice Controls Work practice controls reduce th e likelihood of exposure by alteri ng the manner in which a task is performed. The work practice controls outlined in this section are applicable to the administration of first aid and th e subsequent clean-up operations. Work practice controls shall be instituted whenev er there is potential fo r employee contact with blood and bodily fluid. Situational examples where these controls are to be implemented include, but are not limited to: The voluntary administration of firs t aid care, such as application of bandages to minor or major cuts and abrasions of another person. This care may allow fo r contact with sores, wounds, broken skin, blood, or other bodily fluids. The voluntary administration of first aid care, such as providing CPR. Clean-up activities involving handl ing soiled articles (e.g., gauze, bandages, compresses, etc.) and the decontamination or disinfecting of surfaces and articles that have contacted potentially infectious materials, such as blood or other bodily fluids. Prepare biohazard waste for temporary storage and subsequent disposal. Based upon professional judgment, an employee may choose to temporarily forego the use of PPE if the employee determines that the use of the PPE will further jeopardize his well-being or that of the injured worker. This limited applicat ion must be carefully evaluated and considered by the employee. If this situation does occur, Shaw will investigate and document the circumstances in an effort to provide alte rnative means to avoid further occurrence. The following are specific work practice controls that shall be implemen ted in the above noted situations or whenever an employee determines that the implementation of these work practices is prudent or necessary: The appropriate PPE shall be donn ed prior to engaging in any ac tivities that have the potential for employee contact with potentially infectious materials, such as blood or other bodily fluids. Hands and face will be washed as soon as possible after engaging in any activities that have the potential for employee contact with potentially inf ectious materials, such as blood or other bodily fluids. If wash facilities are not readily availa ble, individually packaged disinfectant towelettes may be used in the interim. W912DR-05-D-0026 12-6 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Eating, drinking, or smoking is not allowed in any work area where a potential exists for occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens. Open wounds or cuts sh all be promptly bandaged. Work surfaces and areas shall be cleaned and di sinfected immediately after being contacted by potentially infectious materials. A 10 percent bleach solution (one part bleach added to nine parts water) shall be applied and allowed to have a contact time of 15 minutes. Non-disposable articles, equipment, or materials contaminated with potentially infectious materials shall be similarly cleaned/disinf ected prior to reuse. All bins, pails, cans, and simi lar receptacles intended for reuse, which have become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be cleaned and disinfected immediately after use. Broken glassware, which may be contaminated, sh all not be picked up directly by hand. Broken glass shall be picked-up using mechanical mean s, such as by using a whiskbroom and dustpan. All PPE shall be immediately removed upon leavi ng the potentially contaminated work area, or as soon as possible if visibly contaminated. The contaminated PPE shall be placed in a labeled \"red-bag\" and then placed in the 30-gallon c ontainer for temporary st orage and subsequent disposal. Any clothing that has contacted blood or other pot entially infectious fluids shall be removed as soon as possible. Any clothing that has contacted bl ood or infectious fluids shall be placed in a labeled \"red-bag\" and then placed in the 30-gallon container fo r temporary storage and subsequent disposal. 12.4.1 Universal Precautions Universal precautions is a method of infection cont rol, which operates on the assumption that all human blood and bodily fluids are to be treated as if they are know n to be infectious for HIV, HBV, or other blood-borne pathogens. Univer sal precautions shall be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentia lly infectious materials. Univ ersal precautions consist of the following practices: All workers shall routinely use appropriate ba rrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous- membrane exposure when contact with blood or ot her bodily fluids is anti cipated. Gloves should be worn for touching blood and bodily fluids, mu cous membranes, or non-intact skin and for handling items or surfaces contaminated with blood or body fluids. Masks and protective eyewear or face shields sh all be worn during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other body fluids to prevent exposure of mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Protective suits shall be worn during proce dures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or other bodily fluids. W912DR-05-D-0026 12-7 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Hands and other skin surfaces shall be washed i mmediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other bodily fluids. Hands shall be wa shed immediately after gloves are removed, using a disinfectant soap. Cardiopulmonary resuscitati on barriers or other ventilation devi ces should be available for use in areas in which the need for resuscitation is foreseeable. Workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shall be excluded from handling potentially infectious materi als until the condition resolves. Pregnant workers should be especially familiar with and strictly adhere to precautions to minimize the risk of transmission. 12.4.2 Personal Protective Equipment The proper use of PPE is an effective work pr actice control. The following requirements for PPE are mandatory whenever there is potential for employee contact with blood and bodily fluid: Inspect PPE prior to use to verify it is in good working order and without defects. Blood or other potentially infectious materials. Disposable (single use) gloves, such as surgic al or examination gloves shall be replaced when visibly soiled, torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Gloves should be changed as soon as possible af ter contact with blood or bodily fluids. After use, remove gloves from top to bottom inside ou t, not allowing unprotected skin to contact the exterior of the gloves. Hands and other skin surfaces shall be washed with disinfectant soap immediately after care has been rendered or clean up has been completed. Gloves reduce the incidence of blood contamination of hands, but th ey cannot prevent penetr ating injuri es caused by sharp objects. Do not re use gloves once removed. A CPR barrier shall be used when administering CPR. Protection for the eyes, face, ha nds, body, feet, and against inhala tion hazards shall be provided as appropriate for each job. Gloves shall be worn when employees have the pot ential for direct skin contact with or when handling items or surfaces soiled with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. Polyvinyl chloride work gloves may be disinfected for immediate reuse if the integrity of the glove is not compromised; however, gloves must be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, discolored, torn, punctured, or exhibit other signs of deterioration. All gloves shall be discarded at the conclusion of the activity or at the end of the shift - whichever comes first. Masks and eye protection or chin-length face shie lds shall be worn whenever splashes, spray, splatter, droplets, or aerosols of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and there is a potential for eye, nose, or mouth contamination. W912DR-05-D-0026 12-8 Safety, Health, and Emergency Response Plan Delivery Order No. 0031 Colonie FUSRAP Site August 2010 Final Fluid-resistant clothing (e.g., coated Tyvek\u00ae suits) shall be worn if there is a potential for splashing or spraying of blood or potentially inf ectious materials. Coated Tyvek\u00ae coveralls shall also ean-up activiti es involving decontamina tion or disinfecting of surfaces and articles that have contacted potentia lly infectious materials, and when preparing biohazard waste for temporary st orage and subsequent disposal. Fluid-resistant clothing (e.g., coated Tyvek\u00ae suits) shall be worn if there is a potential for clothing becoming soaked with blood or ot her potentially infectious materials. Surgical caps or hoods shall be worn if there is a potential for spla shing or splattering of blood or potentially infectious materials on the head. Fluid-proof coverings shall be worn if there is a potential for s hoes or boots to contact blood or other potentially infectious materials. Disposable nitrile or vinyl gl oves shall be worn for touching blood and bodily fluids requiring universal precautions, mucous membranes, or non- intact skin and for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or bodily fluids to which universal precautions apply. 12.4.3 Waste Handling All wastes generated because of administering emergency first aid care and the subsequent clean-up activities shall be placed in red-bags, labeled as a bioh azard, and kept se parately from other trash. Wastes used in medical emergency treatment (i.e., gloves, to wels, and gauze) shall also be bagged and stored in an identical manne r. Red-bagged, biohazard waste shall be placed in the 30-gallon collection container, labeled, an d secured for temporary storage and disposal. Additional containers sh all be obtained as needed and c ontainers shall not be overfilled. 12.5 Biohazard Waste Disposal The Shaw Transportation and Disposal Coordina tor shall be contacted to arrange for proper disposal of biohazard wastes. Th e waste shall remain secured on si te in labeled container(s) until disposal arrangements have been made at an approved disposal facili ty. Disposal of the infectious waste container(s) shall be in acco rdance with applicable lo cal, state, and federal regulations. 12.6 Medical Requirements Employees receive medical evalua tions in accordance with Shaw E & I Procedure No. HS100. The medical requirements of this exposure contro l plan include provisions for vaccinations to all exposed employees as well as for post-exposure pr ocedures and evaluations . All employees with potential for occupational exposure to blood-bor ne pathogens shall receive the hepatitis B vaccination and tetanus vaccination prior to wor kplace exposure, unless they read and sign the Hepatitis B and Tetanus Vaccinati on Declination form (Appendix C).

Heart Rate - Each individual will count his/her radial (wrist) pulse as early as possible during each rest period. If the hear t rate of any individual exceeds 75 percent of their calculated maximum heart rate (MHR = 200 - age) at the beginning of the rest period, then the work cycle will be decreased by o ne-third. The rest period will remain the same. An individual is not permitted to return to work until his/her sustained heart rate is below 75 percent of their calcula ted MHR. Temperature - Each individual will measure his/her temperature wi th a thermometer for one minute as early as possible in the fi rst rest period. If the temperature exceeds 99.6\u00b0F at the beginning of the rest period, then the work cycle will be decreased by one-third. The re st period will remain the sam e. An individual is not permitted to return to work if her/her temperature exceeds 100.4 \u00b0F. Note: due to the lack of accuracy in measuring body temperatures, heart rate is probably a better measurement of heat stress and should be weighted accordingly.

OSHA HAZARD CLASS Based on OSHA definitions, the following ingredients in this pr oduct are hazardous. The OSHA physical and health hazard catego ries are shown below. Note: CHS has not conducted specific toxicity tests on this prod uct. Our hazard evaluation is based on information from similar products, the ingredients, technical literature, and/or professional experience Section 1 - CHEMICAL PRO DUCT AND COMPANY IDENTIFICATION Section 2 - COMPOSITION AND INFORMATION ON INGREDIENTS Section 3 - HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION Unleaded Gasoline (All Grades) Page 2 of 5 Gasoline - Flamma ble, toxic, irritant, target organ (CNS) Toluene - Flammable, toxic, irritant, target organ (CNS) Xylene - Flammable, toxic, irritant Benzene - Flammable, irritant, carcinogen, target organ (kidney, liver, blood) 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene - Flammable, toxic, irritant, target organ (CNS, blood) Ethylbenzene - Flammabl e, toxic, irritant POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS ROUTES OF ENTRY: Inhalation, Dermal, Ingestion. ACUTE EFFECTS OF OVER EXPOSURE: Eyes - Slight to moderate eye irritation. Skin - Moderately irritating; causes redness, drying of skin. Inhalation - Irritating to mucous membranes and respiratory tract. Causes dizziness, irritation of eyes, nose and throat, signs of intoxications. Can act as a simple asphyxiant. Ingestion - Burning of the throat and stomach, loss of consci ousness, convulsions, cyanosis , congestion and capillary hemorrhaging of the lungs and internal organs. Possibl e pneumonia (if vomited), loss of consciousness, and death. CHRONIC EFFECTS OF OVER EXPOSURE: Suspect carcinogen from long term exposur e studies on laboratory animals. Recent studies with laboratory animals have shown that gasoline vapor s caused kidney damage and kidney cancer in rats and liver cancer in mice. Mouse skin painting studies ha ve shown that petroleum middle distillates (bo iling range of 100-700\u00b0F) can cause skin cancer when repeatedly applied and never washed from the animal's skin. The relative significance of this to the skin and the resulti ng skin effects (irritation, cell damage, etc.) may play a role in the tumorigenic response. Studies have shown that washing the animal's skin with soap and water between treatments grea tly reduces the carcinogenic effect of some petroleum oils. A few studies have indicated that workers exposed many year s to high concentrations of benzene have a slightly higher incidence of leukemia. Benzene can al so be toxic to the blood and blood-formi ng tissues. For additional information on employee monitoring, information and traini ng, medical surveillance, methods of comp liance, etc., refer to the OSHA benzene standard, CFR 1910.1028. MEDICAL CONDITIONS AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE: May aggravate pre-existing dermatitis, respiratory illness, or other conditions which have the same symptoms or effects as stated above. CARCINOGENICITY: Unleaded Gasoline - NTP: No IARC: No OSHA: No Benzene - NTP: Yes IARC: Yes OSHA: Yes EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: Eye Contact - If material comes in contact with th e eyes, immediately wash the eyes with large amounts of water, occasionally lifting the lower and upper lids until me dical attention can be obtained. Skin Contact - Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected areas with soap and water. If irritation or redness develops, seek medical attention. Inhalation - Move person away from source of exposure and into fresh air. If symptoms persist, seek immediate medical attention. Apply artificial respiration or cardiopulmonary resuscitation if not breathing. Get medical attention. Ingestion - Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Do not induce vomiting. Aspiration of material into the lungs due to vomiting can cause chemical pne umonitis which can be fatal. If spontaneous vomiting occurs, keep head below hips to prevent aspiration of liquid into lungs and monitor for breathing difficulty. Seek medical attention immediately. Keep vict im warm and quiet.

SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES: Water may be ineffective on flames, but shoul d be used to keep fi re-exposed containers cool. Large fires, such as tank fires, should be fought with caution. If possible, pump the contents from the tank and keep adj oining structures cool and protect personnel. Avoid spreading burning li quid with water used for cooling purposes. Do not flush down p ublic sewers. The use of a self-contained breathi ng apparatus and protective clothing is reco mmended for fire fighters. Avoid inhalat ion of vapors. UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS: Highly volatile material. Flowing gasoline can be ignited by self-generated static electricity; containers should be bonded and grounded. Vapors may travel along the ground to a source of ignition (pilot light , heater, electric motor) some distance away. Containers, drums (even empty) can explode when heat (welding, cutting, etc.) is applied. HAZARD RATINGS: NFPA 704: 4 Reactivity- 0 STEPS TO TAKE IF MATERIA L IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: Notify emergency response personnel as appropriate. If facility or operation has an \"Oil or Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan\", \"Spill Prevention Cont rol & Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan\" or equivalent, activate its procedures. REMOVE ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION. Keep unnecessary peopl e away; isolate hazard area and deny entry. Contain spill if possible. Small spills can be remove d with inert absorbent. Dike area of large spill to prevent ru n-off to sewers, streams, etc. Ventilate area. Avoid breathing vapors. Use appropriate personal protective equipment during clean up. C ontact fire authorities and notify appropriate Federal, State, and Local agencies. HANDLING AND STORING: Transport, handle and store in accordance with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.106, and applicable D.O.T. Regulations. Store in tightly closed containers in a dry cool place, away fro m sources of heat or ignition. Ground and b ond all transfer and storage equipment and equip with self-clo sing valves, pressure vacuum bungs and flame arrestors. Caution: Misuse of empty containers can be hazardous.
