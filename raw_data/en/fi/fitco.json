The Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method is a medically designed protocol that results in fat loss while sparing muscle mass. The protocol was developed in France 25 years ago by Dr. Tran Tien Chanh, MD PhD, who focused his career and research on nutrition with a particular emphasis on the treatment of obesity and obesity related issues. The Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method is an easy 4-phase protocol which helps stabilize the pancreas and blood sugar levels while burning fat and maintaining muscle and other lean tissue. This protocol is also an excellent support for cellulite reduction and has been used in well over 2500 Professional Establishments in North America over the last eight years with great success. According to Dr. Tran Tien, \"The cause of most weight issues in a modern society is insulin dysfunction. A diet grossly disproportionate in its share of saturated fats and sugars, such as in breads, cereals, muffins, cakes, pastries, pasta, pizza, rice, corn - very much like the North American diet - causes the pancreas to produce an overabundance of insulin, which stays in the system and puts the blood sugar level in a negative balance.\" An overproduction of insulin also leads to hypoglycemia or low glycemia, which in turn induces constant sugar cravings and weight gain. Insulin's primary function is to regulate blood sugar levels however it is also the hormone that facilitates the transport of fat (triglycerides) into the fat cells. Even worse, it \"locks\" the fat in the fat cell, preventing it to be used as a source of energy. Now, because the blood sugar has dropped (and we can't access the fat as a fuel source) it creates \"sugar cravings' and the vicious cycle begins again. In other words, an over abundance of insulin causes weight gain. The Ideal Protein protocol will transform the body's ability to digest sugars properly by regulating insulin levels. How? By giving the pancreas a well-deserved break and by limiting simple and complex carbs until the weight loss goal is achieved. Principles Behind the Protocol Learn to live off of the body's own fat reserves. The body employs energy from three reserves: glycogen (carbohydrate), protein and fats. First from it's simple and complex carbohydrate reserves and when depleted, turns simultaneously to its protein and fat reserves for energy. A person not in need of weight loss typically has approximately 1-2% of their body's reserves from carbs, approximately 19% from their muscle mass and 79% of their body reserves from fat. Simple and complex carbohydrates can prevent weight loss. The body stores approximately three days worth of carbohydrates. Because of this, the Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method has a beginning and an end. Until 100% of the weight loss goal is achieved, we restrict sugars (simple and complex). Why? Because, as long as sugar is being consumed, the body is not burning fat. It's as simple as that. Remember, the first source of energy is derived from glycogen (carbohydrate) reserves. The main principle is to deplete the glycogen (carbohydrate) reserves completely in order to compel the body to turn to its fat reserve to burn calories. How do we get the body to burn its fat reserves and not its muscle mass reserves, if both are depleted simultaneously? First, by providing the body with foods that have a high protein value, complete with 8 essential amino acids, 97% absorbable, which make them biologically-complete proteins. Secondly, by supplementing with nutrient-rich supplements such as Natura Multi-Vita, Natura Calcium & Magnesium and Natura Potassium, key ingredients in muscle building and electrolytes to replace those normally found in foods restricted on the Ideal Protein protocol. A dieter will feel energized, look vibrant and feel strong. It is no wonder. Given the opportunity for the body's natural ability to heal itself and showcase its innate and ingenious powers, such as in the way during the protocol the body will return the favor with unparalleled force, radiance and beauty. We also offer a modified protocol for Type I diabetics, adolescents and children. What to Expect On average, women lose weight at the rate of 2 to 4 pounds per week and 3 to 5 pounds per week for men. Based on over 25 years of experience and 5 million people in Europe, Canada, and the United States, the program enables the following: - Quick weight loss without sacrificing muscle mass - An understanding of how food affects and is utilized by the body, including what causes fat storage - Improved skin tone by providing the skin nutrients it needs - Utilization of stored fat for energy usually by day 4 \u2014 fat, (along with cellulite) that contains chemical toxins - Improved energy, appetite control and reduced cravings \u2014 usually on day 4 or 5 - Improved blood sugar, cholesterol levels and reduced blood pressure "}
