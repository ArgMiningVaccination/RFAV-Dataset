You have listened to me, helped to identify my problem, and treated my Urticaria problem such that today after a year's consistent treatment, there is barely less than a percent of its evidence. I am extremely grateful to Dr. Shah and Dr. Samreen, for their promptness and attention with care, and above all listening to my responses and doubts, and addressing those seriously. I get more personal attention than many others here get locally from their family physicians! Thank you Lalita, Toronto, Canada Ms. Lalita.S-Toronto, Canada "}
