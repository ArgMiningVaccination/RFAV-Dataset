SOFA score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems. The highest score for each of the six items is 4 points, and the lowest score is 0 points. Finally, the scores of the six items are summed to get the value of the sofa score. The range of the sofa score is 0-24.Higher values represent a worse outcome. - The cessation of mechanical ventilation(MV) administration [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]The duration from the MV administration to the successful cessation in hours( The successful cessation is defined as the termination of MV for more than 48-hours. This outcome measure is intended only for patients receiving MV) - The cessation of vasoactive drugs administration [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]The duration from the vasoactive drugs administration to the successful cessation in hours( The successful cessation is defined as the attainment of a clinician-prescribed mean arterial pressure target for more than 24-hours without the use of vasoactive drugs.This outcome measure is intended only for patients receiving vasoactive drugs) - The duration of CRRT [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]The duration of CRRT therapy in hours( This outcome measure is intended only for patients receiving CRRT) - ICU length of stay [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]ICU length of stay - Incidence of adverse events [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]A adverse event refers to any adverse medical event that occur after the intervention of trial. The adverse events are not necessarily causally related to the trial treatment. - Incidence of serious adverse events [ Time Frame: The outcome will be assessed at the 28 day after enrollment ]Any adverse medical event occurs at any dose that meets one or more of the following criteria: 1. causes death 2.life-threatening 3. requires hospitalization or hospitalization for an extended period of time 4. causes permanent or significant disability and functional defects 5. causes deformity.
