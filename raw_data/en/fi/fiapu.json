Research [suggests](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction) that it can help relieve pain, and it is used for a wide range of other complaints. What is acupuncture? Acupuncture involves inserting needles at certain points of the body. A certified acupuncturist/ chiropractic acupuncture physician will insert needles into a person's body with the aim of balancing their energy. This, it is claimed, can help boost wellbeing and may cure some illnesses. Conditions it is used for include different kinds of pain, such as [headaches](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/73936.php), [blood pressure](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270644.php) problems, and [whooping cough](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706.php), among others. How does it work? Traditional Chinese medicine explains that health is the result of a harmonious balance of the complementary extremes of \"yin\" and \"yang\" of the life force known as \"qi,\" pronounced \"chi.\" Illness is said to be the consequence of an imbalance of the forces. Qi is said to flow through meridians, or pathways, in the human body. These meridiens and energy flows are accessible through 350 acupuncture points in the body. Inserting needles into these points with appropriate combinations is said to bring the energy flow back into proper balance. There is no scientific proof that the meridians or acupuncture points exist, and it is hard to prove that they either do or do not, but numerous studies suggest that acupuncture works for some conditions. Some experts have used [neuroscience](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248680.php) to explain acupuncture. Acupuncture points are seen as places where nerves, muscles, and connective tissue can be stimulated. The stimulation increases blood flow, while at the same time triggering the activity of the body's natural painkillers. It is difficult to set up investigations using proper scientific controls, because of the invasive nature of acupuncture. In a clinical study, a control group would have to undergo sham treatment, or a [placebo](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306437.php), for results to be compared with those of genuine acupuncture. Some studies have concluded that acupuncture offers similar benefits to a patient as a placebo, but others have indicated that there are some real benefits. Uses Research carried out in Germany has shown that acupuncture may help relieve tension headaches and [migraines](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/148373.php). The NCCIH note that it has been [proven to help](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction%20) in cases of: \u00b7 low [back pain](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/172943.php) \u00b7 neck pain \u00b7 osteoarthritis \u00b7 knee pain \u00b7 headache and migraine In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed a number of conditions in which they say acupuncture has been proven effective. These include: \u00b7 high and low blood pressure \u00b7 chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting \u00b7 some gastric conditions, including [peptic ulcer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9273.php) \u00b7 painful periods \u00b7 facial pain \u00b7 sprains \u00b7 [sciatica](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7619.php) \u00b7 dental pain \u00b7 reducing the risk of [stroke](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7624.php) \u00b7 inducing labor Other conditions for which the WHO say that acupuncture may help but more evidence is needed [include](https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/who-official-position/): \u00b7 neuralgia \u00b7 post-operative convalescence \u00b7 substance, tobacco and alcohol dependence \u00b7 spine pain \u00b7 stiff neck \u00b7 vascular [dementia](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214.php) \u00b7 whooping cough, or pertussis \u00b7 Tourette syndrome The WHO also suggest that it may help treat a number of infections, including some [urinary tract infections](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/189953.php) and epidemic hemorrhagic [fever](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/168266.php). They [point out](http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&codcol=93&codcch=196), however, that \"only national health authorities can determine the diseases, symptoms, and conditions for which acupuncture treatment can be recommended.\" Benefits Acupuncture can be beneficial in that: \u00b7 Performed correctly, it is safe. \u00b7 There are very few side effects. \u00b7 It can be effectively combined with other treatments. \u00b7 It can control some types of pain. \u00b7 It may help patients for whom pain medications are not suitable. What to expect According to traditional Chinese medical theory, acupuncture points are located on meridians, through which vital energy runs. This energy is known as \"qi\" or \"chi.\" An acupuncturist will examine the patient and assess their condition, insert one or more thin, sterile needles, and offer advice on self-care or other complementary therapies, such as Chinese herbs. The patient will be asked to lie down on their back, front, or one side, depending on where the needles are to be inserted. The acupuncturist should use single-use, disposable, sterile needles. As each needle is inserted, the patient may feel a very brief stinging or tingling sensation. After the needle is inserted, there is occasionally a dull ache at the base of the needle that then subsides. Acupuncture is usually relatively painless. Sometimes the needles are [heated or stimulated](http://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/186129?path=/bmj/338/7690/Editorials.full.pdf%20%20) with electricity after insertion. The needles will stay in place for [between 5 and 30](http://cim.ucsd.edu/clinical-care/acupuncture.shtml) minutes. The number of treatments needed depend on the individual. A person with a chronic condition may need one to two treatments a week over several months. An acute problem normally improves after 8 to 12 sessions. Risks All therapies have risks as well as benefits. The possible risks of acupuncture are: \u00b7 It is dangerous if a patient has a bleeding disorder or takes blood thinners. \u00b7 Bleeding, bruising, and soreness may occur at the insertion sites. \u00b7 Unsterilized needles may infect the patient. \u00b7 In rare cases, a needle may break and damage an internal organ. \u00b7 When inserted deeply into the chest or upper back, there is a risk of collapsed lung, but this is very rare. The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [regulate](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=880.5580%20) acupuncture needles as medical devices. Their manufacture and labelling needs to meet certain standards. The needles must be sterile, nontoxic, and labelled for one use only, by a licensed practitioner. As with any complementary therapy, it is advisable to use it alongside conventional treatments in cases of chronic or severe illness. "}
