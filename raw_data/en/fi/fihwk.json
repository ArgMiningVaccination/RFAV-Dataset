That's why so much is written about it'. That is the [title of a post](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/) in which I advocate the view put by John Ioannidis that remarkably little is known about the health effects if individual nutrients. That ignorance has given rise to a vast industry selling advice that has little evidence to support it. The 2016 Conference of the so-called \"College of Medicine\" had the title \"Food, the Forgotten Medicine\". This post gives some background information about some of the speakers at this event. I'm sorry it appears to be too ad hominem, but the only way to judge the meeting is via the track record of the speakers. Quite a lot has been written here about the \"College of Medicine\". It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' late, unlamented, Foundation for Integrated Health. But unlike the latter, its name is disguises its promotion of quackery. [Originally](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) it was going to be called the \"College of Integrated Health\", but that wasn't sufficently deceptive so the name was dropped. For the history of the organisation, see [The new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/29/dont-be-deceived-the-new-college-of-medicine-is-a-fraud-and-delusion/) [The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita. Is Graeme Catto selling out?](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/) The conference programme ( [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/College-of-Medicine-Food-conf-programme-2016.pdf)) is a masterpiece of [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Bait+and+switch). It is a mixture of very respectable people, and outright quacks. The former are invited to give legitimacy to the latter. The names may not be familiar to those who don't follow the antics of the magic medicine community, so here is a bit of information about some of them. The introduction to the meeting was by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon) and [Catherine Zollman](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Zollman), both veterans of the Prince of Wales Foundation, and both devoted enthusiasts for magic medicne. [Zollman even believes](http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7217/1115.1) in the battiest of all forms of magic medicine, homeopathy ( [download pdf](Vickers-Zollman-homeopathy-1999.pdf)), for which she totally misrepresents the evidence. Zollman works now at the [Penny Brohn centre](http://www.pennybrohn.org.uk/) in Bristol. She's [also linked to](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portland-Centre-4pp-A5-Programme-68048-FINAL-4.pdf) the \" [Portland Centre for integrative medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/)\" which is run by [Elizabeth Thompson](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/07/27/dr-elizabeth-thompson-of-bristol-homeopathic-hospital-finds-that-pills-that-contain-nothing-have-no-effect-not-even-placebo-effect/), another advocate of homeopathy. It came into being after NHS Bristol shut down the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, on the very good grounds that it doesn't work. Now, like most magic medicine it is privatised. The [Penny Brohn shop](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/) will sell you a wide range of expensive and useless \"supplements\". For example, [Biocare Antioxidant capsules](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/collections/supplements-1/products/biocare-antioxidant-complex-90-vegecaps) at \u00a337 for 90. Biocare make [several unjustified claims](https://www.biocare.co.uk/default.aspx?GroupGuid=1053) for their benefits. Among other unnecessary ingredients, they contain a very small amount of green tea. That's a favourite of \"health food addicts\", and it was the subject of a [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/delaTorre-green-tea-2016.pdf) that contains one of the daftest statistical solecisms I've ever encountered \"To protect against type II errors, no corrections were applied for multiple comparisons\". If you don't understand that, try [this paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). The results are almost certainly false positives, despite the fact that it appeared in Lancet Neurology. It's yet another example of broken peer review. It's been know for decades now that [ \"antioxidant\" is no more than a marketing term](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/03/anti-oxidant-supplements-dangerous-garlic-useless-update/), There is no evidence of benefit and large doses can be harmful. This obviously doesn't worry the College of Medicine. Margaret Rayman was the next speaker. She's a real nutritionist. Mixing the real with the crackpots is a standard bait and switch tactic. Eleni Tsiompanou, came next. She runs yet another [private \"wellness\" clinic](http://healthbeing.co.uk/), which makes all the usual exaggerated claims. She seems to have an [obsession with Hippocrates](http://healthbeing.co.uk/hippocrates/) (hint: medicine has moved on since then). [Dr Eleni's Joy Biscuits](http://healthbeing.co.uk/recipes/dr-elenis-joy-biscuits/) may or may not taste good, but their health-giving properties are make-believe. Andrew Weil, from the University of Arizona gave the keynote address. He's described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on Nutrition and Health\". That description alone is sufficient to show the fantasy land in which the College of Medicine exists. He's a typical supplement salesman, presumably very rich. There is no excuse for not knowing about him. It was 1988 when [Arnold Relman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_S._Relman) (who was editor of the New England Journal of Medicine) wrote [A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html). \"Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence.\" This blog has mentioned his more [recent activities](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/02/17/quackademics-in-usa-and-canada/#arizona), many times. [Alex Richardson](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=7412), of Oxford Food and Behaviour Research (a charity, not part of the university) is an enthusiast for omega-3, a favourite of the supplement industry, She has published several papers that show little evidence of effectiveness. That looks entirely honest. On the other hand, [ their News section](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=342) contains many links to the notorious supplement industry lobby site, Nutraingredients, one of the least reliable sources of information on the web (I get their newsletter, a constant source of hilarity and raised eyebrows). I find this worrying for someone who claims to be evidence-based. I'm told that her charity is funded largely by the supplement industry (though I can't find any mention of that on the web site). Stephen Devries was a new name to me. You can infer what he's like from the fact that he has been endorsed byt Andrew Weil, and that his address is \"Institute for Integrative Cardiology\" (\"Integrative\" is the latest euphemism for quackery). Never trust any talk with a title that contains \"The truth about\". His was called \"The scientific truth about fats and sugars,\" In [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PC0zYKLkk), he claims that diet has been shown to reduce heart disease by 70%. which gives you a good idea of his ability to assess evidence. But the claim doubtless helps to sell his books. Prof Tim Spector, of Kings College London, was next. As far as I know he's a perfectly respectable scientist, albeit one with [books to sell](http://www.tim-spector.co.uk/), But his talk [ is now online](https://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/food-medicine-diet-myths-microbes/?dm_i=PC7,4DPC1,3PB5TI,G3CAO,1), and it was a bit like a born-again microbiome enthusiast. He seemed to be too impressed by the PREDIMED study, despite it's statistical unsoundness, which was [pointed out by Ioannidis](http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf). Little evidence was presented, though at least he was more sensible than the audience about the uselessness of multivitamin tablets. Simon Mills talked on \"Herbs and spices. Using Mother Nature's pharmacy to maintain health and cure illness\". He's a herbalist who has featured here [many times](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Simon+Mills%22). I can recommend especially his video about [Hot and Cold herbs](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/06/10/bait-and-switch-by-herbalists-chinese-and-western/) as a superb example of fantasy science. Annie Anderson, is [Professor of Public Health Nutrition](http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-annie-s-anderson) and Founder of the Scottish Cancer Prevention Network. She's a respectable nutritionist and public health person, albeit with their customary disregard of [problems of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/). Patrick Holden is chair of the [Sustainable Food Trust](http://www.ciwf.org.uk/about-us/high-profile-supporters/visionaries/civil-society/patrick-holden-cbe/). He promotes \"organic farming\". Much though I dislike the cruelty of factory farms, the \"organic\" industry is largely a way of making food more expensive with no health benefits. The Michael Pittilo 2016 Student Essay Prize was awarded after lunch. Pittilo has [featured frequently](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=pittilo) on this blog as a result of his execrable promotion of quackery -see, in particular, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). Nutritional advice for patients with cancer. This discussion involved three people. Professor Robert Thomas, Consultant Oncologist, Addenbrookes and Bedford Hospitals, Dr Clare Shaw, Consultant Dietitian, Royal Marsden Hospital and Dr Catherine Zollman, GP and Clinical Lead, Penny Brohn UK. Robert Thomas came to my attention when I noticed that he, as a regular cancer consultant had spoken at a meeting of the quack charity, \"YestoLife\". When I saw he was scheduled tp speak at another quack conference. After I'd written to him to point out the track records of some of the people at the meeting, he withdrew from one of them. See [The exploitation of cancer patients is wicked. Carrot juice for lunch, then die destitute](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/). The influence seems to have been temporary though. He continues to lend respectability to many dodgy meetings. He edits the [Cancernet web site](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/index.html). This site lends credence to bizarre treatments like [homeopathy](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-homeopathy.htm) and [crystal healing](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-crystal.htm). It used to sell [hair mineral analysis](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/nutritional-reports.htm), a well-known phony diagnostic method the main purpose of which is to sell you expensive \"supplements\". They still sell the \"Cancer Risk Nutritional Profile\". for \u00a3295.00, despite the fact that it provides no proven benefits. Robert Thomas designed a food \"supplement\", Pomi-T: capsules that contain Pomegranate, Green tea, Broccoli and Curcumin. Oddly, he seems still to subscribe to the antioxidant myth. Even the supplement industry [admits that that's a lost cause](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation-Policy/Why-antioxidant-claims-have-been-killed-off-in-the-EU/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-Jun-2016&c=Spm99iS8YwD3CuvOLnW9pQ%3D%3D&p2=), but that doesn't stop its use in marketing. The one [randomised trial](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/pp-pomi-t.pdf) of these pills for prostate cancer was inconclusive. [Prostate Cancer UK says](http://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2013/6/superfoods) \"We would not encourage any man with prostate cancer to start taking Pomi-T food supplements on the basis of this research\". Nevertheless it's promoted on Cancernet.co.uk and widely sold. The [Pomi-T site boasts](https://www.pomi-t.co.uk/) about the (inconclusive) trial, but says \"Pomi-T\u00ae is not a medicinal product\". There was a cookery demonstration by Dale Pinnock \"The medicinal chef\" The programme does not tell us whether he made is signature dish \"the [ Famous Flu Fighting Soup](http://www.dalepinnock.com/flu-fighting-soup-itvs-this-morning/)\". Needless to say, there isn't the slightest reason to believe that his soup has the slightest effect on flu. In summary, the whole meeting was devoted to exaggerating vastly the effect of particular foods. It also acted as advertising for people with something to sell. Much of it was outright quackery, with a leavening of more respectable people, a standard part of the bait-and-switch methods used by all quacks in their attempts to make themselves sound respectable. I find it impossible to tell how much the participants actually believe what they say, and how much it's a simple commercial drive. The thing that really worries me is why someone like Phil Hammond supports this sort of thing by chairing their meetings (as he did for the \"College of Medicine's\" direct predecessor, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. His defence of the NHS has made him something of a hero to me. He assured me that he'd asked people to stick to evidence. In that he clearly failed. I guess they must pay well. Follow-up Although many university [courses in quackery have now closed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4900), two subjects that hang on in a few places are western herbalism, and traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture). The University of Westminster still runs [Chinese medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683), and [Western herbal medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) (with [dowsing](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541)). So do the [University of Middlesex](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) and University of East London. Since the passing of the Health and Social Security Act, these people have been busy with their customary bait and switch tactics, trying to get taxpayers' money. It's worth looking again at the nonsense these people talk. Take for example, the well known herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.plant-medicine.com/cvs/SYMcv.htm). At one time he was associated with the University of Exeter, but no longer. Perhaps his views are too weird even for their [Third Gap](http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/research/index.php?page=1&group=17) section (the folks who so [ misrepresented their results](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439) in a trial of acupuncture). Unsurprisingly, he was involved in the late Prince's Foundation for Magic Medicine, and, unsurprisingly, he is involved with its successor, the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/search/node/Simon%20Mills)\", where [he spoke](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/human-experiences-herbal-medicines) along similar lines. You can get a good idea about his views from [the video of a talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) that he gave at Schumacher College in 2005. It's rather long, and exceedingly uncritical, so here's a shorter version to which some helpful captions have been added. That talk is weird by any standards. He says, apparently with a straight face, that \"all modern medicines are cold in the third degree\"..And with ginger and cinnamon \"You can stop a cold, generally speaking, in its tracks\" (at 21 30\" in the video). This is simply not true, but he says it, despite the fact that the [Plant Medicine](http://www.plant-medicine.com/) with site (of which he's a director) which he is associated [gives them low ratings](http://www.plant-medicine.com/freepages/find-herbs.asp?symptom2=cold,%20common) Simon Mills is also a director of [SustainCare](http://www.sustaincare.net/company.htm). Their web site says SustainCare Community Interest Company is a social enterprise set up to return health care to its owners: \"learning to look after ourselves and our families in ways that make sense and do not cost the earth\". It is founded on the principle that one's health is a personal story, and that illness is best managed when we make our health care our own. The enterprise brings clinical expertise, long experience of academia, education and business, and the connections and resources to deliver new approaches. \"As its own social enterprise contribution to this project Sustaincare set up and supported Caf\u00e9 Sustain as a demonstration Intelligent Waiting Room at Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health in Devon\". (yes, that's Michael Dixon, again] In the talk (see video) Mills appears to want to take medicine back to how it was 1900 years ago, in the time of Galen. The oblique speaking style is fascinating. He never quite admits that he thinks all that nonsense is true, but presumably it is how he treats patients. Yet a person with these bizarre pre-scientific ideas is thought appropriate to advise the MHRA It's characteristic of herbalists that they have a very long list of conditions for which each herb is said to be good. The sort of things said by Mills differ little from the 1900-year old ideas of Galen, io the 17th century ideas of Culpepper. You can see some of the latter in my oldest book, Blagrave's supplement to Culpepper's famous herbal, published in 1674. See what he has to say about daffodils It is \"under the dominion of Mars, and the roots hereof are hot and dry almost in the third degree\". \"The root, boyled in [posset drink], and drunk, causeth vomiting, and is used with good successe in the beginning of [Agues], especially [Tertians], which frequently rage in the spring-time: a plaister made of the roots with parched Barley meal, and applied to swellings and [imposthumes]do dissolve them; the juice mingled with hony, frankincense, wine and myrrhe, and dropped into the Eares, is good against the corrupt filth and running matter of the Eares; the roots made hollow and boyled in oyl doth help [Kib'd heels [or] [here] the root is good for [Morphew], and discolourings of the skin.\" It seems that daffodils would do a lot in 1674. Even herbalists don't seem to use it much now. A recent [herbal site describes](http://medicineherbs.net/medicinal-herbs/daffodil) daffodil as \"poisonous\". But the descriptions are very like those used by present day herbalists, as you can hear in Simon Mills' talk. Chinese medicine is even less tested than western herbs. Not a single Chinese herb has been shown to be useful for treating anything (though in a very few case, they have been found to contain drugs that are useful when purified, notably the anti-malarial compound, artemesinin). They are often contaminated, some are dangerously toxic. And they [contribute to the extinction of tigers and rhinoceros](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) because of the silly myths that these make useful medicines. The cruelty of bear bile farming is legendary. In a recent [report in China Daily](http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&q=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/08/content_15489946.htm&ct=ga&cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAjtvJ_gRIAVAAWABiAmVu&cd=ZA4JQyP9VeE&usg=AFQjCNEfqSqaUnGuh7mjZkKTM_uFXyDz1w) (my emphasis). In a congratulation letter, Vice-Premier Li Keqiang called for integration of TCM and Western medicine. TCM, as a time-honored treasure of Chinese civilization, has contributed to the prosperity of China and brought impacts to world civilization, Li said. He also urged medical workers to combine the merits of TCM with contemporary medicine to better facilitate the ongoing healthcare reform in China. The trade in Chinese medicines survives only for two reasons. One is that thay are a useful tool for promoting Chinese nationalism. The other is that they are big business. Both are evident in the vice-premier's statement. I presume that it's the business bit that is the reason why London South Bank University (ranked 114 ou ot 114) that led to one of their main lecture theatres being decorated with pictures like this.\"Mr Li Changchun awarding 2010 Confucius Institute of the year to LSBU Vice Chancellor\" . I'll bet Mr Li Changchun uses real medicine himself, as most Chinese who can afford it do. Presumably, what's taught in their Confucius Institute is the same sort of [dangerous make-believe nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043).that's taught on other such courses. The \"College of Medicine\" run a classical bait and switch operation. Their \" [First Thursday lectures](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses)\" have several good respectable speakers, but then they have Andrew Flower, He is \"a former president of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, a medical herbalist and acupuncturist. He has recently completed a PhD exploring the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of endometriosis\". He's associated with the [Avicenna Centre for Chinese Medicine](http://www.avicenna.co.uk/practitioners/andrew-flower/), and with the [University of Southampton's quack division](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/details.php?id=4) The only bit of research I could find by Andrew Flower was a Cochrane review, [Chinese herbal medicine for endometriosis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006568.pub3/abstract). The main results tell us \"Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Both these trials described adequate methodology. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment.\" But the plain language summary says \"This review suggests that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be useful in relieving endometriosis-related pain with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment.\" It sounds to me as though people as partisan as the authors of this should not be allowed to write Cochrane reviews. Flower's talk is followed by one from the notorious representative of the herbal industry, [ Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269#follow), talking on [Herbal medicine: A major resource for the 21st century](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses/firstthursdayherbal?dm_i=PC7,U1NI,3PB5TI,2GPNL,1). That's likely to be about as objective as if they'd invited a GSK drug rep to talk about SSRIs. The people at Kings College London Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences are most certainly not quacks. They have made a database of chemicals found in traditional Chinese medicine. It's sold by a US company, [Chem-TCM](http://www.chemtcm.com/) and it's very expensive (Commercial license: $3,740.00. Academic/government license: $1,850.00). Not much open access there. It's a good idea to look at chemicals of plant origin, but only as long as you don't get sucked into the myths. It's only too easy to fall for the bait and switch of quacks (like TCM salespeople). The sample page shows good chemical and botanical information, and predicted (not observed) pharmacological activity. More bizarrely, it shows also analysis of the actions claimed by TCM people. It does seem odd to me to apply sophisticated classification methods to things that are mostly myth. The multiple uses claimed for Chinese medicines are very like the make-believe claims made for western herbs by Galen, Culpepper and (with much less excuse) by Mills. They are almost all untrue, but their proponents are good salesmen. Don't let them get a foot in your door. Follow-up 10 June 2012. No sooner did this post go public when I can across what must be one of the worst herbal scams ever: \" [Arthroplex](http://josephinejones.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/arthroplex-instant-relief-for-the-wallet/)\" 31 July 2012. Coffee is the subject of another entry in the 1674 edition of Blagrave. Blagrave evidently had a lower regard for coffee than I have. \"But being pounded and baked, as do it to make the Coffee-liquor with, it then stinks most loathsomly, which is an argument of some Saturnine quality in it.\" \"But there is no mention of an medicinal use thereof, by any Author either Antient of Modern\" Blagrave says also \"But this I of UCL's History department \"that the bodies of the English that indulge in this liquor to such an extent seem to degenerate into the nature of barbarians\" My boss, Lucia Sivolotti got something very like that herself. Be very impressed. Salway suggested that clearer Latin would have been \"quod on to Blagrave, but I can't find his email address. I much prefer Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi's aphorism (often misattributed to Paul Erd\u00f6s) \"A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\" Our undercover investigation finds evidence of nutritional therapists giving out advice that could seriously harm patients' health That's the title of [an article](/Which-Nutritional-therapists-Feb-2012.pdf) in February's Which? magazine. (That's similar to Consumer Reports in the USA). \"When Which? sent researchers to investigate the quality of advice from nutritional therapists, some was so bad that patients' health was put at risk. One nutritional therapist advised against surgery and radiotherapy to treat cancer, while another 'diagnosed' a problem with adrenal glands without any blood-test results. Some also used unproven testing, such as iridology or mineral testing, to identify problems or diagnose conditions.\" \"We sent five undercover researchers to visit three nutritional therapists each. Every researcher was equipped with a specific health-related scenario: Helen (46) and Sarah (40), recently diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer; Mark (56) and Linda (52), suffering with serious fatigue for the past three months; and Emily (31), trying unsuccessfully to conceive for more than a year.\" | | Sarah, posing as a patient diagnosed with DCIS, visited a nutritional therapist who advised her to delay treatment recommended by her oncologist (a lumpectomy and a course of radiotherapy). The therapist suggested that Sarah follow a no-sugar diet for three to six months and told her, 'cancer lives off sugar; if you feed it sugar it's going to thrive. If we starve the cancer of sugar then you have a better opportunity of the cancer going away'. When Sarah asked whether the cancer could progress during this time the therapist said it was a 'gamble'. Dr Margaret McCartney, from our panel of experts, says: 'If cancer treatment were as simplistic as cutting out sugar, surely we would have discovered a cure. This advice is highly irresponsible.' Our experts rated this consultation as a 'dangerous fail'.\" The The Universities Admission Service (UCAS) no longer lists any BSc/MSc degrees in \"Nutritional Therapy\" or \"Nutritional medicine\". Westminster University But there are a large number of university courses called \"Nutrition\". How many of them teach properly, and how many of them teach the nonsense that prevails in \"nutritional therapy\", I don't know. The term 'nutrition' has turned into a dangerous minefield. It can mean almost anything, because the term is undefined. Anyone can, and does, describe themselves as a nutritionist. At one extreme you have slick pills salesman like The one thing that you need to get clear is that if you want advice about nutrition, go to a dietitian not a \"nutritionist\". Dietitians are the properly qualified people who work in the NHS, and who are (mostly) free of crackpot ideas. I suppose that one should not be surprised at the poor, and sometimes dangerous, advice that was given by nutritional therapists. Their training contains much nonsense so it isn't surprising that they did so badly. Some of it has been revealed here. See, for example, [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) [Nutritional Fairy Tales from Thames Valley University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=260) [College of Natural Nutrition: bizarre teaching revealed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=384) [Nutriprofile: useful aid or sales scam?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=221) [Response to a threatening letter from Mr Holford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=159) [Food for the Brain: Child Survey.

But look at what they still teach at Westminster University.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) The level of knowledge of both physiology and chemistry shown my some of the therapists was shocking. One recommended avoiding margarine, because it's \"two chemical bonds away from pure plastic\". Another said that Flora margarine contains lots of trans fat, which has not been true for a long time. One graduate ot the [late Thames Valley University course](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=260) said \"\"advantage of the wholemeal or the wholegrain ... is that they contain more fibre and the fibre stops the sugars being absorbed quite as quickly\". Not so. Brown and white bread have [much the same glycaemic index](http://www.portalsaudebrasil.com/artigospsb/nutri028.pdf) (60 - 70). Quack diagnosis One alarming fact was that several therapists offered methods of [diagnosis for allergy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=122) and for deficiencies that have been known for many years not to work. There isn't anything controversial about [iridology](http://www.skepdic.com/iridol.html), hair mineral analysis, taste tests. kinesiology. or the [Vega test](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131#vega).

Colquhoun, from our panel of experts, said: 'Sadly, nutritional therapy is plagued by \"diagnostic tests\" that are little more than quackery; they are tools to aid sales, rather than tools to diagnose deficiencies. [Iridology]and [hair analysis]simply don't work.\" Unnecessary treatments One therapist advised a researcher to have an optimum nutritional evaluation test, costing \u00a3312, and a cellular nutrition profile, costing \u00a3156. Apparently, these would allow the therapist to give a more targeted service by establishing what vitamin and mineral deficiencies he had. Our experts were not convinced by these tests and certainly didn't think they were worth the money; any necessary testing could be done by a GP for free. In 12 of the 15 consultations, researchers were prescribed a huge range of supplements, costing up to \u00a370 per month. It was not revealed whether or not the prescriber made money from this, but usually you were asked to give the prescriber's name \"to get a discount\". So it's a fair guess that they got kickbacks. British Association for Applied Nutrition & Nutritional Therapy (BANT) Despite the low standards of advice, 13 out of the 14 therapists who were visited were registered with BANT, the British Association for Applied Nutrition & Nutritional Therapy. This is what passes for a professional association for nutritional therapists, though like all such bodies in alternative medicine, it is entirely ineffective as a regulator. Rather it serves to protect whatever untrue claims they make. BANT's code of practice says that its members won't diagnose, but in fact many of the therapists diagnosed conditions and created treatment plans. You can be confident that BANT will do nothing to stop this bad practice. You can find out a lot about BANT from these sources: [British Association for Nutritional Therapy - when an organisation looks like a regulator, quacks like a regulator, but isn't a regulator](http://holfordwatch.info/2007/05/09/british-association-for-nutritional-therapy-when-an-organisation-looks-like-a-regulator-quacks-like-a-regulator-but-isnt-a-regulator/) [Why it is easy to get the incorrect impression that BANT is a regulator](http://holfordwatch.info/2007/05/11/why-it-is-easy-to-get-the-incorrect-impression-that-bant-is-a-regulator/) [Nutritional Therapists Fail to Join Ofquack](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/04/nutritional-therapists-fail-to-join.html) [BANT: A Profile](http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/bant-a-profile/) [Matthias Rath drops his million pound legal case against me and the Guardian.](http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/matthias-rath-pulls-out-forced-to-pay-the-guardians-costs-i-think-this-means-i-win/) Only 3 of the 14 therapists were registered with the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (the [CNHC, more commonly know as Ofquack](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311)). They are meant to be the official regulator, launched with a good chunk of taxpayers' money, but registration is voluntary and [not many have volunteered](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/04/nutritional-therapists-fail-to-join.html).

Follow-up The excellent [Quackometer has posted](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2012/01/which-uncovers-dangerous-advice-from-nutritionists.html) simultaneously on the great nutritional therapy scam. 16 January 2012 The British Dietetic Association issued a press release that describes very clearly the many differences between a real dietitian and a \"nutritional therapist\".

BANT moans that that Which? \"did not provide all the promised transcripts/questionnaires in a timely fashion\". In fact they got them before Christmas and were given until January 15th to respond. 16 January 2012. BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, had an item with Jenny Driscoll from Which? magazine and BANT chairperson, Catherine Honeywell. She did, inter alia, admit that some of the behaviour of the therapists were irresponsible. It remains to be seen if they do anything about it. don't hold your breath. [Hear it on BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b019f8bh). 16 January 2012. There was pretty god coverage of the story, even [in the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2087167/Nutrition-therapists-condemned-quacks-patients-health-risk.html). 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766).

I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 17 January 2012 The discussion is going on at the [Which? web site](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/nutritional-therapists-advice-worth-the-cost/). A Chris James cast doubt on the reaults because ot the small sample size, and asked for confidence limits, so [I gave them](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/nutritional-therapists-advice-worth-the-cost/comment-page-1/#comments). Chris James It is easy enough to calculate limits yourself -you don't even need to be able to do the maths -there are web calculators that do it for you, e.g. [http://www.causascientia.org/math_stat/ProportionCI.html] 14/15 = 93% failed. 95% confidence limits for this are 69.8% to 98.4% 6/15 = 40% gave dangerous advice 95% confidence limits 19.7% to 64.6% So despite the small sample size we can say that it's likely that at least 70% (and possibly 98%) of nutritional therapists fail. And it is likely that at least 20% (and possibly 65%) of nutritional therapists give dangerous advice. These results give real cause for concern, despite the small sample size. For statistical enthusiasts, these limits are Bayesian with a uniform prior. Very much the same result is given by the standard analysis which is explained in section 7.7 of Lectures on Biostatistics [ [download pdf](/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf) 10.5 Mb] 18 January 2012. BANT has, at last, produced an [\"updated response\"](http://www.bant.org.uk/bant/pdf/WHICH/UPDATED_RESPONSE_FROM_BANT_TO_WHICH_ARTICLE_20120118.pdf). The good thing is that it starts by saying \" . . it is completely outside the BANT Code of Practice to advise a client to withhold any treatment for cancer for any period of time in order to follow a nutritional approach. Were a client to be advised in such a way we would expect to receive a complaint against the practitioner.\" I hope that this will happen. This statement, the only admission of guilt in BANT's response, is rather spoiled by a later suggestion that no such recommendation was made. It looked very clear to both Which? magazine and to the three members of the expert panel. The rest of the response admits no fault of any sort. I'm sorry to say that the response by BANT shows very clearly what is wrong in nutritional therapy. Any organisation which can see nothing wrong in the advice given in 14 of the 15 consultations is, I'd argue, a threat to the health of the nation. Rather than saying we'll try to improve, they just deny everything. The response seems to show that the professional organisation for nutritional therapists is not part of the solution. Rather it is part of the problem. Since writing about anti-scientific degrees in [Nature (March 2007)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), much has been revealed about the nonsense that is taught on these degrees. New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/). They no longer \"validate\" external degrees at dodgy business colleges, loony religious colleges or magic medicine colleges. [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) (October 2008) This is a 'degree' in nutrtional therapy. It is even more hilarious than usual, but it passed the validation anyway. [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) (November 2010). This post followed the BBC Wales TV programme. At last the QAA began to notice, yet further confirmation of its utter ineptitude. [The University of Wales disgraced (but its vice chancellor is promoted)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766) (October, 2011) The eventual collapse of the university was well-deserved. But it is very weird that the people who were responsible for it have still got their jobs. In fact the vice-chancellor, Marc Clement, was promoted despite his mendacious claim to be unaware of what was going on. It remains to be seen how many of the many quack courses that were validated by the University of Wales will be taken on by other universities. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic is owned by BPP University (so much for their quality control, as [explained in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4422)). but still claims to be validated by Wales until 2017. Some of the more minor players Edinburgh Napier University. After an FOI request (rejected), Napier closed their herbal medicine degree in 2010. [Hot and cold herbal nonsense from Napier University Edinburgh: another course shuts.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (June 2010) As expected, the Scottish Information Commissioner agreed with that for England and Wales and ordered material to be sent.

Some of the horrors so discovered appeared in [Yet more dangerous nonsense inflicted on students by Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4188). The embarrassment seems to have worked. Their remaining degrees in aromatherapy and reflexology have now vanished from UCAS too.

Chiropractic Surprisingly, given the total discreditation of chiropractic in the wake of the Simon Singh affair, and the internecine warfare that followed it, none of the chiropractic courses have shut yet. Some are clearly in trouble, so watch this space. Osteopathy has also had no course closures since 2007. Like chiropractic it also suffers from internecine warfare. The General Osteopathic Council refuses to disown the utter nonsense of \"craniosacral\" osteopathy. But the more sensible practitioners do so and are roughly as effective as physiotherapists (though [there are real doubts](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) about how effective that is). Excluding chiropractic and osteopathy, this is all that's left. It now consists almost entirely of Chinese medicine and a bit of herbal.

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long. Vice-chancellors and Universities UK (UUK), the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the Hiigher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE), [Skills for Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh), the and [Prince Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=3179#050610) his reincarnated organisation, the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632)\", the [King's Fund](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2131), the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU), [OfQual, Edexcel](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), National Occupational Standards and Qualifications and the Curriculum Authority (QCA).

This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012. The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/degree-courses/8989183/Lie-back-and-relax-reflexology-and-aromatherapy-degrees-are-dropped.html) has carried a piece about closure of university courses, written by Michael Hanlon. On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2).

The [published version](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9051103/Complementary-medicine-courses-in-universities-how-I-beat-the-varsity-quacks.html) was edited slightly. There's been no official announcement, but four more of Westminster's courses in junk medicine have quietly closed. For entry in 2011 they offer |University of Westminster (W50)||qualification| |Chinese Medicine: Hon BSc/MSci| |Nutritional Therapy (B400)||3FT Hon BSc| But Medicine: BSc| |Herbal Medicine with Foundation Year (B340)||4FT/5FT Hon BSc/MSc| At the end of 2006, Westminster was offering 14 different BSc degrees in seven flavours of junk medicine. In [October 2008](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=404104), it was eleven. This year it's eight, and next year only four degrees in two subjects. Since \"Integrated Health\" was 'merged' with Biological Sciences in May 2010, two of the original courses have been dropped each year. This September there will be a final intake for Nutrition Therapy and Naturopathy. That leaves only two, Chinese Medicine (acupuncture and (Western) Herbal Medicine. The official reason given for the closures is always that the number of applications has fallen. I'm told that the number of applications has halved over the last five or six years. If that's right, it counts as a big success for the attempts of skeptics to show the public the nonsense that's taught on these degrees. Perhaps it is a sign that we are emerging from the endarkenment. Rumour has it that the remaining degrees will eventually close too. Let's hope so. Meanwhile, here is another helping hand. There is already quite a bit here about the dangers of Chinese medicine, e.g. [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329#tcm) and, especially, [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). A [submission to the Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) gives more detail. There has been a lot on [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=acupuncture) here too. There is now little doubt that it's no more than a theatrical, and [not very effective](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439), placebo. So this time I'll concentrate on Western herbal medicine. Western Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is just a branch of pharmacology and it could be taught as such. But it isn't. It comes overlaid with much superstitious nonsense. Some of it can be seen in slides from [Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (the difference being that Napier closed that course, and Westminster hasn't) Even if it were taught properly, it wouldn't be appropriate for a BSc for several reasons. First, there isn't a single herbal that has full marketing authorisation from the MHRA. In other words, there isn't a single herb for which there is good evidence that it works to a useful extent. Second, the fact that the active principals in plants are virtually always given in an unknown dose makes them potentially dangerous. This isn't 1950s pharmacology. It's 1920s pharmacology, dating from a time before methods were worked out for standardising the potency of natural products (see [Plants as Medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205)). Third, if you are going to treat illness with chemicals, why restrict yourself to chemicals that occur in plants? It was the herbal medicine course that gave rise to the most virulent [internal complaints](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) at the University of Westminster. These complaints revealed the use of pendulum dowsing by some teachers on the course and the near-illegal, and certainly dangerous, teaching about herbs [in cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). Here are a few slides from Principles of Herbal Medicine(3CT0 502). The vocabulary seems to be stuck in a time warp. When I first started in the late 1950s, words like tonic, carminative, demulcent and expectorant were common Over the last 40 years all these words have died out in pharmacology, for the simple reason that it became apparent that there were no such actions. But these imaginary categories are still alive and well in the herbal world. There was a lecture on a categories of drugs so old-fashioned that I've never even heard the words: \"nervines\". and \"adaptogens\". | | | || | The \"tonics\" listed here seem quite bizarre. In the 1950s, \"tonics\" containing nux vomica (a small dose of strychnine) and gentian (tastes nasty) were common, but they vanished years ago, because they don't work. None of those named here even get a mention in | | The only 'relaxant' here for which there is the slightest evidence is Valerian. I recall tincture of Valerian in a late 1950s pharmacy. It smells terrible, According to Not much, for something that's been around for centuries. And None of this near-total lack of evidence is mentioned on the slides. | | What about the 'stimulants'? Rosemary? No evidence at all. Tea and coffee aren't medicine (and not very good stimulants for me either). | | Ginseng, on the other hand, is big business. That doesn't mean it works of course. | | Thymoleptics - antidepressants are defined as \"herbs that engender a feeling of wellbeing. They uplift the spirit, improve the mood and counteract depression\". Oats, Lemon balm, Damiana, Vervain. Lavender and Rosemary are just old bits of folklore | | | | The only serious contender here is St John's Wort. At one time this was the prize exhibit for herbalists. It has been shown to be as good as the conventional SSRIs for treatment of mild to moderate depression. Sadly it has turned out that the SSRIs are themselves barely better than placebos. [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. \"Adaptogens\" are another figment of the herbalists' imaginations. They are defined in the lecture thus. | || | Well, it would be quite nice if such drugs existed. Sadly they don't. - The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. Another lecture dealt with \"stimulating herbs\". No shortage of them, it seems. Well at least one of these has quite well-understood effects in pharmacology, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine. It isn't used much because it can be quite dangerous, even with the controlled dose that's used in real medicine. In the uncontrolled dose in herbal medicines it is downright dangerous. | || | | || | This is what [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/ephedra/) about Ephedra - An NCCAM-funded study that analyzed phone calls to poison control centers found a higher rate of side effects from ephedra, compared with other herbal products. - Other studies and systematic reviews have found an increased risk of heart, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal problems, as well as high blood pressure and stroke, with ephedra use. - According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is little evidence of ephedra's effectiveness, except for short-term weight loss. However, the increased risk of heart problems and stroke outweighs any benefits. It seems that what is taught in the BSc Herbal Medicine degree consists largely of folk-lore and old wives' tales. Some of it could be quite dangerous for patients. A problem for pharmacognosists While talking about herbal medicine, it's appropriate to mention a related problem, though it has nothing to do with the University of Westminster. My guess is that not many people have even heard of pharmacognosy. If it were not for my humble origins as an apprentice pharmacist in Grange Road, Birkenhead (you can't get much more humble than that) I might not know either. Pharmacognosy is a branch of botany, the study of plant drugs. I recall inspecting powered digitalis leaves under a microscope. In Edinburgh, in the time of the great pharmacologist John Henry Gaddum, medical students might be presented in the oral exam with a jar of calabar beans and required to talk about their anticholinesterase effects of the physostigmine that they contain. The need for pharmacognosy has now all but vanished, but it hangs on in the curriculum for pharmacy students. This has engendered a certain unease about the role of pharmacognists. They often try to justify their existence by rebranding themselves as \"phytotherapists\". There are even journals of phytotherapy. It sounds a lot more respectable that herbalism. At its best, it is more respectable, but the fact remains that there no herbs whatsoever that have well-documented medical uses. The London School of Pharmacy is a case in point. Simon Gibbons (Professor of Phytochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry). The School of Pharmacy) has chosen, for reasons that baffle me, to throw in his lot with the reincarnated Prince of Wales Foundation known as the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632)\". That organisation exists largely (not entirely) to promote various forms of quackery under the euphemism \"integrated medicine\". On [their web site](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/perspectives-medicines-natural-resource) he says \"Western science is now recognising the extremely high value of herbal medicinal products . . .\", despite the fact that there isn't a single herbal preparation with efficacy sufficient for it to get marketing authorisation in the UK. This is grasping at straws, not science. The true nature of the \"College of Medicine\" is illustrated, yet again, by their \" [innovations network](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/innovations-network)\". Their idea of \"innovation\" includes the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated medicine, both devoted to promoting the utterly discredited late-18th century practice of giving people pills that contain no medicine. Some \"innovation\". It baffles me that Simon Gibbons is willing to appear on the same programme as Simon Mills and [ David Peters](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22David+Peters%22), and [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Mills' ideas can be judged by [watching a video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437#) of a talk he gave in which he 'explains' \"hot and cold herbs\". It strikes me as pure gobbledygook. Make up your own mind. He too has rebranded himself as \"phytotherapist\" though in fact he's an old-fashioned herbalist with no concern for good evidence. David Peters is the chap who, as Clinical Director of the University of Westminster's ever-shrinking School of Quackery, tolerates dowsing as a way to select 'remedies'. The present chair of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy is Michael Heinrich. He, with Simon Gibbons, has written a book [Fundamentals of pharmacognosy and phytotherapy](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BEV_6SGtZJIC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&ots=phB98jokgG&dq=%22Simon+Gibbons%22+quack&output=html). As well as much good chemistry, it contains this extraordinary statement \"TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] still contains very many remedies which were selected by their symbolic significance rather than their proven effects; however this does not mean that they are all 'quack'remedies! There may even be some value in medicines such as tiger bone, bear gall, turtle shell, dried centipedes, bat dung and so on. The herbs, however, are well researched and are becoming increasingly popular as people become disillusioned with Western Medicine.\" It is irresponsible to give any solace at all to the wicked industries that kill tigers and torture bears to extract their bile. And it is simple untrue that \"herbs are well-researched\". Try the test, A simple test for herbalists. Next time you encounter a herbalist, ask them to name the herb for which there is the best evidence of benefit when given for any condition. Mostly they refuse to answer, as was the case with [Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) (but he is really an industry spokesman with few scientific pretensions). I asked Michael Heinrich, Professor of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy. Again I couldn't get a straight answer. Usually, when pressed, the two things that come up are St John's Wort and Echinacea. Let's see what The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has to say about them. NCCAM is the branch of the US National Institutes of Health which has spent around a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money on research into alternative medicine, For all that effort they have failed to come up with a single useful treatment. Clearly [they should be shut down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123). Nevertheless, as an organisation that is enthusiastic about alternative medicine, their view can only be overoptimistic. For St John's Wort . [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. For Echinacea [NCCAM say](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/echinacea/ataglance.htm)s - Study results are mixed on whether echinacea can prevent or effectively treat upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold. For example, two NCCAM-funded studies did not find a benefit from echinacea, either as Echinacea purpurea fresh-pressed juice for treating colds in children, or as an unrefined mixture of Echinacea angustifolia root and Echinacea purpurea root and herb in adults. However, other studies have shown that echinacea may be beneficial in treating upper respiratory infections. If these are the best ones, heaven help the rest. Follow-up On 23rd May 2008 a letter was sent to the vice-chancellor of the University of Westminster, Professor Geoffrey Petts | | | | Despite reminders, we were never afforded the courtesy of a reply to this, or any other letter. Professor Petts has, however, replied to a letters sent to him recently by the [Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/102-pseudo-science-by-degrees-a-response.html). He said \"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them. They are not teaching pseudo-science, as you claim,...\". Neither of thse claims is true.I know at least two members of the Life Sciences Faculty who are very worried. One has now left and one has retired. The rest are presumably too scared to speak out. It is most certainly not true to say they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". Both the vice-chancellor and the Dean of Life Sciences, Jane Lewis, have been made aware of what;s happening repeatedly over several years, I can think of no other way to put it but to say Professor Petts is lying. Tha is not a good thing for vice-chancellors to do. Much of what is taught at Westminster has now been revealed. This seems like a good moment to summarise what we know. Searching this blog for \"University of Westminster\" yields 39 hits. Of these, 11 show what's taught at Westminster, so I'll summarise them here for easy reference. March 26th, 2007 The day after \" [Science degrees without the Science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)\" appeared in Nature, the University of Westminster issued a statement (now vanished, [but see debate in THE](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208512\u00a7ioncode=26)). In my view, their statement provides the strongest grounds so far to believe that the BSc is inappropriate. Let's take a look at it. | | \"The BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Homeopathy is a fully validated degree that satisfies internal and external quality assurance standards.\" Since that time, the university has closed down the BSc in Homeopathy.

At that time there were five \"BSc\" degrees in homeopathy. A couple of weeks ago I checked the UCAS site for start in 2009, and found there was only one full \"BSc (hons)\" left and that was at Westminster University. Today I checked again and NOW THERE ARE NONE. A phone call to the University of Westminster tonight confirmed that they have suspended entry to their BSc (Hons) homeopathy degree. Then I revealed another set of slides, showing a misunderstanding (by the teacher) of statistics, but most chillingly,some very dangerous ideas conveyed to students by Westminster's naturopaths, and in the teaching of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the great \"detox\" scam. \"if you get tuberculosis, it isn't caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis?

Nevertheless the complaint had some effect, though not much. | | 050110 Course leader proposed to review current Polyclinic policies and procedures, and discuss current practice in cases of serious disease and how doctors are informed and patients consented The response included \"Extracts from Smith J, Rowan N & Sullivan (2000) Medicinal Mushrooms: Their therapeutic properties and current medical usage with special emphasis on cancer treatment\" from Cancer Research UK.\" | | In almost all the examples that will be discussed in this chapter the polysaccharides act mainly as immune- stimulants with little or no adverse drug reactions. Furthermore, several of these extracts have been shown to stimulate apoptosis in cancer cells (e.g. Fullerton et al., 2000). While there are examples where the mushroom polysaccharides have shown efficacy against specific types of cancer as monotherapy, the overwhelming successes have been demonstrated when they function together with proven and accepted chemotherapeutic agents. I could not find that document at Cancer Research UK though there is a similar report, dated May 2002, \"Medicinal Mushrooms: Their therapeutic properties and current medical usage with special emphasis on cancer treatments\" by Smith, Rowan and Sullivan. It can be downloaded at the Cancer Research UK page, [Medicinal Mushrooms and Cancer](http://sci.cancerresearchuk.org/labs/med_mush/med_mush.html). That page, last updated 7 August 2006, lists John Smith BSc MSc PhD DSc FIBiol FRSE as Emeritus Professor of Applied Microbiology, University of Strathclyde. amd Chief Scientific Officer, MycoBiotech Ltd, Singapore, and Richard Sullivan BSc MD PhD as Head of Clinical Programmes, Cancer Research UK (a job he [left in 2008](http://www.eurocancercoms.eu/ecrm.aspx)). Professor John Smith is still Chief Scientific Advisor to [Mycobiotech Inc](http://www.mycobiotech.com/scientific.htmlhttp://www.mycobiotech.com/scientific.html), based in Singapore. This company sells various [mushroom products](http://www.mycobiotech.com/business.html). They are all marketed as \"nutriceuticals\" or \"functional foods\", not as pharmaceuticals. These descriptions are a very common way of making medicinal claims for products, while describing them as foods to avoid the strict regulations about claims made for medicines. It does not seem to me to be a good idea for Cancer Research UK to have advice on its web site from someone with a very obvious financial interest. The quotations from the Smith report are obviously intended to defend the practice of prescribing mushrooms to people on chemotherapy. But the fact that in 2011, five years after the CRUK page, Mycobiotech still has no approved medicine approved for cancer speaks for itself. They sell Shiitake Herbal Soups. They also sell Essence of Shiitake which, they say, contains Lentinan, \"which has been confirmed through research, to be an immuno-enhancer. Lentinan has been found to reduce tumour growth and to prolong the life of cancer patients\". That sounds to me like a rather strong medicinal claim for a \"food\". Even [Nutra-ingredients](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation/Mushroom-extract-seeks-Novel-Foods-approval-again), the industry site for nutriceuticals, doesn't claim much for it. Now back to Westminster's response to the student's complaint. | | I have found no evidence that herbal practitioners in the Polyclinic are making explicit claims to treat cancer. And, from David Peters. | | DP**There is one item in the notes however which I think we need to comment on. While the paper-trail in all other respects shows that the herbal prescription was supportive, one herb in the prescription is categorised as 'anti-tumour'. Although I am convinced after reviewing the notes and talking with the tutor involved, that the aim was to support the patient through her chemotherapy, this part of the prescription nonetheless signifies some ambivalence at least, about whether the aim was or was not to treat cancer But then, from Julie Whitehouse | | JW Yes there is antitumour as an action for many herbs and nutritional components - and several relevant actions including anything as general as anti- oxidant even - it doesn't mean we are suggesting they are being used as treatment It doesn't take much reading between the lines to see the tension between Whitehouse and Peters. The former is very reluctant to give up the myths, the latter is slightly more cautious about claims to treat cancer. Let's be clear about one thing. The student was dead right. There is so little reliable information about mushrooms that neither Cochrane Reviews nor NCCAM has anything relevant to say about them. Antioxidants are [a myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90), much beloved by marketing people and \"boosting the immune system\" is the universal mantra of every advocate of magic medicine when they can't think of anything else to make up. Why can't Peters and Whitehouse admit it? More complaints This one is from a member of staff who teaches on the herbal medicine course. It was addressed to Julie Whitehouse and copied to the dean and vice-chancellor.(10 July 2009). | | \"During last week (5-9th May) I witnessed a member of the Herbal Team and a student dowsing with a pendulum to divine herbal drugs to prescribe for the student. When I approached and spoke, they defensively hid the pendulum and were clearly embarrassed. I discussed what they were doing. They freely said they were prescribing herbal medicine and cited other staff as their 'authority' and 'instructors'. Diagnosing or prescribing by pendulum has no scientific credibility. Further, it is dangerous for prescribing as it both fails to identify any appropriate drugs (except by chance) and may select dangerous drugs for a patient. I know other staff have raised with you the teaching or use of such mediaeval and unscientific practices on the Wmin HM course.\" \"I feel that such practice in the HM Course teaching or in the Polyclinic should be proscribed. I would like to suggest that you address and resolve this matter urgently. Dowsing is in conflict with the VC's recent letter to SIH staff, specifically expecting more evidence of science within the teaching of CT Courses.\" \"I expect that were the Department of Health to be aware of the unscientific teaching and promotion of practices like dowsing, (and crystals, iridology, astrology, and tasting to determine pharmacological qualities of plant extracts) on the Wmin HM Course, progress towards the Statutory Regulation of Herbal Medicine could be threatened.\" The writer seems to have overestimated the sense in the Department of Health. They were aware of these practices (I told them) but nevertheless went ahead with [ a silly form of statutory regulation.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) The same lecturer wrote on 27 July 2009 | | \"This happened with a supervisor, students and patient in the consultation room. The patient was invited to dowse her own \"remedies\" using a pendulum. A set of Bach Flower remedies (also proscribed in the HM Clinics) was placed in front of the patient and a pendulum was produced. On the basis of the dowsing, a prescription of 'remedies' was dispensed.\" \"Although Julie says dowsing has been proscribed, she has been unable to present and document saying as such. Bach Flower Remedies have been proscribed for HM Clinics.\" Some of the replies were sent to me. Julie Whitehouse replied to the lecturer and Peter Davies on 10 August 2009 | | \"I have written and circulated the text to be put into the handbook and have had approval from most members of the herbal team - but [the lecturer who complained] was not there at the time - hope he approves of the statement. It does not specifically say we do not dowse - but it does I think state clearly what we do - we surely do not want a list of what we don't do - where would it end - there could be many things in a list of what we don't do.\" So she explicitly refused to ban the use of dowsing in Westminster's clinic. The lecturer replied, pointing out the unreasonableness of this attitude. | | Dear Julie, I am afraid that I have not received any copy (home or University) of your 'statement' so cannot comment. Please resend me another copy. I don't understand your not wanting 'a list of what we don't do - where would it end'. It is commonplace to have proscribed activities in both social and professional activities, and these are usually for clear reasons of safety and public good. Eg.: Herbal practice is constrained by the prohibitions in the Medicines Act 1968 and following, the maximum dosages under Schedule III of that Act, the prohibited herbal drugs under the MCA, Trading Standards regulations, etc. It seems that, despite the vice-chancellor's assurance that the courses would become more scientific, there are still apologists for diagnosis with a pendulum, and for treating cancer with mushrooms at Westminster University. This saga sounds only top characteristic. Complaints through official channels usually get you nowhere with big organisations. Sadly, the only way to get change is public embarrassment. Some action from Vice-chancellor Geoftrey Petts is long overdue. Follow-up A [a copy an ancient remedy for today's anxiety, [ British Journal of Wellbeing](http://www.britishjournalofwellbeing.com/cgi-bin/go.pl/library/abstract.html?uid=49168)1 (4), 25-30.. This is the paper that I described above, on the basis of the abstract, as \"preliminary study\".. Now that I've seen it I realise it isn't study at all. They simply emailed 377 members of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists to ask what they thought of S. laterifloria. Only 62 replied (16%) and their anecdotes are listed in the paper. It is this sort of worthless information that gets herbal medicine a bad name. 10 August 2011. I notice that Professor Petts has replied to a letters sent to him by the [Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/102-pseudo-science-by-degrees-a-response.html). He said \"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them. They are not teaching pseudo-science, as you claim,...\". Well I know at least two member of the Life Sciences department who are very worried. One has now left and one has retired. The rest are presumably too scared to speak out. How he has the nerve to claim that they don't teach pseudo-science all the teaching materials that have been revealed on this blog is hard to imagine. It is simply not true and he must know it. I find it deeply worrying when vice-chancellors say things which they know to be untrue. The latest example to come to light is cited by Andy Lewis on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/foresight-preconception.html) \"There are some even odder characters too, such as Roy Riggs B.Sc who descibes himself as a \"Holistic Geobiologist\" and is \"an \"professional Earth Energy dowser\". He guest lectures at the London Westminster University's School of Integrative Medicine and The Baltic Dowser's Association of Lithuania.\" I do wonder who Professor Petts thinks he's fooling. One of my first posts about nonsense taught in universities was about the University of Westminster (April 2008): [Westminster University BSc: \"amethysts emit high yin energy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227). since then, there have been several more revelations. | | Professor Petts | | The vice-cnancellor of Westminster, Professor Geoffrey Petts, with whom the buck stops, did have an internal review but its report was all hot air and no action resulted (see By that time Salford University had closed down all its CAM, and the University of Central Lancashire was running an honest internal review which resulted in closure of (almost) all of their nonsense degrees. But Westminster proved more resistant to sense and, although they closed down homeopathy, they still remain the largest single provider of degrees in junk medicine. See, for example [More make-believe from the University of Westminster. This time it's Naturopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), and [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). It's interesting that Westminster always declined to comply with Freedom of Information requests, yet I had more from them than from most places. All the information about what's taught at Westminster came from leaks from within the university. Westminster has more moles than a suburban garden. They were people with conscience who realised that the university was harming itself. They would claim that they were trying to save the university from some remarkably bad management. I claim also that I'm working in the interests of the university. In the wake of the [victory at the Information Tribunal,](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) I sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for for samples of teaching materials from all of their courses. This time they couldn't legally refuse. The first batch has just arrived, so here are a few selected gems of utter nonsense. Well, it is worse than nonsense because it endangers the health of sick people. A letter to the university from a student Before getting on to the slides, here's a letter that was supplied under FOIA. It was sent anonymously to the university. I was told that this was the only letter of complaint but I happen to know that's not true so I've asked again. This one was forwarded to the vice-chancellor in 2008, and to the review committee. Both seem to have ignored it. Judging from the wording, one would guess that it came from one of their own undergraduates. :Here are some extracts.[ [download whole letter](/westminster-complaint-2008.pdf)] | | It is a flagrant contradiction of a 'science' in the BSc to have these practices, but it also jeopardises our profession, which is under DoH review and being constantly attacked in the media Gustifiable I suggest). We are taught that simply tasting plant tinctures can tell us which part of the body they work. on and what they do in the body. We are given printed charts with an outline of the body on to record our findings on. This is both nonsense, but is dangerous as it implies that the pharmacology of plant tinctures can be divined by taste alone. In class we are taught that we can divine the drug actions or use of an unknown plant simply by tasting an alcohol extract. Science? or dangerous fantasy. There are lecturers taking clinics who allow students to dowse and partake themselves in dowsing or pendulums to diagnose and even to test suitability of plant drugs. Dowsing is taught to us by some lecturers and frowned upon by others but we feel it brings the herbal medicine into a poor light as it is unscientific and bogus nonsense. We are concerned that we have seen the course leader brush over this practice as though she is frightened to make a stand. The letter seems to refer to a course in herbal medicine. That is a subject that could be studied scientifically, though to do so would leave students unemployed because so few herbal treatments have been shown to work. It obviously is not being studied scientifically: but even teaching students about dowsing and pendulums does not seem to have stirred the vice-chancellor into action. David Peters: wishful thinking? David Peters is a nice man. He's the Clinical Director of Westminster's School of Integrated Health. I debated with him on the excellent Radio 4 Programme, Material World. His lecture on \"Complementary Healthcare in the NHS\" showed some fine wishful thinking. It shows the progress of the euphemisms that quacks use to try to gain respectability, but little else. Interestingly, later slides show a bit more realism. So he has noticed that the tide has turned and that a lot of people are no longer willing to be palmed off with new age gobbledygook. And yes, courses are shutting. Perhaps his course will be the next to shut? According to an internal Westminster email that found its way to me, The following courses have been closed/identified for closure due to poor recruitment : - BSc degrees in Homeopathy and Remedial Massage & Neuromuscular Therapy, students completing by September 2011 - MA degrees in International Community development, Community development and Faith-based Community development, students completing by September 2011 - BSc degree Complementary Medicine - Graduate diploma BMS The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: - Integrated Health Scheme: BSc Herbal Medicine The BSc (Hons) degree in naturopathy Naturopathy us pretty bizarre, because it consists largely of doing nothing at all, beyond eating vegetables . Being ill is good for you. Perhaps the best source to judge claims is the US [ National Center for Complementary and Alternive Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123) (NCCAM), a branch of the National Institutes of Health. This is the outfit that has spent over a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money testing alternative medicines and for all that money has not come up with a single useful treatment. They never link to any sort of critical comment, and are nothing if not biassed towards all things alternative. If they can't come up with evidence. nobody can. Two useful links to NCCAM are [Herbs at a glance](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), and [Health Topics A - Z](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm). Uses of herbal teas in naturopathic dietary care I was sent a set of over 50 slides on \"Herbal Teas/Decoctions (3CMWS03, 1/02, Uses of herbal teas in naturopathic dietary care). About half of them amount to little more than 'how to make a cup of tea'. but then we get onto uses, but then a lot of fantasy ensues. What [NNCAM says about dandelion](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/dandelion/). There is no compelling scientific evidence for using dandelion as a treatment for any medical condition. What Westminster says Well I know what a diuretic is, but \"blood purifier\" and \"liver tonic\" are meaningless gobbledygook. We've been through this before with Red Clover (see Michael Quinion's .look at the term \" [blood cleanser](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=16)\"). Using words like them is the very opposite of education. What [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chamomile/ataglance.htm).about chamomile: Chamomile has not been well studied in people so there is little evidence to support its use for any condition. What Westminster says So, judging by NCCAM, these claims are unjustified. It's teaching folk-lore as though it meant something. More dangerous advice comes when we get to the 'repertories'. Infections can kill you, They are one of the modest number of things that pharmacology can usually cure, rather than treat symptomatically. If you go to a Westminster-trained naturopath with a serious infection and follow their advice to put garlic in your socks, you will not just be smelly, You could die.

Talking of the \"vibrational medicine\" fantasy, I had an email that pointed out a site that plumbs new depths in fantasy physics. It's on the PositiveHealthOnline website: A post there, [Spirals and Energy in Nature](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/energy-medicine/spirals-and-energy-in-nature), was written by [Robert McCoy](http://www.positivehealth.com/author/robert-mccoy). He claims to have worked on microprocessor layout design, but anyone with school physics could tell that the article is sheer nonsense. In a way it is much more objectionable that the silly slides with coloured rays used in the Westminster course. McCoy's post seeks to blind with sciencey-sounding language, that in fact makea no sense at all. Luckily my retweet of the site attracted the attention of a real physicist, A.P. Gaylard, who made a very welcome return to blogging with [Fantasy physics and energy medicine](http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/fantasy-physics-and-energy-medicine/). He dismantles the physics, line-by-line, in a devastating critique. This sort of junk physics is far more dangerous than the perpetual motion pundits and the cold-fusion fantasists. At PositiveHealthOnline it is being used to push pills that do you no good and may harm you. It is a danger to public health. Systems biology is all the rage, No surprise then, to see the University of Westminster [advertising a job](http://liv2.www.jobs.ac.uk/employer/university-of-westminster) for a systems biologist in the The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences.

LWA) The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences wishes to appoint a Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology. The post-holder will teach on the undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes within the School of Life Sciences, particularly in the areas of Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and/or statistics, establish their own and participate in ongoing research programmes and undertake external income generation activities. The candidate should have an active interest in bridging the gap between western life sciences and Chinese medicine using emerging systems biology approaches, specifically in metabolomics and proteomics with a goal of developing novel diagnostic technologies facilitating the creation of a personalised approach to medical care. They should therefore be willing to work closely with colleagues in the life sciences as well as with clinicians and clinical researchers from within the East Asian medical tradition. The post is available from 1st October 2010 or as soon as possible thereafter. The closing date for applications, together with a short statement on why you believe you are suitable for the position and a description of your research plans, is Monday 6th September 2010. Interviews are expected to be held later in September. Administrative contact (for queries only): Tayjal Tailor ( Reference Number: 50000360 Closing Date: Friday 3 September 2010 A note about systems biology Systems biology is about about how whole organs behave, as opposed to single cells or single molecules, It has to be the ultimate aim of biology. There is one case in which this has been done with some success, That is the modelling of the behaviour of the whole heart by Denis Noble and his colleagues in the Phyiology department (now gone) in Oxford. They adopted a bottom up approach. They measured the currents that flow though many sorts of ion channels in single cells from various parts of the heart, and how individual cells communicate with each other. Starting from this solid basis, together with a lot of computer power, they were able to model successfully a lot of phenomena that occur in the whole heart, but can't be investigated in single cells. For example their work cast light on abnormal heart rhythms like ventricular fibrillation, and on the effect of drugs on heart rhythm. This work was mostly done before the term 'systems biology\" thought of. It was called physiology. It is impressive work, and systems biology became a fashionable buzzword among research administrators and funding agencies. Despite the amount of money thrown at the problem, I'm not aware of any success that remotely approaches Noble's.. One reason for that is that people have not been willing to put in the groundwork. In the case of the heart, the models were built on -many years of basic research on the electrophysiology of single heart cells. People have tried to model from the top down, without doing the spade work first. There has developed a perception that computing power can compensate for lack of basic knowledge about things work. It can't. The usual aphorism applies: garbage in, garbage out. Here's an example, which eas noted in the [diary pages for 29 June, 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#sysbio). While in Edinbuurgh, to give a talk to the European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, I noticed a poster. It described an attempt to model on a computer the entire metabolic network of yeast. \"81 of the 662 intracellular concentrations were defined . . . The remainder were set to the median concentration of c. 0.2 mM.\" Ahem. We didn't know the concentrations so we just made them up so we could run the program. It's interesting that even people in the business seem to realise that even that it isn't living up to the hype. The [Fixing proteomics](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) web site shows why. Put another way, if you try to run before you can walk, you risk falling falling on your face. For these reasons, it seems to me that that most attempts at system biology have been disappointing (please correct me if I'm wrong) Systems biology for Chinese medicine If systems biology suffers from trying to run before it can walk in regular biology, where at least something is known about the functions of cells, how much more true that must be of Chinese medicine. In Chinese medicine almost all the treatments have never been tested properly in man. The odds are that most don't work at all, and some are very poisonous (not to mention the cruelty and destruction of endangered species that is involved in making some of their more bizarre medicines). The idea that you can explain it with systems biology, is ludicrous in the extreme. One can't imagine any vaguely competent biologist who'd want to touch a project as bizarre as this with a bargepole. Eastmedicine This advertisement stems presumably from [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) is the University of Westminster's research centre for East Asian Sciences and Traditions in Medicine. The proclaimed aims are to focus on \"understanding, development and evaluation of East Asian medicines as living traditions\". The director of EASTmedicine, [Volker Scheid](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/index.php), is a herbalist and acupuncturist and, as such, a firm believer in alternative medicine. When he isn't at the University he has a private practice, the [Traditional Acupuncture Centre](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/), in London. The website of his private practice makes some [astonishing claims](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/page1.html) \"Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of numerous conditions including headache, migraine, digestive problems, menstrual disorders, indeterminate aches and pains, asthma, hayfever, stress, tiredness, depression and anxiety. Also commonly treated are chronic conditions such as arthritis, back pain, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema, sinusitis, high blood pressure and repetitive strain injuries.\" These claims simply cannot be justified by any worthwhile evidence. It will be interesting to see what Trading Standards make of them. Dr Scheid [describes himself](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/chinese-medicine-and-complementary-therapies/volker-scheid) as a \"scholar physician\". Physician seems a rather pretentious description for someone whose qualifications are [stated to be](http://www.byregion.net/chinese%20medicine/HealerPages/8/cp/.) PhD, MBAcC, FRCHM. But in similar vein he describes himself thus \"I am one of the West's leading experts on Chinese medical formulas and treatment strategies\". Although Scheid sells acupuncture treatments to patients, he seems ro be more anthropologist than medical. In a discussion of two acupuncture papers \"From the Perspective of the Anthropologist - Volker Scheid, London, UK From a perspective anchored in the cultural studies of science, technology and medicine my main interest in these papers is their status as cultural artifacts that provide access to the lifeworlds of a particular research community. If any, life-world debate and argument marks sites of contestation.\" [Forsch Komplement\u00e4rmed 2007;14:371-375] Scheid shows not the slightest interest in whether acupuncture works other than as a placebo. Since he is selling acupuncture, he presumably starts from the premise that it works. Volker Scheid has had a \u00a3205,000 Wellcome Trust for the History of Medicine Project Grant: 2009 2012; Treating the Liver: Towards a Transnational History of East Asian Medicine; There's nothing wrong with writing the history of long-outdated systems of medicine, though one could hardly imagine that the history would be very impartial, when it is written by a true believer. Another taste of his style can be found in his paper on [Globalising Chinese Medical Understandings of Menopause](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/downloads/EASTS_Menopaus_Article.pdf). There is lots of rather pretentious stuff about culture, but very little about what actually works, Towards the end of the paper we come to the usual feeble excuse. \" . . once traditional medicines allow themselves to be evaluated by biomedical research methods, the odds against receiving fair treatment are heavily stacked against them.\" The translation of that into plain English is something like 'when we test our treatments properly we find they don't work, so we blame the methods and carry on with selling them anyway'. Judging from its web site, [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) does not to do any serious clinical trials to test whether the treaments work in man, They just know that they do. But they are hoping to add some spurious scientific background to their dubious claims by hiring someone to do compuations that will cast no light whatsoever on the question that really matters, Do they work or not? The agenda is made clear by [the statement](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) EASTmedicine seeks to describe and analyse the dynamics of these transformations with a specific view of managing their integration into contemporary health care. So it is just yet another group of people pushing to have unproven and disproved treatments accepted by real medicine. The University of Westminster appears to be determined to make itself the laughing stock by persisting in promoting junk science at a time when most other universities have realise that the harm done to their reputations is not worth the income it generates, Plenty of it has been [revealed here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22). The vice-chancellor of Westminster, Prof Geoffrey Petts, made into the pages of Private Eye (see [Crystal balls. Professor Petts in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1153) when he announced that he wouldn't get rid of the junk, but would make it more 'scientific'. Well, credit where it's due, They have [dropped homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). see [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) For 2010 they still off [ten different \"BSc (Hons)\" degrees](http://courses.westminster.ac.uk/CourseSearch.aspx) in pre-scientific forms of medicine. It will take more than a bit od talk about systems biology to make anyone believe that these courses have anything to do with science. For example, look at some slides from their lectures on \"energy medicine\", the of Westminster. This time it's Naturopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) , or [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) The Dean of the School of the Life Sciences, [Jane Lewis](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/dean-of-the-school), is an entirely respectable marine biologist. She has had the thankless task of merging the real science with the alternative medicine in a single school. I phoned her to get a reaction \" outcome of merger of the school and trying to bring various parts of the school together\" \" \"things are much more rigorous than they were\". DC: \"Why don't you just phase it out?\" \"I'm not in a poition to do that. i move things forward as seems best -for the whole school I have to say\". We're retaining those bits thatI think have some good standing -I see NICE has approved the use of acupuncture for lower back pain and some other bits and pieces so I see acupuncture as something that does have some standing, andwe make sure it rigorously taught\" \"DCHave you looked at the stuff on naturopathy?\" \"Are amethysts emit high Yin energy still taught?\" \" i don't think so\". [It seems, as so often in this case, that the senior people don't really know what's being taught under their noses. Prof](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) Lewis says she has not read about the [background to the (unusually) daft advice from NICE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593). Neither has she read [Barker Bausell's book](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell)on acupuncture research. If she had done any of these things,I suspect she would not have such a high opinion of it as appears to be the case. Bait and switch. Astonishingly there is a now a whole organisation devoted to the respectabalisation of Traditional Chinese Medicine [Good Practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research in the Post-genomic Era](http://www.gp-tcm.org/) It sounds nice and sciencey but, as usual, they are trying to run before they can walk. The first thing has to be to do good clinical trials to find out if there is anything there to be investigated. If, and only if, this is the case, would there be any case for fancy talk about \"proteomics\" and \"the post-genomic era\". I do hope that no funding agency would be fooled into parting with money on the basis of the present vacuous rhetoric. Professor Lewis said that I have I have quoted things like \" [amethysts emit high Yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" out of context. There is a simple solution to that. I have asked Westminster to make available the entire contents of the courses. Then we shall all be able to see the context of what their sudents are being taught. Follow up A brief report of this matter has appeared in [Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413176&c=1). In a statement, the University of Westminster says \"its research into Chinese medicine is following the lead of \"top research institutions\". I'm not aware of anyhting quite like this from anywhere else. In any case, Westminster should be able to think for themselves. Suggested twitter tag: #buckgate | | Number 19 Buckingham Street, London WC2N 6EF.is to be the home of the proposed \"College of Medicine\" that has arisen from the ashes of the Naturally one must ask if the \"College of Medicine\" will propagate the same sort of barmy ideas as the Prince's Foundation used to do, A visit to Companies House shows the auguries are not good | | 19 Buckingham Street For one thing, the name College of Medicine has existed only since May 2010. The company was registered originally 19th November 2009 as The College of Integrated Health, but after a teleconference on 5th May 2010 it [changed its name](/col-med-name-change.pdf), presumably to make itself sound more like real medicine. This happened immediately after the [ closure of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) on April 30th. There is no doubt that the \"College of Medicine\" is the direct descendent of the Prince of Wales' Foundation. In a powerpoint show dated 9th November 2009 (before the name change) this slide is to be found. The author of the slide show is specified as \"Linda\". That, it is a fair bet, must be Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed, and is now Company Secretary for the \"College of Medicine\". The final form of the \"College\" is still being argued about, but guess who will open it? When ask about how Charles' relationship with the College, The Office of TRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall declined to make any comment, but simply referred me to Michael Dixon, who, in turn referred me to Pat Goodall. Recently a statement from Clarence House to the Guardian said that \"the Prince of Wales was aware of the college, but \"has not been involved with setting-up the college, is not launching it and has no official role with it\". That's the official line anyway. It is, of course, almost impossible to find out exactly what the relationship is between Prince Charles himself and the new \"College\". He operates largely out of sight, and the Freedom of Information Act, disgracefully, excludes his interference in the democratic process from public scrutiny. Who is paying? Flat 5 at 19 Buckingham Street was recently valued at half a million pounds. There is some serious money behind this venture. The rumour is that it's from a 'private donor'. Small prize for anyone who finds out who it is. Aims of the College The stated object of the College is \"to advance health for the public benefit\". Sounds good, but what does it mean? It doesn't take long to find out. It is laid out in the [document from Companies House.](/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) To further its objects the Charity may: 7.1 engage with and develop communities of health professionals, health care providers and patients; 7.2 set standards and promote excellence in the fields of health and care; 7.3 lead, represent, train and support stakeholders so that they are better equipped to serve the public in improving the health ofthe public; 7.4 establish an evidence base for integrated health and for individual complementary modalities; 7.5 promote, foster and advance an integrated approach to health and care; 7.6 raise public, professional and political awareness and cultivate a sentiment in favour of an integrated approach to health and care by publishing and distributing books, pamphlets, reports, leaflets, journals, films, tapes and instructional matter on any media; and so on, for 36 paragraphs. Already in paragraph 4 to 6 we see their interest is to promote \"integrated health\" and \"complementary modalities. These of course are just what most of the rest of the world calls quackery. The objects don't differ greatly from the Prince's Foundation from which this outfit sprang. What will be taught at the College? Some information about the preliminary plans can be gleaned from a letter that describes the new College ( [download the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf)). The letter says \"The College is developing two groups of courses. The first is aimed at registered professionals such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. It will familiarise them with different aspects of CAM and develop skills they can use in their day to day practice - not least techniques they can pass on to patients to help them manage their own conditions.\" In other words, the only course for doctors will be to teach them about quackery. Final judgement on that must await information about who will teach it. \"The second group of courses is aimed at non-registered practitioners and will focus on developing their understanding of conventional medicine, including 'red flag' symptoms, familiarisation with conventional therapeutics and increased awareness of critical appraisal.\" The other course, it seems, will be for quacks, to try to teach them enough real medicine to prevent them from killing too many people. The bit about teaching them about \"critical appraisal\" is hard to believe. If that were really done the clients would mostly be out of business. If you were in any doubt at all about the aims of the College, it is necessary only to look at the four directors of the Company Directors of the College of Medicine. - Dr Michael Dixon, general practitioner. Michael Dixon was Medical Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor George Lewith, is Professor of Health Research in the Complementary Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor David Peters. is Professor of Integrated Healthcare and Clinical Director at the University of Westminster's School of Integrated Health. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Mrs Christine Glover is a pharmacist who [sells homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). She was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. The company secretary is named as Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed. A request to Michael Dixon for information was deflected to Mrs Pat Goodall She is yet another connection with PFIH. Mrs Goodall acted as a spokesperson for the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. Now she is scheduled to become Director of Policy and Communications for the \"College of Medicine\". Mrs Goodall declined to say where the money came from. But she did say that the College was not the \"equivalent of a further education college,. . . or higher education college\", That being the case, it seems very odd to use the name \"College of Medicine\". It is a downright misleading name. These people are all well know advocates of alternative medicine, It is very obvious that the \"College of Medicine\", despite its misleadingly innocuous name, is simply a reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The term \"integrated\" is, of course, simply [a euphemism for alternative medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). That means those forms of medicine for which there is little or no evidence that they work. When evidence that something works is found, it is called simply medicine. It may be useful to give a bit more information about the Directors. Dr Michael Dixon OBE Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. You can read more about Michael Dixon at Dr Aust's blog ( [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/)), and, from the USA, Steven Novella's analysis in [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450) Professor George Lewith, George Lewith [has appeared quite often](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) in this blog. He first came to my attention when I [discovered in 2006](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131) that his private clinic was offering a well-known form of fraudulent allergy diagnosis, the Vega test, despite the fact that Lewith himself had written a paper that said it didn't work. Lewith is particularly keen on acupuncture and that most discredited form of quackery, homeopathy. [On More 4 News](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542#lewith), he actually claimed that there was no good sham form of acupuncture. That is simply not true: great ingenuity has gone into devising controls for acupuncture trials and 'real' acupuncture always comes out the same as sham. Professor David Peters David Peters comes from the University of Westminster, which is famous for offering more degrees than any other in [anti-scientific nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19). Westminster is home of the quite remarkable teaching that \" [Amethysts emit high Yin energy](#)\". dowsing, aura photography and other such fairground frauds. Westminster offers also a \"BSc degree\" in that quite remarkable branch of make-believe known as naturopathy, This [teaches students](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) about a totally insane form of psycho-babble called [Emo-trance](http://emotrance.com/) and they are taught (no. seriously) about diagnosis with dowsing and pendulums Westminster also teaches [about kinesiology](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812). Sounds sort of sciencey, but [Applied Kinesiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology) is actually a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor. It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf)). Westminster offers [\"BSc degrees\" in Chinese Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) that are a menace to public health. Their unfortunate students are told \"Legally, you cannot claim to cure cancer. This is not a problem because we treat people not diseases\". It is hard to imagine anything more irresponsible, David Peters, as Clinical Director at Westminster must bear responsibility for this load of irresponsible make-believe, I have no doubt that he is well-intentioned but some of the stuff on these courses is a serious danger to public health. Mrs Christine Glover Mrs Glover is an [Edinburgh pharmacist](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/). She claims She believes symptoms rarely occur in isolation but are usually linked to a persons circumstancs [sic]. Illness occurs when there are imbalances in any of the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of their life. Well, yes and no, Would you really go to her if you had cancer, or tuberculosis, or even atrial flutter? Judging by her website, what you'd get is a bottle of her Liquid Iron & Vitamin Formula (for \u00a316.25 !). Or any one of a [range of homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). There is no branch of alternative medicine that is more totally discredited than homeopathy. Yet now it i being proposed to form a College of Medicine with four directors who are all part of the dwindling band that insists you can do magic with pills that contain no medicine. Who else supports the College? There are some pretty surprising people who are listed in [the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf) as supporting the College of Medicine, though it remains to be seen how many are left once the true nature of the College is known. Some of the supporters were already Foundation Fellows of the Prince's Foundation, despite having no obvious sympathy with quackery. These include Professor Sir Cyril Chantler, Professor Adrian Eddleston and Professor Simon Gibbons. They also include [the notorious Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Karol+Sikora), and the geochemist Professor Jane Plant. Professor Jane Plant is, apparently, a distinguished geochemist, but she developed an obsession with dairy-free diets, after her own experiences with breast cancer. She has written a lot of books and, no doubt, made a lot of money from the desperate. An [extracr from one of her books](http://members.multimania.co.uk/AllThingsChildren/MilkCancer.htm) is titled \"Why I believe that giving up milk is the key to beating breast cancer\". If you want to see the 'evidence' for some of her wild claims, [her web site](http://www.cancersupportinternational.com/janeplant.com/index.asp) invites to join -at a cost of \u00a330. To get a bit closer to the truth it is only necessary to quote the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) Report on diet and cancer, ' [Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective](http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf)'. The WCRF is inclined, in my view, to exaggerate the strength of the evidence for a causal link between diet and cancer (see [Diet and health. What can you believe: or does bacon kill you?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435)) but nevertheless their assessment of dairy products is very different from Plant's. \"The strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that milk probably protects against colorectal cancer, and that diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer.\" It seems that Jane Plant's claims are thoroughly irresponsible. I'm told that two people who were also Foundation Fellows, and who were originally listed as supporters of the College seem to have already jumped ship, namely Professor Stephen Holgate and Baroness Finlay. Professor Sir Graeme Catto is to be president, and I'm told, Professor Sir Ian Kennedy has agreed to be vice president. It is incomprehensible to me why people like this should be willing to lend their names to the Prince's Foundation in the first place, or to its replacement now.. Other people listed as supporters include Sir Donald Irvine, Professor John Cox, and, on the \"scientific advisory committee, Professor Mustafa Djamgoz and Professor Ajit Lalvani. None of these people has an obvious belief in quackery. sp what are they doing mixed up with a venture like this? Graeme Catto tells me he \"knows very little about CAM\", and Cyril Chantler says the College should deal with evidence-based integrated medicine \"but not alternative medicine or homeopathy\". Since, during his time as a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation, Cyril Chantler failed totally to shake the advocacy of homeopathy by them, it seems unlikely yhat he'll be any more successful with the College. The only member of the \"scientific advisory committee\" who has answered by invitation to comment on a draft of this post is Professor Mustafa Djamgoz. It seems that he is more gullible that meets the eye He said, for example, \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work.\" \"We ourselves have already shown that natural substances like omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reseveratrol [sic] etc can produce anti-cancer effects by blocking ion channels.\" Clearly Professor Djamgoz has not been keeping up with research in these areas. Has he never read Barker Bausell's book on acupuncture, [Snake Oil Science](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell).? Apparently not. And there is, of course, not the slightest reason to think that omega-3 or resveratrol help cancer in humans. It is often said that the reason that eminent people support quackery is that they live in hopes of a peerage. That is, perhaps, a bit uncharitable. I think it more likely that they don't bother to investigate closely what it is they are signing up to, and that they are fooled by the [weasel words of \"integrated medicine\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). People like Catto and Chantler seem to think they are supporting caring, human centred, medicine. I fear they have been fooled, They are supporting sheer quackery. Patient centred medicine One of the most infuriating characteristics of quacks is their attempt to hi-jack the 'human side of medicine'. I suppose they have little else to offer, so it's understandable. But there is nothing human about deceiving desperate patients and the human side of medicine is something that is emphasised in the education of every real doctor. If you want to know more about it, there is no better exposition than [Michael Baum's Samuel Gee lecture](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095#baum). Baum has been at the forefront of thinking about supportive or spiritual care of cancer patients. His 2009 Samuel Gee lecture is available in video, [Concepts of Holism in Orthodox and Alternative Medicine](https://admin.emea.acrobat.com/_a45839050/p69282078/). It is a masterpiece. He ends the lecture thus. \"Alternative versions of \"holistic medicine\" that offer claims of miracle cures for cancer by impossible dietary regimens, homeopathy or metaphysical manipulation of non-existent energy fields, are cruel and fraudulent acts that deserve to be criminalized.\" A similar distinction has been made with beautiful clarity by [Dr James May](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095) \"The use of the term 'integrative medicine' in your editorial seems to confuse more than clarify the problem of 'holism' in medicine. Complementary therapists for example often use the term 'holistic' to blur the boundaries between the therapies used and the practitioner's interpersonal skills. It would be better, however, to keep these distinctions clear. Caring is different from curing.\" \"'Holism' is not a multifaceted approach to curing, it is a multifaceted approach to caring\" \"Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.\" I hope that the various eminent people who have lent their name to this mis-named 'College of Medicine' will look very carefully at what it actually does. And that will probably mean withdrawing their support. Follow-up The Guardian, 2nd August 2010, carried this story, written by their science correspondent, Ian Sample: [College of Medicine born from ashes of Prince Charles's holistic health charity](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/prince-charles-college-medicine-holistic-complementary). He quotes Tracey Brown of the Sense about Science charity as saying that the college's emphasis on merging conventional medicine with unproven complementary therapies \"would take society back a century\". \"Despite its mission to promote the integration of alternatives to medicine, this new body has chosen to call itself very grandly the College of Medicine. Perhaps someone thinks this will sound good with Royal in front of it? This wouldn't be a surprise given the institution's origins in the Prince of Wales's efforts to integrate his favoured traditional remedies into medicine.\" Quotation from DC Western herbal medicine need not be mystical nonsense, but it usually it is, Plants often contain chemicals that have pharmacological actions, with all the possibilities for good and for harm that implies (see [Plants as medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205)). It would be quite possible to teach about the plant constituents and their actions in an entirely scientific way, but it seems that this is not what courses in herbal medicine choose to do. That is why they shouldn't be called Bachelor of Science degrees. We have recently revealed the ancient nonsense taught at Middlesex University in its \"BSc (Hons)\" degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine in [Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) as well as similar dangerous gobbledygook from the University of Westminster: see [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). Western Herbal medicine does not talk about \"knotted spleen Qi\", but has an equally barmy mystical vocabulary of its own. They have in common a tendency to divide herbs into hot and cold, a crude and baseless classification that dates from a time when nothing was known about physiology or the causes of disease. A recent post described the problems of finding out what exactly is taught on these courses: [Not much Freedom of Information at University of Wales, University of Kingston, Robert Gordon University or Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351) I lodged a Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act with Napier University Edinburgh on 10th August 2009. As almost always, [ it was refused](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351), as was the internal review of my request. The response to the internal review came from Gerry Webber BA (Hons) 0 PHil MBA MCMI AUA (Fellow). Despite all those impressive sounding letters, he argued with a perfectly straight face that it was perfectly all right for the university to teach this sort of stuff. He ended \"On public interest grounds, I have therefore concluded that, in respect of the commercially sensitive information requested, the public interest is better served in withholding the information you have requested than in disclosing it.\" Despite all those impressive sounding letters after Dr Webber's name, here was a solemn letter, on the university letterhead, defending the teaching of pseudoscientific nonsense The experience is surreal, but far from unique. Although we [ won a judgement](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) that compelled disclosure from the Information Commissioner for England and Wales, the Scottish law is slightly different so I had to appeal to the Scottish Information commissioner. [ [Download appeal](/Napier-FOISA-appeal.pdf)] A similar appeal was lodged for Robert Gordon's University Aberdeen. They have already sent some homeopathy materials, and closed down the homeopathy course, as described at: [Robert Gordon University stops its homeopathy course. Quackademia is crumbling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2914). Napier University followed the same pattern, but a bit more slowly. They sent some of what I asked for without waiting for a formal judgement, after they had been contacted by the Scottish Information Commissioner. Napier also shut down the degree from which the slides, below, were used. It is fascinating that so many places have done this shortly before what is taught is made public. Before that time the courses are defended and advertised. no doubt by people who have never given a moment's thought to what is taught. In 2007, after [my Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19) on the topic, [the Glasgow Herald](http://www.heraldscotland.com/less-than-complementary-1.854730) said A spokeswoman for Napier University said it stood by the integrity of its BSc degrees. \"The BSc Herbal Medicine course uses an approach to teaching and training that we believe best prepares students for practice within a modern integrated healthcare system,\" she said. The [university's brochure](/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf) for the course (still, carelessly, [on the web](http://www2.napier.ac.uk/newsnew/upload/foi/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf) at the time of writing), waxed lyrical about the herbal medicine course. Yet as soon as it becomes known what's actually taught, the courses close. What was taught on Napier's Herbal Medicine \"BSc\". Materia medica starts with hot and cold herbs Yes, but one of the problems is that very little is known about the therapeutic actions of herbs from \"controlled enquiry\". The material just isn't there to fulfil this aim. To paraphrase their quotation,,you can call anything medicine, but plenty of people will argue with you if you can't produce the evidence. This slide strikes me as pure pre-scientific gobbledygook. All herbs and all diseases seem to fall into the 'hot' or 'cold' class. The 'argument' is entirely circular. Pure pseudoscience (is that what the lecturer told them in response to the last question?). What do all these conditions have in common? They are all \"cold\". How can anyone take this sort of baloney seriously? This quotation appears to have no comprehensible meaning at all. It carries overtones of the [great \"detox\" fraud](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), and so perhaps is useful justification for slimming the wallets of the gullible. Now we come to a real herb. There is some real chenistry in this slide. Unfortunately it simply isn't known whether these chemicals have any useful function. Usually it isn't known either what dose of them you are giving in tincture of valerian. When I worked in a pharmacy in the 1950s, you could still find tincture of valerian on the shelves of a normal pharmacy, but iit soon vanished as paople realised it wasn't much use. Disappeared from normal medicine, that is. it is still alive and well among herbalists. Notice too, the mention of \"synergy\". The perpetual excuse of herbalists for giving impure mixtures of chemicals is that they might act synergistically. They are undeterred by the fact that no such synergy has ever been demonstrated properly. I asked that question ot Liz Williamson. editor of Potter's herbal Cyclopedia, but answer came there none. I'd be interested to know what answer was given to the last question, which isn't as simple as it sounds. I wouldn't mind betting it didn't include a critical description of isobol analysis. So what does Valerian do? It seems, even from the lecture, that there is no unanimity that it does anything useful at all. There is no worthwhile evidence to think it is useful for \"generalises anxiety disorder\" Let's take another opinion. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is the branch of the US National Institutes of Health which has spent around a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money on research into alternative medicine, For all that effort they have failed to come up with a single useful treatment. Clearly [they should be shut down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123). Nevertheless, as an organisation that is enthusiastic about alternative medicine, it's interesting to see what [they have to say about valerian](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/valerian/). What the Science Says - Research suggests that valerian may be helpful for insomnia, but there is not enough evidence from well-designed studies to confirm this. - There is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether valerian works for anxiety or for other conditions, such as depression and headaches. Even NCCAM don't pretend that there is any good reason to think it's good for anything. So, you might ask, why are students being taught to treat people with it? Simon Mills on \"hot and cold herbs\" Many of the slides refer to a book by herbalist Simon Mills. You can [see a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGhp0PNHVnc) of a talk he gave in which he 'explains' \"hot and cold herbs\". It strikes me as pure gobbledygook. Make up your own mind. Now take the test This is a question from a Napier University exam paper Which constituents are responsible for the actions of saw palmetto? Which actions would they be? This is what The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) says about saw palmetto. What the Science Says - Several small studies suggest that saw palmetto may be effective for treating BPH symptoms. - In 2006, a large study of 225 men with moderate-to-severe BPH found no improvement with 320 mg saw palmetto daily for 1 year versus placebo. NCCAM cofunded the study with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. - There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of saw palmetto for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate or for any other conditions. - Saw palmetto does not appear to affect readings of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. PSA is protein produced by cells in the prostate. The PSA test is used to screen for prostate cancer and to monitor patients who have had prostate cancer. Magic Medicine In the materials that I was sent, I see nothing to make me believe that herbalism is being taught as science. On the contrary, it all seems to confirm the definition given in the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). Herbal medicine BSc degrees still exist. They are [still running at the following universities.](http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/QZqoewhT8lCPiqyeulU0W5icV5Mny-UBLm/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSuggestion.whereNext?query=314&word=HERBAL&single=N) The vice-chancellors are named because they are the people who must take responsibility for this sort of nonsense being taught in their universities. University of East London (vice-chancellor from Feb 2010 is [Patrick McGhee](http://www.uel.ac.uk/vcg/vc.htm), who, in his previous job at University of Central Lancashire, did so much to prevent me from getting hold of their teaching materials, but then closed the courses anyway) University of Lincoln (Vice chancellor, [Professor Mary Stuart](http://thelinc.co.uk/2009/06/university-of-lincoln-appoints-professor-mary-stuart-as-new-vice-chancellor/)) London Metropolitan University (vice-chancellor, ( [interim Alfred Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metropolitan_University)) Middlesex University (vice-chancellor, Professor [Michael Driscoll](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx)) And, of course, the home of woo, the University of Westminster (vice-chancellor, [Professor Geoffrey Petts](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about/organisation-of-the-university/vice-chancellor/biography-of-professor-petts)). Their students are taught that Amethysts emit high Yin energy and that [dowsing and pendulums](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227) can be used for diagnosis and treatment. By the same token, we may congratulate [Professor Dame Joan Stringer](http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/principal/Pages/default.aspx), vice-chancellor of Napier University Edinburgh for closing down the course from which these slides came. Perhaps now she should consider closing their 'degrees' in aromatherapy and 'reflexology' Follow-up It seems very reasonable to suggest that taxpayers have an interest in knowing what is taught in universities. The recent [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310) suggested that degrees should be mandatory in Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. So it seems natural to ask to see what is actually taught in these degrees, so one can judge whether it protects the public or endangers them. Since universities in the UK receive a great deal of public money, it's easy. Just request the material under the Freedom of Information Act. Well, uh, it isn't as simple as that. Every single application that I have made has been refused. After three years of trying, the Information Commissioner [eventually supported my appea](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364)l to see teaching materials from the Homeopathy \"BSc\" at the University of Central Lancashire. He ruled that every single objection (apart from one trivial one) offered by the universities was invalid. In particular, it was ruled that univerities were not \"commercial\" organisations for the purposes of the Act. So problem solved? Not a bit of it. I still haven't seen any of the materials from the original request because the University of Central Lancashire appealed against the decision and the case of [University of Central Lancashire v Information Commissioner](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/Documents/PendingAppeals/CCU_15102009.pdf) is due to be heard on November 3rd, 4th and 5th in Manchester. I'm joined (as lawyers say) as a witness. Watch this space. UCLan is not the exception. It is the rule. I have sought under the Freedom of Information Act, teaching materials from UClan (homeopathy), University of Salford (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of Westminster (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of West of England, University of Plymouth and University of East London, University of Wales (chiropractic and [nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259)), Robert Gordon University Aberdeen (homeopathy), Napier University Edinburgh (herbalism). In every single case, the request for teaching materials has been refused. And that includes the last three, which were submitted after the decision of the Information Commissioner. They will send things like course validation documents, but these are utterly uninformative box-ticking documents. They say nothing whatsoever about what is actually taught. The fact that I have been able to discover quite a lot about what's being taught owes nothing whatsoever to the Freedom of Information Act. It is due entirely to the many honest individuals who have sent me teaching materials, often anonymously. We should be grateful to them. Their principles are rather more impressive than those of their principals. Since this started about three years ago, two of the universities, [UCLan](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) and [Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), have shut down entry to all of their CAM courses. And [Westminster has shut two](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) of them, with more rumoured to be closing soon. They are to be congratulated for that, but is far from being the end of the matter. The Department of Health, and some of the Royal Colleges, have yet to catch up with the universities, The Pittolo report, which recommends making degrees compulsory, is being considered by the Department of Health. The consultation ends on November 2nd: if you haven't yet responded, please do so now ( [see how here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329), and [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310)). A common excuse: the university does not possess teaching materials (yes, really) Several of the universities claim that they cannot send teaching materials, because they have no access to them. This happens when the university has accredited a course that is run by another, privately run, institution. The place that does the actual teaching, being private, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The ludicrous corollary of this excuse is that the university has accredited the course without checking on what is taught, and in some cases without even having seen a timetable. The University of Wales In fact the University of Wales doesn't run courses at all. Like the (near moribund) University of London, it acts as a [degree-awarding authority for a lot of Welsh Universities](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E5011). It also validates a lot of courses in non-university institutions, [34 or so of them in the UK](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7051&country=UNITED+KINGDOM), and others scattered round the world. Many of them are theological colleges. It does seem a bit odd that [St Petersburg Christian University, Russia, and ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=RUSSIA&inst=PETERS) [International Baptist Theological Seminary, Prague](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=CZECH%20REPUBLIC&inst=IBTS), should be accredited by the University of Wales. They also validate the [International Academy of Osteopathy, Ghent](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=BELGIUM&inst=IAO) 34 UK institutions include the [Scottish School of Herbal Medicine, the ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=SS) [Northern College of Acupuncture](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=NC) and the [Mctimoney College of Chiropractic](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=MT). The case of the Nutritional Therapy course has been described already in [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). It emerged that the course was run by a grade 1 new-age fantasist. It is worth recapitulating [the follow up](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259#follow). What does the University of Wales say? So far, nothing. Last week I sent brief and polite emails to Professor Palastanga and to Professor Clement to try to discover whether it is true that the validation process had indeed missed the fact that the course organiser's writings had been described as \"preposterous, made-up, pseudoscientific nonsense\" in the Guardian. So far I have had no reply from the vice-chancellor, but on 26 October I did get an answer from Prof Palastanga. As regards the two people you asked questions about - J.Young - I personally am not familiar with her book and nobody on the validation panel raised any concerns about it. As for P.Holford similarly there were no concerns expressed about him or his work. In both cases we would have considered their CV's as presented in the documentation as part of the teaching team. In my experience of conducting degree validations at over 16 UK Universities this is the normal practice of a validation panel. I have to say this reply confirms my worst fears. Validation committees such as this one simply don't do their duty. They don't show the curiosity that is needed to discover the facts about the things that they are meant to be judging. How could they not have looked at the book by the very person that they are validating? After all that has been written about Patrick Holford, it is simply mind-boggling that the committee seems to have been quite unaware of any of it. It is yet another example of the harm done to science by an unthinking, box-ticking approach. Incidentally, Professor Nigel Palastanga has now been [made Pro Vice-Chancellor (Quality)](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E735) at the University of Wales and [publishes bulletins](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E780) on quality control. Well well. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic was the subject of my next Freedom of Information request to the University of Wales. The reasons for that are, I guess, obvious. They sent me hundreds of pages of validation documents, Student Handbooks (approx 50 pages), BSc (Hons) Chiropractic Course Document. And so on. Reams of it. The documents mostly are in the range of 40 to 100 pages. Tons of paper, but none of it tells you anyhing whatsover of interest about what's being taught. They are a testament to the ability of universities to produce endless vacuous prose with very litlle content. They did give me enough information to ask for a sample of the teaching materials on particular topics. But I gor blank refusal, on the grounds that they didn't possess them. Only McTimoney had them. Their (unusually helpful) Freedom of Information officer replied thus. \"The University is entirely clear about the content of the course but the day to day timetabling of teaching sessions is a matter for the institution rather than the University and we do not require or possess timetable information. The Act does not oblige us to request the information but there is no reason you should not approach McTimoney directly on this.\" So the university doesn't know the timetable. It doesn't know what is taught in lectures, but it is \" entirely clear about the content of the course\". This response can be described only as truly pathetic. Either this is a laughably crude form of obstruction of my request, or perhaps, even more frighteningly, the university really believes that its endless box-ticking documents actually provide some useful control of quality. Perhaps the latter interpretation is more charitable. After all, the QAA, CHRE, UUK and every HR department share similar delusions about what constitutes quality. Perhaps it is just yet another consequence of having science run largely by people who have never done it and don't understand it. Validation is a business. The University of Wales validates no fewer than 11,675 courses altogether. Many of these are perfectly ordinary courses in universities in Wales, but they validate 594 courses at non-Welsh accredited institutions, an activity that earned them \u00a35,440,765 in the financial year 2007/8. There's nothing wrong with that if they did the job properly. In the two cases I've looked at, they haven't done the job properly. They have ticked boxes but they have not looked at what's being taught or who is teaching it. The University of Kingston The University of Kingston offers a [\"BSc (Hons)\" in acupuncture](http://www.kingston.ac.uk/acupuncturebsc/). In view of the fact that the [Pittilo group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235) has recommended degrees in acupuncture, there is enormous public interest in what is taught in such degrees, so I asked. They sent the usual boring validation documents and a couple of sample exam papers . The questions were very clinical, and quite beyond the training of acupuncturists. The validation was done by a panel of three, Dr Larry Roberts (Chair, Director of Academic Development, Kingston University), Mr Roger Hill (Accreditation Officer, British Acupuncture Accreditation Board) and Ms Celia Tudor-Evans (Acupuncturist, College of Traditional Acupuncture, Leamington Spa). So nobody with any scientific expertise, and not a word of criticism. | | Further to your recent request for information I am writing to advise that the University does not hold the following requested information: (1) Lecture handouts/notes and powerpoint presentations for the following sessions, mentioned in Template 3rd year weekend and weekday course v26Aug2009_LRE1.pdf (a) Skills 17: Representational systems + Colour & Sound ex. Tongue feedback 11 (b) Mental Disease + Epilepsy Pulse feedback 21 (c) 18 Auricular Acupuncture (d) Intro. to Guasha + practice Cupping, moxa practice Tongue feedback 14 (2) I cannot see where the students are taught about research methods and statistics. I would like to see Lecture handouts/notes and PowerPoint presentations for teaching in this area, but the 'timetables' that you sent don't make clear when or if it is taught. The BSc Acupuncture is delivered by a partner college, the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM), with Kingston University providing validation only. As such, the University does not hold copies of the teaching materials used on this course. In order to obtain copies of the teaching materials required you may wish to contact the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine directly. This completes the University's response to your information request. So again we see that Kingston has validated the course but has not seen a timetable, far less what is taught. My reply was thus | | Yes I am exceedingly unhappy about it. The university attaches its name to the course so it must obviously be able to get the material simply by asking for it (I'm surprised that the university should endorse a course without knowing what is taught on it, but that's another matter). I request formally that you obtain this material. If necessary please read this as a formal appeal. I await with interest. In every single case so far, the internal review has merely confirmed the initial refusal. It means a bit of a delay before the case goes to the Information Commisssioner's Office. Napier University Edinburgh Napier University runs a \" [BSc (Hons) Herbal medicine](http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U74301.htm?Nav=2)\". (brochure [here](http://www2.napier.ac.uk/newsnew/upload/foi/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf)). Since herbal medicine is a subject of the [Pittilo recommendations](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235), there is enormous public interest in what they teach. So I asked, under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002). They sent quite quickly validation and accreditation documents, some examination papers, timetables and lecture lists. The validation was the usual vacuous box-ticking stuff though it did reveal that the course \"made extensive use of techniques such as tongue and pulse diagnosis\", which are well known phoney diagnosis methods, about as much use as a pendulum (as used at Westminster University). As at Kingston University, the exam papers they chose to send were mostly \"pretend doctor\" stuff. One of them was Discuss the herbal practitioner's role in the management of IHD [ischaemic heart disease) How one would like to see what the students said, and, even more one would like to see the model answer. Amateurs who try to treat potentially serious conditions are a danger to the public. So then we got to the interesting bit, the request for actual teaching materials. | | I have looked at the material that you sent and I'd now like to make the following supplementary request (A) Lecture notes/handouts and powerpoint slides for the following small smaple HRB09102 Materia Medica 4 Materia (HRB09104) HRB09100 Materia Medica Herbal Practice BSc Herbal Medicine : Materia Medica HRB07102 Lastly, I can see nowhere in the timetable, lectures that deal with Research methods, clinical trial design and statistics. No prizes for guessing the result Total refusal to send any of them. To make matters worse, the main grounds for refusal were the very \"commercial interests\" which, after careful legal examination, the Information Commissioner (for England and Wales) had decided were invalid. They say too that \"The public interest in withholding the information is greater than the public interest in its release\".. It is hard to see how the public interest is served by concealing from the people who pay for the degrees what is taught on degrees that [Pittilo wants](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329) to make compulsory. [ [Download the whole response](/Prof_Colquhoun_FOISA_Response_071009.pdf)] The matter is now under internal appeal ( [read the appeal](/napier-herbal-appeal.pdf)) and eventually we shall find out whether the Scottish Information Commissioner backs the judgement. Robert Gordon University Aberdeen This case has particular interest because the Vice-Chancellor of Robert Gordon University is [ Professor Michael Pittilo](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece), chair of the highly contentious steering group that recommended degress in CAM. Robert Gordon University (RGU) does not teach herbal medicine or acupuncture. But they do run [An Introduction to Homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/prospectus/modules/disp_moduleView.cfm?Descriptor=NU3786). All the degrees in homeopathy have closed. It is perhaps the daftest and most discredited of all the popular forms of [Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). But Professor Pittilo thinks it is an appropriate subject to teach in his university. So again I asked for information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. They sent me quite quckly a list of the powerpoint presentations used on the courses [ [download it](RGU_FOI_230709_1_Homeopathy_course_materials.pd)]. I asked for a small sample of the powerpoints. And again the university did not possess them! | | I should like to see only the following three powerpoint presentations in the first instance, please. Please can you let me know also who produced the powerpoints. (1) Evidence for homeopathy I note that you will have to request them but since they are being offered as part of a course offered by RGU, so RGU is responsible for their quality, I presume that this should cause no problem. The request was refused on much the same grounds as used by Napier University. As usual, the internal review just confirmed the initial proposal (but dropped the obviously ludicrous public interest defence). The internal review said \"it is mainly the quality of our courses (including course material) and teaching which has given us the position of \"the best modern university in Scotland\" I am bound to ask, if the university is so proud of its course material, why is it expending so much time and money to prevent anyone from seeing a small sample of it? My appeal has been sent to the Scottish Information Commissioner [ [download the appeal](/appeal-to-Scottish-info-commissioner-RGU.pdf)]. What are vice-chancellors thinking about? I find it very difficult to imagine what is going through the heads of vice-chancellors who run courses in mumbo-jumbo. Most of them don't believe a word of it (though Michael Pittilo might be an exception) yet they foist it on their students. How do they sleep at night? Recently the excellent Joe Collier wrote a nice BMJ blog which applauded the lack of respect for authority in today's students, [Joe Collier says good riddance to old-fashioned respect](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/10/05/joe-collier-says-good-riddance-to-old-fashioned-respect/). I couldn't resist leaving a comment. | | I couldn't agree more. There is nothing quite so unnerving as being addressed as \"Sir\". It is an advantage of age that you realise what second-rate people come to occupy very grand positions. Still odder since, if occasionally they are removed for incompetence, they usually move to an even grander position. I guess that when I was an undergraduate, I found vice-chancellors somewhat imposing. That is, by and large, not a view that survives closer acquaintance. Should teaching materials be open to the public? There is only one university in the world that has, as a matter of policy, made all of its teaching material open to the public, that is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I can recommend strongly course 18.06, a wonderful set of [lectures on Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/#features) by Gilbert Strang. (It is also a wonderful demonstration of why blackboards may be better than Powerpoint for subjects like this). Now they are on [YouTube too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c). A lot of other places have made small moves in the same direction, as discussed recently in Times Higher Education, [Get it Out in the Open](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408300&c=2). Now the OU is working with other British universities to help them develop and share open course materials. In June, at the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the OU, Gordon Brown announced funding to establish the Support Centre for Open Resources in Education at the OU, as part of a \u00a37.8 million grant designed to enhance the university's national role. The funding follows a separate grant of \u00a35.7 million from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for universities across the sector to make thousands of hours of free learning materials available. Much material is available on the web, when individual teachers choose to place it there, but at the same time there is a move in the other direction. In particular, the widespread adoption of Moodle has resulted in a big decrease in openness. Usually you have to be registered on a course to see the material. Even other people in the university can't see it. I think that is a deplorable development (so, presumably, does HEFCE). Conclusion I was told by the Univerity of Kingston that \"The course is one which the University has validated and continues to be subject to the University's quality assurance procedures, such as internal subject reviews, annual monitoring and external examining\" The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that \"quality arrurance procedures\" work about as well in universities as they did in the case of [baby Peter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/baby-p/5313303/Baby-Peter-failed-by-NHS-staff-who-saw-him-35-times.html). No doubt they were introduced with worthy aims. But in practice they occupy vast amounts of time for armies of bureaucrats, and because the brain does not need to be engaged they end up endorsing utter nonsenes. The system is broken. Resistance is futile. You can see a lot of the stuff here It is hard to keep secrets in the internet age. Thanks to many wonderful people who have sent me material. you can see plenty of what is taught, despite the desperate attempts of vice-chancellors to conceal it. Try these links.

There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up The much-delayed public [consultation on the Pittilo report](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_103567) has just opened. It is very important that as many people as possible respond to it. It's easy to say that the consultation is sham. It will be if it is left only to acupuncturists and Chinese medicine people to respond to it. Please write to them before the closing date, November 2nd 2009. The way to [send your evidence is here](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_103567).

It is now over a year since the Report to Ministers from \"The Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK\" [ [download the report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf)]. The chair of the steering group was Professor R. Michael Pittilo, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The reason thet the report is so disastrously bad in its assessment of evidence is that it was written entirely by people with vested interests. The committee consisted of five acupuncturists, five herbalists and five representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (plus eleven observers). There was not a single scientist or statistician to help in the assessment of evidence. And it shows: The assessment of the evidence in the report was execrable. Every one of the committee members would have found themselves out of work if they had come to any conclusion other than that their treatment works, Disgracefully, these interests were not declared in the report, though they are not hard to find. The university of which the chair is vice-chancellor runs a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of the popular forms of alternative medicine. That tells you all you need to know about the critical faculties of Michael Pittilo. The two main recommendations of this Pittilo report are that - Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine should be subject to statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council - Entry to the register normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours Let's consider the virtue of these two recommendations. Regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC) breaks their own rules For a start, this should be ruled out by the HPC's own rules, which require \" [Practise based on evidence of efficacy](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/)\" as a condition for registration. Since there is practically no \"evidence of efficacy\", it follows that the HPC can't regulate acupuncture, herbal and Chinese medicine as Pittilo recommends. Or so you'd think. But the official mind seems to have an infinite capacity for doublespeak. The HPC published a report on 11 September 2008, [Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf). The report says 1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons. 2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions. 3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest. In other words, the [HPC simply decided to ignore its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284), Its excuse for doing so is that regulation would protect \"public safety\" . But it simply would not do that. It is ell known that some Chinese herbs are adulterated with dangerous substances, but laws against that already exist. Trading Standards are much more likely to take appropriate action than the HPC. The Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) already deals with the licensing of herbal medicines. and, despite the fact that it recently betrayed its trust by allowing them to be labelled in a misleading way, they are the people to do it, not the HPC. The [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) (page 11) says In future, it is hoped that more Government funding can be allocated to research into traditional/herbal medicines and acupuncture and that grants will become available to encourage practitioners to undertake postgraduate research work. So they are asking for more government money. In March 2007, the Chinese Government pledged to spend over $130 million over the next five years on research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. It is to be hoped that this money will be targeted effectively to evaluate TCM. It seems to have escaped the notice of Pittilo that roughly 100 percent of trials of Chinese medicine done in China come out positive. Elsewhere, very few come out positive,(see Vickers et al., 1998, Controlled Clinical Trials, 19, 159-166: [download reprint](/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf)) The Department of Health would be unwise to rely on Chinese research. Remember that modern acupuncture was not so much a product of ancient wisdom, but rather it stems from nationalist propaganda by Mao Tse-Tung, who needed a cheap way to keep the peasants quiet, though he was too sensible to use it himself. The [HPC report](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf) (page 5) cites these with the words \" . . . a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base.\" This sentence seems to assume that the outcomes of research will be to strengthen the evidence base. Thus far, precisely the opposite has been the case. The Pittilo group has apparently not noticed that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent a billion dollars on research in alternative medicine and failed to come up with a single effective treatment. There are better ways to spend money on health. See, for example [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031).An enornous amount of research has already been done and the outcomes have produced no good treatments, The proposed regulation would endanger the public, not protect it. The excuse given by the HPC for breaking its own rules is that it should do so to protect the public. Likewise [Ann Keen, Health Minister, said](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/News/Recentstories/DH_103585): \"Patient safety is paramount, whether people are accessing orthodox health service treatments or using alternative treatments\" So first we need to identify what dangers are posed by acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. - Acupuncture is fairly safe. Its biggest danger lies in the unjustified claims that are routinely made for what can be achieved by being impaled by needles. This poses a danger that people may use acupuncture in place of treatments that work - Herbal medicines are unstandardised, so even the very few that may work are dangerous to patients because the dose of active principle is unknown and varies from one batch to another. Taking a herbal medicine is a bit like swallowing a random number of tablets, False health claims pose a danger to patients too, when they cause patients to avoid treatments that work. - Traditional Chinese Medicine is probably the most dangerous. Like the other two, the medicines are unstandardised so the dose is never known. False health claims abound. And in addition to these dangers, many cases have been found of Chinese medicines being adulterated with poisonous substances or with conventional drugs. The form of regulation proposed by Pittilo would do little or nothing to protect the public from any of these dangers. The proposals accept the herbal and Chinese medicine as traditionally practised. Nothing would be done about one of the major dangers, [ the lack of standardisation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205). That is a problem that was solved by pharmacologists in the 1930s, when international standards were set for the biological activity of things like tincture of digitalis, and assays were devised so that different batches could be adjusted to the same potency. Now, 80 years later, it is being proposed by Pittilo that we should return to the standards of safety that existed at the beginning of the last century. That is a threat to public safety., but the proposed regulation would do nothing whatsoever to protect the public from this dangerous practice. On the contrary, it would give official government sanction to it. The other major danger is that patients are deceived by false health claims. This is dangerous (as well as dishonest) because it can cause patients to avoid treatments that work better, The internet abounds with claims that herbs can cure anything from diabetes to cancer. Many are doubtless illegal, but regulators like the HPC have traditionally ignored such claims: they are left to Trading Standards, Advertising Standards and the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) to deal with. The MHRA already also has responsibility for monitoring side effects. The HPC would not do this. The analogy with chiropractic and the GCC The foolishness of allowing statutory regulation for unproven treatments has recently been illustrated quite dramatically by the case of chiropractic. Chiropractors have had statutory regulation by the General Chiropractic Council, which was established by the Chiropractors Act of 1994. The [ British Chiropractic Association (BCA)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) recently decided to sue the science writer, Simon Singh, for defamation when he cast doubt on some of the claims made by chiropractors, in particular their claims to be able to cure colic and asthma in children. That led to close examination of the claims. In fact there is no reason to think that spinal manipulation w [orks for asthma](/ernst-chiro-asthma.pdf), or that it works [for colic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775). In fact there is quite good evidence that the claims are false. The result was that about 600 well-justified complaints have been lodged with the GCC (enough to bankrupt the GCC if the complaints are dealt with properly). The point of this story is that the statutory regulator had nothing whatsoever to prevent these false health claims being made. Two of the complaints concern practices run by the chair of the GCC. Worse, the GCC actually endorsed such claims. The statutory regulator saw its duty to defend chiropractic (apart from a handful of cases of sexual misdemeanours), not to protect the patient from false health claims. The respectability conferred by statutory regulation made false health claims easier and endangered the public. It would be a disaster if the same mistake were made again. On 11th December 2008 I got a letter form the HPC which said in our opinion a lack of evidence of efficacy would not impede our ability to set standards or deal with complaints we receive. The vast majority of cases we consider are related to conduct. But perhaps that is because they haven't tried \"regulating\" quacks before. Now that the public is far more conscious about health fraud than it used to be, one can predict confidently that the HPC would be similarly overwhelmed by a deluge of complaints about the unjustified health claims made by acupuncturists, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. There is no shortage of them to complain about. The education problem The Pittilo report recommends that the entry level for registration should be a bachelors degree with honours. At first sight it seems reasonable to ask that practitioners should be 'properly qualified', but when one looks at what is actually taught on these degrees it becomes clear that they endanger, rather than protect, the public, There are two very big problems with this recommendation. Firstly, you can't have a bachelors degree with honours until after you have decided whether or not there is anything useful to teach. If and when any of the subjects under consideration and shown to work to a useful extent, then it would be quite reasonable to establish degrees in them. Even the report does not pretend seriously that that stage has been reached. The proposal to set up degrees in subjects, at least some of which are quite likely to have no more than placebo value, is self-evidently nonsense, The time for degrees, and the time for government endorsement by statutory regulation, is after the therapies have been shown to work, not before. The absurdity of thinking that the public will be protected because a practitioner has a degree in, say, acupuncture, is shown with startling clarity by a [recently revealed examination paper](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950) in acupuncture' You can [download the entire exam paper](http://www.dcscience.net/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights from it. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Teaching of traditional Chinese medicine is just as bad. Here are two slides from a course run by the University of Westminster. The first 'explains' the mysterious and entirly mythical \"Qi\". So \"Qi\" means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism. This is meaningless nonsense. The second slide shows the real dangers posed by the way Chinese medicine is taught, The symptoms listed at the top could easily be a clue to serious illness, yat students are taught to treat them with ginger. Degrees like this endanger the public. There are more mind-boggling slides from lectures on [Chinese medicine and cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043): they show that what students are being taught is terrifyingly dangerous to patients. It is entirely unacceptable that students are being taught these ancient myths as though they were true, and being encouraged to treat sick people on their basis. The effect of the Pittilo recommendations would be to force new generations of students to have this sort of thing forced on them. In fact the course for which this exam was set has already closed its doors. That is the right thing to do. Here's another example. The course leader for \"BSc (Hons) Herbal Medicine\" at the [Graeme Tobyn BA](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/health/schools/school_of_nursing/divisions/graeme_tobyn_profile.php). But Tobyn is not only a herbalist but also an astrologer. In an [interview he said](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/tobyn.html) \"At the end I asked her if I could cast her horoscope. She threw up her hands and said, 'I knew this would happen if I came to an alternative practitioner.\" \"I think the ruler of the ascendant was applying to Uranus in the ninth house, which was very pertinent.\" This would be preposterous even in the life style section of a downmarket women's magazine, The Pittilo report wants to make degrees run my people like this compulsory. Luckily the Univerity of Central Lancashire is much more sensible and the [course is being closed.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) The matter is, in any case, being taken out of the hands of the government by the fact that universities are closing degrees in complementary medicine, including courses in some of those under discussion here, The [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) have recently announced the closure of all the degree programmes in complementary and alternative medicine. The largest provider of such degrees, the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) has already shut down two of them, and the rest are being assessed at the moment. It is likely that the rest will be closed in the future. The revelation that Westminster had been teaching its first year students that \" [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" and that students had been taught to [diagnose disease and choose treatments by means of a dowsing pendulum](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), showed very clearly the sort of utter nonsense that undergraduates were being forced to learn to get a 'bachelors degree with honours'. It stretches credulity to its limits to imagine that the public is protected by degrees like this. Precisely the opposite is true. The universities have recognised this, and shut the degrees. One exception is Professor Pittilo's own university which continues to run a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of all the popular types alternative medicine. A simpler, more effective and cheaper way to protect the public I must certainly agree with the minister that protection of the public is an important matter. Having established that the Pittllo recommendations are more likely to endanger the public than protect them, it is essential to suggest alternative proposals that would work better. Luckily, that is easy, because mechanisms already exist for dealing with the dangers that were listed above. The matter of adulteration, which is serious in traditional Chinese medicine, is a matter that is already the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards. The major problem of false claims being made for treatment is also the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards, which has a statutory duty to enforce the Unfair Trading Consumer Protection Regulations of May 2008. [These laws state, for example, that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) \"One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is \"falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations\" The monitoring of false claims, and of [side effects of treatments](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122525561/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0), is also the responsibility of the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Rather than setting up complicated, expensive and ineffective 'regulation' by the HPC, all that need to be done is to ensure that the MHRA and/or Trading Standards have the funds to enforce existing laws. At the moment, they are not being implemented effectively, so I'd recommend that responsibility for enforcing the law against false health claims be transferred entirely to the MHRA, which has much more expertise in such matters than Trading Standards This would be both cheaper and more effective than the present system in which the responsibility is divided between the two organisations in an unclear way. This proposal would protect the public against unsafe and adulterated treatments, and it would protect the public against false and fraudulent claims. That is what matters. It would do so more effectively, more cheaply and more honestly than the Pittilo recommendations. There would be no reduction in patient choice either, There is no proposal to ban acupuncture, herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine. All that is necessary is to ensure that they don't endanger the public. Since the root of the problem lies in the fact that the evidence for the effectiveness is very weak. the question of efficacy, and cost-benefit ratio, should be referred to NICE. This was recommended by the House of Lords Report (2000). It is recommended again by the Smallwood report (sponsored by the Prince of Wales Foundation). It is baffling that this has not been done already. It does not seem wise to spend large amounts of money on new research at the moment, in the light of the fact that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent over $1 billion on such research without finding a single useful treatment. The results of all this research has been to show that hardly any alternative treatment are effective. That cannot be ignored. Conclusion Recent events show that the halcyon days for alternative medicine are over. When the Pittilo report first appeared, it was greeted with derision in the media. For example, in The Times [Alice Miles wrote](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/alice_miles/article4159652.ece) \"This week came the publication of the Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK. Otherwise known as twaddle.\" In the Independent, [Dominic Lawson wrote](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-so-now-we-will-have-degrees-in-quackery-852858.html) So now we will have degrees in quackery. What, really, is the difference between acupuncture and psychic surgery? People will no doubt continue to use it and that is their right and their responsibility. But if the government were to accept the recommendations of the Pittilo report it would be seen, quite rightly, as being anti-scientific and of posing a danger to the public. Fortunately there is a better, and cheaper, way to protect the public. Follow-up Margaret McCartney's blog [in the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/healthblog/2009/08/05/the-force-and-consultation-on-the-pittilo-report-on-alternative-health-therapies/) puts rhw view of a GP with her usual sense, humour and incisiveness. \"This report would, if implemented, create lots more nonsense exam papers funded by a lot more public money - and would produce practitioners without the absolutely crucial skill of how to assess evidence and reject or use it appropriately\" The Times has covered the story (with some interesting comments) [Consultation on how to regulate complementary and alternative therapies](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article6737965.ece) Times Higher Education [UK-wide consultation on CAM regulation is launched](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=407695&c=2) Excellent response from Andy Lewis. The Sun has by far the best coverage up to now, Jane Symons writes \" [Regulating quacks helps them prey on gullible patients](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2573544/Herbalists-seen-to-be-given-approval-will-help-them-prey-on-gullible-patients.html)\" Acupuncture has been in the news since, in a moment of madness, [NICE gave it some credence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593), Some people still seem to think that acupuncture is somehow more respectable than, say, homeopathy and crystal healing. If you think that, read [Barker Bausell's book](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell) ot [Trick or Treatment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh). It is now absolutely clear that 'real' acupuncture is indistinguishable from sham, whether the sham control uses retractable needles, or real needles in the 'wrong' places. There has been no clear demonstration of long-lived benefits in any condition, and it is likely that it is no more than a theatrical placebo. In particular, the indistinguishability of 'real' and sham [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945) shows, beyond reasonable doubt that all the stuff about \"energy flow in meridians\" is so much hokum. There is a small group of ' [medical acupuncturists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=351)' that believes that it is hokum. but who nonetheless maintain that acupuncture works, despite the evidence to the contrary. But most acupuncturists go for the wholesale gobbledygook. If you don't believe that, take a look at the exam paper that has come into my possession. It is this year's exam from the University of Salford. Salford has, very sensibly, now decided to stop all its degrees in alternative medicine, so don't hold this against the university too much. You can [download the entire exam paper](/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Oh really. Perhaps protons neutrons and electrons? OK I'd fail that one because the words have no obvious meaning at all. Perhaps an elementary textbook of embryology would help? How one would love to see a set of model answers for these questions. All this is ancient hokum being taugh to hapless students in the 21st century as though it were fact. The University of Salford has understood that and closed the course. All we need now is for NICE and the Department of Health to understand what it is that they are promoting. NICE neglected the cultural cost of their guidance When [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence](http://www.nice.org.uk/) (NICE) included an acupuncture option on their low back pain guidance, they quite forget that one effect of their decision would be to ensure that new generations of students would have their minds poisoned with intellectual junk like this. That is why NICE really must think again. .

Too many vested interests, not enough honesty](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593) Pittilo and statutory regulation Public consultation is due to open shortly on the [appalling repor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235)t of the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK (see also, [The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)) One of the recommendations is that acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine should have statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC), despite the fact that that would involve the [HPC breaking its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284). Another recommendation of Pittilo is that entry to the \"profession\" (his word, not mine) should be by means of honours degree only. So he wants to impose on students exams like this one in order to \"protect the public\"? The absurdity of that proposal should be obvious now. This exam paper will form part of my evidence to the consultation. And there is one other small problem. Universities are busy shutting down their degrees in alternative medicine, now that the ridiculousness of what is taught has been exposed. They have shut down entirely at the [ University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and at the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899), And even the [ University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) is working on closing them. All we need now is for the common sense and integrity that has been shown by these universities to spread to the Department of Health (and NICE). "}
