My research focus is on methods to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting emerging infectious diseases, especially vaccines. This includes the use of flexible and model-informed trial frameworks tailored to the outbreak setting, as well as observational study designs such as the test negative design. Prior and ongoing work is in HIV, Ebola, Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and COVID-19. I am co-director of the [Emory Alliance for Vaccine Epidemiology (EAVE)](https://emoryeave.org/).
