Abstract: While tremendous advances have improved the under- standing of inflammatory bowel disease, with regard to environ- mental risk factors as well as the biochemical nature of theinflammatory process, a determination of primary etiology remainselusive. Numerous theories have been proposed in the past century concerning the cause of Crohn' s disease and ulcerative colitis with implications for specic therapies. On further study, most of theseideas and therapies have failed to be accurate in theory or therapeutic approach. Others remain untested or are the focus of current investigation and controversy. This paper reviews the dominanttheories of primary etiology. These hypotheses include infectious causes such as Mycobacteria paratuberculosis and measles. Allergic and nutritionally related causes have been the focus of considerableresearch. Microparticles, which is part of the concept behind tooth- paste as a cause, have been suggested more broadly to be the principal factor initiating Crohn' s disease. Several of these concepts rely on theidea that there is an increased intestinal permeability that is the centraldefect leading to Crohn' s disease. Rather than being an excessive T cell driven process, Crohn' s has been suggested to be an innate immune deciency, leading to the use of colony stimulating factors toaugment the intestinal barrier function and innate immunity. Avariety of changes in the gut flora, ranging from a basic dysbiosis to the absence of helminths, have been proposed as the root cause ofinflammatory bowel disease. Key Words: Crohn' colitis, etiology, history (J Clin Gastroenterol 2005;39:S59-S65) The current understanding of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has evolved from a description of gross pathology to a detailed biochemical prole of the inflammatory process. Both Crohn' s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) are viewed as predominantly T cell-driven diseases with a complex set ofinteracting cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators or- chestrated by a variety of cell types. The prevailing theory of IBD suggests that the T cell is inappropriately activated due to an unfortunate confluence of genetic and environmental fac-tors, which generate an immune imbalance, leading to the inflammation characteristic of these diseases. While critical to understanding and treatment of IBD, this increasingly sophis-ticated picture fails to provide information concerning the pro- ximal events, which set the process in motion and would be considered the fundamental etiology of the disease. This paper reviews past and current hypotheses concern- ing the etiology of IBD, dened narrowly as theory of primary cause concerning the initiator or instigator of the disease, asgroup A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus w o u l db ec o n s i d e r e dt h e cause of rheumatic heart disease. While extensive epidemio- logic investigations have identied risk factors and provided numerous clues to the development of IBD, an understanding ofprimary, proximate etiology remains elusive. Many immuno- logic investigations have proposed various mechanisms of IBD, such as IBD being an autoimmune phenomenon, as an example.This article is not a review of different conceptions of path- ophysiology. Instead, this partial survey of ideas includes some of historical interest or curiosity, some hypotheses, which areflat out wrong but may provide insight into these diseases, whileother concepts are likely of critical importance in the under- standing and treatment of Crohn' s disease and UC. Proposed and tested therapies, most discarded, have developed from thesetheories and offer an appreciation of the theoretical under- pinnings of past and current approaches. INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGIES The similarities between infectious colitis or enteritis and Crohn' s disease or UC are sufciently evident that numerous specic agents have been proposed over the years. Dalziel, whose description of a new entity, an ileitis, in 19131 may represent the rst case series of what was subsequently known as Crohn' s disease, wrote ''I can only regret that the aetiology of the condition remains in obscurity but I trust thatere long further consideration will clear up the difculty.'' Because of striking similarities between intestinal Mycobac- teria tuberculosis that Mycobacteria paratuberculosis (MAP), which had recently been described, may have been the cause of theReceived for publication December 27, 2004; accepted December 29, 2004.

Since then, numerous investigators have seized on this idea, and a considerable literature has developed, both in support of and against thisconcept (see below). In the early decades after the Dalziel description, an infectious etiology appeared sufciently obvious that vaccines,antiseptics, and subsequently antibiotics were attempted to treat these presumed chronic persistent infections. Other earlier ideas proposed that a protective factor was absent in theintestines, leading to unusual therapies of pig stool extract and''slop diets,'' which included three pints of milk soured with lactic acid. 2,3Numerous bacteria and viruses were proposed though none fullled Koch' s postulates. Diplostreptococci emerged as a possible agent for UC in the 1920s due to the work of J.A. Bargen of the Mayo Clinic, in which the bacteria was cultured from a high percentage of rectal ulcers in patientswith UC 4and intravenous inoculation of rabbits with these isolated organisms led to colonic lesion.5Based on this work, Bargen subsequently tested an autologous vaccine of fecalDiplostreptococci in patients with UC without signicant success. 3Other early ''vaccines,'' based on a specic in- etiology IBD, included injections of polyvalentantidysentery (AF Hurst, Guy' s Hospital, London) andtyphoid vaccine. 2With the advent of antibiotics, the idea of a bacterial etiology was pursued with great optimism but only temporary benet at best.3Numerous other specic bacterial agents have been advanced Wolinella Coxsakie Polio virus, Norwalk virus, Influenze B, herpes virus, Paramyxovirus. In addition,atypical forms such as L-forms (cell wall defective bacteria), protoplasts, or spheroplasts, have been suggested. Mycobacteria Avium Paratuberculosis Those specic infectious agents, more recently, which gained support based on some evidence includes Mycobac- teria avium paratuberculosis (MAP) and measles. MAP has been proposed by numerous groups as the causative agent of Crohn' s disease.7-9The initial case for MAP as a causative agent in Crohn' s relies on the similarities of Johne' s disease, a chronic MAP infection occurring in ruminants and infecting perhaps as much as 6% of U.S. cattle, but can also infectprimates. Johne' s disease is typically an ileitis in which organisms are easily identied when staining for acid-fast bacilli, thoughnot always. Important distinctions occur between Johne' s andCrohn' s disease. Johne' s does not share some of the cardinal features of Crohn' s disease. Unlike Crohn' s disease, Johne' s disease tends not to be segmental. Unlike Crohn' s disease,stulous activity does not occur in Johne' s disease, although it does typically cause diarrhea and weight loss in infected animals. Ulcerations, bleeding, stricturing, adhesions, perfo-rations and abscesses, classic features of Crohn' s disease, are not features of Johne' s disease. 10,11However, immune and inflammatory responses to the same organisms might re-asonably differ in different organisms and produce a different disease phenotype.MAP survives pasteurization 12and has been suggested to be transmitted from dairy cows in milk, with 7% of com- mercial retail milk cartons in U.K. testing positive in onesurvey, 13,14but transmission through water contaminated by agricultural runoff has been proposed.9The identication of MAP in breast milk of individuals with Crohn' s has beensuggested as further proof of etiology as well as a source of transmission. 15MAP can be a human pathogen and was re- ported as a specic pathogen in a young boy with scrofula wholater went on to develop ileitis, indistinguishable from Crohn' s,and in whom the infection fully resolved after 32 months of rifabutin and clarithromycin. 16 The identication of MAP in Crohn' s tissue has been dif- cult, unlike Johne' s disease. Cell-well free forms have been suggested to be the agents that induce the human disease.17 Antibodies have been positive in high percentage of Crohn' s patients, though with negative studies as well,18-23but studies using PCR for the IS900 sequence have been similarly mixed with positive results above 50% as well as negative resultsequal to a control population. 24-30Culturing organisms have also been difcult.27Recently, MAP has been identied by PCR from the buffy coat of Crohn' s patients' peripheral blood.More importantly, MAP was cultured on 8/15 with Crohn' sdisease but in no controls. 31The signicance is unclear and, while it adds dramatic information, this nding does not establish MAP as the causative agent. Therapeutic trials haveproduced mixed results, 8,32-39using a variety of regimens though a meta-analysis,40suggested a benet in maintaining remission though only after a course of steroids. If MAP iscentral to Crohn' s disease, one would expect that immuno- suppression and infliximab would initiate a more evident infec- tion in at least some cases, as can occur with MTb, though thishas not been reported. MAP still remains an unproven etiologic agent, even in a subgroup of patients. Additional randomized, placebo- controlled trials are underway to validate MAP directedtherapy, although these are likely not specic for MAP alone. Whether MAP is a benign epiphenomenon, an important disease modier, or the immediate causal agent for Crohn' sremains to be established. Measles Wakeeld et al proposed that Crohn' s results from a chronic infection of submucosal endothelium of the intestineswith the measles virus. 41This infection was proposed to generate a granulomatous reaction and a microinfarct pathologic process leading to the characteristic inflammation identied in Crohn' sdisease. This theory was buttressed with a number of patho-logic and epidemiologic investigations. Microvascular casts of intestinal resections from patients with s sug- gested a microvascular injury 42; granulomas were identied as found in association with endothelium; elevated titers to measles were found in some studies of Crohn' s patients, viruses were identied in granulomas from Crohn' s patients.41,43-45 Epidemiologic studies found that perinatal exposure to measles virus increased the risk of the development of Crohn' s disease46,47; the attenuated measles vaccine was suggested to be associated with an increased risk of the development of Crohn' s disease.48This led to considerable media interest and & 2, April 2005public concern over use of live measles vaccine as well as other vaccines. A number of researchers countered these claims, with other studies nding that titers to measles were notincreased in Crohn' s patients, granulomas were not associated with endothelium, 49measles were not in granulomas50and the measles vaccine is not associated with an increased risk ofCrohn' s disease. 51-55Subsequently, measles has been proposed to be a cofactor, increasing the risk of Crohn' s, though perhaps not the primary causative agent. THEORIES OF A PSYCHOSOMATIC ORIGIN In the early and middle decades of the 20th Century, UC and Crohn' s to a lesser extent (though little distinction was made until after 1960 between Crohn' s colitis and UC) wereconsidered ideal paradigms of psychosomatic diseases. 56The psychologic theories developed, the certainty with which they were espoused and the therapies, which issued from them present a self-evident critique of their methods and approach. The theories of a primary psychosomatic etiology of colitis developed out of retrospective studies grounded in an association between ''well-marked time relationship betweenemotional disturbance and symptoms.'' 57A psychologic pro- le or personality type was thought to predispose to the development of UC, in which patients with UC ''couldn'tcope, giving up [with] diarrhea is substituted for real accomplishment, [having a] .childish, dependent personality .[with the] degree of difference so gross as to make a control group unnecessary.'' 58This impaired personality was pre- sented as having been shaped by maternal dominance, loss of a loved one, and social rejection. Studies of the effects of stress on colonic mucosa59reinforced this concept of a direct link between psychology and physiology. Treatment that developed out of these concepts of UC relied on stress control therapy and other attempts atpsychoanalytically oriented therapy. 3More radically, loboto- mies were performed on some patients with the attempt of ablating a neurotic focus.60These theories were refuted with a number of studies in which a psychologic predisposition was not identied, and any identied character traits were suggested to be a consequence not a cause of the disease.Psychoanalytically based therapy was also demonstrated not tohave any influence on surgical rates or recurrences. 61These concepts died slowly with better methodology putting it more thoroughly to rest in the early 1980s.62 DIET AND ALLERGY IBD, as a gastrointestinal disease, has directed consid- eration to the role of diet as a central etiologic factor. In the early part of the 20th Century, in part due to undernourishmentevident in patients with IBD, nutritional deciencies were suggested to be causes of IBD. 63,64The apparent development or at least increase of IBD in the 20th Century and pre-dominance of IBD in the industrialized world have further focused interest on diet as the initiating cause of IBD. Several dietary risk factors have been suggested with regard to infantfeeding practices, including breastfeeding as well duration ofbreast feeding as being protective against the development ofCrohn' s and UC, 65-69an increase in carbohydrates intake, simple carbohydrates in particular being a signicant risk for development of Crohn' s,70-72and the intake of fast food as a risk for Crohn' s disease.71An increased intake of each major component of the diet has been advanced is being critical to the development of IBD, although carbohydrates, consistentlydemonstrated as being increased in Crohn' s disease, simple carbohydrates in particular, has received most attention. 72,73 Trials of low carbohydrate intake have not been useful in maintaining remission or controlling flares,74,75although a diet high in complex carbohydrates appeared promising.76,77 Anecdotal accounts of a low fat intake being successful andpathologic demonstration of fat have led to a hypothesis thatincreased fats, in conjunction with bacterial antigens, play the primary role in activating the immune system and initiating Crohn' s disease. 78,79 Allergy was advanced as the underlying cause of IBD.76,80 This concept persisted, although elimination diets and dietarychallenges were not found useful. An allergy to cow' s milk hasbeen suggested as causative, particularly with regard to UC. 81-84 Breastfeeding was suggested as being protective by delaying aninfant' s encounter with cow' s milk. Individuals later developingUC had a high incidence of milk intolerance as infants. 85 Increased antibodies to cow' s milk were found to be associated with earlier onset of UC. Specic antibodies to proteins in milk have been found to correlate with disease activity in adultsparticularly in UC, although these ndings are not consistent and may reflect increased intestinal permeability, rather than a primary allergic phenomenon. Sulfur Intake and UC Dietary intake and luminal metabolism of sulfur compounds by sulfate-reducing bacteria have been suggested as the etiology of UC by Roediger et al.86One signicant change in the diet in the 20th Century in areas with highincidence of UC is the high intake of sulfur-containing food. Sulfur not recycled by an intestinal sulfur salvage pump passes into the colon where it is metabolized, in some, by sulfate-reducing bacteria, a group of bacteria identied as being much more common in individuals with UC and associated with flares of UC, in particular. 87,88 These bacteria yield compounds, which in turn interact with other luminal substrates to generate sulfoxides, which can be highly injurious to the colonic mucosa. It has been suggested that these compounds can also act on colonocytes to impairuptake of butyrate and other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 89 causing a relative mucosal starvation suggested by Scheppachand others as a fundamental aspect of the pathogenesis ofUC. 90,91The use of SCFA enemas to treat IBD have yield mostly negative results, although it could be argued that increased topical SCFAs may still not overcome the defectpresent. 91A recent dietary study found individuals with a sulfur- containing diet had an increased risk of flares of UC, which may give a renewed interest to this hypothesis.92 Toothpaste and Microparticles Diet, more broadly dened, has been implicated as a potential etiology of Crohn' s disease, in the hypothesis thatingestion of toothpaste causes IBD and Crohn' s in particular. q2005 Wilkins S61J Clin Gastroenterol /C15Volume 39, Supp. 2, April 2005 Past and Current Theories of Etiology of IBDA variety of substances in toothpaste have been demonstrated as harmful in animal studies, in particular some of the parti- culate substances used as abrasives, such as tricalcium phos-phate and quartz, have been identied as being capable of penetrating the epithelium and creating enteric lesions similar to Crohn' s disease. Similar ndings have been shown when talchas been injected into intestinal lymphatics of animals. Other components of some toothpastes such as carageenan, which has been used to induce an animal model of colitis, and otherabrasive agents such as silicates and calcium pyrophosphatecould also play a role in initiating Crohn' s. The hypothesis claims to t into the epidemiologic evidence by suggesting other known risk factors are linked to the use of toothpaste:smokers brush more often, children less often, even increased intake of sugar has been suggested to be linked to toothpaste (increased need to brush teeth). This hypothesis has not beenrigorously studied and has little supportive data but maintains itself as an oddity as such an innocuous presumably health- maintaining habit could pose such a hazard to some. 93 The concept developed in the toothpaste hypothesis has been broadened more recently to be inclusive of a large range of microparticles ingested, as part of the diet, increasingly overthe past century. Powell et al have proposed that billions ofmicroparticles, mostly titanium, aluminum, and silicon oxides, are ingested principally from food additives. 94-96These microparticles are taken up by the specialized M cells butare undegradable and accumulate in lymphoid tissues. While not leading to inflammation in themselves, they are proposed to act as adjuvants, permitting the absorption of other antigensand preventing their appropriate disposition by the immune system, altering the normal intestinal immune tolerance, and stimulating an immune response. In addition, thesemicroparticles, calcium conjugates (calcium phosphate) inparticular, cause apoptosis of macrophages and release of interleukin-1 b. 97This theory proposes that it is not a particular antigen that induces the inflammatory response seen inCrohn' s disease but the way in which the antigen is processed and encounters the immune system. 94 The therapeutic implications of this hypothesis led to a trial of a diet specially treated to be very low in these particulates. In a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 20 patients were randomized equally to a normal diet ora comparable diet specially prepared to be low in micro- particulates for 4 months. 98While similar at baseline, those receiving the low particle diet decreased their Crohn' s DiseaseActivity Index (CDAI) from 392 625 at entry to 145 647 at month 4 ( P= 0.002 vs control group) with 7 patients achieving remission (CDAI ,150). The control group had little change from baseline CDAI of 302 628 to 295 625 at month 4, with none in remission. However, outside of this study, when Crohn' s patients were compared with a control group for their intake of microparticulates, no differences were observed. 99 Permeability A possible common element that has been advanced as a fundamental cause of Crohn' s disease is increased intestinal permeability. The increase in permeability or intestinal epithe-lial barrier dysfunction leads to greater antigen movement across the intestinal epithelium and consequently increasedimmune exposure to these antigens. Numerous studies have documented increased intestinal permeability in patients with Crohn' s though not in those with UC. Similar permeabilityabnormalities have been identied in asymptomatic relatives of patients with Crohn' s, suggesting it may be an early, genetic predisposition, which initiates the cascade of events leading toCrohn' s disease. Patients with Crohn' s as well as their relatives also have an exaggerated increase in permeability in response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These observationsare the underpinnings of the ''leaky gut'' hypothesis, whichasserts that patients with Crohn' s have increased exposure to antigens normally excluded by the intestinal barrier leading to an immune mediated inflammatory response. 100 Crohn's Disease: An Innate Immune Deciency Crohn' s has been proposed to be a deciency of the innate intestinal mucosal barrier, which is inclusive of both the epithelial layer as well as the innate immune system, acting asa second line of defense to protect the host from organisms that breach the epithelial barrier. 101This hypothesis is based on several lines of evidence. Individuals with genetically denedsyndromes of neutrophil and monocyte dysfunction, such as chronic granulomatous disease and glycogen storage Ib, 102 among others, can develop an intestinal phenotype virtually indistinguishable from Crohn' s disease. Other geneticallydened defects, as has subsequently been identied in the NOD2/CARD15 variant associated with Crohn' s disease, may lead to an increased susceptibility as a similar, though milder,defect of the innate immune system. Several environmental hits may further impair innate immune function. In particular, a change in the gut flora inindustrialized countries compared with places in which Crohn' s disease is rare, such as rural Africa, result in an increase in certain bacteria, such as Bacteroides, and a decrease in Bido- bacteria . This shift in bacteria, better studied in association with periodontitis, has greater concentrations of bacteria, which can penetrate the epithelium and produce leukotoxins capable of impairing function of neutrophils and other innateimmune cells. Identied environment risks such as smoking and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may contribute further insults to the innate immune function as well, as hasbeen described. As has been proposed for periodontal disease, the intestinal innate immune barrier may have a serial mucosal response, utilizing initially protective elements such as themucous layer, the intestinal epithelium, and complement to thwart a potential bacterial invasion; if inadequate, a neutrophil response would ensue; in turn, if insufcient, monocytes/ma-crophages would be further activated. If these elements of theinnate immune system are unable to contain or repel a potential invader, subsequently a T and B cell response would be acti- vated and predominate. Consequently, innate immune dys-function could set the process in motion, although the end results appear to be a T cell-driven process. The T cell response may therefore be a secondary phenomenon to a primary innateimmune dysfunction resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The therapeutic implications of this suggest that, rather than suppressing the end-stage inflammatory process, immune stimulation, as with granulocyte macrophage-colony on intestinal epithelium as well as augmenting neutrophil and monocyte function, may provide an alternativetherapeutic approach for Crohn' s disease. Open-labeled studies of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors 104(G-CSF, lgrastim, Neupogen, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) and GM-CSF were suggested a benet in Crohn' s disease. The study of GM-CSF/Leukine has been followed up with a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, which conrmed a signicant benetof this treatment in Crohn' s. 105 Helminths The loss of helminths has been suggested as another relatively recent change in the intestinal flora and as the funda- mental permissive factor, enabling the emergence of IBD.Weinstock et al 106have proposed that, in our zeal to rid the intestines of parasites, we have eliminated a T cell regulatory mechanism that our immune system expects to be present.Helminths have been an integral component of intestinal flora and have acted through T regulatory cells to prevent excessive T cell activation as occurs in IBD as well as perhaps in avariety of other illnesses such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, and allergies. Evolution has engineered human behavioral patterns to pick up soil-borne helminths as infants, during theoral phase. The urban dwellers, wearing shoes and taking onother hygienic practices, have interfered with the acquisition of helminths, causing the loss of this important regulatory function, integral to the healthy functioning of the immunesystem. Animal models have conrmed a signicant impact of helminth colonization on a variety of immune functioning, in particular, augmenting several immune regulatory cytokines,including interleukin 4 and 13, inducing regulatory T cells, and attenuating the T H1 type inflammatory response.107-109 The substantial burden of morbidity and mortality caused by helminths in the world suggests that their adaptationto the human organism does more than only good for its host and that these mechanisms have evolved to permit the organism to thrive by manipulating the immune system of itshost. Regardless of the evolutionary details of the theory, harnessing the immune effects of helminths may yield a potent therapeutic force in Crohn' s and UC. Preliminary results oftherapeutic studies using Trichiuris suis , or pig worm, appear extremely promising with a response rate in a recent open- labeled trial in active Crohn' s of 80% (in 26 patients) anda remission rate more than 70%. 108 Dysbiosis, Cold Chain Hypothesis, and Other Alterations of Intestinal Flora Other recent propositions rest on the concept that the intestines are encountering either new bacteria or concen- trations of bacteria, which would have been unlikely before the20th Century. A fundamental dysbiosis, 110,111or imbalance between harmful and protective bacteria, has been proposed to be the root cause of IBD, although whether this is a primarycausative factor or a secondary epiphenomenon is uncertain. The cause of this dysbiosis is uncertain. Antibiotic use has been proposed to be the central factor leading to an altered gutflora and IBD. The ''cold chain hypothesis'' 112posits that IBD results from chronic exposure to organisms which can surviveat low temperatures, known as psychrotropic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium botulinum , and Bacillus cereus. This chronic ingestion of these bacteria, new in the past century, results from the development and widespread use of refrigeration in food preparation, culminating in the domestic refrigerator, the nal step in thecold chain. Crohn' s has been proposed to develop in ge- netically predisposed individuals who are chronically exposed to these psychrotropic bacteria, which have been provided anexpanded niche in the industrialized world through the use ofrefrigerators. In summary, as the understanding of the inflammatory process in IBD progresses, the medications available to treatthese diseases, growing out of this knowledge, have improved in parallel. The new therapies being studied at present hold great promise. However, optimal medications may onlyemerge when a more comprehensive understanding of the primary etiologic factors is established. IBD likely represents more than its two primary subgroups of Crohn' s and UC, buteach may be a common end pathway, which is arrived at through a number of different routes. The theories surveyed above may all be wrong but may contain at least a kernel,which accurately applies to only a subgroup of individuals.Once this complex knot of multiple subgroups, each with possibly different etiologies, is untangled will ideal therapies be developed for these diseases.
