However, with our fast-paced modern lifestyle and exposure to an increasing number of harmful and toxic substances, our body's natural cleansing ability has become overworked and compromised. Many signs and symptoms attributed to stress are now being linked to exposure from harmful substances such as PCBs, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, growth hormones, and mercury in food and liquids as well as dioxins and formaldehyde in the air. These substances most notably affect the healthy functioning of the liver and immune system. Common symptoms of dysfunction in these systems include: [Allergies](/allergies)and frequent infections Unexplained [weight gain](/weight-wellness)and difficulty losing or gaining weight [Joint pain](/arthritis)and muscle weakness [Indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, gas and/or abdominal bloating](/digestive-disorders) Recurrent yeast/fungal infections Harmful and toxic substances from our chemically laden food and polluted environment have also become implicated as a leading cause of many serious illnesses such as: Degenerative diseases [Infertility](https://taoofwellness.com/infertility/), birth defects and genetic changes To counter this growing situation, the doctors at Tao of Wellness have developed a Cleansing and Detoxification Program that is unique and highly useful in ridding the body of many harmful and toxic substances. In designing the detox program, the doctors have drawn upon the centuries-old Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles to solve a modern problem. The detox program combines selected TCM techniques that work Does It Work? The Cleansing and Detoxification Program is scheduled as a single-day treatment or one-week retreat package at the Tao of Wellness. The procedures used are designed to stimulate the release of harmful substances stored in the tissues and liver. Once the toxins are released into the circulatory system, it is important to remove them as soon as possible. This is why the chosen treatment modalities are so important. Acupuncture Acupuncture stimulates neurological, immunological, and endocrine responses beneficial to tissue cleansing and cell rejuvenation. It also stimulates the release of endorphins that reduce the pain and discomfort sometimes experienced when detoxifying and withdrawing from addictive substances such as alcohol, caffeine, drugs, nicotine and sugar.

Chinese Herbal Medicine The proprietary herbal formulations focus on drawing the toxins directly out of the body through increased sweating, urination, and bowel movements. Some of the herbs directly support the filtering function of the liver and assist it in cleansing and promoting cell repair and cell regeneration.

The prescribed meal plan includes selected foods that cleanse the liver and intestinal tract and provide key nutrients such as all the vitamins and minerals necessary for optimal health.

Our tuina bodywork protocol consists of dry brushing, lymphatic drainage, joint mobilization, and cupping. The strong suction action of the cupping stimulates blood and lymphatic fluid to flow near the skin's surface and to key areas of the body for easy and direct release of toxins.

InfiniChi Energy Therapy When undergoing an internal cleanse it's important to address the changes necessary in the mind as well as other subtle needs of the body during this time of change. InfiniChi is Chinese medical energy therapy in the Tao of Wellness tradition. InfiniChi is a non-touch healing technique that serves as the foundation of the practices of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. An InfiniChi practitioner will use their hands and body to sense areas of improper blood and energy flow. They will make subtle adjustments to encourage your physical organs to cleanse themselves and your emotions to release their excesses as well. [Learn more about InfiniChi](/infinichi-energy-therapy).
