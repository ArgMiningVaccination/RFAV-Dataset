This is redirected funding previously used for General Revenue service charges and other diversions that is being placed back into the State Transportation Trust Fund. These recurring funds will be used along with the Federal Grant Anticipation Revenue (GARVEE) bonding program approved by the Legislature in 1999 to support the Mobility 2000 initiative. The use of the GARVEE bonding program will not begin until Fiscal Year 2006. The \"Mobility 2000\" initiative advances almost $4 billion in projects within and into the current ten year plan for urban congestion relief, trade and tourism corridors and hurricane evacuation projects. 35-33 NONRECURRING _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________ GOV REC N/R ** APPROPRIATIONS 2000-01 POS AMOUNT ________________________________ _____________ ADMINISTERED FUNDS __________________________ LUMP SUM ENTERPRISE TECH RESOURCES GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 8,500,000 ============= INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SYSTM GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 12,000,000 ============= SPECIAL CATEGORIES G/A-GOV/MIAMI FIN EMER/BD GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 150,000 ============= AGENCY/HEALTH CARE ADMIN ADMINISTRATION AND SUPPORT __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET EXECUTIVE DIR/SUPPORT SVCS TRUST FUNDS................. 500,000 ============= HEALTH CARE SERVICES __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET CHILDREN SPECIAL HLTH CARE TRUST FUNDS................. 6,079,614 ============= HEALTH CARE REGULATION __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET HEALTH FACILITY LICENSURE GENERAL REVENUE FUND 200,000 TRUST FUNDS 200,000 ------------- TOTAL ............ 400,000 GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 168,000 ============= AGRIC WATER COORD GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 313,000 ============= EXECUTIVE DIR/SUPPORT SVCS GENERAL ............ 118,177 ============= FOREST/RESOURCE BUDGET TRUST FUNDS 10,000 ------------- TOTAL APPRO ............ 5,913,122 ============= AGRICULTURE MIC __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GENERAL REVENUE FUND 2,655,637 TRUST FUNDS 431,386 ------------- TOTAL APPRO ............ 3,087,023 ============= SAFETY AND QUALITY __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET DAIRY FAC COMPL/ENFORCEMT GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 25,000 ============= FOOD SAFETY INSPECT/ENFORC GENERAL REVENUE FUND BUDGET AGRICULTURAL SVCS GENERAL REVENUE FUND FUNDS 299,507 ------------- ............ 1,066,910 ============= AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC BUDGET AQUACULTURE GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 1,001,200 ============= AGRIC INSPECTION STATIONS GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 622,830 ________________________________ SVCS/COMMR & ENFORC TRUST FUNDS................. 148,000 ============= AGRIC PRODUCTS MARKETING GENERAL TOTAL TECHNOLOGY GENERAL REVENUE FUND........ 47,700 ============= RECOV/RETRN UNCLAIMED PROP TRUST FUNDS................. 202,366 ============= REG/CONS PROT PRG __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT FUNDS ............ 36-3 GOV REC REG OFF/SEC & DIV OF ADMIN __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRUST FUNDS................. 10,310,000 ============= PROFESSIONAL REG, DIV __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET STANDARDS AND FUNDS................. 22,805 ============= ALCOHOL BEV & TOBACCO, DIV __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT TRUST FUNDS................. 4,587,393 ============= CHILDREN & FAMILIES ADMINISTRATION EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP __________________________ PROGRAM BUDGET EXECUTIVE DIR/SUPPORT SVCS GENERAL REVENUE ............ 457,456 ------------- TOTAL APPRO ............
