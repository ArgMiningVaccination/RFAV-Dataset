I made an appointment with Dr. Xiong and he listened to my concerns of not sleeping and my anxiety also. Dr. Xiong took care of my shoulders feeling much better through acupuncture and cupping. the Dr. also calmed down my nervous system and it allowed me to sleep much better. I always felt a difference from when I showed up for my appointment to when I left ....100% better. Even my husband said he saw a difference in my calmness. Thank you for listening to my concerns Dr Xiong.

I need braces to fix my bite from years of clenching, but orthodontists won't give me braces if I clench. Dr. Xiong has helped me so much with the tension in my jaw, my neck, and other areas as well. I highly recommend him because he is very knowledgeable about the body, herbs, and supplements, and he is very kind.

I visited him for shoulder pain that had been bothering me for months, and after just a few acupuncture sessions, I felt a significant improvement in my mobility and a decrease in pain levels. His approach is gentle, compassionate, and highly effective. He took the time to listen to my concerns and provided me with personalized treatment plans that were tailored to my specific needs. Not only is Dr. Xiong incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in his field, but he also has a warm and welcoming demeanor that made me feel comfortable and at ease throughout my entire experience. I am so grateful for his expertise and support and highly recommend him to anyone seeking natural and effective pain relief.
