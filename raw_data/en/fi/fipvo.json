ABSTRACT Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is able to harness biological processes to characterise high-risk features of atherosclerotic plaque prone to rupture. Current radiotracers are able to track inflammation, microcalcification, hypoxia and neoangiogenesis within vulnerable plaque. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used radiotracer in vascular studies and is employed as a surrogate marker of plaque inflammation. Increasingly, 18F-FDG and other PET tracers are also being used to provide imaging endpoints in cardiovascular interventional trials. The evolution of novel PET radiotracers, imaging protocols and hybrid scanners are likely to enable more efficient and accurate characterisation of high-risk plaque. This review explores the role of PET imaging in atherosclerosis with a focus on PET tracers utilised in clinical research and the applications of PET imaging to cardiovascular drug development. 7nAChR 7 disease CANF C-type atrial HIF-1 Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 HIV Human immunodeficiency virus C-reactive protein IVUS Intravascular ST elevation myocardial infarction SUV Standardised uptake value T2DM Type 2 diabetes mellitus TBR Target to background ratio TBRmax Maximum target to background ratio TCFA Thin capped fibroatheroma TIA Transient ischaemic attacks TSPO Translocator protein VH Virtual histology Nomenclature of Targets and Ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in http://www.guidetopharmacology.org, the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (Harding et al., 2017), and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18 (Alexander et al., 2017). Introduction Recent advances in imaging technology have enabled positron emission tomography (PET) to emerge as a powerful tool for studying the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Despite great strides made in the fields of diagnostics and therapeutics, atherosclerosis is the commonest underlying cause of acute cardiovascular events, and remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. This in part brings to light the limitations of current diagnostic techniques, which rely heavily on structural changes. Structural changes occur late in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and do not always lead to adverse clinical outcomes. More recently, there has been a paradigm shift towards using molecular imaging techniques such as PET to identify features of 'high-risk vulnerable plaque' early with the aim of preventing future cardiovascular events. Due to its utilisation in interventional trials, PET imaging also has the potential to bridge the translational divide that exists between laboratory scientific discoveries and their applications to clinical practice. In this era of precision medicine, the development of molecular imaging techniques will hopefully enable more accurate risk prediction and targeted therapy, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical outcomes. In this review we focus on the application of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to vulnerable plaque identification, cardiovascular drug development and risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. The concept of the 'Vulnerable Plaque' Ever since the initial post-mortem studies suggested rupture of vulnerable plaque accounted for an overwhelming majority (~ 75%) of myocardial infarctions (Falk et al., 1995, Virmani et al., 2006, Davies, 1996), there has been a growing interest in further characterising precursor lesions that are prone to rupture. Identifying these high-risk precursor lesions are particularly important because a number of clinical studies have shown that the degree of luminal stenosis cannot predict the timing or location of acute coronary events (Hackett et al., 1988, Ambrose et al., 1988). Furthermore, the majority of coronary events occur at locations previously identified as having angiographically mild disease (Varnava et al., 2002, Smits et al., 1999). More recently, large-scale studies of patients who underwent CT coronary angiography have shown that 48-54% of patients who went on to experience a coronary event did not have obstructive coronary artery disease at prior imaging (Hoffmann et al., 2017, SCOT-HEART, 2018). This highlights the importance of identifying high-risk features that may confer vulnerability to plaque rupture. An increasing body of evidence suggests that there are two phenotypically distinct vulnerable plaque types (Libby et al., 2019); the 'rupture prone plaque' and the 'erosion prone plaque'. prone plaque', often termed 'thin-capped fibroatheroma' (TCFA), are well defined. They typically have a macrophage rich inflammatory component. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in both the initiation of atherosclerosis and in its propagation (Libby, 2012). Mediated by risk factors, a pro-inflammatory state initially leads to the expression of vascular cell adhesion protein-1 and P-selectin (Vita, 2011). This facilitates the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes and the secretion of further pro-inflammatory cytokines (Boring et al., 1998). The accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins and lipid-rich macrophages (foam cells) eventually leads to hypoxia within the vessel intima and the formation of a necrotic core, another feature of unstable plaque. A stabilising collagen-rich fibrous cap covers this core; however, in unstable lesions this fibrous cap undergoes degradation and thinning due to an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases and collagen synthesis (Aikawa and Libby, 2004). Local hypoxia and inflammation also stimulate microvessel formation (neovascularisation) within the plaque, making it more prone to intra-plaque haemorrhage and destabilisation (Virmani et al., 2005). Another feature of vulnerable plaque is microcalcification, which is associated with plaque rupture (Vengrenyuk et al., 2006). Microcalcification is thought to arise in part due to vascular smooth muscle cells that secrete extra-cellular vesicles. These matrix vesicles then create a nidus for microcalcification to occur in the extracellular space (Kapustin et al., 2015). Expansive remodelling is another feature associated with TCFAs, where the patency of the lumen remains preserved despite the plaque occupying a large volume within the vessel wall (Varnava et al., 2002). It is however, important to be aware that studies have shown less than 5% of TCFAs (identified by intravascular imaging) lead to clinical events (Stone et al., 2011) and most TCFAs transition to a more stable state without ever rupturing (Kubo et al., 2010). These findings highlight the diagnostic challenges faced by clinicians as we are yet to determine the components of the TCFAs that make a plaque most vulnerable and what factors drive transition towards plaque instability. Data from clinical studies suggest that a patient's overall plaque burden and disease activity are important factors in determining long-term prognosis (Stone et al., 2011, Kubo et al., 2008, Kubo et al., 2010). A recent study demonstrated that high risk plaque characteristics and overall coronary artery calcification burden, increased the risk of both non-fatal and fatal cardiac events (Williams et al., 2019). Erosion prone plaque is a more recently defined pathological entity which has been identified in approximately a third of patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes (Partida et al., 2018). This type of plaque was associated more frequently with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (Partida et al., 2018) and occurs more commonly in women (Pasterkamp et al., 2017). Erosion prone plaques appear to be phenotypically different to rupture prone plaques because they have an increased fibrous tissue content composed of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycans (Kolodgie et al., 2004). They also tend to be deficient in inflammatory cells (Virmani et al., 1999), contain an abundance of vascular smooth muscle cells and are associated with platelet rich 'white' thrombus (Libby et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2014). Due to the availability of radioligands that bind to specific molecular targets on atherosclerotic plaque, PET imaging can be employed to quantify inflammation, hypoxia, neoangiogenesis and microcalcification within vulnerable plaque (Figure 1). Figure 1: Molecular targets of PET tracers currently used in clinical studies for imaging atherosclerosis PET imaging PET is a non-invasive imaging technique and its most widespread use is in investigating patients with oncological conditions. In cardiology, PET imaging is most frequently used for assessing myocardial perfusion and viability. However, more recently PET imaging has been used to characterise atherosclerosis and heart valves (Chin et al., 2015). PET utilises radiolabelled tracers that bind to molecular targets and decay at predicted rates emitting positrons. When a positron collides with an electron, annihilation () photons are created, which are detected by the PET scanner (Rudd et al., 2008a). Image quality of the PET scan is determined to a large extent by attenuation of the signal by annihilation photon interactions within tissue (Compton scatter). Attenuation correction is employed to tackle this issue. Apart from this, during 3D reconstruction of the images, corrections are also applied for dead time and random coincidences. Uptake of a given radiotracer can be quantified in a number of ways. Standardised uptake values (SUV) are one way to quantify the PET signal. SUV is a mathematically derived ratio of the radioactivity concentration in a specific tissue and the injected dose of radioactivity per kilogram of the patient's body weight. The target to background ratio (TBR), which is derived from arterial wall SUV, is more commonly used to present PET data in vascular imaging studies. Although PET allows the detection of picomolar concentrations of radioligands, this advantage is offset by poor spatial resolution compared to other imaging modalities. Particularly with regards to vascular imaging, this can make true quantification of radiotracer uptake in atherosclerotic lesions (especially in small calibre vessels such as the coronary arteries) challenging due partial volume effects causing signal spill-in and spill-out. This leads to difficulties in demarcating the region of interest (ROI) in the arterial vessel wall (by avoiding the vessel lumen). This challenge is overcome to a certain extent by co-registering PET images with CT or MRI to provide anatomical landmarks enabling better localisation of the signal. Advances in vascular PET/CT imaging protocols and software have enabled more reliable attenuation correction, faster scanning times and lower radiation doses (Rudd et al., 2008a, van der Valk et al., 2016). Coronary artery imaging using PET can be particularly challenging due to the small calibre of the blood vessels and artefacts created by cardiac and respiratory motion. Techniques such as cardiac gating using electrocardiograms, respiratory gating and list-mode acquisitions have been employed to reduce motion artefacts (B\u00fcther et al., 2009). Compensating for respiratory motion has proved to be particularly difficult and methods employed to overcome this such as respiration synchronised image acquisitions and motion tracking with 4DCT (Fayad et al., 2013), remain restricted to research. PET/MRI has the advantage of significantly reduced radiation exposure compared to PET/CT and provides more detailed plaque characterisation. However, limited scanner provision, accuracy of MR attenuation correction and quality of MR angiography remain significant hurdles to its widespread replacement of PET/CT for imaging atherosclerosis (Robson et al., 2017b, Robson et inflammation in atherosclerosis 18F-FDG PET 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used radioligand in PET imaging. Cells that metabolise glucose take up 18F-FDG via glucose transporters (GLUT 1 and 3). 18F-FDG is then phosphorylated by the cytosolic enzyme hexokinase and accumulates within the cell as it cannot undergo glycolysis (Mochizuki et al., 2001). Thus 18F-FDG uptake quantified using PET, corresponds to real-time metabolic activity in tissue. While all metabolically active cells can take up 18F-FDG, in the case of the 18F-FDG vascular signal, it appears to correlate mainly to macrophage activity in inflamed plaque. Ex vivo histological studies from arterial specimens have shown a strong correlation between 18F-FDG uptake and macrophage density (Tawakol et al., 2006, Ogawa M, 2012). This finding is thought to be due to increased glucose turnover in macrophages compared to other cells that compose atherosclerotic plaque, leading to upregulation of GLUT transporters on macrophages. The 18F-FDG signal is also related to local hypoxia which augments glycolysis and leads to up-regulation of GLUT transporters within atherosclerotic plaque via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) gene expression (Pedersen et al., 2013). 18 F-FDG PET and cardiovascular risk prediction Arterial 18F-FDG uptake was initially explored in PET/CT studies performed in oncology patients. Although retrospective, these studies demonstrated the possible use of arterial 18F-FDG PET for cardiovascular risk stratification (Paulmier et al., 2008, Rominger et al., 2009, Figueroa et al., 2013). Studies have demonstrated that higher aortic 18F-FDG uptake was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and that the degree of 18F-FDG uptake at baseline could predict the timing of such events (Figueroa et al., 2013, Paulmier et al., 2008). Furthermore, one study demonstrated that considering 18F-FDG uptake in addition to conventional risk factors led to a 27.5% net reclassification in risk prediction compared to using conventional risk factors alone (Table 1). Table 1: PET imaging and cardiovascular risk prediction The first prospective clinical study investigating arterial 18F-FDG uptake was done in patients who experienced recent transient ischaemic attacks (Rudd et al., 2002). In this study, the culprit carotid arteries had 27% higher 18F-FDG uptake compared to non-culprit vessels, elucidating that 18F-FDG accumulated in unstable vulnerable plaque that gave rise to symptoms. Subsequent studies have shown that plaques with increased 18F-FDG uptake were associated with ischaemic stroke and early stroke recurrence, independent of carotid artery luminal stenosis (Marnane et al., 2012, Davies et al., 2005). Stroke recurrence may in part be explained by micro-embolic phenomena in unstable plaque (Moustafa et al., 2010); however, more conclusive evidence is required to substantiate this observation. Furthermore, a18F-FDG PET/MRI study showed that in patients diagnosed with 'cryptogenic' stroke, 39% had high-risk plaque features on MRI and these lesions were associated with higher 18F-FDG uptake (Hyafil et al., 2016). These findings are consistent with results from previous studies which have shown that 18F-FDG uptake was higher in plaque that exhibited high-risk features identified on MRI such as a large lipid rich necrotic core and intra-plaque haemorrhage (Silvera et al., 2009, Saito et al., 2013, Chowdhury et al., 2018). 18F-FDG PET imaging may also have a role to play in individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis. A recent study conducted to define thresholds of 18F-FDG uptake for arterial inflammation showed that the majority (>52%) of individuals with atherogenic risk factors had higher 18F-FDG uptake (van der Valk et al., 2016, Fern\u00e1ndez-Friera et al., 2019). It also demonstrated that that healthy individuals (those who had calcium scores of zero) had significantly lower arterial 18F-FDG uptake than those with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Studies in individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease demonstrated that in both, intermediate and low Framingham risk score groups, vascular inflammation measured using 18F-FDG PET/CT was higher in individuals with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (Yang et al., 2013, Yoo et al., 2016). Interestingly, the correlation between hs-CRP and vascular 18F-FDG uptake in patients with cardiovascular disease has been inconsistent, with at least 5 studies failing to show a statistically significant correlation (Duivenvoorden et al., 2013, Rudd et al., 2009, Rogers et al., 2010). Vascular inflammation as measured by arterial 18 F-FDG PET/CT has also been used to risk stratify other at-risk groups such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals (Subramanian et al., 2012, Yarasheski et al., 2012), those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Lee et al., 2017) and severe dermatitis (NCT02926807). In these studies the individuals with HIV and fatty liver disease had higher arterial uptake of 18F-FDG compared to matched controls. More recently a 18 F-FDG PET/CT study investigated the association between stress and cardiovascular risk. The study demonstrated that activity in the amygdala (a region of the brain associated with stress) correlated with increased arterial inflammation as measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT (Tawakol et al., 2017). Another trial is currently underway that explores this theme further. It aims to recruit individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to explore the relationship between the activity in the fear system of the brain (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex) and arterial inflammation as measured by 18F-FDG PET/MRI (NCT03279393). Apart from playing a role in cardiovascular risk prediction, due to validation of the relationship between arterial 18F-FDG uptake and vascular inflammation (Bucci et al., 2014) and the excellent inter-scan reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in large arteries (Rudd et al., 2009, Rudd et al., 2007b, Rudd et al., 2008b), the arterial 18F-FDG signal is increasingly being used as a surrogate endpoint in cardiovascular interventional studies (Tarkin et al., 2018). 18 F-FDG PET in cardiovascular intervention trials. A number of experimental studies involving patients with CVD or cardiovascular risk factors have examined the effect of various statin therapies on arterial inflammation using 18F-FDG PET imaging (Ishii et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2012, Rudd et al., 2007a, Subramanian et al., 2013, Tahara et al., 2006). Notably, a rapid dose-dependent reduction in arterial 18F-FDG uptake was observed in a double-blind trial that compared treatment of high-dose to low-dose atorvastatin (Tawakol et al., 2013). 18F-FDG has since been used to explore similar effects of other lipid lowering therapies such as evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor. This study failed to demonstrate a reduction in vascular inflammation (Stiekema et al., 2018). Table 2 summarises cardiovascular interventional trials done using PET imaging. Table 2: PET imaging in cardiovascular interventional trials In the Dal-PLAQUE trial (Fayad et al., 2011), the effects of dalcetrapib, a modulator of cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity was investigated in patients with CVD or cardiovascular risk factors. This study failed to show significant changes in arterial inflammation with treatment, a result which was later mirrored in a phase III clinical trial that was terminated early due to futility (Schwartz et al., 2012). More recently 18F-FDG PET/CT has been used to study the efficacy of novel anti-inflammatory agents in cardiovascular disease. Studies have looked at the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, losmapimod (Elkhawad et al., 2012) and BMS-582949 (Emami et al., 2015). These studies done in patients with established cardiovascular disease, did not show significant reductions in arterial 18F-FDG uptake with treatment. Similar results were demonstrated in a 18F-FDG PET/CT study investigating another 2014). 18F-FDG PET/CT has also been used to study the off-target effects of pioglitazone in atherosclerosis. One study showed that treatment with pioglitazone resulted in a decrease in 18F-FDG uptake in the left main coronary trunk (Nitta et al., 2013). Interestingly, in a randomised controlled study done in patients with stable coronary artery disease, those who had 18F-FDG uptake above the median at baseline showed a significant reduction in inflammation when treated with pioglitazone in addition to a statin (Choo et al., 2018). This highlights the potential for using 18F-FDG to tailor therapy to populations who may most benefit from the treatment. The results of two interventional trials assessing the effect of (a) etanercept on vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in psoriasis patients (NCT01522742) and (b) colchicine on vascular inflammation in patients with stable CAD (NCT02162303); are currently awaited. A18F-FDG study investigating the lowest threshold for benefit from LDL-C lowering in patients with stable cardiovascular disease is also currently underway (NCT03355027). 18F-FDG PET/CT has also been employed to study potential circulating blood biomarkers of inflammation. In two recent studies, arterial 18F-FDG uptake was associated with circulating resistin levels (Choi et al., 2011) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein levels (Yoo et al., 2011), independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. This highlights the scope for using PET imaging to improve future CVD diagnostic techniques by aiding the development of potential circulating blood biomarkers. Challenges in using 18FDG PET for plaque imaging The main limitation of using 18F-FDG in imaging atherosclerosis is that as the tracer is taken up by all glucose metabolising cells, its signal is not inflammatory-cell specific. This is particularly important when imaging coronary arteries, as myocardial cells take up 18F-FDG avidly. This makes it difficult to assess and quantify 18F-FDG uptake in the coronary arteries accurately (Tarkin et al., 2017, Saam et al., 2010, Cheng et al., 2012). Similarly, 18F-FDG uptake by the thyroid and structures in the neck in close proximity to the carotid arteries can pose a challenge when imaging these vessels. Thus, there is clearly a need to develop alternative PET tracers with greater specificity for arterial inflammation. Choline imaging 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) and 18F-methylcholine (18F-FMCH) are used clinically to aid the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. Choline, an integral component of cell membranes, is taken up by activated macrophages and incorporated into their cell membranes following phosphorylation. As with 18F-FDG imaging, initial data on arterial uptake of 18F-FMCH comes from retrospective analyses of scans performed in patients undergoing imaging for oncological indications (Bucerius et al., 2008). A recent prospective study undertaken in stroke patients demonstrated that arterial 18F-FMCH uptake was higher in the culprit carotid arteries and correlated with the degree of macrophage infiltration in endarterectomy samples (V\u00f6\u00f6 et al., 2016). Currently two feasibility studies employing 18F-FCH PET/MRI are underway. The first of these studies will utilise 18F-FCH PET/MR along with optical coherence tomography (OCT), to validate this tracer in patients with active coronary artery disease (NCT03252990). The second study aims to recruit patients with stable and unstable cardiovascular disease and compare arterial 18F-FCH uptake between the two disease states. In this study patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease who undergo carotid endarterectomy surgery will have 18F-FCH uptake compared to CD68 staining (a marker of plaque inflammation) on histological samples (NCT02640313). Somatostatin receptor imaging Somatostatin receptors are G-protein coupled transmembrane receptors, which mediate a broad range of functions in the body when bound by somatostatin and other endogenous circulating inhibitory peptides. 68Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid]-D-Phe1,Tyr3-octreotate (DOTATATE) is a PET tracer with highly specific binding affinity for somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), currently in clinical use for imaging neuroendocrine tumours. Somatostatin receptor 2 is expressed in activated macrophages, and therefore, 68Ga-DOTATATE represents an attractive molecular probe by which to detect plaque inflammation (Armani et al., 2007). Preclinical data from a murine model of atherosclerosis (Li et al., 2013) and retrospective analysis of imaging datasets from oncology patients (Malmberg et al., 2015, Rominger et al., 2010) demonstrated the feasibility of vascular 68Ga-DOTATATE imaging. These retrospective clinical studies showed that vascular 68Ga-DOTATATE signals were moderately correlated with the presence of coronary artery calcification and other cardiovascular risk factors, but did not specifically co-localise to areas of high 18F-FDG uptake (Li et al., 2012). Importantly, there was low background uptake of the radiotracer by myocardial cells, permitting tracer uptake analysis within coronary arteries. In 2015, a dedicated vascular PET/MRI study done in patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy surgery showed that arterial 64Cu-DOTATATE uptake was higher in the culprit carotid artery compared to the non-culprit vessel (Pedersen et al., 2015). Findings from this study suggested that the 64Cu-DOTATATE signals in culprit carotid arteries were associated with upregulation of CD163 gene expression, which is a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. Thus 68Ga-DOTATATE potentially provides a more specific tracer to study inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque. A more recent study provided further clinical, histological and gene-expression level data to support the use of 68Ga-DOTATATE for imaging macrophage-related inflammation in atherosclerosis (Tarkin et al., 2017). In this study, patients with stable and unstable cardiovascular disease underwent prospective 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging. 68Ga-DOTATATE accurately identified culprit from non-culprit coronary and carotid lesions, as well as stable coronary lesions with high-risk plaque morphology. In contrast, 18F-FDG imaging in the coronary vasculature was significantly hampered by excessive myocardial signal spillover. The study also confirmed specific 68Ga-DOTATATE binding to SST2 receptors in CD68-positive macrophage-rich with in vivo 68Ga-DOTATATE Protein Imaging The 11C-labelled PET tracer PK11195, is a selective radioligand of the translocator protein (18KDa). This translocator protein (TSPO) was shown to be upregulated in activated macrophages in pre-clinical models (Scarf and Kassiou, 2011). This finding was further corroborated by studies performed using explanted human carotid endarterectomy specimens, which demonstrated that the translocator protein was found on CD68 positive macrophages (Fujimura et al., 2008, Lomare et al., 2011). Following investigations in vasculitis patients (Pugliese et al., 2010, Lomare et al., 2011), a study done on patients with carotid atherosclerosis showed that patients with symptomatic carotid artery plaque (stroke/TIA) in the preceding three months had increased arterial 11CPK11195 uptake compared to asymptomatic individuals (Gaemperli et al., 2012). Newer, non-carbon-11 TSPO tracers are currently being evaluated. 18F-GE-180 (S-N,N-diethyl-9-[2-18F-fluoroethyl]-5-methoxy 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbamazole-4-carboxamide) is one such tracer that has been used in animals models which appears to have lower non-specific binding and a higher signal-to-noise ratio (Dickens et al., 2014, Boutin et al., 2015). PBR28 ([(11)C]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine), another TSPO tracer, showed a more specific vascular signal than 11C-PK11195 in non-human primates. This tracer has been evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT00547976) and the results are awaited. Further studies are required to test the feasibility of these second generation TPSO radioligands in a clinical setting and it remains to be seen whether the variable receptor binding affinity due to genetic polymorphisms will pose a challenge to the widespread use of these newer tracers. Aluminium fluoride-18-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid conjugated folate binds to folate receptor- (FR-). FR- is selectively expressed on macrophages making it a potential target for molecular probes aimed at studying inflammation in atherosclerosis. A study done using tissue samples from mice, rabbits and humans; demonstrated that 18F-FOL co-localised to FR- positive macrophages in atherosclerotic plaque. Furthermore, carotid endarterectomy samples from patients who experienced recent cardiovascular events showed increased 18F-FOL uptake co-localised to areas of inflamed plaque (Silvola et al., 2018). Using PET/CT imaging in mice and rabbits the study demonstrated that 18F-FOL accumulation in atherosclerotic plaque corresponded to areas of high macrophage density. Compared to 18F-FDG, 18F-FOL had considerably lower uptake in myocardial cells, potentially making it a radioligand that could be used to study coronary artery atherosclerosis. 2. PET imaging of microcalcification Coronary artery macrocalcification as quantified by the Agatston score is a well validated marker of CVD burden and future cardiovascular risk. The presence of microcalcification (calcium deposits <50\u00b5m), which cannot be detected on CT or MRI, is a histological feature observed in early atherosclerotic lesions as well as high-risk rupture-prone plaque. The hydroxyapatite crystallisation on necrotic debris and matrix vesicles causes strain concentration patterns in the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque, potentially making it more prone to micro-fractures and rupture (New and Aikawa, 2011, Roijers et al., 2011). 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) is a PET radiotracer conventionally used to bony metastases in oncology patients. 18F-NaF binds to hydroxyapatite crystals by exchanging hydroxyl ions to form fluorapatite. A recent study done using an in vitro 3D collagen platform, ex-vivo human endarterectomy specimens and a mouse model demonstrated that 18F-NaF PET/CT was able to identify arterial microcalcification not detected by CT and these results were further validated using infra-red florescence imaging and histology (Creager et al., 2019). These results are in-keeping with findings of a previous study performed on carotid endarterectomy specimens that demonstrated 18F-NaF had a high affinity, sensitivity and specificity for plaque microcalcification (Irkle et al., 2015). Initial retrospective analyses of 18F-NaF PET/CT data from oncology patients showed that measurement of arterial 18F-NaF uptake was feasible, and that uptake was strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors (Derlin et al., 2010). Similar results were also observed in another study where patients with higher coronary artery 18F-NaF uptake had higher rates of prior cardiovascular events and higher Framingham risk scores (Dweck et al., 2012). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that only 15% of individuals diagnosed with diabetes had high 18F-NaF uptake in the coronary arteries, potentially helping to better risk stratify this cohort of patients who have classically been thought of as being at higher risk of cardiovascular events (Raggi et al., 2019). 18F-NaF is particularly suited for charaterising microcalcification in coronary artery plaque due to relatively low tracer uptake by myocardial cells. A prospective study performed in patients who underwent PET/CT and invasive coronary angiography, showed that 18F-NaF uptake was higher in culprit coronary arteries than non-culprit arteries in 93% of patients diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (Joshi et al., 2014). In contrast coronary artery 18F-FDG uptake could not be distinguished from patchy myocardial uptake in 52% of vessel territories, despite patients following a special diet prior to undergoing 18F-FDG imaging to minimise myocardial uptake. Where coronary artery 18F-FDG signals were interpretable, tracer uptake was not significantly different between culprit and non-culprit coronary arteries. Furthermore, in patients with stable angina whose coronary arteries had increased 18F-NaF uptake, intravascular ultrasound demonstrated other high-risk plaque features such as a necrotic core and expansive remodeling. The highly selective nature of 18F-NaF for intra-plaque microcalcification, coupled with its low uptake in myocardial cells, makes 18F-NaF a promising imaging probe for studying vulnerable coronary artery plaque. A large study utilising18F-NaF imaging in patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction and multi-vessel coronary artery disease that aims to recruit up to 700 patients is currently underway (NCT02278211). The study aims to investigate the ability of 18F-NaF PET/CT to predict plaque progression identified by CTCA, as well as longer-term clinical outcomes. Another study is planned in patients with a recent diagnosis of stroke, and aims to use transcranial doppler to further characterise 18F-NaF positive atherosclerotic plaque lesions (NCT03215563). 18F-NaF uptake is also being used in clinical trials to provide surrogate imaging endpoints in cardiovascular interventional trials. The results from two interventional studies investigating the effects of rosuvastatin (NCT03233243) and ticagrelor (NCT0211033) on atherosclerotic plaque metabolism in the targeted treatment of individuals with high arterial 18F-NaF uptake at baseline, are awaited. Figure 2: PET imaging of Inflammation and microcalcification in atherosclerosis 3. PET imaging of hypoxia Hypoxia is a feature of atherosclerotic plaque. Pre-clinical studies performed in rabbit atherosclerosis models have shown that 18F-Fluoromisonadazole (FMISO) PET can be used to identify hypoxia as characterised by pimonidazole staining (Mateo et al., 2014). Hypoxia is thought to potentiate the inflammatory response via HIF-1 expressed by macrophages in the plaque core, the most hypoxic area within the plaque. A clinical study conducted using both 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG in patients with recent ischemic cerebrovascular events, showed that vascular uptake of 18F-FMISO was higher in symptomatic carotid arteries compared to asymptomatic vessels (Joshi et al., 2017). This trial also demonstrated that plaque inflammation and hypoxia were closely correlated, with hypoxia underpinning about 40% of the measured 18F-FDG signal. 18F-2-(4-((2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl) propanolol (18F-HX4) is another tracer that has been used in clinical studies to measure hypoxia in atherosclerosis. In a small study arterial 18F-HX4 uptake was shown to localise to areas of atherosclerosis in patients who experienced a cardiovascular event in the preceding six months (van der Valk et al., 2015). More studies are needed to validate the role of this radiotracer in atherosclerosis. Despite these impressive results demonstrating the relationship between hypoxia and inflammation within atherosclerotic plaque, low signal to noise ratios and high tracer costs have limited the widespread adoption of these radiotracers. 4. PET imaging of neoangiogenesis Neoangiogenesis, which predisposes plaque to intra-plaque haemorrhage, is another feature of vulnerable plaque (Doyle and Caplice, 2007). Of the radiotracers used to image neoangiogenesis, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides targeting V3 integrin have been the most widely studied in the context of atherosclerosis. V3 integrin is expressed in a number of cells, notably endothelial cells and macrophages (Brooks et al., 1994). The expression of V3 integrin is vital to endothelial cell sprouting in neoangiogenesis. This process has also been shown to be orchestrated to a degree by macrophages (Gurevich et al., 2018). Interestingly V3 integrin expression on macrophages has also been implicated in their transition into foam cells. 68Ga-1,4,7- triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) -Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and 18F-Galacto-RGD PET tracers bind to V3 integrin have been studied in pre-clinical and to a limited extent in clinical atherosclerosis (Laitinen et al., 2009, Beer et al., 2006). In a study performed in patients undergoing imaging for solid tumours, arterial 18F-Galacto-RGD uptake correlated with V3 integrin staining on histology (Beer et al., 2006). Furthermore, in 10 patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis,18F-Galacto-RGD accumulated in culprit atherosclerotic 18F-Galacto-RGD uptake again correlated with V3 integrin expression (Beer et al., 2014). Dedicated studies are required to explore the scope of RGD PET tracers in imaging atherosclerosis. A study aiming to investigate arterial 18F-FPP-RGD2 uptake in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis and advanced abdominal aortic aneurysms, is due to commence shortly (NCT02995642). Another integrin PET tracer, 18F-Fluciclatide, has been shown to correlate with atherosclerosis burden. A 46 participant study showed that 18F-Fluciclatide uptake in the thoracic aorta was higher in patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypercholesterolaemia (Jenkins et al., 2015). However, studies have also shown that 18F-Fluciclatide uptake correlates with fibrosis in tissue (Chen et al., 2017, Jenkins et al., 2017), thus more studies are required to characterise the role of 18F-Fluciclatide in atherosclerosis imaging. The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChR), a subtype of nicotinic receptors, have also been implicated in angiogenesis. 7nAChRs are highly expressed in endothelial cells as well as macrophages and the role of 7nAChRs in atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies that have shown 7nAChRs agonists accelerate atherosclerosis (Koga et al., 2014). Although, a number of radioactive tracers, both agonists (18F-NS14490) and antagonists (18F-ASEM), are available to target 7nAChR (Boswijk et al., 2017) these have not yet been investigated in the context of atherosclerosis in clinical studies or clinical specimens. The natriuretic peptide clearance receptor is another molecular target that appears to be upregulated in angiogenic lesions (with co-localisation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells) in mouse models (Liu et al., 2011). A novel molecular nano-probe integrating 64Cu-labeled C-type atrial natriuretic factor (CANF), that can be detected by PET/MRI, is currently under investigation in a feasibility study recruiting patients who are due to undergo carotid endarterectomy (NCT02417688). Other novel PET tracers 68Ga-pentixafor is a radiolabelled PET tracer selective for CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), these receptors are expressed on endothelial cells and macrophages, as well as a range of other immune cells. Pre-clinical studies suggest CXCR4 may have a role to play in endothelial progenitor recruitment and the transition of macrophages into foam cells (Yao et al., 2012). Retrospective studies in oncology patients have shown that 68Ga-pentixafor uptake correlated with cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerotic plaque burden (Li et al., 2018, Weiberg et al., 2018, Li et al., 2019). The first dedicated vascular study using 68Ga-pentixafor was done in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention following their first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (Derlin et al., 2018). 68Ga-pentixafor uptake was highest in the culprit coronary artery with lower uptake in stented non-culprit arteries. The lowest 68Ga-pentixafor uptake was observed in 'na\u00efve' coronary segments. Ex-vivo studies done on coronary artery specimens showed that CXCR4 was overexpressed in atherosclerotic lesions and mainly co-localised with CB68+ cells. 18F-Flutemetamol 18F-Flutemetamol is a PET tracer with a high affinity for amyloid beta, extensively studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta is also associated with atherosclerosis (Gupta and Iadecola, 2015), with in vitro studies suggesting that a major part of this association is based on the ability of amyloid beta to trigger macrophage activation and plaque instability. Currently a feasibility study using PET/MRI is underway investigating arterial 18F-Flutemetamol uptake in individuals who have recently had a stroke or TIA and have carotid artery stenosis (NCT03291093). This study will evaluate 18F-Flutemetamol uptake in both carotid and coronary arteries. 11C-acetate Lipids play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaque. Evidence from several studies has demonstrated that de novo fatty acid synthesis occurs within atherosclerotic lesions (Filipovic and Rutem\u00f6ller, 1976, Derlin et al., 2011). Intra-plaque fatty acid synthesis is essential for macrophage-mediated inflammation, which in turn affects plaque stability. De novo fatty acid synthesis is mediated by the multifunctional enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) in arterial lesions. FAS requires acetyl-coenzyme-A, derived from acetate for the production of fatty acids. Thus 11C-acetate could potentially be used to identify vulnerable plaque, although currently its main clinical use is in oncology. A 11C-acetate PET/CT feasibility study undertaken in patients with oncological conditions showed vascular 11C-acetate uptake could be quantified and that in 30% of cases 11C-acetate uptake co-localised to areas of calcified plaque. A limitation of using this tracer is its short half-life and high uptake by myocardial cells (Derlin et al., 2011). Dedicated studies are required to characterise its role in atherosclerotic plaque evaluation. Table 3: PET tracers used in clinical research for atherosclerosis imaging Conclusions and future directions. The diverse molecular imaging targets that can be harnessed by PET imaging offers a wide range of tools by which to explore the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and identify vulnerable plaque. The validation of more specific PET tracers will enable us to not only characterise vulnerable plaque better but also aid more accurate risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. Methods for vascular imaging using hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI scanners continue to advance (Robson et al., 2017a). The immediate advantages of PET/MRI over PET/CT scanning are lower radiation exposure allowing serial imaging for longitudinal studies, integrated cardiac and respiratory motion correction facilities built into the scanners, and improved soft tissue characterization of MRI compared to CT. While these new scanners also have improved detector sensitivity, as well as other technological advances important for vascular imaging, major challenges such as accurate attenuation correction remain (Silvera et al., 2009, Saito et al., 2013, Calcagno et al., 2013). Furthermore, pre-clinical studies using PET/MRI have demonstrated proof of concept for using combinations of nanotracers for multi-parametric characterisation of atherosclerotic plaque (Senders et al., 2018). These however need further validation in clinical trials. Currently the commonest use of hybrid PET/MRI is in assessing myocardial function and viability post myocardial infarction. Other clinical applications of hybrid PET/MRI include the assessment of myocarditis and cardiomyopathies (Nensa et al., 2018). Imaging coronary atherosclerosis using PET is particularly challenging due motion artefacts that occur as a result of cardiac and respiratory motion. There is also a greater risk of misclassification of tracer uptake in the coronary arteries due to motion artefact as there is only a relatively small difference in tracer uptake between culprit and non-culprit coronary arteries (Rubeaux et al., 2016). Furthermore, due to the lack of anatomical landmarks general purpose motion correction methods are not particularly useful in the assessment of coronary arteries. However, a recent feasibility study done using motion corrected PET data reconstruction demonstrated a novel technique to reduce noise and increase TBR signals with 18F-NaF PET/CT (Rubeaux et al., 2016). In conclusion, PET imaging is a powerful tool that can provide important pathophysiological insights into the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and enable more accurate characterisation of high-risk plaque, especially with the advent of hybrid imaging techniques and more specific tracers. PET imaging is also increasingly being used in cardiovascular interventional trials as a surrogate marker of drug efficacy, and is proving to be an efficient and cost-effective method for bridging the translational divide that exists in drug development.

Figure 1: Molecular targets of PET tracers currently used in clinical studies for imaging atherosclerosis Inflammation: 18F-FDG is the most-widely used and validated tracer. 18FCH,18F-FMCH, 68Ga-DOTATATE, 18F-FOL and 11C-PK11195 are others used in clinical research. Hypoxia: FMISO and 18F-HX4 are tracers currently being trialed for imaging hypoxia in atherosclerosis Neoangiogenesis: These tracers target integrin found on vascular smooth muscle cells and on macrophages. RGD PET tracers such as 18F-Galacto-RGD, and 18F-Fluciclatide are currently being evaluated for imaging atherosclerosis. Microcalcification: 18F-NaF is increasingly being used to image vulnerable plaque in atherosclerosis by targeting microcalcification. Other: 68Ga-pentixafor is a radiolabelled PET tracer selective for CXCR4 found on macrophages and endothelial cells. 18F-Flutemetamol is a PET tracer with high affinity for amyloid beta (Ab), which has been associated with atherosclerosis. 11C-acetate is implicated TSPO, translocator protein.
