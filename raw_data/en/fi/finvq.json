Integrative Therapies Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Overview [Complementary and alternative medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044964&version=Patient&language=English) (CAM) includes many different kinds of [therapies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English), botanicals, and [dietary supplements](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English). [Complementary medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044951&version=Patient&language=English) is treatment that is used along with [standard treatments](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044930&version=Patient&language=English) but is not considered standard. [Alternative medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044921&version=Patient&language=English) is treatment that is used instead of standard treatments. In general, less research has been done for CAM than for standard treatments. [Integrative therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000689097&version=Patient&language=English) is medical care that combines standard care with CAM practices. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reported that about 4 out of 10 adults use a CAM therapy. Natural products and deep breathing exercises were the most common. One large survey reported on the use of complementary therapies in [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) [survivors](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000450125&version=Patient&language=English). The therapies used most often were prayer and [spiritual](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000441265&version=Patient&language=English) practice, relaxation, faith and spiritual healing, and nutritional supplements and [vitamins](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044744&version=Patient&language=English). CAM therapies are used often to treat children with cancer, both inside and outside of [clinical trials](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045961&version=Patient&language=English). CAM therapies have been used to treat [side effects](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046580&version=Patient&language=English) caused by cancer or cancer treatment. Cancer patients sometimes choose alternative medicine over standard treatment; however, alternative medicine does not work as well as standard medicine to treat cancer. In Asian countries, [traditional Chinese medical therapies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000449722&version=Patient&language=English) are often used along with standard therapy. One study showed that when [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) patients and their doctors talked about CAM therapy, it was most often brought up by the patient. Both the patient and the doctor were more satisfied with the visit when they talked about CAM therapy.

Cannabis and Cannabinoids (also known as marijuana) [Cannabis](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000716285&version=Patient&language=English) is a plant from Central Asia that is grown in many parts of the world today. In the United States, it is a [controlled substance](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000716287&version=Patient&language=English) and is classified as a Schedule I agent (a [drug](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English) with increased potential for abuse and no known medical use). The Cannabis plant makes a [resin](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000642508&version=Patient&language=English) that contains active [chemicals](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000643008&version=Patient&language=English) called cannabinoids. Cannabinoids cause drug-like effects throughout the body, including the [central nervous system](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046481&version=Patient&language=English) and the [immune system](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046356&version=Patient&language=English). Possible benefits of medicinal Cannabis for people living with [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) include control of [nausea](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000390302&version=Patient&language=English) and [vomiting](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000390324&version=Patient&language=English), increasing [appetite](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454699&version=Patient&language=English), relieving pain, and improving sleep. - See the PDQ patient summary on Cannabis and Cannabinoids for more information. Essiac/Flor Essence [Essiac](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000446524&version=Patient&language=English) and Flor Essence are herbal tea mixtures originally developed in Canada. They are sold worldwide as [dietary supplements](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English). Supporters of Essiac and Flor Essence say that these products can help [detoxify](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000446105&version=Patient&language=English) the body, make the immune system stronger, and fight cancer. There is no evidence in clinical trials that Essiac or Flor Essence can help treat patients with cancer. - See the PDQ patient summary on Essiac/Flor Essence for more information. Flaxseed [Flaxseed](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000285920&version=Patient&language=English) comes from the flax plant. It is a rich source of [omega-3 fatty acid](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045809&version=Patient&language=English), [fiber](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046401&version=Patient&language=English), and [compounds](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000422394&version=Patient&language=English) called [lignans](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000330172&version=Patient&language=English). It is being studied in the [prevention](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000439419&version=Patient&language=English) of several types of cancer. Flaxseed has also been studied for its effect on hot flashes. - See the Herbs/Dietary Supplements section in the PDQ health professional summary on Hot Flashes and Night Sweats for more information on flaxseed. Ginger [Ginger](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000340930&version=Patient&language=English) is a root that is used in cooking and in some cultures to treat medical conditions such as nausea.

The manufacturer is no longer in business and PC-SPES is no longer being made. - See the PDQ patient summary on PC-SPES for more information. St. John's Wort [St. John's wort](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044957&version=Patient&language=English) (Hypericum perforatum) is an herbal sold as an [over-the-counter](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044696&version=Patient&language=English) treatment for [depression](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000430479&version=Patient&language=English). St. John's wort has not been proven to be better than standard [antidepressant](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044105&version=Patient&language=English) medicines. Studies have been done to compare St. John's wort with antidepressants, placebo (inactive) medicines, or both, and have shown mixed results. Be sure to talk with your doctor before taking St. John's wort. It may change the way some of your other medicines work, including anticancer medicines. Also, there are no standards for companies that make St. John's wort, so the amount of active ingredient may be different in each brand. Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup \"Selected Vegetables\" and \"Sun's Soup\" are different mixtures of vegetables and herbs that have been studied as treatments for cancer. Dried and frozen forms of Selected Vegetables are sold in the United States as dietary supplements. The vegetables and herbs in Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup are thought to have substances that block the growth of cancer cells and/or help the body's immune system kill cancer cells. There is very little evidence that Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup is useful as a treatment for cancer and no randomized or controlled clinical trials have been done. - See the PDQ patient summary on Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup for more information. Mind-Body Therapies Aromatherapy and Essential Oils [Aromatherapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000462662&version=Patient&language=English) is the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, [herbs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English), or trees) as [therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English) to improve physical, emotional, and [spiritual](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000441265&version=Patient&language=English) well-being.

NDV appears to copy itself much better in human cancer cells than in most normal human cells and is being studied for anticancer effects. - See the PDQ patient summary on Newcastle Disease Virus for more information. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the complementary and alternative therapies found in other PDQ summaries and NCI Fact Sheets. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Date Last Modified\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014also called integrative medicine\u2014includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment\u2014not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. [The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm) which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: - What side effects can be expected? - What are the risks related to this therapy? - What benefits can be expected from this therapy? - Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? - Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? - Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? - If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? - Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
