Quite the contrary. We are drawn here to consider a phenomenon. We are here to consider whether a collective romantic fantasy called alternative medicine that has seized our society really deserves the acclaim it is receiving. This, for the most part, is what people like us do when we gather in symposia or meetings to discuss alternative medicine. We argue about beliefs and claims, not results. Are the beliefs and claims of this collective romantic fantasy justified by empirical data? Or rather, will the beliefs and claims of this collective romantic fantasy be justified by empirical data because the fantasy is already securely in place in our political and fiscal, medical and educational, structures? - Type - Article - Information [Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics), [Volume 31](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/volume/808E6C6E1E8CCD1005835A6CAD45E2A0), [Issue 2](/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/issue/ED3E3BB93932EB35402A0BD347D30FC1), Summer 2003 , pp. 191 - 197 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics "}
