The production is based on a seed lot system. The manufacturing process starts with inoculation of a starter cultur e with Mycobacterium bovis , substrain Moreau, and expansion steps. The bacterial mass is harvested, washed, homogeni sed and diluted in carrier solution to obtain a suspension with the defined concentration for filling. The specifications include tests for identity, live bacterial count, and microbiological purity. Batch analysis data from commercial scale batches were provided and indicate a consistent manufacturing process. The analytical methods established for drug substance release are described and hav e been validated in accordance with Ph. Eur. No drug substance shelf life has been established since drug substance is immediately introduced into the drug product manufacturing process. 3.2 Drug Product The finished drug product is a powder (lyophilisate) for suspension for intravesical administration. It is available in two dosage strengths, BCG Apogepha 50 mg and BCG Apogepha 100 mg, containing 1.5 - 6.0 x 108 and 3 .0 - 12.0 x 108 colony -forming units of BCG mycobacterium, respectively , and a solvent for suspension. Both dosage strength s are available in either 5 ml amber glass vial s or 3.4 ml amber glass ampoules. The solvent (0.9% saline) is provided in a 2 ml clear glass ampoule. For reconstitution of the lyophili sed drug product , 1 ml of diluent is used for both dosage strengths . The manufacturing process for the finished drug product comprises aseptic filling and freeze- drying. Process validation studies were executed at commercial scale using three consecutive validation batches. The specifications include tests for appearance, identity, live bacterial count per unit, virulent mycobacteria, microbiological purity, water content and uniformity of mass. The analytical procedures comply with Ph. Eur. For BCG Apogepha (50 mg and 100 mg) presented in 3.4 ml amber glass ampoules, the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored under refrigerated conditions (2 - 8\u00b0C) is justified based on stability studies performed according to ICH guidance. For BCG Apogepha (50 mg and 100 mg) presented in 5 ml amber glass vials , a shelf life of 9 months when stored under refrigerated conditions (2 - 8\u00b0C) is accepted. 3.3 Quality Conclusions Satisfactory and consistent quality of drug substance and drug product has been demonstrated.

Information for healthcare professionals 1 / 10 BCG Apogepha 50 / 100 mg The efficacy and safety of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg have only been summarily assessed by Swissmedic. The approval of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg is based on Onko BCG 50 / 100 with information as of November 2018, which contain the same active substance(s) and are authorised in Poland. Composition Active substances Bacillus Calmette -Guerin, live, equivalent to 3.54 mg sodium/ml), water for injections Pharmaceutical form and act ive substance quantity per unit Powder and solvent for suspension for intravesical use. White to cream -coloured, dry, amorphous powder. BCG Apogepha 50 mg One ampoule / vial contains 50 mg live, attenuated Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) from the Brazilian Moreau substrain ( min. 1.5 - max. 6.0 x 108 CFU (colony forming units)). BCG Apogepha 100 mg One ampoule / vial contains 100 mg live, attenuated Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) from the Brazilian Moreau substrain (min. 3.0 - max. 12.0 x 10 8 CFU (colony forming units)). Indications/Uses The product is used for the treatment of superficial, epithelial, non- muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (Carcinoma urotheliale Ta, Tis, T1) .12 The product should not be used in invasive bladder carcinoma as chances of complete recovery are negligible . Dosage/Administration 1 EU-SmPC Areas of application 2 Modules 2.5 Information for healthcare professionals 2 / 10 Dosage3 The content of one ampoule / vial of BCG Apogepha 100 mg corresponds to one complete dose for intravesical instillation. The powder contained is suspended in 1 ml sterile physio logical saline solution (0.9%) . In case of recurr ing side effects (dysuria, increased body temperature) or increased tuberculin reaction, BCG Apogepha 50 mg may be used. In this case, the content of one ampoule / vial of BCG Apogepha 50 mg corresponds to a complete dose for intravesical instillation. The powder contained is suspended in 1 ml sterile physiological saline solution (0.9%) . Method of administration Using a st erile 2 ml or 5 ml syringe, add 1 ml of the enclosed solvent ( sterile physiological saline solution (0.9%) ) to an ampoule / vial of BCG. To obtain a homogeneous suspension, the following procedure should be repeated three times: The BCG suspension is care fully aspirated from the ampoule / vial into the syringe and then returned to the ampoule / vial (avoid shaking and foaming of the suspension). Then draw up the entire suspension from the ampoule / vial into a sterile 50 ml syringe and add 49 ml sterile p hysiological saline solution (0.9%). The suspension should be homogeneous and without visible conglomerates. Insert a catheter into the urethra to empty the bladder completely. Then, the entire BCG suspension (50 ml in the sterile syringe) should be slowly instilled into the bladder via the catheter. To remove the BCG suspension completely from the catheter after instillation, it should be rinsed with 5 ml of sterile physiological saline solution (0.9%). The catheter can now be removed. The patient should not take any liquids 3 -4 hours before and 2 hours after administration of the BCG suspension. The instilled BCG suspension must remain in the urinary bladder for 2 hours. During this period, the patient should change his/her body positi on every 15 minutes (prone, supine, side position). After 2 hours, the urinary bladder should be emptied completely. BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg should be instilled into the urinary bladder no earlier than 14 days after a urinary bladder biopsy or transurethral resection -B). Instillation with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg should be performed once a week for 6 consecutive weeks as induction therapy. The subsequent maintenance therapy is administered once a week for 3 consecutive weeks every 3 months. In case of tumour recurrence, the 6- week induction therapy should be repeated. Before starting treatment, an intradermal tuberculin test (PT, PPD) should be performed to assess the patient's degree of immunoreactivity. When skin reaction is severe or when its diameter exceeds 1 cm (6 mm induration diameter is considered a positive result), immunotherapy should not be performed. 3 EU-SmPC Dosage and method of use Information for healthcare professionals 3 / 10 6 weeks after the start of treatment, the intradermal tuberculin test should be repeated to assess the effect of treatment on the patient's general immunoreactivity. This is significantly increased in some patients. Urination Two hours after instillation of the BCG suspension, the patient should empty the urinary bladder. If this is not successful, the patient should be catheterised by healthcare professionals to remove the remaining urine. After urination, the toilet is cleaned with standard disinfectants. Patient information card: Patients should be informed about the risks of treatment and the precautions for the safe use of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg, and the patient information card should be given before treatment is started. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section \"Composition\" . Infections of the urinary tract. In these cases, therapy with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg should be interrupted until the urine culture results are negative and therapy with antibiotics and/or local antiseptics has been terminated. Macrohaematuria. In these cases, treatment with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg should be discontinued or postponed until the haematuria has been successfully treated. Clinical presence of active tuberculosis. Before starting treatment with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg, active tuberculosis should be excluded in patients with active PPD skin test. Active tuberculosis infection or other diseases requiring the use of tuberculostats such as streptomycin, paraamino- salicylic acid (PAS), isoniazid with immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids, cytostatics or radiotherapy) Impaired immune response, whether congenital or acquired through disease, drugs, or other therapies. Positive HIV serology Pregnancy and lactation Febrile infections or fever of unknown origin Recent TUR -B (less than 2- 3 weeks after TUR -B) Presence of urinary bladder wall perforation. Warnings and Precautions Information for healthcare professionals 4 / 10 BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg contains live, attenuated mycobacteria. Because of the potential risk of accidental infection, the suspension must be prepared and used with the greatest care. Before the first intravesical instillation of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg, a tuberculin test should be performed. If this test is positive, the intravesical instillation of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg is contraindicated only if, in addition, there are additional medical indications of an existing active tuberculosis infection. The possibility of severe systemic BCG infection or allergic reaction necessitating antituberculostatic therapy or treatment of the allergic reaction should be considered before starting BCG therapy. A traumatic event during catheter insertion or other injury to the urethra or bladder mucosa may trigger systemic BCG infection. It should be considered to postpone BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg treatment until the injured mucosa has healed. The lubricant for catheterisation should be free of tuberculostatic agents. The amount of liquid taken in should be increased for 24 hours after the first urination after instillation. Urination should be done regularly. In patients with known risk factors for HIV infection, it is recommended that adequate HIV testing be performed before starting therapy. After each intravesical instillation, patients must b e monitored for symptoms of systemic BCG infection and signs of a toxic reaction. Manifestation of latent BCG infection (including delayed diagnosis) BCG bacteria can persist in the body for several years. Such latent BCG infections can become manifest years after the initial infection, especially in the form of granulomatous pneumonitis, abscesses, infected aneurysms, infection of an implant, graft, or surrounding tissue. The patient must be made aware of the possibility of a late onset of latent BCG infec tion and informed of the measures to be taken if symptoms such as fever and weight loss of unknown cause occur. If latent BCG infection is suspected to have manifested, a doctor specialis ed in infectious diseases should be consulted. Please note that a pat ient information card is available on this subject, which must be given to the patient (see section \"Dosage/ Administration \"). BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg must not be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. To protect the partner, it is recommended not to have sexual intercourse or use a condom within one week after instillation. The use of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg may cause sensitisation of patients and a positive reaction of the PPD test. Information for healthcare professionals 5 / 10 Reconstitution, preparation of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg suspension for instillation and administration must be carried out under aseptic conditions. Spilled suspension may cause BCG contamination. The spilled BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg suspension should be cleaned with paper towels soaked in tuberculostatic disinfectant for at least 10 minutes. Subsequently, all waste material should be disposed of in a manner appropriate for hazardous waste. In case of self -instillation, inhalation or unintentional swallowing of BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg suspension, unintentional contact with the skin or mucous membrane may occur. In healthy individuals, contact with BCG should not cause significant adverse health effects. In case of su spected accidental ingestion or instillation, it is recommended to perform a PPD skin test immediately and 6 weeks afterwards to detect any conversion of reactivity to PPD. Interactions The product should not be used in patients receiving concomitant treat ment with cytostatic drugs or are systemic steroids. Topical steroids are not a contraindication for treatment with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg. During BCG treatment, administration of drugs such as antibiotics and p- aminosalicylic acid (PAS), which have a possible bactericidal effect on BCG, should be restricted. 4 Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg should not be used during pregnancy. Lactation BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg is contraindicated during lactation. Effects on ability to drive and use machines The ability to drive and operate machinery during treatment with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg has not been examined. Undesirable effects Treatment of non- invasive bladder carcinoma with intravesical instillation with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg is well tolerated by most patients. Local or systemic side effects may nevertheless occur. The most common side effects include acute cystitis, which often occurs after the second or third administration. Pollakiuria, haematuria and vesical tenesmus often occur on the day of therapy and usually subside after a few hours. Tuberculous granulomas have been described in the lungs. Tuberculous granulomas have also been described in the liver. 4 SmPC OncoTICE interactions Information for healthcare professionals 6 / 10 More serious adverse effects of therapy are also known, such as tuberculous inflammation of the deeper layers of the urinary bladder wall, prostat e, and epididymis with foci of caseous necrosis. In patients with tuberculous prostatitis or persistent (sub) -febrile status, the 6- week protocol based on daily administration of rifampicin (600 mg) and isoniazid (5 mg per kilogram of body weight) should be used. In patients with acute septic symptoms or arthritis, the 4 -month protocol should be used: 3 drugs daily for 2 months: Daily administration of rifampici n (600 mg), isoniazid (5 mg per kilogram body weight), ethambutol (25 mg per kilogram body weight, replaceable by pyraniazid 1500 mg) and 2 medicines 3 times a week for 2 consecutive months: rifampicin (600 mg) and isoniazid (10 mg per kilogram of body we ight). If patients develop symptoms of arthritis, the administration of corticosteroids may be necessary. In the case of the mentioned systemic BCG reactions/infections, therapy with BCG Apogepha 50 mg / 100 mg must be stopped. In addition to local react ions, general reactions such as malaise, brief increase in body temperature (38\u00b0C - 39\u00b0C), chills, nausea, muscle and joint pain, diarrhoea and pain in the genital area may occur. Usually , the symptoms disappear after 3 days at the latest. Very rarely, the symptoms just mentioned require interruption of BCG treatment and administration of tuberculostats. All mentioned severe side effects of intravesical BCG instillation usually resolve after 4 months of antituberculostatic therapy. The following side e ffects may occur after administration of BCG Apogepha 50 / 100 mg: allergic reaction, possibly manifested in breathing difficulties, cough, skin rash, oedema of the face, Tuberculosis infection, possibly manifested by cough, high fever lasting longer than 12 hours (temperature above 39.5\u00b0C) or fever lasting longer than 2 days (temperature above 38.5\u00b0C), yellow eyes or yellow skin, greyish or whitish stools, fever (a temperature below 38.5\u00b0C) with chills, headache, muscle and joint pain lasting longer than 2 days, marked pain when urinating or excessive urge to urinate, panophthalmitis, haematuria.
