Psychotherapy, sometimes just referred to as therapy or counselling, is a service provided to you, which focuses on your well-being. Generally, in session, individuals spend some time thinking, talking, and / or planning around any issues they feel are important to process through. Therapy can also be an opportunity to work on areas of the self that one feels are imbalanced in any way. It is also quite common for therapy to be referred by other kinds of practitioners (e.g. doctors, teachers), or recommended by loved ones, peers, employers or friends. Cognitive behavioral therapy (or cognitive behavioral therapies or CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach that aims to solve problems concerning dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and cognition's through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure (Butler, Chapman, Foreman and Beck, 2006). The therapist works with the client in isolating negative thought (cognition) patterns are directly influencing or perpetuating harmful, destructive or limiting actions (behaviors). The aim is to re-construct the negative patterns into ones that are helpful, honest, and progressive. The result is that change will manifest at a practical level for the client in their everyday actions, in what and how they do things, as well as create a heightened sense of self-awareness so as to prevent the negative cycles from returning. In CBT, the client should expect to be an active participant, this is not a passive form of therapy, it requires interaction between the client and therapist, so that the client can be directly involved in the process. CBT also works well in conjunction with other approaches, and can easily be integrated with other forms of therapy to according to client needs and preferences. The roots of CBT can be traced to the development of behavior therapy in the early 20th century (Butler, Chapman, Foreman and Beck, 2006) originating from the Behavioural Therapeutic work of Mary Cover Jones in 1924, and Cognitive Therapeutic approaches developed in 1937 by Abraham Low. The merging of the two approaches occurred in the 1960's; ever since CBT has been empirically proven to provide the client with highly successful results. Today, CBT is still one of the most widely used forms of psychotherapy in the West, and information on is extremely accessible via the internet or through academic journals. Craniosacral Osteopathic Therapy is a specialized form of Osteopathy that uses a combination of osteopathic and cranio-sacral techniques to provide a gentle non-obtrusive manipulation within the Cranial Sacral Area to calm, relax and heal using cranial-sacral balancing. Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions obesity, substance abuse, pain, ego, anxiety, stress, amnesia, phobias, and matters of performance. The purpose of massage therapy is to undo the stress and damage that the muscles endure for whichever reasons. When muscles become stressed, they tend to block oxygen and nutrients, which leads to inflammation. This inflammation builds up toxins in the muscle tissue. A massage will help the muscles release the toxins, while getting the blood and oxygen circulating properly. It is therefore important to drink plenty of water after a massage to assist the body in getting rid of these toxins. Osteopathy is a way of detecting and treating injured parts of the body such as muscles, ligaments, nerves and joints. Osteopathy can be beneficial for the treatment of acute pain from a current injury or disorder and for the treatment of chronic pain following past injuries or health problems. Reiki is a Japanese touch therapy for relaxation and pain relief that also promotes healing and spiritual development. Although Reiki is \"hands-on\", unlike massage, Reiki is administered through a very gentle touch. Tui Na is a sophisticated medical massage used to treat injuries, joint and muscle problems and internal disorders. Tui Na techniques and manipulations are rigorous. It involves applying finger pressure, hands, elbows and knees as a tool to directly influence the flow of Qi (body energy) to treat disease and illnesses. Tui Na is also used to protect health by building immunity, so that disease can be stopped in its beginning acting as a preventative medical care. It involves a deep tissue massage to various acupuncture points without the use of needles. In many cases it is used for children, seniors and for individuals who may be afraid of needles.
