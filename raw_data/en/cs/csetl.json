Healing of the tendons is typically supported by casting and unload-ing the operated limb. Tendon rupture or overcorrection may result as an adverse effect. Little is known on the sta-bility of Z-plasty tendon lengthening and whether an aug-mentation may increase stability. In a randomized in-vitro study, 18 bovine flexor tendons were lengthened or shortened using standard Z-plasty approach. After randomization, a conventional surgical technique by suturing the Z-plasty was used as a control. In experimental group 1 (E1), an additional augmentation on top of the existing suture approach with a Fiberlock patch was performed. In experimental group 2 (E2), tendon fixa-tion was done only with a reinforced patch not using any sutures on top of a Pulvertaft repair. A universal material testing machine Z010 (ZwickRoell GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was used for testing and data was recorded with its dedi-cated software (testXpert III ZwickRoell, Ulm, Germany). The Fibrelock patch augmented suture repair (E1) showed significant increase compared to the control in ultimate failure force (481.7 \u00b1 106.9 N vs. 205.8 \u00b1 36.9 N, 0.0004) and linear stiffness (40.8 \u00b1 6.9 N/mm 8.8 N/mm, p = 0.0052). Suture-less E2 group did not show any significant difference in ultimate failure force compared the control group. The augmentation using the Surgical-Fiberlock technology indicates biomechanical superiority regarding ultimate fail-ure force and is therefore a promising new approach for strengthening a Z-plasty tendon lengthening or shortening. This may enable early mobilization with or even without casting after tendon lengthening or shortening and improve stability of tendon sutures to avoid overcorrection or under - correction. In-vivo testing in future studies are planned to proof adavantages of such augmentation techniques for clinical routine and patient related outcome. BASIC SCIENCE OP-2 Investigation of local and systemic response of degrading implants are for ortho- paedic interventions due to their biocompatibility, bio-degradability, and suitable mechanical properties. Its elastic modulus is similar to the bone tissue thereby preventing stress shielding. However, their fast degra dation rate with the release of gaseous hydrogen limits the usage of these implants in clinical applications. Therefore, it is important to understand the degradation behaviour of Mg-based implants and their effect on bone remodelling. In this study, we investigated i) the degradation behaviour of ZX00 (Mg < 0.5wt%Zn < 0.5wt%Ca) and ultra high- purity Mg (XHP-Mg) implants, ii) their safety and effects on bone in-growth in juvenile growing rats (Sprague Dawley) and compare with state-of-the-art Ti implants. Five SD rats per group underwent bilateral, transcortical implantation of cylindrical pins (ZX00 and XHP-Mg: d = 1.6mm, l = 8 mm; Ti: d = 1.5 mm, l = 8mm) into the diaphysis of both femurs. Material degradation was observed via in vivo low-medium resolution (2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks after surgery) and ex vivo high resolution micro-computed tomography \u00b5CT (\u00b5CT; 6 and 24 weeks after surgery). Sequential fluorochrome markers were administered in rats to evaluate new bone tissue formation together with histological analysis. Serum ALP, Ca, and Mg level were measured and histopathological evaluations were performed to elucidate the systemic effect of degrad-ing Mg implants. Our results demonstrated that ZX00 homogenously degraded with an increased gas accumulation 12 and 22 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) 24 weeks after implantation whereas XHP-Mg exhibited a higher gas accumulation at 2 weeks after implantation. Histological examination and sequential fluorochrome labelling analysis showed both ZX00 and XHP-Mg implants can support osseointegration as well as osteogen-esis better than Ti implants (Fig.1). In vivo degradation of both implant types have no impact on spleen, liver, and kidney tissues. These findings suggest that Mg-based implants are superior for new bone tissue formation and in-growth in comparison to Ti implants. BASIC SCIENCE OP-3 Does telescopic rodding affect residual growth of Natalia Russian Federation Introduction: Telescopic rodding is applied in children affected with bone fragility such as osteogenesis imper - fecta. The aim of this experimental study was to assess residual growth of tibia after transphyseal rodding. Material and methods: Intramedullary rodding was done in a series of 6 puppies (age of 5 months). Antegrade insertion without reaming medullary canal was applied. Titanium telescopic rod of 4.2 mm diameter for right tibia was used in all cases. The animals have been observed till the end of natural growth (radiological growth plate fusion at the age of 12 months). Radiologic assessment in com-parison to left intact tibia included length of tibia, joint angles (MPTA, LDTA, PPTA, ADTA). Amount of rod elongation was measured as well. Results: Only in one case a loss (8 mm or 4.8%) of resid- ual growth was noted. In all other animals the tibial length discrepancy was less than 2 mm. Posteriorly deviated positioning of male rod from midpoint in the distal epiph-ysis due to natural slight recurvatum shape of dog's shaft caused angulation while growing: anterior distal tibial angle and lateral distal tibial angle increased significantly. Average amount of rod elongation was 11.3 mm. We found no rod migration neither pulling out of the physis or nontelescoping. Conclusion: Titaneum telescopic rodding represents low risks growth disturbance. In order to prevent angula- tions, telescopic systems should be positioned maximally close to the center of physes. Titanium telescopic rods are not prone to failure to telescopeBASIC SCIENCE OP-4 Early outcome of ex-vivo gene therapy for hip dysplasia in Mucopolysaccharidosis type Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy 2\"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy 3Radiology Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy 4Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy 5San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Therapy (SR-TIGET), San San Raffaele University, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University; Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy Introduction and Objectives: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I Hurler (MPSIH) is a multisystemic disorder due to alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene mutation causing gly-cosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-gene therapy (GT) on hip dysplasia (HD) was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Eight MPSIH patients (6 M; 2 F) were treated with autologous HSCs genetically modi- fied to express human phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03488394, EudraCT 2017-002430-23). Median age at treatment was 22 months (range, 14-34). Primary end-point of efficacy was blood IDUA at 12 months post-GT. HD was evaluated in 14 hips using Acetabular Index (AI) and Migration Percentage (MP) on X-Rays and MRIs at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36 months post-GT with a median fol-low-up of 37.15 months (range, 29.5-46.7). Cartilaginous Acetabular Index (CAI) and Cartilaginous Migration Percentage (CMP) were evaluated on MRI. No conserva-tive orthopedic treatment for HD was performed. Results: All patients showed sustained engraftment of gene-corrected cells with supraphysiologic blood IDUA activity and normal or near-normal urinary GAG excre-tion. One patient was excluded from the analysis for bilat-eral hip dislocation which was already present before GT. 14 hips (7 patients) were analyzed. On X-Ray mean AI was 28.1\u00b0 at baseline HD. Conclusions: MPSIH patients post-GT showed progres- sion of HD only in 1/14 hips after a median follow-up of 37.15 months. A longer follow-up is needed. BASIC SCIENCE OP-5 Effect of K-wire Holes on Torsional Strength of Ovine Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Bursa, Turkey 2Bursa Technical University, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Bursa, Turkey Introduction and Objective: To analyze the effect of multipl drill holes caused by unsuccessful K-wire place-ment attempts in a simulated lizarov configuration. Materials and Methods: 114 tibia of 57 sheep were used. One tibia of each animal was used for intervention whereas the other tibia served as the control. In Group I, 2 1.8 mm K-wires were placed at 90\u00b0 according to lizarov princi-ples. In Group II, the second K-wire was removed to simu-late a misplaced wire and re-inserted at 15\u00b0 increment, resulting in a tibia with 2-K wires at 105\u00b0 and 2 empty holes. The removal and re-insertion of K-wire at 15\u00b0 incre-ments was repeated to create Group III (120\u00b0 and 4 empty holes) and Group IV (135\u00b0 and 6 empty holes) till intersec-tion angle reached 135\u00b0. Torsinal strength of tibias were analyzed using computer controlled torsion testing device following removal of all K wires. The resultant fracture patterns, degree of rotation, maximum torque (Nm) and time elapsed till fracture were noted. The loss of torsional strength compared to control tibia of each animal, and the difference between intervention groups were evaluated. Results: There was significant reduction in maximum torque, degree of rotation and time to fracture in all groups compared to controls (p < 0,01). The loss of biomechanical strength was most evident in Groups III and IV . Maximum torque, degree of rotation and time to fracture were %48, %45,9 and %51,6 of the control tibia in Group III and 42.1%, %38.3% and %50.7% in Group IV . Tibias in Group IV were fractured at significantly lower degrees of rotation and maximum torque compared to Group I and II (p < 0,01).Conclusions: Additional K-wire holes simulating unsuc- cesful placement attempts cause a significant reduction in torsional strength of the bone even with small diameter K-wires. BASIC SCIENCE OP-6 The Influence Of Transepiphyseal Implantation Of Biodegradable ZX00 Screws On The Physis Of Juvenile Sheep - Comparison Of Different Surgery Techniques Romy Marek Background: The use of bioresorbable implants reveals new opportunities for the pediatric field, especially for the treatment of physeal fractures. Previous results showed that transphyseally implanted Mg-Zn-Ca (ZX00)-screws broke several weeks after implantation, without interven-ing with bone growth. The possibility to perform fracture stabilization through the physis could optimize the surgery technique. Yet, a screw breakage before fracture consoli-dation must be avoided to guarantee sufficient stabiliza-tion. Thus, two different surgery techniques with different expected time points of screw breakage, as well as their influence on longitudinal bone growth were investigated in this study. Objectives: The aim of this project was to investigate the influence of the transepiphyseally implanted ZX00-screws on the longitudinal bone growth. Additionally, we exam-ined the time points of the intended screw breakage in rela-tion to the implantation technique. Material and Methods: A total of 33 juvenile sheep was used for this study. We performed monocortical or bicorti-cal transepiphyseal implantation of a ZX00-screw Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) proximal tibia. The contralateral leg was operated similary with a titanium (Ti)-screw or left empty as a control. We performed in vivo clinical computed tomography (CT) on 11 sheep up to 24 weeks after implantation to assess the bone growth over time. On the remaining sheep we per - formed ex vivo micro-CTs after 6, 12 or 24 weeks to inves-tigate implant integrity and the leg lengths of the animals. Results and Conclusion: This study showed that bicorti- cally implanted screws broke earlier when compared to monocortical screws. After 24 weeks Ti-legs were 7 \u00b1 3 mm shorter when compared to the contralateral ZX00-legs after bicortical implantation. Importantly, we found no influence on longitudinal growth after implantation of ZX00-screws, regardless of the implantation technique. Therefore, ZX00 appears to be a promising implant material for the treatment of physeal fractures using both, mono- or bicortical implantation technique. BEST OF LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY OP-7 A multicenter cohort study of complications and risk factors in intramedullary bone lengthening nails Markus Orthopaedic Nationwide Hospital, Ohio, United States 3Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark Introduction and Objective: Lower extremity distraction osteogenesis with external fixation has been reported to have 1-3 complications per patient. Wires/pins traversing the soft tissue enveloped have been suspected to be a significant source of complications. The all-inside design of the intra-medullary lengthening nails, therefore, raised the expecta-tion of a complication reduction. However, the current knowledge of complications and risk factors are limited in these nails. The study's objective was to examine the compli-cations and complication risk factors in lower limb bone lengthening with the FITBONE and the PRECICE nail. Materials and Methods: A chart review from two limb lengthening hospitals was performed on patients with internal lengthening nails in the lower extremity. Only patients that had completed nail removal of the FITBONE or PRECICE nail after treatment were included. Data on nail information, complications, and patient demographics were collected. Lengthening segments were assessed for complication as (no/yes). A model was constructed with directed acyclic graphs for the evaluation of complication risk factors using modified Poisson regression (relative risk (RR)). Results: 269 complications were identified in the 257 patients (314 segments). Complications per patient ranged from 0-5(median 1). 56 % of patients encountered a com-plication. The most frequent origins of complications were device-related, joint, and bone (Table 1). The adjusted RR of complication of selected factors is presented in Table 2. Conclusions: Complications in intramedullary lengthen- ing nails should be expected in half of the patients. Special attention during treatment should be paid to the device and joint since these are the most frequent origins of complications. Compared to the femur, the tibia showed a 59 % increased risk of complication, and age groups from 30 years and upwards showed an approxi-mately double risk of complication compared to the 10-19 years group.

CNNs were trained and validated with pediatric standing lower limb radiographs. Results were compared to manual measurements performed by orthopaedic surgery fellows. Results: CNNs combined with mathematical algorithms to find anatomical landmarks were used to extract mechan- ical axis parameters (mLFDA and mMPTA). Initial results compared favourably with those measured by orthopaedic surgery fellows. mLFDA measurements showed mean dif-ference of -0.08 degrees with a standard deviation of 1.02 degrees. mMPTA measurements showed mean difference of -3.25 degrees and a standard deviation of 3.06 degrees. Mechanical axis deviations (MAD) measured with a mean difference of 1.37 mm and a standard deviation of 5.15 mm. Full axis measurements take 2-3 seconds per radio-graph on consumer grade laptop computer. Conclusions: CNNs are promising approach to automating commonly performed, repetitive tasks, especially pertain- ing to image processing. The time savings are significant in clinical research applications where large sets of radio-graphs are routinely available and require analysis. With further development of these algorithms, we anticipate significantly improved agreement with expert-measured results and calculation speed. BEST OF LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY OP-9 The Perils of Sleeper Plates in Multiple Hereditary Exostosis: Retrospective Cohort Demonstrates 100% Rate of Tibial Overcorrection due to Bony Exostosis Tethering Widmann1, Emily Dodwell1 1Hospital for Special Surgery, New York City, United States Introduction and Objective: Hemiepiphysiodesis is the mainstay treatment for angular knee deformities in chil-dren with MHE. Upon correction, the metaphysesal screw may be removed in the sleeper plate technique, with a plan to re-implant the screw when the anticipated deformity recurs. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of sleeper plate complications in the MHE population. Materials and Methods: Patients under 18 with MHE who underwent hemiepiphysiodesis of the knee between February 1, 2016, and September 15, 2022 with minimum 2 year follow up were identified via billing codes. Patient charts and radiographic images were reviewed to assess for the bone(s) treated, number of guided growth plates converted to sleeper plates and whether any complication occurred, including overcorrection from bony ingrowth at the empty holes. Results: In 10 patients, 15 limbs with 26 hemiepiphysiode- sis sites, 11 distal femoral and 15 proximal tibial, were included. Of the 26 plates, 15 were removed upon deformity correction and 2 did not require removal due to physeal clo-sure at maturity. 4 of 11 femoral plates and 5 of 15 tibial plates were left as sleeper plates, with the metaphyseal screws removed. All 5 tibial plates (100%) devel-oped bony ingrowth into the empty metaphyseal screw hole (Figure) which led to unintended progressive deformity. Removal of tibial sleeper plates was supplemented with cor - rective surgery in 4 of 5 overcorrected knees, specifically removal of exophytic bone/bar and hemiepiphysiodesis on the contralateral side of the Conclusions: 100% of tibial sleeper plates hole. This bony ingrowth functions as a tether, like a screw, resulting in progressive angular deformity. Sleeper plates should be avoided at the proximal tibia in MHE patients, and extreme caution should be exercised when considering this technique at the femur.

A large variety of surgical procedures have been developed with an average rate of union without refracture of 50 %. This study evaluated the first 8 patients suffering from CPT pri-marily treated by Cross-Union (X-Union) protocol in our institution. Materials and Methods: Eight patients (5 male) with an average age of 2.7 years with CPT were included (Table 1). All patients were operated on between 2020-2021 by a single surgeon. The X-Union technique described by Paley (intramedullary and plate fixation, bone grafting, zoledronic acid infusion and bone morphogenetic protein 2 insertion) were used. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 24 months (Table 1).

From 6 months after surgery, we let patients do all activities with-out restrictions. In 2 patients the distal fixation wire of Fassier-Duval (FD) rod had to be replaced because it was passing through the metaphysis of the tibia on the lateral side. We did this during the plate removal surgery. We did not observe any perioperative complications or refractures during the follow up period (Figure 1).safe, providing 100 % healing of pseudoarthrosis with a low risk of complications. If the surgical technique is strictly followed, the method is very reproducible. It can be used at a very young age thus preventing secondary changes. The results are very promising and seem to dra-matically change the prognosis of this complex disease.

Despite the actual progress, little has been changed in regenerate biological enhance-ment. Venting the femoral intramedullary canal at the oste-otomy site creates egress for bone marrow (BM) during reaming. This BM exit the vent holes and acts as preposi-tioned bone graft at the distraction gap. Our objective was to study the effectiveness of BM on bone regenerate quality and to compare its influence on regenerate consolidation time with and without venting procedure before reaming. Materials and Methods: Medical records from January 2013 to December 2021 were reviewed to collect data on the femoral lengthening procedure using a PRECICE\u00ae intramedullary nail (IMN) with or without venting proce-dure before reaming. The outcome was evaluated based on bone healing, time to achieve full weight-bearing, and complications. Results: A total of 63 femoral lengthening procedures were included in the study (39M/24F); 2 Patients were excluded due to hardware failure during distraction. The final study group's average age was 18 y/o (11.5 - 42). The mean lengthening was 55mm (40-80mm) in the Venting group and 45mm (25-80mm) in the Non-Venting group. The mean healing index (HI) was 21 d/cm (11.6-36.2) in the Venting group and 30.85 d/cm (12.5-137) in the Non-Venting group. The Venting group achieved full weight-bearing earlier than the Non-Venting group, 3.6 months (1.7 to 6.4) versus 4.4 months (1.5 to 8.6), respectively. Conclusions :Ventilation procedure before reaming in IMN lengthening nails improves regenerate consolidation Conclusions: Only a few papers on this method have been published so far, most of them by Paley himself. The X-Union technique is very technically demanding, but 28 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) time significantly and allow patients earlier full weight bearing. Further research should be done to find the cor - relation between the number of venting holes and the improvement of the healing index and consolidation time.

The objective is to conduct an international field test study. Material and methods: A mixed method multiphase approach was used to develop LIMB-Q Kids. In phase 1, a systematic review was conducted to identify concepts from existing PROMs used in research with children with LLDs. A preliminary conceptual framework derived from the systematic review informed an international qualitative study. The data from qualitative interviews were used to form the LIMB-Q Kids, which was further refined through multiple rounds of cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs) with children. Input was obtained from parents and health-care professionals from Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, India, UK, and the USA. LIMB-Q Kids was translated and cul-turally adapted (TCA) into multiple languages. Results: The final field-test version consists of 11 scales (159 items) that measure appearance, physical function, symptoms (hip, knee, ankle, foot, and leg), leg-related dis-tress, and school, social and psychological function. This version was rigorously translated into Danish and German. Translations that are in progress include Arabic, Finnish, Hindi, Swahili, Portuguese, Spanish, and Luganda. An international field-test study is underway in 9 countries (15 sites with a target recruitment of 150 participants per coun-try). 150 patients from 5 sites have completed LIMB-Q Kids. A preliminary analysis of the available data using Rasch Measurement Theory analysis provided evidence that the scales in the LIMB-Q Kids work as hypothesized. Conclusions: No internationally applicable PROM exists for children with LLDs. Data from the international field- test study is used to reduce items and perform psychomet-ric testing of LIMB-Q Kids. The rigorous TCA process provided versions of LIMB-Q Kids in different languages. Once completed, the LIMB-Q Kids will provide a com-mon metric for outcome assessment for children with lower limb differences internationally. BEST OF SPINE OP-13 Night-time detorsion Paris, France Introduction and objective: Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) represents a therapeutic challenge, impacting trunk growth and rib cage development. Although several surgical tech-niques have gained popularity in the last decade, bracing remains the gold standard conservative treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of night-time brace in idiopathic EOS patients followed until maturity. Materials and methods: 76 idiopathic EOS patients treated with night-time (8h/night) detorsion brace were EPOS Abstract Book 29 included and followed until skeletal maturity. 3D spinal and trunk reconstructions (EOS stereoradiography) were performed every year during follow-up. Pulmonary func-tion tests (PFT) and functional scores were assessed at maturity (minimum 1 year after brace stop) and compared to the values of a healthy control cohort. Results: Brace was successful for 24 patients, and for 15 patients the Cobb evolution was > 5\u00b0 but no surgery was required. 51% of the EOS cohort didn't required surgery. Mean main Cobb among unoperated patients was 21\u00b0 (\u00b1 9\u00b0) at diagnosis, 19\u00b0 (\u00b1 the brace and 22\u00b0 (\u00b1 11\u00b0) at latest follow-up. 37 patients (49%) under - went spinal fusion. Among these patients, mean main Cobb at diagnosis was 31\u00b0 (\u00b1 13\u00b0) and 66\u00b0 (\u00b1 18\u00b0) at the time of surgery. There was no significant difference regarding the average trunk heigth (assessed by the T1-T12 distance) between operated and non operated patients at latest follow-up. 56% of patients with initial Cobb < 20\u00b0 were in the successful group, while 70% of patients with initial Cobb > 30\u00b0 needed surgery. There was no significant difference between mature EOS and healthy patients regarding rib cage volume, PFT's and EOSQ-24 scores. Conclusion: Night-time detorsion brace remains a reason- able and well accepted option for idiopathic EOS patients, that can help avoiding surgery if started early.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate pain and HRQoL in surgi-cally managed patients with a minimum follow-up of 10 years compared with patients with untreated AIS and a healthy control group. Materials and methods: 64 consecutive patients, mini- mum follow-up 10 years (mean 12.1), who underwent posterior pedicle screw instrumentation for AIS by a sin-gle orthopedic surgeon were prospectively enrolled. 51 (80%, 8 boys, mean age at FFU 27.0 [2.0] years) patients completed Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-24 question-naires, underwent clinical examination and standing spi-nal radiographs. Data on reoperations were collected. Pain and HRQL were compared with those of 51 age and sex-matched patients with untreated AIS (mean major curve 32 [13 ] at skeletal maturity, mean age 26.4 [4.2] years at FFU) and 51 healthy controls (mean age at FFU 27.6 [6.1] years). Results: Mean (SD) major curve was 57 (8.4) degrees preoperatively and 15 (6.3) degrees at FFU. Two (3.9%) re-operations were needed. The SRS-24 pain, self-image, function and activity remained at high level from pre-operative to 10-year follow-up (p > 0.10 for all changes). Pain, general activity and total scores were significantly better at 10-year follow-up in the surgically treated patients as compared with untreated patients (p0.05 for all) (Table 1). In contrast untreated patients had better function scores (p = 0.024). Healthy controls had significantly higher score than surgically treated at FFU. Conclusions: Patients undergoing segmental pedicle screw instrumentation for AIS maintain high level HRQoL during 10-year follow-up. Their HRQoL was significantly better than in untreated AIS, except for function domain.30 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) BEST OF SPINE OP-98 Can fusion surgery for AIS be prevented by means of growth modulation? Results after anterior Vertebral Body Tethering vertebral body tethering (aVBT) has been introduced for the treatment of immature patients with AIS. However, it is still unclear if fusion surgery can be prevented by means of spinal growth modulation. Purpose: To present the results with aVBT in patients with follow-up until skeletal maturity. Material and methods: Single center retrospective study. Inclusion criteria: Immature patients (Risser < 2, Sanders 5) treated with aVBT for AIS with follow-up until skele-tal maturity (Risser 5, or Sanders 7b). Success of treatment was defined as Cobb angle < 50\u00b0 at latest follow-up. Results: The study group comprised 16 patients with 17 curves. Mean age at surgery was 13,5 yrs (range 11,5-14,5 yrs). Mean follow-up was 2,5 yrs (range 2-4 yrs). Main scoliosis curve angle before surgery was 47,7\u00b0 (range 29-64\u00b0) and was reduced to 20,5\u00b0 (range 3-40\u00b0) immediately after surgery and measured 32,8\u00b0 (range -6-58\u00b0) at latest follow-up. At latest follow-up fusion surgery was prevented in 11 patients (75%) showing curves < 50\u00b0 with well-balanced spine. Curve worsening beyond 50\u00b0 was observed in 4 patients (25%). In those patients spinal fusion was indicated. Only 1 (6%) of the patients presenting with bone age Sanders stage 4 at initial surgery needed fusion at latest follow-up. Of 7 patients presenting with Sanders stage 5 at initial surgery fusion was indicated in 4 (57%). Rupture of the flexible tether was observed in 8 patients (50%) with need of revision surgery in 1 (6%). Conclusion: Spinal fusion can be avoided in 75% of the immature AIS patients using aVBT, provided that the surgery is performed at or before \"adolescent rapid\" phase of pubertal growth corresponding to Sanders stage 4. Surgery at or beyond \"adolescent steady\" phase (corre-sponding to Sanders stage 5) carries a risk for further curve worsening and need for definitive spinal fusion of over 50%. BEST OF SPINE OP-16 Incidence and risk factors for opioid use disorder after spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis United States Introduction: Post-operative pain management following spinal fusion (SF) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) typically involves opioids. Given that postoperative analgesic prescriptions have been associated with opioid use disorders (OUD), we sought to describe risk factors for OUD following SF for AIS. Methods: We identified patients ages 10-18 undergoing primary SF for AIS between 2007-2015 in an administra- tive claims database containing data from inpatient and outpatient admission data across the United States. Demographic variables and prescription patterns (in mor - phine milligram equivalents [MMEs]) were analyzed to determine any potential association with new diagnoses of OUD in the 1 year following SF. Results: We identified 5,366 operative AIS cases (75.4% Female, 24.6% Male), of which 120 patients (2.2%) developed an OUD. Patients were prescribed on average 597.5 (+/- 601.9) total MME and 62 (+/- 47.1) MME/day post-operatively. Our multivariable model demonstrated no association of opioid prescription characteristics with the subsequent development of OUD within one year of SF.

Also patients whose operations included ponte osteotomies had increased odds of OUD (OR = 1.76; CI 1.14-2.74; p = 0.011). Conclusion: Populations at higher risk for OUD after PSF for AIS are those with concomitant Spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis, those with preexisting prescrip-tions for certain psychiatric medications as well as those whose operations included Ponte osteotomies, which may be an indicator of larger more severe curves. Variability in opioid prescribing did not demonstrate association with subsequent risk of development of OUD in this model BEST OF SPINE OP-17 Controlling the progression of curvature in children and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis following the administration of Melatonin, Calcium, and Ulici 1, Alexandru Herdea1 Department, \"Carol Davila\" Bucuresti, Romania Introduction and Objective: Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) affects a severe number of children. Their quality of life and development are also disturbed. Given the critical role that vitamin D, calcium, and melatonin may play in both the onset and the development of children and ado-lescent IS, this novel study aims to verify whether the administration of melatonin, vitamin D, and calcium sup-plements to patients diagnosed with IS, having a Risser score of 0-3, will slow down or stop the progression of the curvatures. Materials and Methods: In this perspective, randomized, case-control, interventional study, the impact of using mel-atonin, calcium, and vitamin D, respectively, on IS patients was analyzed. Every odd-numbered patient went into the study group, while the even-numbered patient went into the control group. Initially, when enrolling in the study, both groups did all three blood samples (vitamin D, cal-cium, melatonin) then, at six months and one year, only the study group repeated the tests as seen in Figure 1. Study group received Melatonin 1.5 mg/daily, Calcium 600 mg/daily and Vitamin D 2000 UI/daily. Recovery treatment was done using physiotherapy, while a Cobb angle of over 30 \u00b0 would also involve wearing a brace. Results: A total of 51 patients met the required criteria (26 in the study group and 25 in the control group). Stagnation of the disease was observed in the study group compared with the evolution of the disease in the control group (p = 6.81\u00d7106). The results were statistically sig- nificant (p = 6.85\u00d7105), showing an improvement for those who managed to correct their vitamin D deficiency. Conclusions: Our preliminary results showed that these drugs positively affected the illness progression quantified by the spine curvature. Low vitamin D levels can predict a significant increase in Cobb angle. Patients with IS may benefit by supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, and melatonin. 32 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) BEST OF SPINE OP-102 Medical Issues Complicate 90 Day Return to the ED after Spinal Deformity Surgery: A Review of New Hyde Park, United States Introduction: Return to hospital after surgery is frequently used as a quality metric. We aimed to evaluate risk factors for ED visits wihtin 90 days of spinal deformity surgery. Design: Ambispective Review of spinal deformity surgeries between 2011-2018. Radiographic, operative, and hospital stay data were collected and presented as median and interquartile ranges (IQR) and counts and frequencies if categorical. Wilcoxon-Signed Rank was used to analyze categorical data while Kruskal-Wallis tests analyzed continuous met-rics. ED visits were categorized as medical and surgical. Medical visits included, but were not limited to, fever, pain, and seizures. Surgical visits included, but were not limited to, wound and surgical site infection. Results: 346 patients were included: 274 idiopathic scoliosis, 48 neuromuscular, 10 Scheurmann's kyphosis, 3 spondylolisthesis (grade 4), and 11 other. 41 patients (11.8%) returned to ED within 90 days. 32 (78%) returned with medical-related complaints: pain (n = 14), fever (n = 6), constipation (n = 4), spasm/seizures (n = 2), syn-cope (n = 3), fall (n = 1) and dysnea (n = 2). 9(22%) returned with surgical-related complaints: drainage from incision (n = 6), wound infection (n = 2), and baclofen pump failure (n = 1). 65.8% (n = 27) returned to ED within 30 days. There was no significant difference in age (13.19 vs 12.42 years, p = 0.27), BMI (18.27 vs 17.13, p = 0.33) pre- (47.30 vs 46.0, p = 0.731), preoperative kyphosis (16 vs 17, p = 0.971), and levels fused (10 vs 11, = 0.359) between those did not return to the ED and those who did. Blood loss (300 vs 350ml, p = 0.973), surgical time (230 vs 228, p = 0.180), and length of stay (4 vs 4, p = 0.94) were also similar between the two cohorts. Neuromuscular distribution was also similar (12.8% vs 21.9%). Conclusion: 11.8% of patients returned to ED within 90 days mostly with medical complaints - more than half by 30 days. Although no risk factors were found in this study, the findings present an opportunity to better improve dis-charge planning and care coordination.LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 1 OP-31 Optimizing Femoral Version Measurements in Pediatrics: Inter- and Intra-Rater Reliability Support the Method of Lee and Posterior Condylar Axis to measure Femoral 1Hospital for Special Surgery, New York City, United States Introduction and Objective: There are many described proximal and two distal femoral landmarks to measure femoral version. The primary aim of this study was to determine the inter and intra-rater reliability of different femoral version measurement techniques in pediatric patients. The secondary aim was to determine the resultant difference in femoral version between different combina-tions of proximal and distal techniques. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 25 patients under the age of 18 with CT version studies between 7/20/2016 and 7/20/2022 were included. Patients with femoral nails, skeletal dysplasia or other severe ana-tomic variants were excluded. Femoral version was mea-sured (Figure) according to 5 described proximal femoral techniques, Lee, Reikeras, Tomczak, Murphy, distal posterior con-dylar axis (PCA) and epicondylar axis (EA) by 5 raters - 2 fellowship trained pediatric orthopedic surgeons, 2 pedi-atric orthopedic research fellows and 1 senior resident. Repeat measures were made at a one month after initial measurement for intra-rater reliability. Inter and intra-rater reliability were calculated with two-way random and two-way mixed effects models for absolute agreement, respec-tively. The mean resultant version for each combination of techniques was calculated and reported with standard deviations. Results: Mean age at imaging was 14.1\u00b13.3 years. The inter- and intra-rater ICCs and resultant mean version are reported (Table) and demonstrate that the Lee/PCA meth-ods are the most reliable and repeatable. Using the Lee/PCA methods, average femoral version was 14.7\u00b111.1\u00b0. The smallest measured mean femoral ver - sion was 10.7\u00b111.8\u00b0 with the Lee/EA technique and great-est was 29.4\u00b0\u00b112\u00b0 with the Murphy/PCA technique. There was up to 18.7\u00b116.8\u00b0 of difference in measured version depending on techniques used. Conclusions: Femoral version measurements may vary by 18.7\u00b0 depending on technique. The Lee/PCA methods are the most reliable.

In bigger children with CKD, after walking age, we can't perform closed reduction so often and, as such, we need more aggressive surgical options. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe a series of 8 cases of CKD treated with open reduction by means of Judet's quadricepsplasty associated with a femoral short-ening osteotomy when needed, describing the surgical technique as well. Methods: Retrospective review of all cases of CKD diag- nosed and treated after walking age, in the context of humanitarian missions in a West-African country. Inclusion criteria were age under 16 at time of surgery and a mini-mum follow-up of one year. We included 8 patients (10 knees). All patients were operated betwen 2018, 2019, 2020 by means of an open reduction, soft tissue release, Judet's quadricepsplasty and a femoral shortening osteotomy. A long leg cast was main-tained for 2 months, followed by a rehabilitation protocol. Intra and post-op complications were registered. Results: All patients presented quadriceps atrophy and walked without external support. We arded femoral short- ening osteotomy in 6 cases. Mean follow-up 14 months. Mean post-op ROM was 0-40\u00ba flexo extensi\u00f3n. All patients achieved walking ability in full knee extension. All patients presented wound dehiscence: six were low grade with closure by secondary intention, and two presented skin necrosis with need of skin graft. No neuro-vascular or infectious complications were registered, nor instability.Conclusion: CKD represents a surgical challenge in the developing countries, due to high grade deformities. Our technique showed good functional results, although skin complications are highly frequent. The association of femoral shortening can help to reduce this risk. LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 1 OP-21 When correcting leg length discrepancy of 2-5 cm in children aged 8-16 years by means of proximal tibial Germany., Munester, Germany 2Pediatric Orthopaedics, Deformity Muenster, Munester, Germany 3General Orthopaedics and Muenster, Germany 4Pediatric Orthopaedics, Deformity Reconstruction and Foot Surgery, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany Introduction and Objective: There is lack of evidence to assess the need for proximal fibular epiphysiodesis (PFE) when conducting treat leg length discrepancy (LLD). This study analyses the results of PTE conducted with and without PFE in the light of a new standard radiographic reference for proxi-mal fibular height. Materials and Methods: To define the physiological position of the proximal fibula 500 long standing radio-graphs of 256 children (8-16 years) with physiological limb alignment were retrospectively analyzed. The dis-tance between the center of the proximal tibial growth EPOS Abstract Book 35 plate and a line tangential to the tip of the fibular head and horizontal to the imaging plane (dPTFH) was mea-sured (Figure1). Subsequently, in patients treated with temporary PFE (n = 27) and without temporary PFE (n = 31) concomitant to temporary PTE (mean preopera- tive LLD = 2.8cm, mean mean follow-up: 36 months) dPTFH was retrospectively measured before and after treatment. Results: On average the tip of the proximal fibula is local- ized 3 mm distal to the center of the proximal tibial growth plate (SD = 3mm, CI -3.0--2.5) and dPTFH was normally distributed (p = 0.1). No relevant sex or age-dependent differences were observed, and inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.88; CI 0.77-0.93). In the cohort treated for LLD dPTFH remained within physiological range in 21/26 PFE and in (70%) without PFE. Mild and clinically irrelevant proximal fibular over - growth newly developed in 2/26 patients (8%) with PFE and in = 0.431). Conclusion: Radiographic references such as dPTFH should be considered to detect shortening or overgrowth of the proximal fibula. Proximal fibular growth is reduced compared to its physiological growth rate even when PTE is conducted without PFE. We do not routinely perform temporary PFE concomitantly with temporary PTE when preoperatively dPTFH is within physiological range. LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 1 OP-22 Is postponed tibial lengthening justified in Serbia In children with Paley types 3 and 4 of Fibular Hemimelia (FH) the SUPERankle procedure demonstrates good excellent outcomes and can be combined with lengthen-ing. Reconstruction is indicated between 18 and 24 months of age where families are often refuse external frame. We analyzed results in patients where lengthening was postponed. Materials and methods: This retrospective series included 12 children with type 3 and 4 of FH. The index alignment procedure and foot reconstruction with internal osteosyn-thesis were performed at the age of 16-24 months, length-ening with external frame postponed to the age 3-6 years.Results: Index surgery enabled alignment of tibia, addressed foot deformities and allowed walking with the foot in plantigrade position. Average postoperative By the lengthening stage good results maintained in 10 patients. In one boy (3C) we noticed severe equinus position of the foot with TTA 123\u00b0 and TCA 148\u00b0. In another case (3C) relapse of deformity (TTA 140\u00b0 and TCA 142\u00b0) occured. We sup-pose that insufficient amount of tibial shortening caused deformity relapse. In lengthening procedures average amount of lengthening was 7.4\u00b12.4cm(47.2\u00b117.9%), healing index 22\u00b13.2d/cm. There was one fracture after frame removal. In the case of equinus position relapse, the lengthening was associated with progressive correction of foot position. In another case of hindfoot deformity relapse, an additional calcaneus osteotomy and progressive correction with external frame was performed but a good ankle function is not expected. Conclusion: Alignment and foot reconstruction in chil- dren (aged 18-14 months) with severe FH followed by 36 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) lengthening in further age is justified in parents' insistence. Nevertheless we strongly recommend to associated recon-struction and lengthening within first treatment stage and to apply external fixator in type 3C where a significant shortening tibial osteotomy is required. LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 1 OP-23 No bony changes at the telescopic and Objectives: Motorised lengthening nails are the treatment standard for bone lengthening of the lower limbs. However, bony changes namely osteolysis and periosteal hypertrophy have been described after certain type of magnetically driven lengthening nails. The aim of the present study was to report the radiological bone abnormalities of electric-driven FITBONE TAA lengthening nails at least one year after the implantation. Materials and Methods: Single-centre retrospective case series of patients treated with a FITBONE TAA lengthen-ing nail with a minimum follow-up of 1 year after implan-tation. Standard orthogonal radiographs were obtained postoperatively, weekly during the distraction phase, and then monthly for 6 months, and before removal of the equipment. We looked for bone abnormalities at the tele-scoping section of the nail before removal. Results: In total, 101 patients (58 males, 43 females) with a mean age of 21 years (range: 11.8 - 53.5) had 128 (104 femoral and 27 tibial) limb lengthening nails implanted between 2010 and 2021. The mean follow-up period was 925 days (range: 371 - 3587). The mean lengthening was 4.7 cm (range: 1.5 - 8.7). No bones exhibited focal osteoly-sis or periosteal reactions at the junction of the lengthening nail. Cortical hypertrophy around the single diaphyseal locking screw was observed in 79% (101/128) of the cases. Conclusions: No focal osteolysis or periosteal reactions at the bone surrounding the junction of 128 FITBONEs was observed. Cortical hypertrophy was observed in the major - ity of FITBONE TAA nails at the single locking screw. LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 1 OP-24 The use of the distal radius ulna classification system in predicting final limb length - a user friendly methodLok Wah Noah So1, Siu Him Janus Wong2, Evelyn E Kuong1, Prudence Cheung2, Pui Yin Jason Cheung2, Kai Tsun Michael To2, Wang Chow1 1Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, China 2The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China Introduction and objective: Accurately predicting final limb length discrepancy (LLD) is crucial in the treatment of leg length discrepancies. Current models utilizing chrono-logical age are inferior to predictions using bone age. However, traditional bone age schemes are difficult to use in clinical setting. We investigated the usefulness of the dis-tal radius ulna (DRU) classification in predicting final limb length, which has been shown to be accurate in predicting peak growth and growth cessation in scoliosis patients. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who received epiphysiodesis for LLD between 2000-2018 with follow-up until skeletal maturity. X-rays of the non-operated femoral or tibial segments were reviewed. The segments were included if they were nor - mal or congenitally short. The segments were excluded if there was evidence of physeal insult or any pathology associated with inconstant growth inhibition rate. Linear regression was performed with prediction models for final limb segment length using the SPSS programme. DRU classification, chronological age, sex and present limb segment length were included as independent variables. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results: A total of 867 observations were made. The most significant predictor for final limb length in girls for both femora and tibiae is the distal radius classification, whereas that in boys was the distal ulnar classification. Sex and bone-specific prediction models for final limb segment length with the DRU classification were reasonably accu-rate in predicting final limb segment length (mean absolute difference 1.3+/-1.5cm). Conclusion: The DRU classification system is an accurate alternative in the prediction of final limb segment length. It is more user friendly than traditional bone age schemes and more applicable in the busy clinic setting. Compared with existing models, it can enhance accuracy since it inte-grates the concept of skeletal maturity. LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 2 OP-25 Role of proximal tibiofibular fixation in leg lengthening with (TFJ) transfixion during Ilizarov tibial lengthening is still debated in the literature. The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact on patient outcome. Methods: All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from 1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients) submit-ted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B TFJ transfixion. [Figure 1] Results: Patients were homogeneously divided as [Table 1]. A statistically significant difference in proxi-mal fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients was observed, with mean PFM of 9.2 mm (range 1 -20 mm) and of 21 mm (range 2.7- 76 mm)in Group A and in Group B, respectively. However, there are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological parameters [Table 2 and 3] and in functional and quality of life scores.One patient in group B, with PFMof 76 mm at the end of treatment, developed valgus deviation and sub-luxation of the knee. Reviewing his x-rays, an early fibula consolidation was detected in the early stages of lengthen-ing. PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and stability. Conclusion: There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of prox-imal TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of the fibular osteotomy. Our data suggest that lengthening percentages between 50% and 55% of the initial segment induced distraction forces that could cause a distal migration of the fibular head up to 5 cm with-out clinical complications affecting knee function. 38 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Table 1.

There is a lack of studies that have assessed the influence of epiphysiodesis on the cen-tral knee joint anatomy. The goal of the study is to define new radiographic refences for the central knee joint anat-omy in skeletally immature patients. Materials and Methods: 503 calibrated long standing anteroposterior radiographs of 254 children aged 8-16 years with leg length discrepancy < 1 cm and mechanical axis deviation < 2 cm were retrospectively analyzed during the study period (2011-2020). Four specific radiographic parameters were assessed: femoral floor angle, roof angle, width of femoral physis, and femoral notch-intercon-dylar distance. Parameters were analyzed in different age groups (8-10 years, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16) and by sex.Results: The median age of the study cohort was 13 years (min.-max. 8-16 years), and normal distribution was observed for all four measurement parameters (figure 1). The mean femo-ral floor angle was 142\u00b0 (SD 6, CI 142 to 143), mean tibial roof angle was 144\u00b0 (SD 5, CI 144 to 145), the mean width at femo-ral physis was 73 mm (SD 8, CI 72 to 74) and mean femoral notch-intercondylar distance was 8 mm (SD 5, CI 7.5 to 8.3) (figure1). There were no clinically relevant age and gender dependent differences. ICC values for two observers were excellent for all measured parameters ranging from 0.70 to 0.96. Conclusion: This is the first description of standardized refer - ence values regarding the central and sagittal knee joint anat- omy in children. We suggest considering values within the margin of two standard deviations (SD) as physiological range. These parameters might help to identify secondary deformities during growth modulating treatment such as epiphysiodesis. 40 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) LOWER LIMB DEFORMITY 2 OP-27 The values School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey 2Department of Radiology, Ko\u00e7 University Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey 3Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ko\u00e7 University fied Insall-Salvati and Blackburne-Peel indexes are com-monly used indexes for evaluating the adult knee, however, the pediatric values of them and their reliability are not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the values and performance of these indexes for pediatric knees. Materials and Methods: Lateral radiographs of 127 knees (85 patients) of asymptomatic pediatric patients aged between 5-15 years old were divided into two age groups(5-10 and 10-15 years). Measurements of Caton, Insall-Salvati, Modified Insall-Salvati and Blackburne-Peel indexes were made by two researchers using GE PACS software. Interobserver reliability as well as the effect of the age on these indexes were investigated. Results: The mean values of these indexes for pediatric knee according to the age groups is shown in Table 1A-B. For 5-10-years age group, age and Caton, Modified Insall-Salvati and Insall Salvati-Indexes had a signifi-cantly negative correlation and Blackburne-Peel Index was positively correlated, however it was not significant. In the 10-15 years age group, all of the indexes were found to be negatively correlated with age however none of these correlations were significant. Age and Caton, Modified Insall-Salvati and Insall-Salvati indexes were found to have strong and significant negative correlation without the subgroup analysis. In the 10-15-years age group, interobserver reliability of Caton, Insall-Salvati indexes were excellent and good, respectively and Modified Insall- Salvati and Blackburne-Peel indexes were poor. In the 5-10-years age group interobserver reli-ability of Insall-Salvati index was good and Caton and Modified Insall-Salvati indexes were fair and however, Blackburne-Peel Index had poor interobserver reliability.(Table 2A-2B) Conclusion: For evaluation of patellar height in children, Caton and Insall-Salvati indexes may be more reliable than Blackburne-Peel index. Also, using the classic ver - sion of Insall-Salvati instead of the modification may be prudent. intraclass Correlation95% Confidence interval f test with true Value 0 lower bound upper bound Value df1 df2 sig Caton index ,767 ,649 index ,640 92 92 ,358 ,046 ,570 1,586 92 92 ,014* insall-salvati index ,637 ,150 ,818 3,893 92 92 <,001* Table 1A. age and index descriptive statistics.

The goal of this study was to determine if the resulting Zometa lines (Z-lines) could be used as radiographic markers to study growth in these patients. A retrospective review was performed for all patients with a diagnosis of unilateral CPT who underwent surgical reconstruction at a single institution from 2013-2022. Radiographs from the 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month postoperative visits were analyzed. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the measurement of Z-lines. Growth rates were calcu-lated for the distal femoral and proximal tibial growth plates, and the operative and non-operative rates were compared. Fifty-one patients were included in the final analysis. The ICC for Z-line measurement was excellent at 0.92 were consistently visible (over 75%); therefore, further analysis was limited to those physes. When comparing the operative to the nonoperative physes, the operative proxi-mal tibia had significantly higher growth rates at 3, 6, and 12 months (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0026, 0.0011).

Tolk 1, Sara Gargent3, Netherlands NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom 3Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom 4University College London, London, United Kingdom 5Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, United Kingdom Introduction: Hemi-epiphysiodesis is commonly used for lower extremity deformity correction in children. Nevertheless, rate of correction and the role of underlying skeletal pathology are not well understood. Our objective was to determine treatment success, correction rate (CR) and factors influencing CR for idiopathic and non-idio-pathic aetiologies. Methods: We analyzed 524 completed growth modula- tions (261 children, mean age 10.6 years [1.8-16.5]) using tension-band-plates. Before and at the end of growth modulation mMPTA, mLDFA and mechanical-axis- deviation were measured on standardized long-leg-radio-graphs. Treatment success and CR were analyzed stratified for etiology, and other factors influencing CR were ana-lyzed using regression modelling. Results: Hemi-epiphysiodesis was performed at (56.5%) and the proximal tibia in 228 (43.5%), in 191 cases (36.5%) both were addressed. Distribution according to underlying skeletal pathology is specified in table 1. A neutral mechanical axis was achieved in 73.9%. This was more often in idiopathic cases compared to non- idiopathic cases (76.6% vs 65.3% p = 0.030). The overall average CR of the was mLDFA 0.72(+/-0.57)\u00b0/month and for mMPTA 0.45(+/-0.41)\u00b0/month. Both femoral and tibial growth modulations showed significant differences in CR between etiologies (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively, Oneway-ANOV A). Lowest correction rates were observed for skeletal dysplasia patients and metabolic conditions (table 1). Multiple linear regression analysis, corrected for under - lying aetiology, showed that higher age at surgery was an independent predictor of lower CR both in the femoral and tibial corrections (p < 0.001), for femoral corrections varus deformity related to lower CR's (p = 0.006) Conclusions: Hemi-epiphysiodesis is an effective method of deformity correction, nevertheless incomplete correction Figure 1EPOS Abstract Book 43 Table 1. patient distribution and deformity correction rate according to underlying etiology.

Method: 72 patients (107 limbs) treated by eight-plate hemiepiphysiodesis technique around the knee joint were evaluated. After desired correction; only metaphyseal screw was removed (sleeper plate group) in 35 limbs (25 patients), while both screws and plate were removed (Plate removal group) in 72 limbs (47 patients).

Materials and Methods: Children with CP, aged 17-40 months, were recruited to participate in this IRB approved prospective longitudinal study. Dynamic foot posture was measured during walking by coronal plane pressure index (CPPI) and foot segment impulses from age 2-21. Data were compared between children with CP stratified by GMFCS and typically developing (TD) children utilizing lossless averaging and serial Welch's t-tests across time with Holm correction for multiple comparisons.rebound, tethering and maintenance of correction in groups were analyzed at the latest follow-up (mean of 3,4 years). Results: The mean age of the patients was 8,1 (6,7-10.8) years at the time of surgery. After a mean of 40,3 months (range, 16-86), 17 (48,5%) limbs maintained the desired stable correction in the sleeper plate group compared to 59 stable limbs (72.2%) in the plate removal group (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant differ - ence regarding rebound phenomenon between sleeper plate group and plate removal group (34.2% vs 27.8% respectively) (p = 0.216). Reinsertion of the metaphyseal screw was possible 7/12 limbs and remaining 5 limbs underwent further surgeries. There were 6 limbs of tether - ing after a mean of 66,3 months (range 48 to 96) in the sleeper plate group which caused a radiographic bone bar and undesired clinical growth arrest treated with further surgeries Conclusion: Removing only metaphyseal screw increases the risk of tethering. Additionally, reinsertion of the screw may not be possible in all cases due to bony growth and further corrective surgeries may be necessary. Close follow-up is required if the sleeper plate technique is to be applied. Table 1.

Children completed 16.9 (\u00b1 4.4) evaluations between age 2.9 (\u00b1 0.7) and 18.6 (\u00b1 1.7) years. 525 evaluations were compared with 862 age matched evaluations of TD children. Use of physical therapy and bracing was most common among children during younger years with 94% receiving PT and 82% using orthotics between ages 2-5. Among 65 total surgeries, 39 procedures were performed to address foot deformities: 11 to address varus, and 28 to address valgus (Figure). Children with CP begin walk-ing with valgus and those classified as GMFCS I and II tend to normalize with growth while those at GMFCS level III and IV tend to persist until surgical intervention (Figure; p < 0.05). Reduced heel pressure is initially present among all GMFCS levels (p < 0.05) but improves with age in children at GMFCS levels I-III. Conclusions: Young children with CP walk with valgus foot posture and limited heel contact which tends to resolve with growth in those walking without an assistive device. Conservative management is recommended in early child-hood with close monitoring throughout growth. The description of deformity management and foot posture progression can be utilized to guide treatment and educate families on expected outcomes. Introduction and objective: Valgus flatfoot is a common deformity in neurological conditions. Pain, ulceration on the medial border of the foot can lead to walking limitation. Traditional surgical treatment includes osteotomies or tri-ple arthrodesis. For reducible valgus surgical technique: talonavicular arthrodesis (TNA) combined with talocalcaneal screw Methods: 59 valgus flatfeet were surgi- cally treated in 38 walking patients. Pre and postoperative clinical, functional (FMS, Hoffer function status, GMFCS) and radiological evaluation were documented. All patients underwent simultaneously correction of flexible hind foot deformity with TCSF and the midfoot with TNA. Achilles, peroneus brevis lengthening when needed. Postoperative complications were recorded. Results: 81% were cerebral palsy patients. Mean age was 12 years (range 8-17). In 13 out of 38 patients, foot correc- tion was part of a multistage surgery. 42% of patients complained of pain preoperatively, none postoperatively. The gait perimeter was signifi-cantly improved. FMS score increased in 40% of cases and decreased in only 6%. Hoffer functional status was improved in 2 patients who underwent associated multi-stage surgery. Delayed fusion was noted in two feet. Staples used in TNA were removed in 4 cases. Screw breakage was observed in three cases, without loss of correction. 92% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of the surgery. AP and lateral standing radiographic measurements showed statistically significant improvement (P < 0.001) in: talocalcaneal divergence, talonavicular coverage slope and calcaneal slope. Triple arthrodesis is proposed for stiff defor - mities in mature subjects. TNA has been reported in imma- ture patients with reducible deformities. It is thought to carry a greater risk of nonunion. Combination of TNA and TCSF is a simpler surgical procedure that corrects the sub-talar deformity and enhances talonavicular fusion. associated with talocalcaneal screw fixation: is it a reliable option for the treatment of neurological valgus flatfoot in NEUROMUSCULAR 1 OP-41 Surgical Management of Pes Planus in Children with Cerebral Palsy: a Systematic Review King's College London, London, United Kingdom 2Evelina Children's Hospital, St Thomas Hospital, London, United Kingdom Purpose: Pes planus (or flatfoot) is the most common defor - mity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). There are several surgical interventions used to treat no evidence on optimal treatment for flatfoot in children with CP. Our purpose is to systematically review studies reporting compli-cations, recurrence rates and radiological outcomes of the surgical management of flatfoot in children with CP. Methods: Five databases were searched to identify studies published from inception until July 2021, with keywords relating to flatfoot, CP and surgical interventions. We included prospective, retrospective and comparative study designs in the English language. Data was extracted and tabulated in duplicate into Excel and analysis was con-ducted using Python SciPy. Results: 1220 studies were identified of which 44 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 2,234 feet in 1,364 patients with a mean age of 10.3 and mean follow-up of 55.9 months. Radiographic outcomes showed improvement with all procedures; complications and recurrence rates were too poorly reported to compare. Only 10 (23%) studies were assessed as a low risk of bias. There was substantial heterogeneity of outcome measures. Conclusions: There is a lack of high-quality, comparative studies assessing the radiological outcomes, complications and recurrence rates of surgical alternatives to treat flatfoot in children with CP. There is currently no clear evidence on optimal surgical treatment and this provides an opportunity for researchers to undertake more studies in this field. NEUROMUSCULAR 1 OP-40 Is Simple Talectomy a Good Salvage Procedure for Severe Deformity?Marianne Denmark Introduction: Talectomy is rarely performed. Non- invasive techniques are gold standard to redress Severe Neuromuscular Foot Deformity (SNFD). Yet, talectomy may be considered for rigid, painful, or neglected SNFD to obtain a stable, plantigrade, pain-free foot. We present a 10-year follow-up accessing radiological correction rates, functional outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction. Methods: This single centre retrospective case series evaluated talectomies in 2012-2022. Simple talectomy was combined with Steinman pin fixation of calcaneus to tibia for approximately six weeks. Main diagnoses included arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cerebral palsy. The primary outcome was radiological correction rates. Tibiotalar angle (TiTa) and tibiocalcaneal angle (TiCa) were measured on mediolateral projections, pre-ferably full weightbearing. Talectomy indications were pain, skin irritation, wounds, pressure marks, problems wearing shoes/orthoses, severe rigidity, and residual/recurrent deformity after former interventions. Secondary outcomes were functional outcomes graded as good/fair/poor based on degree of deformity and pain. Validated patient-reported outcome measures, i.e., EQ-5D-5L and two items from the Scoliosis Research Society-30 Questionnaire assessed health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. Results: 19 talectomies in 11 patients were analysed. Mean follow-up was 61.8 months (range 9-112 months). Mean TiTa prior talectomy was 137\u00b117.4\u00b0. TiCa improved significantly with a mean difference of -24.3\u00b0 (95% CI = [-44;-5]) (p0.02). All 19 feet became plantigrade and pain-free with no wounds or pressure marks. Functional outcomes were graded as 9/19(47%) good, 10/19(53%) fair and 0/19(0%) poor. 9/11(82%) patients could stand with support versus 6/11(55%) before talec-tomy. Four patients walked supported by aids prior surgery (all bilateral cases). In-house walking distance improved in three cases. Parents/primary caregivers ranked satisfaction level between \"neither satisfied nor unsatisfied\" and \"very satisfied\". Perceived health was rated with a mean visual analogue scale score of 54.1\u00b127.3 out of 100, emphasizing complex medical conditions. Conclusion: Simple talectomy is a suitable salvage proce- dure for SNFD. Risk of long-term complications should be considered.EPOS Abstract Book 47 NEUROMUSCULAR 2 OP-34 Is guided growth at the the proximal femur superior to the natural history in children with cerebral palsy? A bicentered matched pair 2Christophorus Kliniken, Coesfeld, Germany In order to prevent hip dislocation in children with cerebral palsy (CP), interventions as soft tissue and bony surgery are well-established treatment methods. Few studies applying guided growth (GG) to the coxal end of the femur reported that it might be a less invasive method to change the radiographic hip geometry. This study is the first to compare radiographs of a GG group with a natural history (NH) group in order to find out if the measured improvements are caused by the GG or amount to the NH. A retrospective, two-centered case-control study was con- ducted. Pelvic radiographs of 15 children treated with hemiepiphyseodesis of the medial proximal femur were compared with the X-rays of 15 CP children matched according to age at time of the X- ray, gender and GMFCS level at matching time points preoperatively and two years postoperatively. Neck-shaft angle (NSA), head-shaft angle (HSA), acetab- ular index (AI) and migration percentage (MP) were anal-ysed. Due to non-normal distribution non-parametric test were used for statistical analysis. X-rays of 30 children (8 girls, 7 boys per group) with a mean age of 6.2 years and a mean follow-up of 2 years (13-43 months) were available for analysis. The GMFCS lev-els were distributed as follows (GG/NH): Level I 1/1, level II 1/1, level III 1/1, level IV 6/6, level V 7/7. Comparing GG to NH, there were no significant differences in the measured values of any of the parameters within a two-year timeframe. The only significant finding was a higher MP in the GG group than in the NH group (timepoint 1 45%/33%; p = 0.006, timepoint 2 41%/32%; p = 0.116). Regarding the results from this matched pair analysis a sig-nificant influence on hip migration of GG as treatment for hip dysplasia over NH in children with CP could not be shown. NEUROMUSCULAR 2 OP-37 Chronological order between scoliosis and hip Hospital, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon 2Department of Orthopedic Surgery, H\u00f4tel-Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon Pelvic obliquity (PO) is common in children with paralytic diseases and may be related to the presence of a spinal deformity, a hip dislocation or both. Spinal fusion most commonly involves the pelvis, in order to correct PO and achieve satisfactory sitting balance. Hip surgery is indi-cated to improve nursing and sitting balance, and decrease pain. There has always been a dilemma in the literature regarding what should come first regarding surgical treat-ment of spinal deformity v/s hip subluxation. A retrospective review was undertaken on 88 children with paralytic diseases (GMFCS IV-V) with scoliosis and/or hip dislocations, having corrective surgery for either one of them between 1998 and 2020. Etiology, scoliosis type, fusion levels, pre- and post-operative hip Reimer's index and PO were taken, with an average follow-up of 4 years (1.3-6.7). The choice of the first surgical site (FSS) was considered appropriate if improvement or at least stabili-zation of second site deformity was observed. The FSS was the hip in 13 patients, 9 of which developed scoliosis and PO several months following surgery, and 4 showed worsening of a preexisting scoliosis despite a suc-cessful hip surgery. The FSS was the spine in 75 patients, 31 of which had an associated hip subluxation/dislocation; only 3 patients showed worsening of a preexisting sub-luxation or developed a new one following spinal fusion. There was a significant improvement of Reimers index from its preoperative value for both hips. Patients with paralytic scoliosis and/or hip subluxation must be treated to produce a level pelvis. Starting with scoliosis surgery seem to lead to a better mid-term results on hip migration, probably through a better femoral head coverage produced by a more level pelvis. Surgical treatment of paralytic scoliosis with optimal cor - rection of pelvic obliquity is better done before any surgi- cal treatment of hip subluxation/dislocation. NEUROMUSCULAR 2 OP-35 Isolated Anterior Distal Femoral Hemiepiphysiodesis Does Not Change Pelvic Tilt in Children with Cerebral Palsy Alison Hanson 1, Tishya Wren1, Robert Kay1, Natalie Zusman1 1Children's Hospital Los skeletally immature with flexed knee gait and fixed knee flexion defor - mity. Anterior pelvic tilt (APT) has been reported after hamstring lengthening (HSL) 1 and distal femoral extension osteotomies (DFEO),2 but has not been studied after ADFH. This study assesses APT after ADFH with and without con-current HSL in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: Ambulatory children with CP who underwent ADFH with pre and postoperative gait analyses were retro-spectively reviewed. Clinical exam measures and gait kinematics/kinetics were collected. Mean pelvic tilt during stance phase was compared across visits and as a function of relevant clinical and gait parameters using linear mixed models. Results: Among 34 eligible participants (24 male, mean age 13.0 years, 57 limbs), pelvic tilt increased significantly after ADFH by 5.4\u00b0 (p < 0.0001). APT increased 8.0\u00b0 with concurrent HSL (p < 0.0001), compared to 1.0\u00b0 without concurrent HSL (p = 0.61), with the difference between groups being significant (p = 0.003) (Table 1). Previous HSL did not affect change in APT (p = 0.19). When ADFH was done without previous or concurrent HSL, APT decreased slightly by 3.4\u00b0 (p = 0.03). APT increased more in GMFCS III-IV compared with GMFCS I-II (p = 0.02). 0.0001) and 2.3\u00b0 in GMFCS I-II (p = 0.21). Change pelvic tilt was not influ- enced by preoperative popliteal angle, knee extension range of motion, hip extension, strength of the hip exten-sors, knee extensors, and knee flexors, or minimum knee flexion in stance. Discussion: ADFH without concurrent HSL in children with CP does not significantly affect APT. By contrast, ADFH with concurrent HSL results in increased APT, as has been reported following DFEO and HSL. Surgeons should be aware that ADFH does not result in a significant increase in APT, unless it is combined with HSL.

Bhushan 2Southampton General hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom Introduction: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has set guidelines serving as a bench- mark for high quality transition services for children and young people (CYP) with chronic health conditions. We aimed to assess the services provided by the transition program running at our tertiary care hospital and to iden-tify the unmet needs of health care in adults with neuro-muscular disorders (NMDs). Methods: A questionnaire was designed through consen- sus amongst professionals and review of literature. An online survey of parents, caregivers, and patients going through NMDs was conducted to identify lacunae in tran-sition services being provided to them. Results: 53 families who had been transitioned were invited to participate in the study and 39 responses were received. Only 9 patients (23%) agreed that they received a transition plan for transfer of further care to an adult orthopaedic surgeon. The average score of satisfaction with the transition plan was 4/10. Care of their general health was taken over by their GP in 49% of them, while EPOS Abstract Book 49 28% patients did not have any doctor looking after them. 69% patients did not have any orthopaedic supervision whereas, 53% did not have any inputs from Spine surgeons since transitioning. 33% patients did not have continuing physiotherapy. 41% patients reported some decline and 6 (15%) reported a significant decline in their musculo-skeletal health. Conclusion: Transition between services is challenging for families with tremendous scope for improvement. Coordination of care between Paediatric and adult services can make transition seamless for patients. Table 1.

This study reports the longer-term out-comes at up to twelve year follow up. Materials & methods: The first 100 infants treated at our institution with the growth stimulating minimal acetabular pelletoplasty were analysed. Teratological hips were included. Pre-operative patient demographics and radio-logical measurements to final follow up were recorded, including IHDI classification of hip position, Acetabular Index (AI) and Severin grade. Results: Median age at the time of surgery was 15 months (range 12-30 months). The majority (60 of 100 cases) were high hip dislocations (IHDI grade IV - sixty cases), with 28 being IHDI grade III and 12 being grade II. Mean pre-operative AI was 40\u00b0, which showed statistically signifi-cant improvements year on year (Repeated measures ANOV A, post hoc Bonferroni correction, p < 0.001). Mean AI at final follow up (mean eight years post-surgery, range 4-12 years) was 18\u00b0, and statistically indistinct from the normal contralateral hips. 94% of cases have Severin Grade 1 (excellent) or 2 (good) outcome. Only two patients required later pelvic osteotomy for residual acetabular dysplasia, compared to 60% of cases who do so after open reduction without pelvic osteotomy. Conclusions: These longer-term results have demon- strated this minimal acetabular growth stimulating proce- dure to be at least as effective as any formal pelvic osteotomy, yet is technically quicker and easier to perform. It is a simple adjunct for the surgeon who has just sweated their way through a hip open reduction. Now with up to 12 years follow up, this simple technique can be confidently recommended to be routinely performed alongside a hip open reduction, for infants aged 12-30 months. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 1 OP-44 Identification of Predictors for the Development of Femoral Nerve Palsy in Brace Treatment for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Emily Schaeffer 1, Jack British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, British Columbia Children's Hospital, of Orthopaedics 17(1S) 3Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia; Centre for International Child Health, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada 4Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States 5SickKids Toronto, Toronto, Canada 6Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia Introduction and Objective: Femoral nerve palsy (FNP) is a potential complication of brace treatment for DDH. Little is known about the causes of this complication, with methodological and size limitations in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to examine potential risk factors for FNP in the largest, prospective cohort of infants with DDH to date treated by orthosis. Materials and Methods: A global prospective database of infants diagnosed with DDH was analyzed for patients that developed FNP during orthosis treatment. Patients treated by closed or open reduction prior to orthosis treatment were excluded. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify potential risk factors for development of FNP, including sex, age at diagnosis and orthosis application, orthosis applied, femoral head location, percent coverage of the femoral head, and alpha angle. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results: In total, 3008 patients (5012 affected hips) were included; 99 (2.0%) hips in 94 patients (3.1%) developed FNP. Median (Q1, Q3) time to development of FNP was 7 (6,21) days after brace application. Pavlik was most com-mon (62.6%), followed by Denis Browne (23.9%), with the Pavlik used more frequently in those that developed FNP (84.0% vs. 61.9%; P < 0.001). Univariate analyses (odds ratio [95% CI]) identified lower percent coverage of the femoral head (0.87 [0.84,0.91]; P < 0.001), and lower alpha angle (0.82 [0.76,0.89]; P < 0.001) to be significantly associated with a higher risk of femoral nerve palsy. These risk factors remained significant in the multivariate model, with odds ratios of 0.93 [0.88,0.99] and 0.90 [0.83,0.98] respectively. Conclusion: Incidence of FNP was 3.1% in the largest study to date. Severity of dislocation/dysplasia was the most significant potential risk factor identified for devel-opment of FNP. Understanding factors affecting develop-ment of this complication will be important to optimize treatment outcomes for patients and avoid potentially unnecessary surgical procedures.DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 1 OP-45 Does Brace Treatment Improve Acetabular Dysplasia or Reduce the Rate of Secondary Surgery Following Open Reduction of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)? Arnav Kak 1, William Morris1, Laura Mayfield1, Harry Kim1 1Scottish Rite for Children, Dallas, United States Background: Abduction bracing is commonly used fol- lowing open reduction (OR) and spica casting of DDH. However, there is little scientific evidence to support or refute this practice. The purpose of this study was to deter - mine the efficacy of abduction bracing after OR in improv-ing the acetabular dysplasia, as measured by acetabular index (AI), and reducing the rate of secondary surgery for residual dysplasia. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients treated with OR. Demographic data, severity of dislocation (IHDI class), age at reduction, and casting duration were obtained (Table). Patients were prescribed no bracing, part-time ( < = 18 hours/day), or full-time ( > = 20 hours/day) based on surgeon preference. AI measurements were obtained at cast removal and at 2- and 4-year follow-up. Uni-/multi-variate analyses were performed. Results: 146 hips underwent OR with 61% (89/146) of the hips treated with abduction bracing. There was no difference between the two groups with regards to sex, age of reduction, duration of casting, dislocation severity, or immediate post-casting AI (Table). Two-year and 4-year follow up X-rays showed no difference in AI between the braced vs. non-braced hips. When categorized by full-time, part-time, or no bracing, no differences in AI were also observed at 2 and 4 years. There was no difference in the rate of secondary sur - gery between braced vs. non-braced hips. Multivariate anal-ysis demonstrated that neither IHDI classification, bracing, nor age at reduction predicted residual dysplasia. Conclusion: Abduction bracing following OR for DDH is not associated with decreased residual dysplasia at 2-/4-years post-reduction or with decreased secondary surgery. There may not be any clinical value in bracing after OR. A prospective study is necessary to provide more definitive recommendations. pre-bracing characteristics Non-braced braced p-value age at reduction (years) 1.10\u00b10.63 of 0.15 ai at cast removal 33.3\u00b16.6\u00b0 32.0\u00b16.7\u00b0 0.28EPOS Abstract Book 51 outcomes Non-braced at 2 year follow-up ai at 4 year follow-up 24.9\u00b16.5\u00b0 of secondary surgery for residual dysplasia 35% 30% 0.55 DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA follow-up of Dega acetabuloplasty in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip: Is it as effective as expected? Traumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Giresun, Turkey 3Orthopaedics and Polatli State Hospital, Ankara, Turkey 4Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Faculty of Istanbul, Turkey Introduction and Objective: Although Dega acetabulo- plasty is widely used for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), there is a paucity of data on long-term outcomes. The purpose of the study was to eval-uate the rate of residual acetabular dysplasia after Dega acetabuloplasty for DDH. Materials and Methods: Patients of a previously reported consecutive series of 35 patients (43 hips) operated by a single surgeon were recontacted for long-term follow-up. Of these, 25 patients (32 hips) consented, with a follow-up rate of 71% (74% hips). The mean age at the time of surgery was 35 (18-65) months. The presence of residual dysplasia was noted according to the center-edge angle of Wiberg (CEA). The final radiographic outcome was evalu-ated according to the Severin classification and patients were clinically evaluated according to the modified McKay's criteria. Results: The mean follow-up duration of 16.5 (12-20) years yielded an average age of 19.2 (14-23) years at the time of analysis (Figure 1). According to CEA reference values, 5 of 32 (15.6%) hips were dysplastic and 2 of 32 (6.3%) hips were reoperated for re-subluxation. Thus, a total of 7 hips (21.9%) were considered dysplastic. With the exception of two hips that underwent further osteoto-mies, no other hips were re-subluxated or re-dislocated. Over-containment was noted in 3 (9.4%) hips. There were 25 Severin group I and II (78.1%), 5 Severin group III (15.6%) and 2 Severin group IV (6.3%) hips. According to modified McKay criteria, 27 hips (84.4%) were excellent and good and 5 (15.6%) were fair. Severin classification and modified McKay's criteria was correlated with dyspla-sia (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dega acetabuloplasty provided long-lasting satisfactory clinical outcomes in the majority of patients with DDH. However, even in well-treated asymptomatic hips, patients should be followed regularly, especially for residual dysplasia. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 1 OP-47 Comparative analysis of the traumaticity of surgical approaches during triple pelvic osteotomy in children with hip dysplasia Pavel Bortulev 1 1Federal State Budgetary Institution \"H.Turner National Medical Research Center for Children's Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery\" of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Saint Petersburg, Pushkin, Russian Federation Introduction: To perform a triple pelvic osteotomy, ortho- pedists use from one to three surgical approaches to pro-vide osteotomy of the sciatic, pubic and iliac bones with subsequent reorientation of the acetabulum. The analysis of the scientific literature has shown the absence of publi-cations concerning the comparison of the traumaticity of various surgical approaches for performing triple pelvic osteotomy.52 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Aim - to analyze the degree of muscle injury during triple pelvic osteotomy with various approaches in patients with hip dysplasia Matherials and methods: The study included 70 patients (70 hip joints) aged 12 to 18 years (15.2\u00b11.4) with dyspla-sia Crowe I grade. All children were divided into two groups - group I consisted of 35 patients who underwent triple pelvic osteotomy from an anterolateral approach, group II - 35 patients who underwent triple pelvic osteot-omy from two approaches (medial and \"bikini\"). Indicators of severity of pain syndrome on the V AS scale were evalu-ated, as well as biochemical analysis of markers of muscle injury (LDH, CPK, creatinine, AST, C-reactive protein) before surgery and on the 3rd and 7th days after surgery.Results: The intensity of the pain syndrome according to the questionnaire data was more pronounced (p < 0.05) in patients who underwent surgery from an anterolateral access, and the values of CPK and C-reactive protein sig-nificantly (p < 0.05) exceeded those in patients who under - went triple pelvic osteotomy from two surgical approaches. Conslusion: A comparative analysis of the traumaticity of surgical approaches in triple pelvic osteotomy in children with hip dysplasia showed that the use of anterolateral access significantly (p < 0.05) has greater damage to mus- cle tissue than the use of two surgical approaches (medial and \"bikini\"), as evidenced by a significant increase in CPK and CRP in the blood, as well as more severe pain syndrome in the immediate postoperative period.

This study updates the previous limited series. Materials and Methods: An updated multi-centre, pro- spective database of patients diagnosed with DDH was analyzed for all patients treated by closed and/or open reduction with radiographs available at minimum one-year follow-up. Presence of A VN (Salter criteria) was deter - mined by three senior pediatric orthopaedic surgeons by blinded assessment and consensus discussion. Surgeons were provided with surgical hip, surgery type, sex, age, and length of follow-up. Patient demographics, clinical exam findings, and radiographic data were assessed.EPOS Abstract Book 53 Results: In total, 368 hips from 292 patients (239 female, 53 male) were included. Mean age at diagnosis was 19.3 months (SD = 21.5) and mean age at surgery was 22.2 months (SD = 21.5). The incidence of A VN was 36% (132/368 hips). Univariate logistic regression analysis identified open reduction (OR 2.70 [1.66;4.50]), unilateral left hip (OR 1.96 [1.21;3.19]), older age at diagnosis (27.3 versus 14.7 months, OR 1.03 [1.02;1.04]), older age at sur - gery (30.1 versus 17.9 months, OR 1.03 [1.02;1.04]), and IHDI grade IV (OR 1.87 [1.03;3.45]) to be associated with increased risk of A VN. Family history of DDH (OR 0.25 [0.08;0.62]) and previous brace treatment (0.51 [0.28;0.90]) were protective against A VN. Sex, pre-surgery acetabular index, and presence of ossific nucleus were not found to be associated. Conclusion: We identified an A VN incidence of 36% in our large cohort. Open reduction, surgery on the left hip, older age at diagnosis and surgery, and pre-surgery IHDI grade IV were potential risk factors, whereas an immediate family history of DDH and previous brace treatment were identified as potential protective factors. Older age at diag-nosis and surgery as significant factors, provide strong evi-dence to support early detection, screening, and treatment to prevent complications. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 1 OP-49 The association between residual hip dysplasia and total hip arthroplasty in late-detected DDH: 48 patients followed to a mean age of 62 years Terje Terjesen 1 1Section of Children's Orthopaedics and Reconstructive surgery, Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway Introduction and Objective: There is no consensus with regard to the association between residual acetabular dysplasia without subluxation and later need of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in late-detected developmental dislo-cation of the hip (DDH). The aim of the present study was explore this association in patients who have been fol-lowed to an age 60 years. Materials and Methods: Inclusion criteria were patient age at diagnosis 0.5-3.0 years, initial treatment with skin traction to obtain gradual closed reduction during the period 1958-1662, and no acetabular procedures to improve femoral head coverage. 48 patients (57 hips) filled these criteria, 41 girls and 7 boys with a mean age at diagnosis of 1.4 (0.5-2.8) years. Residual hip dysplasia was defined as center-edge (CE) angle at skeletal maturity 10-20\u00b0 (Severin grade III).Results: 18 hips had residual dysplasia without sublux- ation. Their mean CE angle at skeletal maturity was 15.8\u00b0 (10-19\u00b0). The remaining 39 hips without residual dysplasia had a mean CE angle of 25.7\u00b0 (20-36\u00b0). 16 hips had under - gone THA, 5 of 39 hips without residual dysplasia (13%) and 11 of 18 hips with dysplasia (61%); the difference was significant (P < 0.001). The mean patient age at THA was 52.2 years in patients with residual dysplasia and 54.9 years in those without residual dysplasia (P = 0.370). The average patient age at the last follow-up in patients without THA was 62.1 (60-64) years. Conclusions: With follow-up to a mean patient age of 62 years, the rate of THA was markedly higher in hips with residual hip dysplasia at skeletal maturity compared with hips without residual dysplasia. This indicates that correc-tive surgery should be considered to improve femoral head coverage during childhood or adolescence. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 2 OP-50 Effect of the Pavlik Harness Used in the Treatment of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip on Unaided Sitting and Independent and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Background: For the treatment of developmental hip dys- plasia (DDH) in early ages, the pavlik harness is one of the most widely used device with satisfactory results. Purposes: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pavlik harness use on the development of unsupported sitting and independent walking in infants with DDH. Methods: Infants (127 girls, 18 boys, total 145) that were treated with pavlik harness between July 2017 and April 2020 were included to this prospective observational study. The inclusion criterias were as follows: having a gestational age of more than 37 weeks, being less than six months at the time of treatment initiation and having idiopathic DDH without prior treatment. A control group, consisted of 100 (20 boys, 80 girls) healthy children with normal hips and without locomotor system disorder was arranged. Variables such as age at onset of treatment, the treatment duration, and independent sitting and walking time were collected. Normality of variables were evalu-ated with Shapiro-Wilkins test. Independent sample t test was used to compare the means between groups. Results: The mean age at the treatment initiation was 76.3\u00b131 days. The mean duration of pavlik harness use 54 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) was 4.6\u00b12 months.The mean unsupported sitting age of the DDH group was 6.8\u00b11 months and 5.9\u00b11 months for the control group. The mean independent walking age of the DDH group was 12.7\u00b12 months and 11.8\u00b11 months for the control group. It was statistically significant that babies having DDH treatment with Pavlik harness were walking (p < 0.001) and sitting (p < 0.001) later than the control group.

DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 2 OP-51 Do Children With Normal Acetabuli After Successful Pavlik Harness Treatment For Infantile Hip Dislocation Develop Residual Acetabular Dysplasia At 1Rady San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States Introduction: We evaluated the rate of residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD), defined as an acetabular index (AI) of greater than 90 th percentile (90th%) of age- and sex-matched historical controls, in a cohort of infants successfully treated with the Pavlik Harness (PH). Methods: We retrospectively studied typically developing infants with at least 1 dislocated hip, that were success-fully treated with a PH and had a minimum of 48 months follow-up. Hip dislocation was defined as less than 30% femoral head coverage at rest on pre-treatment ultrasound or IHDI grade III or IV on the pre-treatment radiograph. Results: 46 dislocated hips in 41 infants were studied (4 M, 37 F). Brace treatment was initiated at an average age of 1.7 months (range: 2 days to 9.3 months) and was maintained for an average of 10.2 months (range: 2.3 to 24.9 months). All hips achieved IHDI grade 1 reduction. 5/46 hips (11%) had an AI greater than the 90 th% at the conclusion of bracing. Only 1 out of these 5 hips required subsequent acetabuloplasty with the remaining 4 hips hav-ing continued acetabular development to below 90 th% at final follow-up. Average final follow-up was 6.6 years (range: 4.0 to 15.2 years). Three hips went on to acetabu-loplasty and 11 more had AI greater than the 90 th% at final follow-up, representing a 30% incidence of RAD (14/46 hips) after successful PH treatment. 13/14 (93%) of these hips had AI less than 90 th% at the end of brace treatment. Conclusion: In a single center cohort of infants with dislo-cated hips treated successfully with a PH we observed a 30% incidence of RAD at minimum 4.0 year follow-up. Normal acetabular morphology at the end of brace treat-ment did not result in normal acetabular morphology at final follow-up in 13/41 hips OF THE HIP 2 OP-52 Sagittal lumbo-pelvic alignment in dysplasia an evo- lutionarily formed and genetically predetermined sagittal lumbo-pelvic alignment which remains unchanged for life. This results in four different sagittal orientated pelvic types EPOS Abstract Book 55 (elephant\u00b4s ear type, flat back-pelvic retroversion type, nor - mal pelvic version type, pelvic anteversion type) that may influence the sagittal acetabular ante-/retroversion. The objective was to determine whether the lumbo- pelvic alignment plays a role in the sagittal acetabular ver - sion of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and symptomatic acetabular retroversion (AR). Materials and Methods: 35 juvenile and adult patients (51 hips), f:m = 30:5, mean 19,4y who were diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip and 36 patients (72 hips), f:m = 23:13, mean 15,8y with the diagnosis symptomatic acetabular retroversion were compared by a lumbo-pelvic standing lateral view, a frontal pelvic radio-graph and a faux profile view. Radiological parameters were Pelvic Incidence (PI), Sacral Slope (SS) and Pelvic Tilt(PT). Acetabular parameters were Inclination-angle, LCE- and ACE-angle. Results are given as mean values and standard deviations together with the range. Results: DDH: predominantly be found with normal and anteverted pelvises. DDH is an autonomous the consequence of a pathological lumbo-pelvic angulation with a low pelvic incidence. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 2 OP-53 Screening for hip dysplasia using pubo femoral distances is more effective than clinical examinations and risk factors Hans-Christen Denmark 2Aarhus University Hospital / Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Aarhus, Denmark 3Aarhus University Hospital / Department of Radiology, Aarhus, Denmark 4Aarhus University Hospital / Department of Children's Orthopaedics, Aarhus, Denmark Introduction and Objective: Selective screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) based on clini-cal hip examinations and risk-factors, has low detection rates. The pubo-femoral distance (PFD) ultrasound mea-surement is an easy to learn diagnostic tool for DDH but it's effectiveness in screening for DDH has not yet been established. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of PFD screening in terms of detection rates, referral rates, and positive predictive values (PPV) further, to compare these results with traditional selective screening. Materials and Methods: PFD hip ultrasound was offered to all newborns at Aarhus University Hospital after clinical hip examination and risk-factor screening performed by a midwife during a one-year study period. The PFD ultra-sound was performed by midwives trained in the PFD method. A PFD value of 6.1mm or above was used as referral criteria for Graf ultrasound in addition to selective criteria. Referral rates were compared using Student's paired t-test, PPVs were calculated as true positive screenings/all positive screenings for each method, with a positive diag-nosis defined as a Graf type IIa hip or above. Results: 2735 children were included, mean screening age was 3.7 days (range 1-17 days), 485 children received fol-low-up Graf ultrasound. Distribution of hips were 906 type I, 57 type IIa, 7 type IIc and 0 type III+. Traditional selec-tive screening detected 45% of identified type IIa hips and 43% of type IIc hips. PFD screening detected 65% of type IIa hips and 86% of type IIc hips. The PPVs were 5.6% for traditional screening and 14.8% for PFD screening while 56 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) referral rates were significantly lower for PFD screening (13.6% vs 7.2% p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, universal PFD screening was more effective than traditional selective screening. The poor performance of traditional screening points towards rethinking DDH screening in locations with similar screen-ing strategies. DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 2 OP-54 Radiological development of 69 ultrasound-unstable hip joints according to Graf after successful treatment with plaster cast in human position - a follow-up over 5.5 years Germany Introduction: After successful treatment of DDH follow- up-examinations are widely recommended until end of growth. Therefore, the objective of this study was to follow the development of successfully treated primarily ultrasound unstable hips (type D, III and IV) according to Graf which were treated by a plaster cast in human posi-tion (Fettweis plaster, FP). Methods: Ultrasound unstable hips type D, III and IV which were successfully treated with FP were included, if there were 3 pelvic radiographs available (12 to < 24, 24 to < 48 and 48 to < 96 months). The hip-development was followed by the acetabular- index (AI) and classified according to Tonnis into normal (NF +/- 1 standard deviation (SD)), slightly dysplastic (sliD, 1-2 SD) or severely dysplastic findings (sevD, > 2 SD). Furthermore, the hips were analyzed for avascular necrosis (A VN) according to Kalamchi and MacEwen and the need of surgical treatment. Results: 69 primarily ultrasound unstable hips (54 patients, 15 bilateral, 35 left, 44 female, hip type D 9; III 27; IV 33) were included. The first radiological control revealed 39.1% (second: hips with sevD. An improve-ment of the AI comparing first and second radiograph was detected in 9/69 hips and between the second and third radiograph in 20/69 hips. However, 16/29 deteriorations were detected comparing first and second radiograph, respectively 4/69 comparing second and third radiograph - independently of the initial ultrasound hip type. A VN was observed in 4 cases.A pelvic osteotomy was recommended for 16 (23.2 %) hips due to sevD, in 8/16 hips a Salter osteotomy was performed. Conclusions: Midterm results indicate that radiological controls should be provided to detect deteriorations after finishing the initial treatment of ultrasound unstable hips with the FP DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP 2 OP-55 The rate and risk factors of failure in closed reduction in developmental dysplasia of the hip: a systematic Centre for Translational Medicine, Budapest, Hungary 2Semmelweis University Centre for Translational Medicine, Budapest, Hungary 3University of Debrecen Department of Orthopaedics, Debrecen, Hungary 4Semmelweis University 3. Department of Biophysics and Radiation Biology, Budapest, Hungary 5Semmelweis University Department of Orthopaedics, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: The incidence of failure and the signifi- cance of risk factors for failure in the treatment of hip dis-location in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) remain unclear. In this study we investigated the overall rate and the risk factors of failure in pediatric patients with DDH treated with closed reduction. Methods: In our systematic review and meta-analysis we followed the Cochrane recommendations. We performed a systematic search on 02.07.2022 in three medical data-bases to identify all studies reporting on pediatric patients with hip dislocation in DDH. Eligible studies reported on the rate of failure, either with or without mentioning dif-ferent risk factors, in children under the age of 24 months. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from two-by-two tables (event rate in risk group, event rate in non-risk group). Results: We identified a total of 13.316 studies, of which we included 93 studies for failure rate analysis. Out of these, 26 studies (2920 hips) were eligible also for assess-ment of different risk factors. We found that the overall rate of failure in closed reduction was 24% and the majority of EPOS Abstract Book 57 failure occur intraoperatively: the rate of intraoperative, postoperative failure and redislocation was 31%, 6% and 8%, respectively. We also found that the risk of failure in closed reduction was significantly higher in high disloca-tions (IHDI IV . vs. IHDI II. OR: 11.88, . vs. Graf III. OR: 3.4, CI: and in male gender (OR: 1.64, CI: 1.06-2.54). Conclusion: Based on our results, high dislocation and male gender were the risk factors for failure in closed reduction in hip dislocation in DDH. HIP 1 OP-56 Advanced Containment Surgery in a Patient Cohort with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease (LCPD) Dominated by Severely Affected Cases Thomas Wirth 1, Anna Thomanek1 1Dept. Orthopaedics, Olgahospital, Klinikum Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany Introduction: Simple surgical containment treatment is not beneficial lateral pillar group Herring C patients. This study aims to answer the question if advanced containment procedures like a triple pelvic osteotomy yield better clini-cal and radiological results. Materials and Methods: 123 LCPD patients,102 male (82.9%) and 21 female (17.1%) subjects, average age of 8.24 \u00b1 2.36 years at time of surgery, were analysed. 54 (43.9%) patients had an intertrochanteric varus osteotomy (IVO), (32.5%) a triple pelvic (15.4%) a triple plus proximal femoral varus osteotomy. Among others the key parameters clinical findings (preop, postop, follow-up modified Harris hip score), severity (Catterall, Herring), lateral extrusion/subluxation (Reimers migration index [RMI]), radiological outcome according to Stulberg were recorded. Results: Mean follow-up was 4.91 \u00b1 2.88 years. There were 72.2% Herring B and 20.4% Herring C in IVO patients, 45% and 47.5% in triple and 52.6 vs. 47.4% in triple plus IVO patients. RMI 16.87% in IVO patients and 20.19% in the triple and 23.85% in the triple plus IVO group. It was corrected to 14% in the IVO patients, to 11% in the TPO and to 12.5% in the combined group. At last follow-up there in IVO, 27.5% in TPO and 21.1% in the combined group and 55.5% fair results (Stulberg III/IV/V) in IVO, 72.5% in TPO and78.9% in TPO plus IVO. In the Harris Hip score the IVO and triple patients fared similarly with 70.4 and 72.5% excellent results. The multi-variate statistical analysis identified Herring C, age at onset and the epiphyseal quotient as risk factors for a fair radiological outcome. Conclusion: Advanced containment surgery doesn't lead to a promising improvement of radiological outcomes in patients with more severely affected hips. HIP 1 OP-57 Can we predict the risk of avascular necrosis after surgical treatment for severe unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis? Samuel Objective: Avascular necrosis (A VN) of the femoral head in severe slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) has been reported to occur at a rate of 0 to 66%. In this retrospective study we asked whether assessment of epiphyseal perfusion would help identify hips at risk of A VN after modified Dunn procedure. Patients and Methods: Between 2015 and 2020 we per - formed 38 modified Dunn procedures for severe unstable SCFE. Epiphyseal perfusion was assessed (1) by dynamic pre-operative MRI which compared signal intensity-curve and the relative rate of enhancement (RRE) of both epiph-ysis; (2) intra-operatively by the presence or absence of active bleeding from epiphysis. At a minimum follow-up of 12-months after surgery, radiographic findings of A VN were evaluated. Results: 4 (10%) patients developed symptomatic A VN. Three patterns emerged from dynamic MRI: (A) global homogeneous enhancement where signal intensity curve of affected epiphysis was not impaired with a RRE > 0.5 (28 patients); (B) global homogenous impairment where signal intensity curve of SCFE side was totally compromised with RRE < 0.5 (7 patients) (fig. 1); (C) partial heterogenous enhancement where signal intensity curve of the supero-lateral region of interest (ROI) of the affected epiphysis was impaired with RRE > 0.5 (3 patients). All Subjects in group A had active bleeding and had no A VN. Subjects in group B had no A VN when bleeding was positive (4 of 7 patients); 2 patients developed A VN when bleeding was negative (3 of 7 patients). All subjects in groups C had positive bleeding with 2 patients developing A VN (table 1). Globally 4 of 10 patients (40%) who had impaired MRI developed A VN. Conclusions: Patients who had positive dynamic MRI and operative bleeding didn't develop A VN. All Patients who developed A VN had impaired MRI. In case of impaired dynamic MRI, intra-operative bleeding seems to be an important prognostic A VN neck lengthening through surgical hip Perthes-like Typical sequelae of Perthes disease and Perthes-like deformities comprise short femoral neck, aspherical femoral head, and greater trochanteric over - growth. Morscher's osteotomy aims at restoring the nor - mal extra-articular anatomy, but incapable of restoring a normal head-neck contour with residual impingement. Femoral neck lengthening osteotomy combined with osteochondroplasty through surgical hip dislocation approach was not previously described in the literature. We hypothesized that this technique is capable of near-normal restoration of the proximal femoral anatomy, increasing limb length, restoring abductor power, and simultaneous management of intra-articular chondro-labral disease. Methods: A prospective series of 21 consecutive patients with sequelae of Perthes disease and Perthes-like defor - mity (Stulberg II and III) were treated by Morscher's oste-otomy through surgical hip dislocation approach. The mean age was 14.9years (9-30years) and the mean follow-up was 4.5years (2-8years). Results: The mean Harris hip score improved significantly from 66.5 to 89.5 points (p < 0.001), and the mean limb length discrepancy improved from 2.5 to 0.6cm (p < 0.001). The mean alpha angle improved from 81.8\u00b0 to 49.5\u00b0, the mean neck-shaft angle increased from 117.8\u00b0 to 129.8\u00b0, and the articulo-trochanteric distance has improved from 6.7 to 20.8 mm. Six out of 21 patients required staged periacetabular osteotomy for residual acetabular dysplasia. No cases were identified. Femoral neck lengthening osteotomy through surgical hip dislocation appraoch has proven to be safe and effective for preservation of symptomatic hips with Perthes and Perthes-like deformities and mild to moderate femoral head deformities (Stulberg II and III). A staged periace-tabular osteotomy may be required in those patients with significant acetabular dysplasia. EPOS Abstract Book 59 HIP 1 OP-59 Total hip arthroplasty in paediatric patients: results registry Rob Nelissen1, Pieter Bas De University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands Introduction and Objective: The available literature on total hip arthroplasty (THA) in children is limited. Severe sequalae of paediatric hip disorders such as developmental dysplasia (DDH) and post-Perthes deformity (PPD) are common indications for THA in children. These condi-tions may pose specific surgical challenges, especially on the acetabular side. Aim of our study was to assess the 5-year risk of aseptic cup failure and overall revision after THA in paediatric patients. Materials and Methods: From the Dutch Arthroplasty registry (LROI, 99% completeness for primary THA), we identified all patients who underwent primary THA before the age of 19 years. Primary procedures took place from 2007-2019. Demographics, baseline characteristics, and prosthesis survival were assessed. Kaplan Meier estimates were used to assess revision risks. Results: We identified 151 patients (96 female, 64%; mean age 15 years). Registered diagnoses included osteoarthritis (OA; n = 72, 48%), DDH (n = 62, 41%), and PPD (n = 17, 11%). Implants were uncemented in 83 (55%), cemented in 55 (35%) and hybrid or reverse hybrid in 13 (9%). The majority had a posterolateral approach (n = 116, 77%).Tables: Table 1. summary of the intra-articular procedures. intra-articular pathology (%) teres 2 (9.5%) acetabular cartilage, oCD; osteochondritis dissecans.

The cumulative risks of aseptic cup failure at 2 and 5 years (with number of patients at risk) were 0% (n = 115) and 1.9% (n = 51, 95%CI 1.4-2.4), whereas the overall revision risks were and 2.8% (n = 112, 95%CI 2.5-3.1) and 6.3% (n = 48, 95%CI 5.5-7.1), respectively. Conclusions: Although THA might be a viable option in children with debilitating hip disorders, the overall revi-sion risk on the mid-term was relatively high. However, despite the surgical challenges that commonly result from paediatric hip disorders, the risk of aseptic cup failure is acceptable. HIP 1 OP-60 Does duration of non-weightbearing after femoral varus osteotomy affect outcome at to 11 year-old patients with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes' disease (LCPD)? An international multicenter prospective Children, United States 2Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal, India 3University of Oklahoma Medical Center, Oklahoma City, United States 4University of California San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, United States 5Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden 6Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, United States7University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil 8Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States 9Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare, Saint Paul, United States In the 8 to 11 age group, femoral varus osteotomy (FVO) is commonly performed in the early stages of LCPD to achieve containment and minimize deformity. While tradi-tional recommend 6-8 weeks of non-weightbearing (NWB) after FVO, some advocate a longer duration (> = 6 months) to protect the femoral head further. The purpose of this study was to directly compare the 2-year outcome of patients who were treated with short (6-8 weeks) vs. long NWB (> = 6 months) after FVO in the 8-11 age group. Methods: This is a prospective study of patients with LCPD onset between 8-11 years of age treated with FVO in Stage 1 or 2A. Patients received short or long NWB based on participating surgeons' preference. All patients had perfusion MRI and those with > = 50% hypoperfusion (i.e. severe disease) were included. The primary outcome was the deformity index at 2 years. Results: Thirty-five and 40 patients were enrolled into the short and long NWB groups, with mean NWB duration of 57 days and 198 days, respectively (Table). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the age at diagnosis, age at FVO, and follow-up duration. The short NWB group had significantly higher mean % hypoperfu-sion compared to the long NWB group (83% vs 77%, p = 0.03). At 2-year follow up, the deformity index was sig- nificantly lower (i.e. less deformity) in the long NWB group compared to the short NWB group (0.30 vs. 0.38, p = 0.03). Significantly higher number of patients in the short NWB group had unplanned surgeries (p = 0.02). Conclusion: The long NWB group had significantly less deformity compared to the short NWB group following FVO at 2-year follow up with less unplanned surgeries.

We propose 3D preoperative and intraoperative planning of this correction by computer-assisted design to achieve optimal results. Materials and Methods: 15 hips in 15 patients that had hip dysplasia underwent pelvic osteotomy using patient-specific instrumentation. Age of patients ranged from 6 to 15 years. 3D computer modeling of pelvic osteoto-mies was obtained using 3D reconstruction from pre-operative low-dose CT scan. Geometric and anatomical landmarks were placed on 3D models to define refer - ence planes passing through the center of femoral head (fig 1). Measurements of LCEA (Lateral Center Edge Angle), ACEA (Anterior Center Edge Angle) and AA V A (Anterior Anteversion Angle) angles defined corrections to be applied on the pelvis. Osteotomy cuts were positioned according to the variety of pelvic osteotomy chosen. Virtual correction was then simulated by moving acetabular fragment by rotation/translation in the 3 planes until desired correction was obtained according to pre-defined criteria. Patient-specific cutting and posi-tioning guides were designed, and 3D printed to be used intra- operatively. LCEA, acetabular index (AI), Sharp's and femo-ral head extrusion index (FHEI) were assessed on pre- and at 6 months post-operative supine antero-posterior radiographs (fig 1). Results: There was one case of peri-acetabular, 11 cases of triple peri-acetabular and 3 cases of triple Lecoeur At six months follow-up, these same measurements were nor - malized with respectively 34\u00b0\u00b111\u00b0, 11\u00b0\u00b17\u00b0, 30\u00b0\u00b18.2\u00b0, 9%\u00b111% and 3.8%\u00b15.3%. Conclusions: Our patient specific cutting and rotating template improve accurate implementation of 3D preop-erative planning during surgery. Results are confirmed on standard postoperative imaging. 62 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) HIP 2 OP-62 Modified Dunn procedure in Hospital, Krakow, Poland 2Department of Pediatric Orthopedic, Institute of Medicine, College for Medical Sciences of University of Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland 3Department of Pediatric Orthopedic, Clinical Regional Hospital No. 2, Rzeszow, Poland Background: modified Dunn procedure (subcapital femoral realignment) offers the effective correction of post-SCFE deformity, however the risk of blood flow impairment to the femoral head has been reported. Methods: patients treated between 2015 and 2019 for moderate/severe SCFE by modified Dunn procedure in 2 academic pediatric orthopedic centers, with the minimum 2y. follow-up were included. Clinical examination, X-ray and MRI scans were conducted at the final assessment. The occurrence of A VN was considered failure. Primary outcome measures were: hip pain, range of motion, Harris hip score and the patients satisfaction (1-10 scale). X-ray and MRI results were assessed for persistent/secondary deformity and signs of osteoarthritis. Need for subsequent surgery and the surgical complications were identified. Results: 48 hips (24 right, 24 left) in 46 patients (29 boys, 17 girls), aged 9,75-16y. at the time of surgery were included - 6 unstable SCFEs (5 acute, 1 acute-on-chronic), and 42 stable chronic. The preoperative axial Southwick angle ranged 40-90 deg. (61 on av.) and was corrected to 10-22 deg. (12,4 on av.). A VN rate was 22,9% (11/48). In the remaining 37 hips - flexion and internal rotation increased postoperatively (76- > 125deg. and (-22)- > 28deg. respec-tively), however limited in comparison to contra-lateral side (flexion = 135deg. internal rotation = 41deg.). Drehmann sign disappeared in all patients, however FADIR was still positive in 48,6%. All patients were pain-free on walking and ADL. Limb length discrepancy (0,5-2cm; mean = 0,7cm) was noted in 75,7%. HHS ranged 88-96 (91,7 on av.). Satisfaction rate was 7-10 (8,4 on av.). On X-ray secondary femoral head deformity was noted in 43,2% hips. On MRI - chondro-labral junction pathology was evident in 54%. Complications included: Conclusion: modified procedure remains valuable trtm method for high grade SCFE, however significant rate of A VN and complications may occur. HIP 2 OP-63 Ellipsoidal Process of the Femoral often causes the residual deformity,tipicallu appearin as an ellipsoidal shape. In some cases, this oval-ization is related to the asymetric groth of the femoral head physis, is to the effectivenes of selective hemiepiphysiodesis of the healthy physis in posteroinferior quadrant as means of disrupting femoral head ovalization in cases of LCPD with the previosus onset of ovalization. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective study of 39 LCPD hips operated on consecutively by selec-tive hemiepiphysiodesis of the posteroinferior portion of femoral head during the reossification phase. Surgical indication was based on a progressive increase in the ellip-soidal index (EI), the presence of a double spiphyseal nucleus of reossification,pyseal narrowing, and physela angulation. Hemiepiphysiodesis was performed at the mean patient age of 8.8 jears (SD 1.5) and a mean of 4.7 years (SD 1.4) following disease onset. Results: Preoperative EI was 1.80 (SD 0.2), wich was reduced to 1.72(SD 0.2) postoperatively (p > 0.05). Physeal angulation increased from 50\u00ba preoperatively (SD 9.3) to 54.29\u00aa (SD 9.7) at the end fo growth (P > 0.05). The final result according to the Stulberg classification revealed 20 class II cases,16 class III cases;and 3 class IV ,and SDS was 25.97 (SD 9.95) range:9.36-51.67 T1, T2, T3 are the moments when variables were measured. ATD: articulotrochanteric distance.T2-T3*: Time elapsed between postoperative follow-up (T2) and the end of growth (T3). Conclusion: As revealed by the EI,the ellipsoidal process may be stopped by selective hemiepiphysiodesis in the posteroinferior quadrant of the femoral head.EPOS Abstract Book 63 HIP 2 OP-64 Measurements of acetabular morphology in healthy children using Children's Hospital, Wilmington, United States 2Delaware State University, Dover, United States Introduction and Objective: Hip joint morphology varies by sex and different ages of maturity and Computed tomog-raphy (CT) provides an excellent evaluation. Our objective was to describe the acetabular morphology on CT in healthy children by sex and at specific ages of maturity. Materials and Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of children who had abdominal CT scans to investi-gate abdominal pain. Inclusion criteria: CT scans includ-ing both hips with thin reconstructions. Exclusion criteria: prior diagnosis of hip disease, previous hip surgery, or trauma that deformed the hip joint. CT images were ori-ented to an anterior pelvic plane. Acetabular coverage was assessed by the measurement of the Lateral Center-Edge Angle (LCEA), Acetabular Angle Acetabular Sector Angle (PASA) (Figure 1). Patients were grouped by age and sex. Results: Bilateral hips in 125 children (61 girls and 64 boys) were included in the analysis. The mean age was 12.5 years (1-18 years). CT scans of 250 hips were evalu-ated and grouped by age: < 2 years old (n = 6), 2-5 years old (n = 13), 6-11 years old (n = 38 children), and 7-18 years old (n = 68). Mean AcetAnt was 16.5\u00b0 and ACEA increased with age (p < 0.001), and AA decreased with age (p < 0.001). AcetAnt and PASA were highest in females (p < 0.001). The right and left hips were similar for all measurements (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Hip joint development varies by sex across specific ages of maturity. The measurements computed in this study provide an instrument for early identification of pediatric hip deformities and provide support in the plan-ning of potential surgeries. HIP 2 OP-65 Risk Factors for Suboptimal Outcome of FAI Surgery in the Adolescent Patient Yi-Meng Yen1, Michael Boston, United States 2Washington University St Louis, St Louis, United States 3Texas Scottish Rite Hospital, Dallas, United States 4Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States 5Hospital for Special Surgery, New York City, United States 6Washington University, St Louis, United States Introduction and Objective: Surgical treatment for ado- lescent patients with femoroacetabular impingement is increasing. This study evaluated the outcomes of FAI sur - gery in a multicenter cohort of adolescent patients and identified predictors of suboptimal outcomes. Materials and Methods: 126 adolescent hips (114 patients < 18 years of age) undergoing surgery for symptomatic FAI were studied from a multicenter cohort: 74 (58.7%) females and 52 male hips (41.3%), mean age 16.1y (range 11.3-17.8). Clinical outcomes included modified Harris Hip Score, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome score (5 domains) and UCLA activity score. Failure was defined as revision surgery or clinical failure (not reaching mini-mally clinical important difference, or patient acceptable symptoms state for the mHHS). Statistics included pair t-tests, univariate and multivariate analysis to identify fac-tors significantly associated with failure. Results: There was clinical important improvement in all PROs (mHHs, HOOS) for the overall group, but a 18.3% failure.. Revision rate was 8.7%. Females were signifi-cantly more likely than males to be classified as a failure 64 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) (25.7 vs 7.7%, p 0.01, RR 3.3), in part because of lower pre-operative mHHS (59.1 vs 67.0, p < 0.001). Mild cam deformity (alpha angle < 55 degrees) was present in 42.5% of female hips; 17.3% of male hips. Higher alpha angles inversely correlated with failure. Alpha angles > 63 had failure rate of 8.3%; between 55-63 degrees 12.0%; and less than 55 degrees (mild CAM) failure rate of 37.5%. Athletes had a 10.3% failure rate compared to non-athletes 25.0% (p = 0.03, RR 2.4). Conclusions: Adolescent patients undergoing surgical treatment for FAI demonstrated significant improvement. Female sex, mild CAM deformities and lack of sports participation were independently associated with higher failure rates. This study identified that the more of these factors present, the higher the failure rate. These factors should be considered in surgical decision making and counseling. risk factor Composite outcome successComposite outcome failure None 26 (96.3%) 1 (3.7%) 1 36 (97.3%) 1 (2.7%) 2 27 (67.5%) 13 (32.5%) 3 13 (61.9%) 8 (38.1%) total 102 (81.6%) 23 (18.3%) HIP 2 Hip Pediatric Orthopedics, Pozna University of Medical Sciences, Pozna, Poland Introduction and objective: Hip stability is a main preoc- cupation during in children with fem-oral hypoplasia. In Congenital Femoral Deficiency (CFD) the preparatory hip surgery aims to protect against hip sub-luxation/dislocation during or after subsequent femoral lengthening. We aimed to review the results of femoral lengthening in CFD patients. Material and methods: A cohort of 15 consecutive patients presenting unilateral CFD was treated at one department between 2015 and 2022. In all cases the pre-paratory hip surgery (15/15 SUPERhip procedure, 14/15 Dega osteotomy) was performed at mean age of 3.9 yo (range 2.7- 7.3). At the second stage, the femoral length-ening using a rail external fixator was performed at 6.1 yo (range 4.3-9.7).Results: All patients presented a stable hip joint after preparatory surgery. Mean femoral lengthening time was 198 days (range 158-245), mean distraction time 70 days (range 47-108), mean distraction-consolidation time 129 days (range 90-177). Mean lengthening of 6.6 cm (range 5.0 -8.7) was achieved, which equals 30 % (range 18-44) of the femur length. External Fixator Index was 30.8 days/cm (range 18.5-42.0). At external fixator removal, all patients underwent prophylactic femoral nailing. No hip instability during femoral lengthening occurred. 3/15 patients (20%) presented hip instability (1 dislocation, 2 subluxations) after lengthening: two of them were attrib-uted to the femoral nail removal, one occurred 4 months after external fixator removal without any detectable cause. All were successfully treated surgically. Conclusions: In CFD children, during femoral lengthen- ing, the previously performed SUPERhip procedure com- pleted with Dega osteotomy proved to provide a stable hip joint in 80% of patients. Soft tissues injury related to femo-ral nail removal might negatively impact hip stability in 20% of patients which require further observation. HIP 2 OP-67 Pathogenic gene variants identified in patients presenting with Perthes Perthes-like Dallas, United States Introduction: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a diagnosis of exclusion. Various conditions, such as skele-tal dysplasia, can closely mimic LCPD and these must be ruled out to provide appropriate counseling, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, genetic testing has not been read-ily available in pediatric orthopaedic practice. Furthermore, the clinical value of genetic testing for LCPD is unclear. With the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS), genetic testing has become more clinically available and cheaper over last 5 years. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical utility of genetic testing in select patients with LCPD. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 46 consecutive patients who presented with LCPD symptoms and/or X-ray findings and who had genetic testing using NGS technology from 2015-22. The reason(s) for genetic test-ing are listed in the Table below. Patients already diag-nosed with skeletal dysplasia were excluded. Results: Of the 46 patients, 15 (33%) were found to have a pathogenic gene variant. In eight of the 15, a variety of EPOS Abstract Book 65 skeletal dysplasia was diagnosed: 2 Stickler's 1 multiple 1 SLC26A2 disorder, 1 COL2A1 disorder, 1 RLP13 disorder, and 1 hypophosphatasia. The remaining 7 patients were found to be carriers of autosomal recessive disorders: primary Of the 15 patients with pathogenic variant, only 6 had bilateral disease, 5 were < 20 percentile in height, and 2 had a family history. All 15 patients were referred for genetic counseling. Conclusion: With 33% of the patients showing pathogenic results, genetic testing is clinically valuable in detecting underlying genetic disorder or carrier status of autosomal recessive disorders in patients presenting with Perthes-like disease so that appropriate counseling and treatment can be provided. main reason(s) for testing: pathogenic results: a) atypical healing/x-ray findings 9 4 b) bilateral lCpD Diagnosis 16 3 C) family history of lCpD 4 1 D) short stature 2 0 e) suspected skeletal Dysplasia 2 2 f) a-e Combinations 13 5 Total: N 46 15 TRAUMA 1 OP-68 Bone remodeling after supracondylar fractures in children : myth or reality? A review of 351 cases Sarah Bartlomiejczyk1, Boualem Frendi1, Khaled Alomar1, Florence Muller1, Pierre Journeau1 1CHRU Nancy, Nancy, France Supracondylar fractures account for more than 50% of all pediatric elbow fractures. Moreover, the elbow has a low growth potential. Therefore, we are always look-ing for the most anatomical reduction. Nevertheless, no recommendation describes the percentage of frontal, sagittal and axial translations that can be accepted in this fracture. The aim of this study was to predict the bone remodeling and its consequences after a supracondylar fracture in chil-dren and thus to know if a revision surgery would be necessary.Our study includes 351 children who presented this frac-ture between 2004 and 2017, and who were above the age of 11 for girls and 13 for boys in 2021. The Baumann angle, the sagittal and frontal translations were calculated and the anterior humeral line was drawn on radiographs right after surgery, after material removal, and at the end of the elbow bone maturation. A radio-clinical evaluation was performed on each patient at the end of their growth. 97 patients were followed until bone maturity. Final results showed that frontal translations were fully corrected. When the Baumann angle wasn't within the normal ranges, only 7% was corrected after osteosynthesis material removal. The average sagittal translation correction was 9,1% at bone maturity. There was no significant influence of age nor sex. Clinical results show a complete recovery of range of motion and a painless return to sports. A modi-fied carrying angle is the principal clinical consequence in case of incomplete correction of the Baumann angle. We obtained objective remodeling criteria to establish the need for revision surgery, especially when the Baumann angle is not restored for it is responsible for an elbow varus or valgus which is not cosmetically acceptable. Sagittal translations were also poorly remodeled, but without important clinical consequences. Lastly, frontal translation may be subject to a simple radiographic monitoring. TRAUMA 1 OP-69 The fare of the malrotated elbow supracondylar fractures. Is really deformity in elbow supracon- dylar fractures (SCF) has an uncertain prognosis. It has been linked to elbow varus deformity and it is unknown the amount that can be acceptable. Objective: Evaluate the relationship between varus and malrotation and define if a rotation value exists that deter - mines the outcome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of SCF type 3 (2012- 2016), with residual malrotation. Clinically: both elbow movement, shoulders rotation arch (SRA), and elbow carrying angle (CA) were evaluated. The DASH score and the Flynn criteria were used to assess the outcome.66 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Radiologically: displacement direction and fracture shape were assessed on initial X-rays. The postoperative fracture rotation (PFR) was measured on the postoperative radiograph. Comparative X-rays were used for the final assessment. Means and SD, medians, and ranges were used for con- tinuous variables, Mann Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. A correlation was studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: 27/46 patients agree to enter the study. Mean age was 4yr (1-9yr), mean F-U 55m (see Table). No correlation was found between the initial displace- ment direction or fracture shape and the change in CA or SRA.A low correlation was found between the PFR and the final CA (r = 0.34) and between PFR and SRA (r = 0.37) A low-moderate correlation was found between PFR and the final Flynn result (r = 0,43), but no correlation between PFR and DASH score (r = 0.006). There was some relationship between age at fracture time and final Flynn with older children doing worse, similarly the longer the follow-up the better the result (p-value 0.16) Conclusions: Malrotation up to 20\u00ba has good functional outcomes (96%). Shoulder rotation did not change the functional outcome. The relationship between varus and malrotation was poor. A low correlation was found between the amount of fracture rotation and final CA.

Although many aspects of treatment are covered in these recommendations, both the American and British Orthopaedic Associations do not recommend the exact duration of immobilisation post-operatively.This study compared outcomes of operatively managed supracondylar fractures immobilised post-operatively for short immobilisation (SI) defined as 28 days or less, with long immobilisation (LI) defined as more than 28 days. The outcomes measured were clinical (deformity, range of motion, pin site infection) and radiological (loss of posi-tion after removal of K wires, Baumann's angle, anterior humeral line, refracture, signs of osteomyelitis). The study was a retrospective cohort study and included 193 paediatric supracondylar fractures over a four year period which were treated with manipulation under anaes-thetic and K-wire fixation. Demographic data was recorded to evaluate and ensure satisfactory matching of the two groups for analysis. The SI group were immobilised for 27.5 days on average (SD 1.23) and the LI group were immobilised for 43.9 days on average (SD 5.57). Although the average difference in time kept in plaster for the two groups was statistically significant, there was no difference in rate of infection, refracture, range of motion or deformity. Our study therefore suggests that early EPOS Abstract Book 67 mobilisation of these patients (SI group) does not yield a higher rate of complications including refracture and malunion. TRAUMA 1 OP-71 Does shorter time to treatment of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures impact clinical Introduction and Objective: Treatment of supracondy- lar humerus (SCH) fractures within 18 hours of presenta-tion is a tracked metric for ranking of pediatric orthopedic hospitals. This contrasts the literature that shows time to treatment does not impact outcomes in SCH fractures. We aim to determine whether an 18-hour cutoff for pedi-atric SCH fractures is clinically significant for hospitals by comparing the complication risks of patients on either side of this timepoint. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of clinical outcomes was performed for 472 pediatric patients who underwent surgical management of isolated supra-condylar humerus fractures between 1997 and 2022 at a single level I pediatric trauma hospital. The cohort was then split based on the time to surgery ( < 18 hours or 18 hours from ED admission). Results: Definitive fracture treatment occurred < 18 hours of arrival in 435 (76.9%) patients and 18 hours in 37 (26.1%) patients. Mean age in the cohort was 5.6\u00b12.2 years and 51.5% of patients were female. Gartland fracture classification was either type II (n = 152 [32.3%]), type III (n = 284 [60.3%]), type IV (n = 13 [2.8%]) or flexion-type (n = 18 [3.8%]). There were no differences in demographic characteristics or fracture classification between cohorts. Fractures in the 18-hour cohort were treated more com-monly with 2 pins (62.2% vs 38.5%, p = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in open vs. closed reduction, utilization of medial pins, or post-operative immobilization. No differences were detected in post-operative complications, including non-union, delayed union, stiffness, malunion, loss of reduction, iatrogenic nerve injury, or infection. This remained true when all type II fractures were excluded. Conclusions: Using an arbitrary time cutoff of < 18 hours does not influence clinical outcomes in the surgical treat- ment of SCH fractures. Quality metrics that truly impact clinical outcomes should be utilized to rank hospitals and improve patient care for this common fracture. TRAUMA 1 OP-72 Displaced Medial Epicondyle Fractures in Pediatric Age: AVEIRO, Portugal 2Department Pediatric Hospital Pedi\u00e1trico - CHUC, EPE, Coimbra, Portugal Objective: The treatment of isolated and displaced medial humeral epicondyle fractures in pediatric age is controver - sial. The recommended options are: plaster cast immobili-zation without reduction or open reduction and internal fixation. Our objective: compare the functional and radio-logical results obtained with the conservative and surgical treatment of isolated fractures of medial epicondyle with deviation of 5-15mm. Methods: Retrospective comparative study, including children with medial epicondyle fracture, deviation 5-15mm, treated in our Hospital, period 2011-2021. We excluded fractures with < 5mm displacement or joint entrapment of the epicondyle. Demographic, clinical and radiographic data were collected. The QuickDASH ques-tionnaire was applied by telephone for functional assess-ment. Compared results obtained for patients treated surgically or conservatively. Statistically significant differ - ences were considered for p < 0.05. Results: We included 38 children: 22 in the Conservative Group (GCon) and 16 in the Surgical Group (GCir). The GCon included 15 boys and the GCir included 14 (p = 0.167). The mean age was 10.6\u00b13.8 years in the GCon group and 11.3\u00b13.0 in the GCir (p = 0.314). 0 patients in the GCon and 1 in the GCir had initial neurological alterations (p = 0.235) The median deviation of the epicondyle was 6 (5-12) mm in GCon and 8 (6-17) mm in GCir (p = 0.142). The QuickDash was 0 (0-4.5) in TCon and 0 (0-4.5) in TCir (p = 0.285), performed on average at 28.3\u00b117.9 months of follow-up in and 41.9\u00b121.8months in Tcir (p = 0.610). Asymptomatic pseudarthrosis was observed in 0 patients from TCir and 10 from TCon (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Similar functional results were observed after conservative and surgical treatment of medial epicon-dyle fractures with a deviation of 5-15mm. Pseudarthrosis 68 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) only affected patients undergoing conservative treatment and did not impair function. Relevance: Treatment of displaced medial epicondyle fractures should be personalized. The risks and benefits of both surgical and conservative options should be discussed with patients and families, and it is advisable to share the final therapeutic decision. TRAUMA 1 OP-73 Resorbable Magnesium Screws for fixation of Medial Epicondyle Immature (ME) fractures are treated with ORIF with K-wires or screws. Rates of implant prominence, failure or nonunion reported are con-siderable. Magnesium (Mg) screws have demonstrated bio-compatibility, osteoconductivity and high pull-out strength. The aim of this study was to compare surgical fixation of ME fracture using resorbable Mg Herbert screws (Figure 3 and Figure 4) to K-wires (Figure 1 and Figure 2), in skele-tally immature patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed from January 2015 to April 2020. Inclusion criteria were: dis-placed ME fracture, < 15 years, absence of concomitant ipsilateral upper limb fractures. Two consecutive cohorts based on fixation device were made: Group A (wires) and Group B (Mg screws). Alignment, pain, range of motion (ROM), Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and radiological healing were assessed. Results: 27 patients were included, 15 in Group A and 12 in Group B. Groups were comparable for age and sex. Mean follow up was higher in group A (38,73 \u00b1 3,15 vs 26,18 \u00b1 4,85 months; p < 0,001). No significant differences were observed regarding ROM, alignment, pain and MEPS, with excellent results in both groups. Two patients in Group A developed a deep wound pin site infection requiring antibiotics. X-rays revealed 3 cases of non-union in Group A and 1 in Group B, all of them asymptomatic. No patient required a second surgical procedure. Conclusions: ORIF of ME fractures with Mg screws showed comparable results to a widely accepted procedure such as the use of K-wires, potentially with a lower inci-dence of nonunion and infection. No adverse reactions were recorded.TRAUMA 2 OP-74 Neglected seymour fractures of the hallux in children. Shall we fix or not, transarticular or extra-articular if Halil Demir3 1Gaziantep Islamic Science and Technology University, Faculty of Medicine , Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Gaziantep, Turkey 2T.C. Ministry Health Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Elaz, Turkey 3T.C. Ministry of Health ehitkamil State Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Gaziantep, Turkey Introduction and Objective: Seymour fractures are a fracture pattern involving the distal phalangeal physis, accompanied by nail bed injury.Contrary to other pediatric fractures, these fractures have a high risk of infection and osteomyelitis due to misdiagnosis or late diagnosis. In this study we aimed to analyse and compare three different approaches in neglected Seymour fractures without a stan-dard treatment algorithm. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was con- ducted to evaluate children aged 18 years or younger who underwent operative treatment Seymoure fracture of the hallux with an associated nail bed injury from December 2016 to October 2021.Patients who presented more than 48 hours after injury were considered late presentation and were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups according to the management: Transarticular fixation with a single k wire (TFx), extra-articular fixation with two crossed k wires (EFx) and without fixation (WFx). Results: Forty-four patients with at least 12 months of follow-up were included in the study. Average age of patients 9.31 years old \u00b1 1.56. The TFx group consisted of 16 patients, the EFx group of 17, and the WFx group of 11. There was a strong correlation between the time to diag-nosis and the risk of osteomyelitis (p < ,00000, r = 0,829, Spearman's correlation). In the WFx group, loss of reduc-tion was found to be significantly higher in the follow-up compared to the other groups (p < 0,048) (Table 1). TFx was the group that reach the longest time to achieve full range of motion at the interphalangeal joint (Table 1). Conclusions: In the absence of a delicate examination and a skeptical clinical approach in Seymour fractures, late diagnosis and treatment, and as a result, increased compli-cations are inevitable. We advocate fixation with k wire together with nail bed repair in neglected seymour frac-tures, both extra-articular and transarticular fixation may be favored with comparable outcomes.EPOS Abstract Book 69 Table 1. multiple comparison of demographic variables and complications between groups.

Clavicle frac-tures represent the most common orthopedic birth injury, involving approximately 0.2% to 3.5% of births. Hypotheses: Cesarean delivery, elective or necessary, along with the type of presentation, may play a determi-nant role in the etiology of obstetrical fractures. Materials and methods: We chose to do a retrospective study to determine possible risk factors for this type of injury that may manifest in either delivery. Our aim was to deepen our knowledge in order to have a better prediction and a better management of this condition. Data gathered included parity, gestity, type of delivery, presentation, shoulder dystocia, type of fracture, birth weight, and APGAR score. Results: We followed 136 patients that were diagnosed with Allman type I clavicle fracture, 32 of them also hav-ing brachial plexus birth palsy type 1 (Duchenne-Erb). Natural birth with a pelvic presentation imposes a relative risk of 6,2 of associated pathologies compared to cranial presentation. Cesarean delivery and cranial presentation increase the risk of related pathologies by 5.04 compared to natural birth. Statistically, pelvic presentation is 5,54 times more likely to develop related pathologies than cra-nial presentation.This logistic regression model shows that multiparity decreases the risk of birth injuries by 84% compared to primiparity for a particular birth weight and a specific type of delivery. The logistic regression model based on birth weight and type of delivery varies accord-ing to the confidence intervals that we choose and builds an Predictive modeling. Conclusion: Cesarean delivery brings risks for the newborn and should be practiced only when necessary.

TRAUMA 2 OP-76 Open access for institutional outcomes of pediatric fracture care 2T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Hospital, Helsinki, Finland Introduction and Objective: U.S. Newsweek ranks the best children's hospitals using an online survey. The total score in orthopedics is a complex incomprehensible sum of different issues. Assessment of the quality of fracture treatment is based on the total number of fractures treated, and specifically on treatment of grade III supracondylar and femoral shaft fractures. It might be better to display outcomes of pediatric fracture care publicly be displayed in an open access format? Materials and Methods: Equivalent data to the U.S. ranking system for pediatric fracture care was sought from our institutional fracture register (Kid's fracture tool). The register includes an online survey of patient sat-isfaction to surgical treatment (Likert scale 0-10). Register data accuracy was confirmed from patient files concern-ing timing, complications of treatment, and outcomes of grade III supracondylar and femoral shaft fractures. We then shared all this information in an open access format in our web pages. Results: During 2021 the total number of under 16-year- olds treated for a fracture in our hospital was 2105. Risk of an infection after internal fixation of closed fracture was 1.4% (7/361, all superficial infections). Grade III supracondylar humerus fractures (n = 32) were all pinned (11 after open reduction), and 17/19 of the femoral shaft fractures were operated within 18 hours of admission. We had no unexpected returns to operative room, secondary corrective surgery or complications of treatment. Mean satisfaction after surgery (64 respondents) was 9.1 (range, 2-10). Conclusions: The quality of treatment of children's frac- tures in our institution was satisfactory in 2021. We had no deep infections after internal fixation of closed fractures, no complications of treatment and no re-do operations after primary surgery. We encourage all institutions treat-ing children's fractures to implement an institutional frac-ture register and to make their results public. TRAUMA 2 OP-77 Pediatric forearm shaft refractures treated Otorhinolaryngology, Department of Paediatrics, Clinical Complex, University Medical University Graz, Austria, Graz, Austria 3Department of Pediatric surgery and orthopedics, Lausanne University Medical Center, Switzerland, Lausanne, Switzerland 4Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, Landesklinikum Baden/Moedling, Austria, Baden, Austria 5Department of Orthopedics, Hvidovre Hvidovre, Denmark, Hvidovre, Denmark 6Peterfy Hospital and Manninger Jen National Trauma center Paediatric Trauma Department, Hungary, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Pediatric forearm diaphyseal refracture is a relatively common complication of a forearm fracture, seen in about 5% of cases. Refracture most often is caused by the repetition of the same injury up to 6 months after the initial injury. Surgery is recommended in cases of dis-placed or unstable fractures, especially in the proximal and midshaft, where the remodeling potential is lower. The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and complications of using Resorbable Stable Intra-medullary Nailing (ReSIN) and casting in the treatment of forearm shaft refractures in children. Materials and methods: A prospective multicenter study started in 9/2020, including 8 centers from 7 coun-tries. Inclusion criteria are children aged 3-12 years with 72 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) a closed diaphyseal forearm fracture needing reduction and osteosynthesis. Exclusion criteria are comminuted or wedge fractures and associated bone diseases. Analysis of refractured (after conservative or flexible intramedullary nailing treatment) forearm fractures which indicated operative procedure. The data was retrieved from the patient charts and critical descriptive analysis was performed. Results: In a total of 123 children treated with resorbable nails, we identified 8 refractures of the forearm in children, which occurred at a mean of 8,6 (2-18) months after the primary fracture. Four boys, four girls, mean age 7,1 years (6-10). Four reftractures were treated by ReSIN after con-servative treatment and four patinets were operated after flexible intramedullary nailing. Technical difficulties with closed intramedullary canal prompted open reduction in two patients. Conclusions: Operative treatment of refractures with PLGA-based biodegradable implants is a safe and suc-cessful treatment option in pediatric forearm refractures. Resorbable implants have multiple advantages. By fixa-tion with biodegradable implants removal operations are unnecessary and related costs will be avoided. There is no need for a secondary hospitalization and second gen-eral anesthesia, which may cause pain and anxiety for the children. TRAUMA 2 OP-78 Management of Paediatric Forearm fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic: Outcomes from a large secondary care Forearm fractures account for nearly 40% of all paediatric fractures. British Orthopaedic association published guidelines for management of traumatic condi-tions during the COVID-19 pandemic, though controver - sies still exist. Recent studies have highlighted the effect of the pandemic on the epidemiology and treatment of paedi-atric forearm injuries, warning us of delays and increased complication rates. Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinico-radiological outcomes of paediatric forearm frac-tures during the pandemic at a large secondary care centre from March 2020 to March 2022.Methods: Medical records and radiographs of 807 paedi-atric patients presenting to the emergency with forearm injuries during the pandemic were reviewed. Results: The cohort (average age 9.5 years, 1-16 years) included 450 buckle fractures, 113 undisplaced fractures, 146 displaced fractures requiring manipulation and 98 patients requiring surgical fixation. Manipulation was suc-cessfully performed in 77 cases in the emergency depart-ment. Interventions were performed within 48 hours in all except 2 cases. The average duration of follow up was 3 months (0.5-18 months). Complications ( < 1%) included loss of reduction, refracture, transient nerve palsies and wire migration. We noted a satisfactory result in all cases at the time of final follow-up. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprece- dented pressures on the health system affecting trauma services. Our study showed that with careful planning, paediatric forearm fractures can be managed with good outcomes and low complication rates with efficient use of resources. TRAUMA 2 OP-79 RESULTS IN RADIAL NECK FRACTURES NEEDING OPEN REDUCTION. Is the prognosis so bad? Ignacio Sanpera1, Marta Salom2, Valencia, Spain 3Hospital Universitari La Fe, Valencia, Spain Introduction: Major displacement, old age, and the need for open reduction in radial neck fractures (RNF) in children are bound to a poor prognosis (> 50% cases). Objective: Evaluate the midterm results in patients with severely displaced radial read fractures that required open reduction (OR). Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with RNF requiring OR (2000-2010). Patients were assessed clinically and radiologically. Elbow range of motion, prono-supination arch (PSA), and elbow carrying angle were evaluated. The Quick Dash and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) were used for functional scoring.EPOS Abstract Book 73 Preoperative fractures were classified using the Judet classification. A comparative radiological eval- uation was done at the final evaluation. The fixation method and postoperative complications were also recorded. Confidence Intervals, means, and quartiles were used for analysis. Results: We recall 12 of the 17 identified patients. The median age was 8yr and the mean F-U was 52m. was affected in most patients (8/12; 66,7% (IC95% 40,0% - ) 5,0 -53,8). Functionally according to MEPI, most patients were graded good or excellent. The pain was the most important cause of a drop in results. The degree of loss of PSA did not correlate with the outcome (Graphic 1). Postoperative complications, a larger head, or pre- mature physis closure did not correlate with the final result. Conclusions: Results at midterm for RNF needing open fractures are good. Early OA changes in some cases sug- gest a possible deterioration in the future. The MEPI may not have enough sensitivity to detect significant changes in the PSA in this group of patients. TRAUMA 3 OP-80 Elastic Stable Intramedullary Nailing and Temporary External Fixation for the Treatment of Unstable Femoral Shaft Fractures in Children Aged 5-11 Years Old A Retrospective Study of 28 Cases Yunan Lu 1, Federico Canavese2, Shunyou Chen1 1Fuzhou Second Hospital of Xiamen University, Fuzhou, China 2Lille University Centre, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille, France Purpose: Unstable femoral shaft fractures (UFSFs) in children aged 5-11 years remain challenging due to their intrinsic instability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of UFSF in chil-dren aged 5 to 11 years managed by the combined use of ESIN and temporary EF. Methods: Children with UFSF (long oblique and commi- nuted) treated by ESIN and temporary EF were retrospec-tively reviewed. Sex, age at injury, side involved, type of fracture, presence or absence of associated lesions or neu-rovascular complications, type of treatment, time from trauma to surgery, duration of surgery, radiation exposure and length of postoperative immobilization were collected from the medical charts. Radiological and functional out-comes were evaluated according to Beaty's and Flynn's criteria, respectively. Results: A total of 28 consecutive patients with closed or open (Gustilo type I or II) UFSF were reviewed (18 boys and 10 girls). The mean age at injury was 8.7 \u00b1 1.6 years (range, 5-11); the average weight was 38.1 \u00b1 7.6 kg (range, 26-55). The mean hospital stay was 3.7 \u00b1 1.4 days (range, 2-7), and the mean time to EF and ESIN removal was 6.5 \u00b1 1.1 weeks (range, 4-8) and 9.4 \u00b1 1.6 months (range, 6-12), respectively. Twenty-seven out of 28 patients had excellent radiographic outcomes according to Beaty's criteria, and 24/28 had excellent functional outcomes according to Flynn's criteria. Overall, 4 complications (14.3%) were recorded. No statistically significant correla-tion was found between complication rates and sex, age, weight or fracture characteristics (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The combined use of ESIN and temporary EF provides good clinical and radiological outcomes in children with UFSF aged between 5 and 11 years, with a reduced complication rate.74 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) EPOS Abstract Book 75 Tables: Table 1. beaty's criteria (radiological outcome) satisfactory poor shortening < 1 cm > 1 cm lengthening None present Coronal angulation Table 2. flynn's titanium elastic Nails grading system (functional outcome) excellent satisfactory poor limb length discrepancy < 1 cm 1-2 cm > 2 cm malalignment < 5\u00b0 5\u00b0-10\u00b0 > 10\u00b0 pain None None present Complication None minor/resolved major/lasting Table 3.

The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to evaluate the correlation between the time needed to achieve radiological union and the number, size and location of partially threaded cannulated screws (PTCSs) in children with displaced PFNFs. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 136 children (mean age: 10.6 \u00b1 3.8 years) with displaced PFNFs treated by 2 (n = 103) or 3 (n = 33) PTCSs was carried out. Student's t- tests, one-way ANOV A and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the variables affecting the time needed to achieve radiological fracture healing according to the number, size and position of PTCSs, as assessed on plain radiographs. Results: A total of 132 hips achieved union an average of 3.2 \u00b1 1.6 months after the initial surgery. The time needed to achieve union in patients treated with 2 or 3 PTCSs was comparable (P = 0.36). Among the fractures treated by 2 PTCSs, the time needed to achieve union did not correlate with the size of the implant (P = 0.122) or with the angula- tion between PTCSs on anterior-posterior (P = 0.257) and lateral radiographs (P = 0.547). The time needed to achieve union in the fractures that were fully compressed by the implants was similar to the partially compressed fractures (P = 0.08). Conclusions: The number, size and position of PTCSs do not affect the radiological healing in children with dis-placed PFNFs treated surgically. TRAUMA 3 OP-82 Recovery of gait the first year after intramedullary nail fixation of pediatric femoral shaft fracture Marianne Flinck1, Jacques Riad2 11) Department of Orthopaedics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. 2) Department of Orthopaedics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden., Gothenburg, Sweden 21) Department of Orthopaedics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. 2) Department of Orthopaedics, Skaraborg Hospital, Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden, Skovde, Sweden Introduction and Objective: Pediatric femoral fractures are commonly treated with intramedullary nail fixation in school-aged children. Outcome is often reported with radio-graphic findings, pain, leg length discrepancy, malalign-ment, non-union and refracture. There are limited reports on time to expected recovery of physical function, including objective quantitative measures, which could guide the rehabilitation process. The purpose was to study recovery of gait after femoral shaft fracture in children and adolescents.78 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Materials and Methods: Seven females and 11 males, between 6.3 - 15.8 years of age, with a femoral shaft frac-ture treated with intramedullary nail/nails, participated in the prospective longitudinal study. Exclusion criteria were pathological fractures, inability to perform three-dimen-sional gait analysis (3D GA), other physical impairment or injuries that influence gait. At clinical follow-up at 6 and 12 weeks, assessment of physical function regarding mobilization, and weight bearing was performed. In the gait laboratory 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post- operatively, 3D GA (temporospatial data, kinematics and kinetics) and observational tests were performed. Results: At the six weeks clinical follow-up 16 of 18 (88%) participants were using walking aids and at twelve weeks 25%. Correspondingly, 35% could stand on the injured leg and 83% at 6 and 12 weeks respectively. Results from the gait laboratory are presented in Table 1 and 2. Conclusions: Early recovery, between 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively, was noted in basic observational tests after femoral shaft fractures in children and adolescents. The objective quantitative assessment with 3D GA revealed normalization of gait pattern at 6 months although subtle differences were still noted. Interestingly the force data revealed increased hip extensor- and flexor muscles work on the fractured side, most likely a compensation mechanism. These findings could prove useful in the reha-bilitation and decision on return to physical activities after femoral shaft fracture in children and adolescents. EPOS Abstract Book 79 TRAUMA 3 OP-83 Variables influencing radiological fracture healing in children with femoral neck fractures treated surgically: A review of 177 cases Wentao Wang 1, Federico Canavese2, Shunyou Chen3 1Scientific Research Center, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China 2Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille University Center, Lille cedex, France 3FuZhou Second Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, FuZhou, China Introduction and Objective: This study aimed: (1) to determine the probability of and the amount of time needed to achieve fracture healing in children with displaced fem-oral neck fractures (FNFs) treated surgically; and (2) to determine which factors can affect both the probability of and the amount of time needed to achieve radiological fracture healing in those patients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 177 children (mean age 10.5 \u00b1 3.9 years) with FNFs treated surgically. Risk factors, including age, sex, laterality, the mechanism of injury, the initial displacement severity, the type of fracture, the time to reduction, the reduction method, the fixation method and the reduction quality, were recorded. Furthermore, the presence of a comminuted medial or posterior cortex on anteroposterior (AP) or lateral radiographs was also recorded. Results: A total of 172 hips (97.2%) achieved radiological fracture healing. Severe initial displacement, a commi-nuted cortex on the AP or lateral radiographs and poor reduction quality significantly increased the time needed to achieve radiological fracture healing (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis indicated that the cumulative probabil-ity of achieving fracture healing increased linearly during the first 6 months and then plateaued, with a monthly increase of less than 5%. The severity of initial displace-ment, presence/absence of comminution on the medial or posterior cortex, and reduction quality were factors influ-encing the probability of achieving fracture healing within the first 6 months after injury (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Radiological union of displaced pediatric FNFs treated surgically increases linearly during the first six month after surgery and then it tends to plateau. Risk factors for nonunion are severe initial displacement, poor reduction quality and the presence of comminuted medial or posterior cortex on AP or lateral radiographs; the same factors are associated with a longer time to achieve fracture healing. 80 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) TRAUMA 3 OP-84 Osteochondral injuries: The relation between strong clinical suspicion to on-time diagnosis of the fracture and early Hospital, Athens, Greece Introduction and Objective: Osteochondral injuries in children must be treated immediately to avoid early degen-erative changes. The purpose of this study is to examine the period between the injury, the diagnosis and the treat-ment and the efficacy of on time surgical fixation as well as possible factors associated to favorable outcome in 1 year's period follow up. Materials & Methods: A retrospective study of patients who were treated at our department the last 2 years for osteochondral injury. Demographics, history, imaging tests and clinical progression at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months fol-low-up were recorded. Results: 15 children: 12(80%) with knee and 3(20%) with ankle osteochondral injury respectively have been treated. The mean age was 12(SD = 2) years and 50% were boys. 50% presented with an AP lower extremity injury. The median age between the injury and the evaluation in the emergency department was 2 (IQR, 0-2) days. The osteo-chondral damage in the knee joint was related to patella dislocation whereas in the ankle recurrent sprain was co-existent. X-ray and MRI revealed the injury. 5 (33%) chil-dren were treated with arthroscopic fixation of the in situ enlarged fragment while 10 (33%) who had a free piece of fracture fragment were treated with mini open fixation after rejuvenation & reduction using bio-absorbable pins. For each year of age the probability for free fragment increases by 25% (p < 0.1). Three months after the surgery, an MRI scan was performed. Recovery was complete in 11(73%), 14(93%) and 15(100%) patients at 6, 9 and 12 months respectively. Immediate attendance and diagnosis on the day of injury increases recovery by 60% at 6 months (p < 0.1). Conclusions: Evaluation by the pediatric orthopedic the day of the injury results in timely treatment of the osteo- chondral fragment by fixation contributes decisively to the restoration of the functionality of the joint. TRAUMA 3 OP-85 Virtual Reality reduces anxiety of children in the plaster room: A Randomised Controlled Trial Maximiliaan Poppelaars1, Lisa Netherlands, Netherlands 2Foundation for Orthopaedic Research, Care & Education, Amphia Hospital, Breda, the Netherlands, Breda, Netherlands 3Department of Surgery, Hospital, Breda, the Netherlands, Breda, Netherlands 4Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam the Netherlands, Rotterdam, Netherlands Background: Paediatric fractures are highly prevalent and are most often treated with plaster. The application and removal of plaster is often an anxious experience for chil-dren. Decreasing anxiety may improve patients' satisfac-tion and the quality of healthcare. Virtual reality (VR) has proven to effectively distract children and reduce their anxiety in other clinical settings, and it seems to have a similar effect during plaster treatment. This study aims to investigate further the effect of VR on the anxiety level of children with fractures that undergo plaster removal or replacement in the plaster room. EPOS Abstract Book 81 Methods: This study was designed as a randomised con- trolled trial. A total of 257 patients were included, aged 5 to 17 years, who needed plaster treatment for upper or lower extremity fractures. The intervention group was dis-tracted with VR goggles and headphones during the plaster treatment, whereas the control group received standard care. As the primary outcome, the level of anxiety was measured with the Child Fear Scale (CFS). Secondary out-comes included the children's anxiety reduction (differ - ence between CFS after and CFS before plaster procedure), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain, NRS satisfaction of the children and accompanying parents/guardians, and the children's heart rates during the procedure. An unpaired samples t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test (depending on the data distribution) was used to analyse the data. Results: The post-procedural CFS was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the intervention group (median 0.0, IQR 0.0- 0.0) than the control group (median 0.0, IQR 0.0-1.0). The anxiety reduction, NRS pain and satisfaction scores and heart rates showed no significant differences between the control group and the intervention group. Conclusion: VR effectively reduces the anxiety levels of children in the plaster room, especially in the younger age group (5-11 years). No statistically significant effects were seen regarding pain, heart rate and satisfaction. FOOT & INFECTION OP-87 Quantitative Scoring of Gait Analysis in Ponseti-treated Clubfoot patients; A Pilot study in London, United Kingdom Introduction: The benefit of Gait analysis (GA) in assess- ment of Ponseti-treated clubfeet is ill-defined. Having used GA routinely in our Ponseti patients from age 5, we developed and piloted a scoring system using 6 parameters to analyse data in unilateral clubfeet, comparing with the contra-lateral foot. Patients & methods: 62 unilateral clubfeet treated using the Ponseti technique (median casts 5, tenotomy rate 81%, brace compliance 61%) were assessed using 3D instru-mented GA (Motek GRAIL treadmill system) at 5 years. GA was scored out of 6 on; heel strike, second rocker, early heel rise (hindfoot tightness, HFT), dynamic supina-tion (DS), dorsiflexion in swing (DFS), and ankle power (AP), and graded as symmetrical with contra-lateral foot (1), asymmetrical within normal range (0.5) or outside normal range (0).Results: In 40 patients with excellent function, median gait score was 6/6 (3-6). Minor asymmetries in DFS/DS were seen in 11 (34%), and HFT in 13 (41%). In 12 patients with recurrence, median GA score was 4 (0.5-5.50. GA identified isolated HFT in 2, pure DS in 5, combined HFT/DS in 5. In 2 cases it identified DS when clinically, HFT masked midfoot function in swing. Residual HFT/DS were significantly commoner in non- compliant feet. Mild asymmetry of HFT was commoner without tenotomy. AP was symmetrical in 81% of those with good func- tion, even with increasing walking speeds, but in only 42% of recurrences. Conclusions: This scoring system illustrated mild asym- metry in HFT and DFS/DS missed clinically, even in those with good function and compliance, highlighting those who might benefit from closer follow-up. It aided management decisions in recurrence, eg high- lighting need for tendon transfer in significant HFT, and need for repeat tenotomy with tendon transfer. Higher GA scores and lower HFT and DFS/DS abnor - malities in compliant patients provides quantitative evi-dence of the importance of bracing. FOOT & INFECTION OP-88 Four years follow-up of orthotic treatment in children with clubfoot born between 2015-2017. A national Swedish Health, Motoriklab, Q2:07, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden 3Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Orthopaedics, Lund, Sweden Introduction and Objective: This study aimed to describe the first four years of orthotic treatment in children with clubfoot using Swedish national clubfoot registry data. Secondly, this study aimed to explore factors influencing compliance with orthotic treatment. Materials and Methods: A national register, the Swedish Pediatric Orthopedic Quality register, was used to extract data on children with clubfoot born between 2015 - 2017. Extracted data included demographic data; information on orthotic treatment from the start of orthotic treatment, and at one- and four years follow-ups. The gold standard of clubfoot treatment in Sweden is the Ponseti method.82 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Results: Of 386 registered children with clubfoot, 320 children (83%) had complete data (one, and four years follow-up) and were included in the study. Of these, 93% were prescribed a foot abduction brace (FAB) at the start of treatment, and 7% had a unilateral orthosis with or with-out a knee component, or other option. Before the age of one year, 15% of the children changed the type of orthosis, and between one and four years of age, the corresponding number was 24%. Orthosis use at one year was > 10 h for 79 % of the children, and 60% at four years. 77% of the children continued with orthotic treatment until at least four years of age. Children ending orthotic treatment before four years of age had a significantly lower Pirani score at diagnosis (p < 0.001). Additionally, sleeping prob- lems and low orthosis acceptance were mentioned. Conclusions: The vast majority of included children com- plied with the orthotic treatment according to the Ponseti method. However, 25% ended treatment prematurely, con-sequently, this group requires further investigation. These numbers may serve as baseline values for orthotic treat-ment, valuable for planning future clubfoot treatment, as well as for evaluating time trends of children born with clubfoot. FOOT & INFECTION OP-89 Recurrent Toe Walking in Pediatric Orthopedic Patients: Idiopathic versus Concomitant Sensory Processing Disorders Polk1, Claire Shivers1, Chanhee Jo1, Anthony Riccio1 1Texas Scottish Rite Hospital, Dallas, United States Introduction and Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare rates of recurrent toe-walking following operative intervention between idiopathic toe walkers and toe walkers with associated sensory processing/autism spectrum disorders. Methods: An IRB-approved retrospective r eview of patients at a single pediatric institution who underwent surgical treatment for toe-walking over a 12-year period was conducted. Children with peripheral or central neu-rologic disorders, muscle disorders, congenital foot/extremity deformities, prior ankle/foot surgery, and those not managed with an isolated triceps surae procedure were excluded. The remaining patients were divided into those with idiopathic toe-walking (ITW Group) and those with toe-walking associated with sensory processing/autism spectrum disorders (SPD Group). Recurrence of toe walking and need for additional surgery for recurrence were compared between cohorts.Results: 106 patients met inclusion criteria. 29 patients (27%) had an associated sensory processing disorder, and the remaining 77 patients comprised the ITW group. There were no differences between groups in length of follow-up (p = 0.08) or type of initial surgery performed (p = 0.48). The SPD group contained a significantly greater percent-age of males (75% vs 56%, p = 0.01) and were younger at the age of index surgery (8.5 vs 10 years, p = 0.03). At an average follow-up time of 1.2 years, 11 patients (10%) developed clinical recurrence, of whom, 4 underwent a subsequent intervention. Recurrences occurred at an aver - age of 2.5 years following the index procedure. Patients in the SPD group had significantly higher rates of recurrence than idiopathic toe walkers (24% vs 5%, p = 0.009). Multivariate regression analysis adjusting for gender and age at index surgery demonstrated that an underlying sen-sory processing disorder was an independent predictor of recurrence (p = 0.018, OR = 7.5, 95% CI [1.5-45.2]). Conclusion: Clinical recurrence following the surgical treatment of toe-walking is over seven times greater in children with autism spectrum and/or other sensory pro-cessing disorders than idiopathic counterparts. FOOT & INFECTION OP-90 Sonication for Detection of Colonization Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany 2Charit\u00e9 - University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany Introduction and Objective: Sonication has emerged as a gold standard diagnostic to rule out implant-associated infection in arthroplasty, spinal and trauma surgery, but its role in non-spinal paediatric orthopaedics has not yet been described. This study aimed at exploring the frequency of bacte- rial colonization of paediatric orthopaedic implants by sonication. Materials and Methods: Sonication culture results and relevant data of all patients who underwent implant removal between 01/2019 and 11/21 at a single institu-tion and had been < 18 years at index implantation were retrospectively reviewed. Sonication culture results were classified according to microbial growth as negative (no/non-significant growth)\" or positive (colonized signifi-cant growth). Descriptive statistics were performed, cor - relations were analyzed via crosstabs and univariate ANOV A (p < 0.05).EPOS Abstract Book 83 Results: 129 sonicated orthopaedic devices from 28 females and 35 males were included. Mean patient age at implantation was 9.8 (range 3.0-15.6) years, mean implant in-situ time was 2.2 (range 0.6-8.8) years. 63 tension band plates, 35 locking screw plates, 26 cannulated screws, three intramedullary nails, and two K-wires were evaluated. 128/129 (99.2%) of implant sites were asymptomatic. Sonication cultures were positive in 19.4%. Mono bacterial growth was detected on 21 implants, on four implants two species were detected. Identified pathogens included Staphylococci (n = 17), Cutibacterium spp. (n = 6), Coryne- bacterium spp. (n = 3), and other (n = 3). Neither non-soni- cation culture results or histology findings nor patient or implant characteristics significantly correlated with sonica-tion results. Conclusions: Sonication demonstrated a positive micro- biologic yield in 19 % of all explants, 99 % of which were removed from asymptomatic sites. Predominant patho-gens were staphylococci, the most common causatives of implant-associated infections in adults. Further research is required to determine the diagnostic role of sonication in paediatric orthopaedics. Insight regarding frequency and clinical relevance of subclinical implant-associated infections may add evidence concerning the discussion of implant removal versus retention in children. FOOT & INFECTION OP-91 Diagnostic Utility of Synovial Fluid Cell Counts and CRP in Pediatric Knee Arthritis: A 10-Year Monocentric, 3Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland Background: Orthopedic surgeons often use the intra- articular white blood counts (WBCs) and the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in the diagnosis of an acute swollen and painful knee joint in children. Today, there is no established threshold for the synovial WBC, and their differentiation, as indicative of native joint knee bacterial arthritis. We determine the sensitivity and speci-ficity of synovial WBCs and PMN percentages in the pre-diction of a community-acquired, acute bacterial native joint septic arthritis (SA) in the pediatric population. Methods: A retrospective study on healthy children 0-16 years of age who underwent knee joint aspiration for a community-acquired, acute irritable knee effusion in our tertiary-care children's hospital between May 2009 and April 2019 was conducted. We divided the study popu-lation into two groups according to the detection of bacte-rial arthritis in the synovial fluid (bacterial arthritis versus its absence) and compared the intra-articular leukocyte and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results: Overall, we found a statistically significant dif- ference regarding the total CRP (p = 0.017), leukocyte or PMN counts (p 0.001 in favor of a bacterial arthritis). In contrast, the percentage of the neutrophils was not deter - minant for the later confirmation of bacterial pathogens, and we were unable to establish diagnostically deter mining minimal thresholds of the intra-articular CRP and leuko-cyte levels. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that either the leu- kocyte or PMN counts may be associated with a bacterial origin of knee arthritis in children. We plan a larger pro-spective interventional study in the future to confirm these findings including the investigation of other joint aspirate biomarkers. SPINE 1 OP-92 Can preoperative supine radiographs predict the spinal alignment observed on the operating table during adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery (AIS) ? Fran\u00e7ois Hospital, France 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France 3Department of Pediatric Surgery, Paris Diderot University, Paris, A great variability exists among surgeons in planning methods for AIS surgery. Preoperative supine full-spine frontal radiograph is one of them, promoted by Lenke, but whether or not it can really predict the intraoperative spinal alignment remains debated. The aim of the study was therefore to compare preoperative supine and intraoperative prone radiographs during AIS posterior fusion. Methods: 139 patients undergoing AIS posterior fusion in a single center were prospectively included. Frontal radiological parameters were compared between the pre-operative full-spine radiograph and the one in prone posi-tion on the operating table, performed at the beginning of 84 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) the procedure to verify the lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) level. Results: A strong correlation was found for all parameters, except for the C7-CSVL (r = 0.3) (distance C7-central sacral vertical line). However, all curvatures were signifi-cantly reduced intraoperatively compared to the preopera-tive supine examination (p = 0.004 for main thoracic and p < 0.0001 for lumbar). The ratio between the main tho- racic apical vertebral translation (A VTMT) and the lumbar one (A VTL) also showed no significant difference (p = 0.2). Subgroup analysis according to Lenke types showed in Lenke 4 curves, significant differences for proximal tho-racic Cobb (p = 0.008), lumbar Cobb (p = 0.03), tilt LIV+1 (p = 0.02), L4 tilt L4 (p = 0.006). Subgroup analysis accord- ing to the Lenke lumbar modifier (A, B or C) showed no significant difference in the different parameters between the two radiographs. Conclusion: Preoperative full-spine radiographs reliably predict intraoperative alignment, and can be accurately used to plan AIS surgery. Further analysis remains neces-sary for Lenke 4 curves. SPINE 1 OP-93 Increasing Cervical Kyphosis Correlates with Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease in Patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Adrian Lin 1, David Skaggs1, Lindsay Andras1, Tyler Tetreault1, Vernon Tolo1, Kenneth Illingworth1 1Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States Introduction/Objective: Evidence of cervical degenera- tive disc disease (DDD) is observed in children with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). We hypothesize that cervical DDD is associated with increasing cervical kyphosis, compensating for a hypokyphotic thoracic align-ment or posterior global alignment. This study investigates the incidence of cervical DDD and its association with cervical kyphosis in children with AIS. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 80 AIS patients > 10 years old (mean 14.1) that had cervi- cal MRI and anterior-posterior and lateral spine radio-graphs within one year of each other at a tertiary children's hospital. Severity of cervical changes was graded by a pediatric orthopaedic spine surgeon using Pfirrmann clas-sification (1 = normal disc, 5 = severe end stage DDD). Cervical sagittal angle (C2-C7), thoracic sagittal angle (T1-T12), and major coronal curve angle were measured. Figure 1. mean C2-C7 angle for each grade of pfirrmann classification [1]. there was a significant difference between C2-C7 angle for pfirrmann grade 1 vs 2, 3, 4 (p < 0.01). Figure 2. 14-year-old female with 50-degree ais, thoracic hypokyphosis and cervical kyphosis with grade 4 cervical DDD changes with evidence of ventral cord effacement at C5-C6. reproduced with permission from the Children's orthopaedic Center, los angeles.Results: Severity of thoracic hypokyphosis (r = 0.49, p < 0.01) and increasing major curve angle (r = 0.22, p = 0.04) were associated with increasing cervical kypho- sis. 35 patients (44%) had no DDD with a mean cervical lordosis of 3.1 \u00b1 7.9\u00b0 and 45 patients (56%) had DDD with a mean cervical kyphosis of 11.1 \u00b1 9.5\u00b0 (p < 0.01). Cervical DDD by Pfirrmann classification was: 24 (30%) stage 2, 18 (22%) stage 3, 3 (4%) stage 4 and 0 stage 5. Mean C2-C7 angles C2-C7 angle differed sig-nificantly for Pfirrmann grade 1 vs. 2, 3, 4 (p < 0.01), and grade 2 vs. 3, 4 (p = 0.02). 9 patients had ventral cord effacement secondary to DDD with a mean C2-C7 of -22.8 \u00b1 8.6\u00b0, compared ventral cord effacement (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study to relate cervical kyphosis in AIS with cervical DDD. Increasing cervical kyphosis was significantly associated with more severe cervical DDD.EPOS Abstract Book 85 SPINE 1 OP-95 Perioperative Cocktail Injection for Patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Undergoing Posterior Spinal Fusion Surgery Clinic, Memphis, United States 2University of TN Health Science Center, Memphis, United States 3Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, Memphis, United States Introduction and Objective: This retrospective cohort study compares post-operative as needed (PRN) opioid consumption pre- and post-implementation of a periopera-tive cocktail injection in patients undergoing posterior spi-nal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Secondary outcomes include pain scores, time to ambula-tion, length of stay, blood loss, 90-day complication rate, operating room time, non-opioid medication usage, and total inpatient medication cost before and after the initia-tion of this practice. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients weighing at least 20 kg who underwent PSF for a primary diagnosis of AIS between January 2017 and December 2020 were identified. Patients who underwent surgery during 2018 were excluded to account for standardization of the prac-tice. Patients were excluded if they had any diagnosis other than AIS, were allergic to any of the experimental medications, or if they were non-ambulatory. Outcomes of patients treated with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was compared to those treated with a weight based peri-operative cocktail containing morphine, ketorolac, epi-nephrine, and ropivacaine. Data was analyzed utilizing the two-sample t-test or Chi-squared test as appropriate. Figure 3. 16-year-old female with 30-degree ais, thoracic hypokyphosis and cervical kyphosis with grade 4 cervical DDD changes with evidence of ventral cord effacement at C4-C6. reproduced with permission from the Children's orthopaedic Center, los angeles.Results: Compared with patients treated post-operatively with PCA, patients treated with a multimodal periopera-tive cocktail injection had significantly less consumption of PRN morphine equivalents (0.3 mEq/kg vs. 0.5 mEq/kg; p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients treated with a periop- erative cocktail had significantly higher rates of ambula-tion on post-operative day 1 compared with those treated with PCA (70.9% vs. 40.4%; p = 0.0023). Conclusions: The administration of a perioperative cock-tail injection is an effective practice that should be consid-ered in the perioperative protocol in patients undergoing PSF for AIS. SPINE 1 OP-96 Is the intraoperative analysis of spinal alignment obtained after correction sufficient to predict postoperative standing frontal balance in adolescent idiopathic Hospital, France 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France 3Department of Pediatric Surgery, Paris are helpful during AIS surgery to control both coronal balance and the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) residual tilt. Despite addi-tional adjustments and strict criteria, some patients still develop adding-on during follow-up. The aim of the study was therefore to compare frontal alignment between intra-operative prone (after correction) and postoperative radio-graphs in AIS patients undergoing posterior fusion. Methods: 139 patients undergoing AIS posterior fusion were prospectively included. Frontal radiological parame-ters were compared between the intraoperative prone radiograph, performed after correction, and the postopera-tive standing radiographs (at 4 months and 1 year). Results: A strong correlation was found between intra- operative and postoperative parameters, except for the C7-CSVL and the LIV-CSVL distances (r = 0.1 and r = 0.4, respectively). This correlation during the follow-up did not change significantly. A significant difference was found for Tilt LIV+1 (p = 0.008) and DWA (p < 0.0001) between intraoperative and postoperative radiographs at 1 year. of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Adding-on occurred in 20%. Subgroup analysis according to LIV level showed significant differences between the two types of radiographs in the L1 groups regarding the apical vertebral translation of lumbar (A VTL) (p = 0.01), the first uninstrumented disc below the LIV (p = 0.03) and the distance C7-CSVL (p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis according to the Lenke lumbar modifier showed signifi-cant differences regarding L4 residual for the C. Conclusion: The final intraoperative radiograph performed after AIS correction can be safely used to predict post-operative standing coronal alignment after thoracic AIS surgery. There is a strong correlation between intraopera-tive and postoperative parameters which is slightly dimin-ished if the LIV is L1 and in Lenke C. SPINE 1 OP-97 Does the addition of convex uniplanar screws in hybrid constructs improve surgical correction in thoracic Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Hospital/ MD, Paris, France 2Department of Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital/ MD-PhD, Paris, France constructs combining lumbar pedicle screws and thoracic sublaminar bands have proved their efficiency and safety in AIS surgery, empha-sizing sagittal correction. The principle is to avoid peri-apical screw placement on the thoracic concave side, where pedicles can be small and dystrophic. Posteromedial translation is the main correction technique,applied via the concave sublaminar bands. Since great frontal and axial correction rates have been reported with all-screws constructs, periapical uniplanar convex screws have been progressively introduced our thoracic constructs. The goal of this study was therefore to analyze the consequence of this adjunction on correction and complication rates. Materials and methods: A total of 147 patients operated for thoracic AIS were included:74 patients with concave sublaminar bands and convex screws (group 1) were com-pared to a control group of 73 patients with bands only (group 2). Operative parameters, 3D radiological measure-ments and complications were compared Results: Operating time (group 1 = 236 min; group 2 = 233 min; p = 0.295) and perioperative blood loss (group 1 = 584 ml; group 2 = 568; p = 0.368) were not affected by the surgical technique, but significant improvement was observed in frontal correction rate with uniplanar screws (group 1 = 67% vs group 2 = 62%; p = 0.001). The sagittal alignment restoration provided by the thoracic concave bands was maintained (average instrumented kyphosis increase, group 1 = 11\u00b0; group 2 = 12\u00b0). No neurological complication occurred. Conclusion: Adding convex uniplanar screws around the apex can help improve safely frontal corrections of hybrid constructs in thoracic AIS, without altering sag-ittal alignment. SPINE 2 OP-99 Guided Posterior Vertebral Modulation (GPVM): A new technique for of Spain 3Clinica Santa Madrid, Spain 4Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain 5Hospital Universitario HM Madrid, 6Hospital Universitario de Spain 7Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Background: Anterior spinal growth modulation (SGM) for deformity correction has an incomplete and unpredict-able outcome. Recent evidence suggests that posterior SGM using pedicle screws (PS) is possible. Objective: Report the correction ability of the GPVM technique using PS without fusion in AIS patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. 36 AIS patients (Risser \u00a33) underwent maximal correc- tion deformity by posterior PS without fusion. Instrumen-tation was removed once the maturity stage was completed (Iliac apophysis almost completely fused). Convectional coronal and sagittal standing X-rays were assessed preoperative and postoperatively before instru-mentation removal, immediate post-removal 2yr post-removal. The coronal wedging ratio (WR) was calculated between the height of the apex vertebra at the concave and convex sides of the main curve (MC). Preoperatively, and final SRS-22 questionnaire was completed, and T12-S1 ROM was measured. Results: The mean preoperative coronal Cobb of the MC (95% CI:50.7-56.6) was corrected to 5.5\u00ba\u00b17.5\u00ba (89.7%) at the immediate postoperative. Before the removal of instrumentation, there was a 3.4\u00ba loss of EPOS Abstract Book 87 correction, with an additional 2.8\u00ba just after removal. Removal time was 29 months (range 19-35). At 2yrs post-removal follow-ups, the mean MC correction from the initial curve). T5-T12 kyphosis showed a significant improvement from a mean angle of 19\u00ba (95% CI 13.3-24.8) to 27.1\u00ba (95% CI:20.1-26.1) at 2yr implant removal (29.9% increase. p < 0.05) The WR improved from 0.71\u00b10.06 to 0.98\u00b10.08 post- op sagittal ROM segment lumbar levels became kyphotic in anterior flexion. SRS-22 scores improved from 3.31\u00b10.25 to 3.68\u00b10.25 at the final assessment (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The GPVM through a posterior approach using PS without spinal fusion corrects scoliosis curves in patients with Risser \u00a33. Results are maintained in time, preserving ROM at lumbar segments. SPINE 2 OP-100 Sagittal Spinal Malalignment and Complications One Year After Posterior Dynamic Distraction Device Implantation for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Grace Chew 1, Stacy Ng2, Woei Jack Pan2, Lee2, Kevin Lim2 1Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore 2KK Women's & Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Objective: To evaluate the complications, if any, of the Posterior Dynamic Distraction Device (PDDD) with a minimum 1-year follow up. Methods: This is an IRB-approved retrospective case series of 12 AIS patients in a tertiary children's hospital who were treated with the PDDD. Their case records, radiographs and clinical photos were reviewed. Results: The average age in this cohort was 14.8 years. There were 10 females. Six of the 12 patients had Lenke 1 curves while an equal number had Lenke 5 curves. At one year, 9 of 12 patients presented with sagittal malalignment. Eight (66.7%) Four of the 8 patients with DJK also developed an acute focal lordosis between the distal fixation and the adja-cent caudad vertebra (Figure 1). The sole patient with PJK (Lenke 5) required unlocking of the implant to address worsening kyphosis and proximal implant prominence (Figure 2); this resulted in his scoliosis reverting to 41 degrees. One other patient with a Lenke 1 curve and DJK also developed a prominent implant distally (Figure 3). A further patient with DJK had a resistant mycobacterium for - tuitum deep wound infection and required implant removal 16 months after index surgery, despite 2 washouts and anti-biotics. Overall in this series, the PDDD corrected the sco-liosis by an average Cobb angle of 18.8 degrees (45.3%). Conclusions: At one year, 9 of 12 patients (75%) devel- oped sagittal spinal malalignment, one of whom has under - gone implant removal for infection. The majority of the patients in this cohort will require revision or removal of the PDDD, or conversion to instru-mented spinal fusion in the near future.88 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) SPINE 2 OP-101 Does a dedicated a \"Scoliosis Team\" and Surgical Standardization Improve Outcomes in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Surgery and New Hyde Park, United States Introduction: In 2011, we implemented a standardized approach including a \"scoliosis team\" of dedicated anesthesiologists, operating room nurses, surgical tech-nicians, and neurophysiologists. We also implemented a standardized pre-operative work-up, specific intraop-erative protocols including the use of anti-fibrinolytics and intrathecal morphine, and a multi-disciplinary postoperative care model. The purpose of this study is to determine if standardization improves AIS surgery outcomes and whether it is transferrable between institutions. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of a pro- spective AIS database from 2009-2018 at 2 institutions (IA and IB). In each institution, a non-standardized group (NST) and a standardized group (ST), were compared. Demographics and perioperative outcomes were recor - ded. In 2015, the surgeons changed institutions (to IB). Reproducibility was determined between institutions (IA vs. IB). Median (IQR), Kruskal-Wallis, and Fisher's exact test were used. Results: 325 AIS patients were collected from the data- base. The non-standardized group (NST) included 44 patients, while the standardized group (ST) included 281 patients. Age (p = 0.21), BMI (p = 0.48), preoperative Cobb angle (p = 0.48), levels fused (p = 0.42), and correction per - centage (p = 0.39) were all similar. Standardized protocol patients had lower estimated blood loss (EBL) (700 ml vs 325 ml, p < 0.001), shorter anesthesia time (437 min vs 384 min, p = 0.004), shorter surgical time (310 min vs 248 min, p < 0.001), and shorter length of stay (LOS) (7 days vs 5 days, p < 0.001). IA (n = 101) and IB (n = 105) were compared. Age (p = 0.21), BMI (p = 0.48) and preoperative Cobb angle (p = 0.48) were similar. EBL (p < 0.001), anesthesia time (p < 0.001), surgical time (p < 0.001), and LOS (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in IB. Conclusion: A standardized AIS approach including a dedicated operative team, pre-operative work up, postoperative multi-disciplinary management, and streamlined surgical steps improves outcomes and efficiency.EPOS Abstract Book 89 SPINE 2 OP-113 Complication Rates for Robotic-Assisted Placement of Over 1,500 Pedicle Screws in Pediatric Posterior Spinal Fusion Jenna L. Wisch1, Colson P. Zucker1, Roger F. Widmann1, Jessica H. Heyer1 1Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, United States Introduction: Few studies characterize the complica- tions associated with robotic-assisted spine surgery in pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF). The goal of this study is to assess the rate of surgi-cal complications associated with over 1,500 robotically-placed pedicle screws in pediatric patients undergoing PSF for idiopathic scoliosis (IS) or Scheuermann's kyphosis (SK). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 93 pediatric patients (ages 10-22) with juvenile or ado- lescent IS or SK who underwent PSF from 2020-2022 with the Mazor X Stealth Edition Robotic Guidance System for Spinal Surgery. Operative data included num-ber of screws placed with and without robotic assistance and intraoperative events such as neuromonitoring changes and robotic complications like screw malposi-tion and technical challenges. Results: Of the 93 patients, 71.0% were female and average age was 14.8 years, with a median of 13 fused levels (range 5-15). 1,653 (74.4%) screws had unintentional breach (34 medial, 7 lateral, 1 inferior, and 1 combination), all of which were identified intraoperatively and redirected or removed. In the first quartile, there were 13 (4.2%) robotically-placed pedicle screws breaches; by the fourth quartile, only 7 (1.3%) screws breached (Figure 1). There was 1 durotomy due to screw placement with no associated neurological changes, 2 neuromonitoring alerts remote to the surgical field that resolved with patient repositioning, 10 instances of clamp/bridge strike precluding screw placement at that level, 3 instances of inability to register the proximal curve, and 1 loss of reg-istration due to patient shifting. There were 0 cases of postoperative infection or reoperation, and 2 cases of non- or delayed-union (Table 1). Conclusions: Robotic navigation in the pediatric spine population allows for safe and reliable placement of pedi-cle screws that improves over time. 90 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Table 1. intraoperative and postoperative Complications associated with robotically placed pedicle screws.

Methods: The clinical and radiographic records of patients with severe scoliosis who underwent PSF 2017 reviewed and analysed. Results: In this series there were 128 patients who under - went PSF with pedicle screws using 2D fluoroscopy or the MvIGS system. Age, gender, BMI, and scoliosis etio-logy were equivalent between the two groups. Compared to 2D fluoroscopy, MvIGS reduced fluoroscopy time 52.91\u00b138.17 cGycm2; p < change in the largest Cobb angle (33.72\u00b112.99\u00b0 vs. 40.00\u00b111.63\u00b0; p = 0.005), and estimated blood loss (870.25\u00b1616.57 mL vs. 553.75\u00b1434.32 mL; p < 0.001).Overall, the average navigation time for the MvIGS sys-tem was 114.07\u00b151.88 minutes, and 5.79\u00b13.15 minutes per screw implanted. The number of levels fused, number of pedicle screws implanted, pre- and post-operative Cobb angles, operative time and length of hospital stay were not significantly different between the two groups. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a 1 mL increase in esti-mated blood loss for every 0.064 cGycm2 increase (95% 0.097; p < radiation exposure. Conclusion: The use of the MvIGS as an adjunct for pedi-cle screw placement in PSF, has contributed to a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time, intraoperative radiation exposure, and estimated blood loss. Exposure to radiation was significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss. The MvIGS holds much promise in improving the over - all safety for our young patients with scoliosis undergoing instrumented posterior spinal fusions. SPINE 3 Introduction: Neuromuscular scoliosis are frequently progressive and require surgical treatment to maintain trunk and pelvic balance. Posterior spinal fusion has the disadvantages of long operative time with high blood loss. Minimally invasive surgery with bipolar fusionless con-struct allow a satisfying correction with a reduced opera-tive duration and blood loss. Moreover, it can be used with growing rods. The aim of the study was to report results of minimally invasive surgery for neuromuscular scoliosis in children. Material and Method: A bicentric study included all neu- romuscular patients operated on for scoliosis with mini-mally invasive surgery. Surgery consisted in bilateral rod construct anchored proximally by hooks and distally by 2 ilio-sacral screws. Instrumentation was implanted by 2 minimal approaches and there was no fusion between proximal and distal implants. Depending on the remaining growth, it was either a definitive surgery or a traditional growing rods construct. A minimum of 2 years of follow-up was necessary for inclusion. Demographic, clinical and radiological data were recorded. Results: 52 patients were included, with a mean age at sur - gery of 10 years (4 to 16). Etiologies were: 15 congenital myopathy, 11 cerebral palsy, 8 myelomeningocele, 7 spinal muscular atrophy and 11 other neurological etiologies. 34 constructs used growing rods, 18 used traditional rods. Mean follow-up was 50 months (24 to 108). Main cobb angle significantly decreased from 65 to 32\u00b0 and pelvic obliquity from 22 to 5,8\u00b0. We reported 31 complications, 18 out of the 31 concerned patients with myelomeningocele. Most frequent complication were: sepsis 26%, distal 18,5%. Conclusion: Minimally invasive surgery is an effective technique to restore trunk and pelvic balance in neuromus-cular scoliosis. Patient with myelomeningocele have to be informed about the high risk of complication. SPINE 3 OP-104 Utility of Abdominal Radiographs after Posterior Spinal Fusion for Scoliosis Andras1, Tyler Tetreault1 1Children's Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States Introduction/Objective: Postoperative ileus is common in neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) posterior spinal fusion (PSF), and abdominal radiographs (KUBs) are often ordered. We sought to investigate how often KUBs produced meaningful findings that impacted patient care. This information may help providers balance the downsides of KUBs (radiation and increased cost) against possible benefits. We hypothesize that KUBs ordered following PSF increase cost and radiation to the patient but have minimal impact on management. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of NMS patients treated with PSF between January 2014 and December 2019 at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Electronic medical records and radiographs were reviewed. Results: 186 patients met inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 13.7 \u00b1 2.8 years (range: 2-20 years) and mean pre-operative curve magnitude of 84.6 \u00b1 24.7 degrees (range: 20-170 degrees). Mean follow up 43.2 \u00b1 33.1 months (range: 0-181 months). 21.5% (40/186) of NMS patients had a KUB due to abdominal pain and/or distension. 97.5% (39/40) of the KUB imaging performed was con-sistent with ileus. 1 KUB study demonstrated nonspecific findings prompting a general surgery consult; however, patient management was not altered. All cases of ileus resolved. Conclusions: In this series, KUBs were performed in 1/5 NMS patients during the postoperative period. Although the sample size of 186 may not capture rare events, this study did not demonstrate any benefit or change of treat-ment from KUBs. This imaging may increase cost and radiation without benefiting the patient and may therefore not be warranted in most cases. SPINE 3 OP-106 Postoperative Urinary Retention Occurs in 1 in 5 Patients after Posterior Spinal Fusion for Neuromuscular Scoliosis 1Children's Los Angeles, United States Introduction/Objective: Although postoperative urinary retention (POUR) can occur after any surgical procedure, neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) patients may be at increased risk because of underlying neurologic involve-ment, as well as the type and duration of surgery. This may be particularly concerning for parents/providers trying to differentiate between typical POUR and a neurogenic bladder that could signify an intraoperative or postopera-tive neurologic injury. Our objective was to quantify the incidence, duration and outcome of POUR in NMS.92 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of NMS patients undergoing PSF between January 2004 and May 2019 at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Patients who were catheter dependent preoperatively were excluded. POUR was defined as needing catheterization or Foley reinser - tion following initial Foley removal. Electronic medical records were reviewed. Results: 409 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean fol- low-up was 40.0 \u00b1 31.1 months (range: 0-181 months). 99 (24%) of 409 patients had POUR following spinal surgery and required a mean duration of intermittent catheteriza-tion of 3.3 days (range: 1-27 days). 15 of the 99 patients with POUR (15%) had Foley reinsertion. 5 patients (5%) were diagnosed with and treated for a postoperative uri-nary tract infection. In 93% (92/99), POUR resolved prior to discharge. 7 patients had continued symptoms of POUR at the first postoperative visit (2-4 weeks following the procedure), 6/7 resolved by the three month postoperative appoint-ment. The other patient was noted by urology to have findings of severe hydronephrosis and urinary retention consistent with a neurologic bladder on their preopera-tive MRI. Conclusions: POUR occurred in 24% of NMS patients after PSF and resolved in 99% of cases. This study objec-tively quantified the incidence, duration and outcome of POUR in NMS patients. SPINE 3 OP-107 Evidence of Spinal Stiffening following Fusionless Bipolar Fixation for Introduction: This study reports the first use of shear wave elastography (SWE) for imaging NMS by assessing the mechanical response of lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs) after FBF and compare them with asymptomatic controls. The aim is to acquire evidence from the stiffness of the spine following fusionless bipolar fixation (FBF) at long term follow-up. Methods: Nineteen NMS operated on with fusionless bipolar fixation from T1 to the pelvis (18, SD2y at last follow-up, 6.2\u00b11y after surgery) were included prospec-tively. Preoperative Cobb was 89, SD20\u00b0 and 3, SD1\u00b0 at latest follow-up. All patients had reached skeletal matu-rity. Eighteen asymptomatic patients (20\u00b14y) were also included. Shear wave speed was measured in the annulus fibrosus of L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 IVDs and was com-pared between the two groups. Measurements were per - formed using a Canon Aplio i800 system. Measurement reliability (intra-observer repeatability and interobserver reproducibility) was assessed on a subset of the first five NMS and healthy patient. Results: In healthy subjects, average SWS (all disc lev- els pooled) was 7.5m/s, SD 2.6m/s. In NMS patients SWS was significantly higher at 9.9, SD 1.4m/s (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney test). Differences (10,3 SD2.3m/s vs 7, SD 1.1m/s, p = 0.0006). No difference was observed for L5S1 IVDs (p = 0.2). A statistical significance was not correlated with age at surgery, Cobb angle correction and age at the SWE measurement. Conclusion: The features resulting from this study show for the first time a significant increase of disc stiffness at the end of growth for these NMS patients treated by FBF. These findings could serve as a useful adjunct to CT scan in assessing stiffness of the spine in relation with avoidance of surgical final fusion at long term follow-up after FBF. SPINE 4 OP-109 Clinical Relevance of Painful Congenital Early Onset Scoliosis: An Study States 2University of Puerto Rico Orthopaedic Surgery Department, San Juan, United States 3San Lucas Hospital, Ponce, United States 4Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United States 5Shriners Hospitals for Children-Chicago, Chicago, United States 6Children's Hospital Colorado, Colorado, United States 7Shriners Hospital for Children Philadelphia, Philadelphia, United StatesEPOS Abstract Book 93 Introduction: Back pain as a clinical marker has been associated with underlying pathology in scoliosis patients for many years, warranting further radiological imaging such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Risk factors for abnormal MRI pathology findings in Congenital-EOS patients include failures of segmentation and mixed defects, female sex, rib anomalies, congenital thoracic anomalies, and neurocutaneous markers. Yet, back pain complaints have not been evaluated as a risk factor for underlying MRI pathology in patients with Congenital-EOS. This study aimed to identify underlying MRI pathology's clinical relevance in Congenital-EOS patients with back pain. Methods: This is a retrospective review from the Pediatric Spine Study Group (PSSG) Multicenter Database of all Congenital-EOS patients who reported a back pain com-plaint, a visual analog scale (V AS) score, and underwent a spinal MRI study before surgical intervention. Patients were divided into those who had an underlying MRI pathology, and those who did not. Demographics were compared between groups. Results: From 2355 Congenital-EOS patients registered in PSSG, 42 patients met inclusion criteria. The average age of all patients was 8.1 years; 60.0% were females, and 57% of patients reported comorbidity. An underlying MRI pathology was found in 50% (21/42) of Congenital-EOS patients with back pain. Congenital-EOS patients with an abnormal MRI had an average age of 7.5 while those with a normal MRI result had an average age of 8.7 (P = 0.393). The presence of comorbidities was found in 42.9% of patients with abnormal MRI and 66.6% of those with nor - mal MRI findings (P = 0.215). Conclusion: Of patients that reported back pain and had an MRI study, 50% had underlying MRI pathology. Age, pain intensity, and radiographic findings were not associated with underlying pathology. Back pain could be considered a risk factor associated with underlying MRI pathology in Congenital-EOS patients.

We hypothesized that implant type and patient size would inform LIV selection. An international pediatric spine database was queried for patients ages 2-10 years treated by growth friendly instru-mentation with at least 2-year follow up. Non-ambulatory patients, those with a LIV below L5, and those with prior spine surgery were excluded. Relationships between the LIV and preoperative spinal height, curve magnitude, and implant type were assessed. The relationship between the TV (defined as the most cephalad vertebrae touched by the center sacral vertical line) and the LIV was also evaluated. 281 patients were included. The LIV was L3 or below with more caudal LIV selection (p = 0.001). Larger curve magnitudes were similarly associated with more caudal LIV selection LIV selec-tion (p = 0.32) including MCGR actuator length (p 0.829). 64% of patients exhibited TV-LIV incongruence. The LIV was caudal to the TV in 78% of patients with a TV at L2 or above compared to only 17% of patients with a TV at L3 or below (p < 0.0001). Larger curve magnitude and smaller spinal height were associated with more caudal LIV selection, implant type was not. Although selective thoracic surgery is an area of focus in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, it is rare in EOS. 50% of patients had an LIV caudal to the TV , which may represent an area for improved clinical decision making.

STD was proclaimed as a core indication for a V-osteotomy Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Ribs (VEPTRs) expansion thoracoplasty of the posterior fused rib. We aim to present radiographic, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), genetic testing, and 24-Items Early Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) findings in 11 non-surgically EPOS Abstract Book 95 treated Puerto Rican STD patients to understand its natural history. We conducted a prospective study of 11 non-surgically treated STD patients. Medical evaluations, radiographic findings, genetic testing, PFTs, and EOSQ-24 findings were studied. The cohort consisted of eleven STD patients with a mean age of 32.3 (14-69 years old). Mean Body Mass Index was 24.7 Kg/m2 (18-38.9kg/m2), with typical head, chest, and abdom-inal circumferences. Radiographically, they exhibited the usual STD configuration with a mean thoracic height of less than 18 cm. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation in the MESP2 gene. Mean predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) was 22%, predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 30%, FEV1/ FVC ratio was 107%, compatible with severe restrictive airflow pattern. The EOSQ-24 revealed: General Health (75), Pain (67), Pulmonary Function (76.1), Transfer (86.4), Physical Functions (83.4), Daily Living (80.7), Fatigue/Energy Level (64.8), Emotion (77.2), Family Burden (77.5) and Satisfaction (77.3). Our patients demonstrated the expected decreased PFTs findings, yet the EOSQ-24 exhibited better results than those reported in previous neuromuscular or syndromic population. We emphasize that PFTs results do not asso-ciate with patient quality of life and question the use of PFTs as a surgical indication. Therefore, a confirmed STD diagnosis should not be an absolute indication for a V-osteotomy (VEPTRs) expansion thoracoplasty as was previously stated.

The impact of functional impairments on altered muscle growth remains unclear. Objective: To model morphological muscle growth in children with SCP, using repeated assessments during 2-year (y) follow-up. Material and Methods: This prospective longitudinal study included 87 children (age range: 6 months to 11 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] Table 1. absolute (above; in ml) and normalized (below; in ml/kg.m ) muscle volume of medial gastrocnemius in relation to age in ambulatory children with spastic cerebral palsy. blue: gmfCs resulting in 234 assessments. Three-dimensional freehand ultrasound was applied to assess medial gastrocnemius muscle volume (MV), mid-belly cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle belly length (ML). Non-linear mixed models calculated regression coefficients or growth rates and breakpoints and compared trajectories of muscle growth between GMFCS-I versus GMFCS-II&III with F-test. Results: MV and CSA growth trajectories showed two breakpoints, with the highest growth before 2y and nega-tive growth rates after 6-9y (Table 1). Before 2y, children with GMFCS-II&III already showed lower growth rates compared to GMFCS-I. From 2-9y, the growth rates did not differ between GMFCS levels. After 9y, a more pro-nounced reduction in normalized CSA was observed in GMFCS-II&III. Different trajectories in ML growth were shown between the GMFCS level subgroups. Conclusions: High muscle growth rates were observed before 2 years, followed by slower absolute muscle size growth until 6-9 years, while normalized MV and CSA were reduced already at youngest ages. From 6-9y, muscle growth further reduced. These altered muscle growth tra-jectories can be used to monitor the SCP muscle pathology during childhood and highlights the need of treatment that stimulates muscle growth.96 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) BEST OF NEUROMUSCULAR OP-116 Mortality in scoliosis patients with cerebral palsy with and without spinal deformity surgery - a register-based Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, Helsinki, Finland 2Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, Helsinki, Finland 3National Institute for Health and Welfare, Information Services Department, Helsinki, Finland., Helsinki, Finland 4Department of Health and Welfare, Arcada University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland, Helsinki, Finland Introduction and Objective: Scoliosis is common in chil- dren with cerebral palsy (CP). Severe scoliosis leads to decreased health related quality of life (HRQoL) and pul-monary compromise. Scoliosis surgery in children with CP increases HRQoL and reduces caregiver burden, but effects of scoliosis surgery on pulmonary function and mortality remain obscure. The purpose of this study was to compare mortality and primary causes of deaths in scoliotic children with CP with and without spinal deformity surgery. Materials and Methods: We identified 4571 children born between 1987 and 2020 who had been diagnosed with CP between 1996 and 2022 from national registries, of these 474 children with CP had been diagnosed with scoliosis. Two hundred and thirty-six had not been operated and 238 were operated for scoliosis during the follow-up median 17.8 (IQR 11.7-25.7) and 23.0 (IQR 18.4-28.2)) years, respectively. Associated co-morbidities, demo - graphic data, mortality and causes of death were analyzed between non-surgically and surgically treated children with CP and scoliosis. Results: Children with CP and scoliosis with non-surgical and surgical treatment were diagnosed with scoliosis at the age of 12.1 and 12.5 years, respectively. Length of gesta-tion and birth weight was similar in both groups. Both groups had similar rate of pneumonias, epilepsy, and gas-trostomy. During the follow-up mortality was higher in the non-surgically treated group than in the surgically treated group (n = 38/236, 16% vs. n = 29/238, 12%, p = 0.047) (Fig. 1.). Primary cause of death was significantly more often respiratory causes in non-surgically treated children with CP, whereas neurological causes were significantly more common in surgically treated patients (Table 1.). Conclusions: Surgical treatment of scoliosis associates to reduced mortality due to respiratory causes in children with cerebral palsy and scoliosis.Table I.

BEST OF NEUROMUSCULAR OP-117 Long-term results of hip reconstruction into adulthood in patients with cerebral palsy Patrick Curran1, Bologna, Italy Purpose: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the leading cause of phys- ical disability during childhood. Children with CP who develop hip disease may undergo surgery to improve hip congruency and alignment. The long-term effectiveness of these interventions into adulthood have not been widely reported. The purpose of this study is to review long-term outcomes in adults with CP who underwent hip recon-struction as children.EPOS Abstract Book 97 Methods: Retrospective review of patients presenting to the Rady Children's Hospital Adult CP Clinic from 2011-2020. Inclusion criteria were CP diagnosis, underwent hip reconstruction with VDRO +/- acetabuloplasty at age 12 years, and follow-up at age 18 years. Exclusion criteria were primary hip procedure at another institution, inade-quate documentation, or primary procedure consisting of periacetabular osteotomy, triple innominate osteotomy, or hip salvage procedure. Clinical records were reviewed for patient demographics, CP classification, operative data, and need for secondary surgery. Radiographic measures included migration percentage (MP) and the Melbourne Cerebral Palsy Hip Classification Scale (MCPHCS). Survival of hip joint was defined as not requiring additional surgery, other than implant removal, by final follow-up. Results: One hundred three adults (188 hips; 37% female; age 22.8 \u00b1 4.3 years) returned for follow-up at mean 15.4 \u00b1 4.8 years postoperatively. All underwent VDRO and 83 (44.7%) underwent acetabuloplasty. MP and MCPHCS significantly improved from preop to most recent follow-up (51 \u00b1 25% to 21 \u00b1 12%; p < 0.001) and (4 to 2; p < 0.001), respectively. Twelve patients underwent revision VDRO with acetabuloplasty for dysplasia with hip subluxation. Six hips underwent salvage procedure with either valgus osteotomy (2) or proximal femoral resection (4) for painful hip. The overall hip survival was 87%. Conclusion: A primary goal of hip reconstruction in chil- dren with CP is to restore hip congruence and prevent painful hip in adulthood. Eighty-seven percent of hips that underwent hip reconstruction during childhood survived into adulthood at mean follow-up 15 years. BEST OF NEUROMUSCULAR OP-118 Can a Surgical Vulnerability Score predict outcomes of hip reconstruction in children with severe neuromuscular disability? Alistair Bevan1, Stephanie Edwards2 of of Paediatric NHS Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom Introduction and objective: Children with severe neuro- muscular disabilities frequently undergo hip surgery to prevent chronic pain from hip migration. They often have multiple, severe co-morbidities relating to their neurodis-ability, but there is currently limited guidance for assessing if they are suitable candidates for surgery. This study aims to help inform shared surgical decision-making; by corre-lating a novel measure of the physiological reserve, termed the Surgical Vulnerability Score (SVS), with outcomes of reconstructive hip surgery. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight cases, provided by a single surgeon between January 2014 and May 2016, were retrospectively graded on physiological vulnerability using the SVS. SVS was then correlated against the length of stay (LOS) and severity of postoperative complications. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level was also correlated against these outcomes as a base-line comparison. Sub-analysis was performed for patients undergoing femoral (n = 48) versus femoral and pelvic osteotomies (n = 20). Results: SVS ranged from 0 to 21. A higher SVS was asso- ciated with an increased LOS (p = 0.001) and severity of postoperative complications (p = 0.0008). Increased GMFCS level was not associated with either LOS (p = 0.246) or the severity of postoperative complications (p = 0.282). Sub-analysis found an increased SVS had no association with either LOS (p = 0.483) or severity of complications (p = 0.981) for patients that underwent a femoral osteot- omy. However, for patients who underwent the addition of a pelvic osteotomy, a higher SVS was associated with an increased LOS (p = 0.0002) and severity of complications (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: The SVS can help identify children at greater risk of adverse outcomes following reconstructive hip sur - gery: allowing for more informed consent, and better prep-aration by the child's family. Results also support an early intervention: indicating better outcomes when fixation is achieved with only a femoral osteotomy. This further dem-onstrates the value of hip surveillance programmes in the early identification of progressively migrating hips. BEST OF NEUROMUSCULAR OP-119 Long-Term Function of Adolescent Rehabilitation Center, Jerusalem, Israel 2Hand and Microvascular Surgery Unit, Hadassah Medical Organization, Jerusalem, Israel Introduction: Function of patients with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is highly variable, depending 98 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) on severity and treatments. Objective was to identify and describe associations between physical impairments, treat-ments, and long-term functional outcomes of adults with AMC. Methods: 146 patients with AMC aged over 18 years were approached, all were treated for 30 years at a pediatric rehabilitation center and a local hospital. Interviews included demographic and medical histories, and stan-dardized outcome measures of quality of life (SF-36), upper limb (U/L) activity (Quick-DASH) and Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD). Fischer's exact and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare variables, p-value of 0.05 or lower was considered significant. Results: Forty patients (27.4%) replied, mean age 37.0 years (SD 12.0), equal number males and females; 25% live independently. Compared to general population, patients were more likely to have a graduate degree but have lower physical function scores; quality of life was similar. Mobility was affected by foot symptoms. Only two reported useing pain medication regularly despite high rates of reported pain in back (60%), hip (50%), shoulder-elbow (25%) and wrist (58%). 83% had U/L involvement. Participants treated only conservatively for U/L function reported better results than those treated surgically (p = 0.035). U/L function decreased in participants with hip joint pain (p = 0.039). Patients with scoliosis reported lower levels of activity and function (PASIPD, p < 0.05) and decreased U/L function (Quick-DASH, p < 0.05). Conclusions: There were surprising discrepancies between high quality of life and advanced level of gradu-ate education with relation to high rates of pain and low physical activity and independence. U/L function was most affected by spine and hip deformity and pain. Patients treated with U/L surgery did not achieve higher function. These findings are expected to influence future decision making of surgical interventions and other treatments for pediatric patients with AMC. BEST OF NEUROMUSCULAR OP-120 Surgical practice variation and factors influencing indications for specific interventions for hip displacement in children with cerebral palsy Maximillian Mifsud 1, Investigator Group21Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom 2The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada 3British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada 4Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, United States 5Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia 6Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford, United Kingdom 7Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, United States 8Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand 9Dega Hospital, Poznan, Poland 10Safra Hospital for Children, Tel Hashomer, Israel 11Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, United States Objectives: Although hip-surveillance regimes for cerebral palsy (CP) recommend orthopaedic referral when migration percentage (MP) reaches 30%, indications for when and what specific interventions to do, vary widely. The CHOP study is a prospective international cohort study of 750+ non-ambulant children with CP and hip displacement. This study quantifies practice variation among CHOP surgeons and explores factors influencing decision-making. Methods: 28 surgeons (mean:10 yrs CP-practice) from 17 sites/10 countries were presented 71 case vignettes of chil- dren (GMFCS IV&V) from the CHOP database: mean age 6.9 yrs (1.3-17.5yrs); uni-/bilateral involvement; x-rays showing MP; hip abduction range (R1/R2); parent-report of hip symptoms. An anonymized digital response system captured surgeon treatment recommendations for each case - watchful-waiting (W); botulinum-toxin (SS); uni- vs bilateral surgery; open reduction (ORed). Effect of surgeon and patient factors on indications for specific interventions was evaluated with multiple logistic regression(OR:odds ratios). Results: Mean MP was 58%(0-100% each side). 37/71 had hip symptoms. MP and hip symptoms influence deci- sions. When MP < 50%: 40% chose W, 25\u00b0; 18% preferred AdR; 27% performed VDRO. Surgery for MP < 50% was more likely with hip symptoms. When MP > 50%, VDRO was recom- mended by 95% of surgeons, independent of other factors. AdR was seldom offered when MP > 60%. PO was added for children > 5 yrs with dysplasia. > 75% of surgeons pre- ferred bilateral surgery. ORed was recommended by 40% to 60% of surgeons for increasing MP. SS was preferred for high/irreducible dislocations (OR:23); severe dysplasia (OR:16), and symptomatic hips (OR:8.7). Surgeons varied in their threshold of acceptable femoral head deformity. Conclusion: Treatment recommendations vary among experienced CP surgeons world-wide. MP and hip symp- toms are major drivers of recommendations. Evaluation of comparative effectiveness of these different strategies in the CHOP study will inform future decision-making and narrow practice variation.EPOS Abstract Book 99 UPPER LIMB OP-121 Upper Limb Lengthening in Children with Spastic Joe Bizdikian1 1Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon Introduction: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and upper limb muscle contractures are often treated with sur - gical lengthening. Results of single-event multi-level sur - gery of the upper limb are not well documented. This study evaluates the results of surgical lengthening of spastic upper limb muscles in children with CP. Materials and Methods: 50 CP children (24M/26F; mean age = 12y [2-18]) were sorted retrospectively in 2 groups. Group A: 1 lengthened muscle (N = 14), group B: 2 lengthened muscles (N = 36). All contractured mus- cles were treated by surgical lengthening followed by casting and physiotherapy. Patients were examined post-operatively at 2 weeks, 1 month, 1 and 2 years. Functional and cosmetic satisfaction were assessed 8 years post-operatively in average. Results: 19 patients received Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) injections. 53.3% of the children who had BoNT-A for 2 spastic muscles relapsed at 2 years. 75% of patients who 100 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) had injections in 3 muscles vs 33% in 2 muscles relapsed. Contracture recurred in 36% of patients 2 years after sur - gery (29% group A, 31% group B). However, on the long-term, 13% relapsed in group B but none in group A. Approximately 60% of patients in both groups were not satisfied with functionality and cosmesis. Discussion: The number of muscles injected with BoNT-A simultaneously negatively affected the outcomes of sur - gery. Simultaneous lengthening of a larger number of muscles had a higher risk of failure. Consistency with physiotherapy impacted outcomes. Care givers have high expectations on the functional and aesthetic outcomes, but disappointment is common. Conclusion: The risk of recurrence after lengthening of spastic upper limb muscles is high and most significant during the first 2 years. Physiotherapy and splinting are essential. Other factors of failure seem to be: simultaneous lengthening of a larger number of muscles and simultane-ous BoNT-A injections of several contracted muscles. UPPER LIMB OP-122 Guided growth with the eight-Plate implant is effective for the treatment of cubitus varus in children: medium- to long-term varus is the most common elbow deformity secondary to elbow fracture in children. Correction is commonly attempted through supracondylar humeral osteotomy. We hypothesized that lateral distal humeral hemiepiphysiodesis (LDHH) can be used to gradually correct this deformity in children. Methods: Retrospective study including all patients who underwent LDHH with the eight-Plate system at a pediatric referral center between 2008-2018, with a minimum 4-year follow-up. We collected demographic data, fracture-related and pre- and postoperative clinical (carrying angle (CA), ROM, symptoms) data, operative and imaging data (humeral-ulnar angle (HUA), Baumann angle (BA)), as well as complications and satisfaction at last follow-up. Results: Fifteen patients were included, 80% of whom were male; median age at the time of surgery was 5.12 (IQR,3.58) years. Median follow-up was 80.57 (34.13) months. All variables improved significantly between the preoperative and final postoperative visit (Table-1). An annual correction rate of 2.41\u00ba (0.93) in terms of HUA was obtained (Figure-1). A correlation was observed between time of implant duration and degree of correction accord-ing to CA (p = 0.007), HUA (p = 0.027), and BA (p = 0.007). Also, a correlation between previous HUA and CA correc-tion (p = 0.031) as well as HUA correction (p = .040) was found. There were 5 cases of aseptic screw loosening, 4 requiring replacement, which was not related to age at surgery (p = 0.324). A total of 5 cases required implant removal and 1 case each of infection, ulnar neuropathy, and radial schwannoma. Most patients (86.67%) were sat-isfied after surgery and a relationship was found with the younger age at surgery (p = 0.037), with no relationship found with other variables such as initial deformity or degree of correction (p > 0.05) (Table-2). Conclusions: LDHH with eight-Plate is an effective tech-nique for cubitus varus deformity correction in children in the medium- to long-term. Most patients are satisfied after the procedure, age being a determining factor. Patients should be advised of the possibility of reoperation for screw replacement or implant removal.

The use of local-only anesthesia (Walant technique) has recently gained popu-larity in adults and adolescents, but its use has never been reported in young children. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the feasibility of the Walant tech-nique, implemented with virtual reality (Walant-R), in children under 12 years old. Materials and methods: All children with a fingertip injury or a dorsal digital wound were prospectively included. Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients aged from 3 to 11 years old, (2) surgical indication of repair and (3) parents' consent for the procedure. Pain and anxiety were evaluated with dedicated scoring systems (Objective pain scale (/10)- OPS and the modified Yale preopera-tive anxiety scale (/100) - MYPAS) as well as parents' anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form (/80)- STAI). Perioperative data were also analyzed. All patients were evaluated 24 hours after the procedure.Results: 30 patients were included (mean age 5.7\u00b1 1.6 years). Rate of conversion into general anesthesia was 23%, mean age of the patients being 4.9 \u00b1 1.9 years. The causes for failure were the rejection of the virtual reality mask (n = 1) and the pain during the injection (n = 6). Mean OPS at the time of injection, during and after surgery was respectively 3.3, 0.3 and 0. Mean MYPAS and STAI scores were low (23.4 \u00b1 0.9 and 44.3 \u00b1 0.8) respectively. The time spent in the operating room was significantly decreased (- 28 min). No tourniquet was required because of insuffi-cient vasoconstriction and no ischemia or necrosis occurred. Conclusion: The Walant-R technique is feasible and safe in young children with distal digital wounds injuries. Protocols may be modified for children under 5 years old. Further investigations are currently performed to extend indications.

The purpose of this paper was to review our treatment of ulnar bow in pediatric patients with MHE. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all children treated at our institution with a diagnosis of MHE. Patients were included if they underwent ulnar osteotomy using an intramedullary rod, had preoperative/follow-up radiographs and minimum follow-up of six months. A sub-analysis was performed on forearm motion. Radiographic parameters measured included total ulnar bow (TUB), total radial bow (TRB), and percent ulnar length (PUL). Descriptive statistics were calculated and paired samples t-test were used to compare means. The preoperative and followup TUB and PUL were plotted on a previously published prediction matrix for radiocapitellar instability to visualize improve-ment (Figure 1). Results: 25 patients with 25 forearms were included. The mean age at the time of surgery was 9.8 years (\u00b13.3 years). The mean follow-up was 17.7 months (\u00b18.5 months). PUL improved by 1% (p = 0.0066). The mean preoperative TUB was 19.7 o and postoperatively was 4.8o. TUB improved by 15o (p < 0.00001). The mean pre- operative TRB was 15o and did not significantly change (p = 0.4561). All radiocapitellar joints were located at the final followup. A sub-analysis of pronation and supina-tion was performed on 18/25 forearms. The mean pre-operative supination was 66 o and this improved to 82o post operatively (p = 0.0201). The mean preoperative pro- nation was 58o and did not significantly improve post- operatively (p = 0.1135). Conclusions: The presented technique improved ulnar deformity in patients with MHE and the graph demon-strates a shift away from radiocapitellar instability. This is the first report detailing a potential, prophylactic treatment to prevent radiocapitellar dislocation in patients with MHE. UPPER LIMB OP-125 Distraction Osteogenesis at the Proximal Third of the Ulna for the Treatment of Masada Type I/IIb Deformities in Children with Hereditary Multiple Exostoses: A Retrospective Review of 20 Cases Yunan Lu 1, Federico Canavese2, Shunyou Chen1 1Fuzhou Second Hospital of Xiamen University, Fuzhou, China 2Lille University Centre, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille, France Background: Ulna distraction by monolateral external fixator (MEFix) is a good option for the treatment of Masada type-I/IIb in children with HME. However, there is no consensus regarding where to perform ulnar osteot-omy. Our hypothesis is that osteotomy at the proximal third of the ulna and progressive distraction with MEFix can simultaneously correct elbow and wrist deformities. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with HME who underwent ulna distraction osteogenesis from June 2014 to March 2019. The carrying angle (CA), radial articular angle (RAA), ulnar variance (UV), radial variance (RV), ulna lengthening distance (LD) and range of motion (ROM) of the affected forearm and elbow were clinically assessed before lengthening and at the last fol-low-up visit. Results: There were 11 patients (12 forearms) with Masada type I deformities and 8 patients (8 forearms) with Masada type IIb deformities. Patients with type IIb deformity had higher RV , lower CA values, less elbow flexion and forearm prono-supination than those with type I deformity (p < 0.05); RV was an independent risk factor for radial head dislocation, with the cut off at RV > 15.5 mm. The mean LDs in patients with type I and type IIb deformities were 33.6 \u00b1 6.6 mm and 41.4 \u00b1 5.4 mm, respectively. The mean CA, UV , RV , forearm prona-tion and ulna deviation at the wrist improved significantly following surgery in all patients. In particular, 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) with type IIb deformities had concentric reduction of the radiocapitellar joint, while no radial head subluxation was detected in patients with type I deformi-ties at the last follow-up. Conclusions: Distraction osteogenesis at the proximal third of the ulna provides satisfactory clinical and radio-logical outcomes in patients with Masada type I and IIb deformities. Early treatment of Masada type I deformities is indicated before progression to more complex type IIb deformities.EPOS Abstract Book 103 104 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Table 1. masada type i versus type iib deformities according to age, preoperative radiographic and clinical outcomes. masada i (N = 12)masada iib(N = 8)t/Z p value age (years \u00b1 sD) 8.1 \u00b1 1.7 10.6 \u00b1 2.5 -2.696 \u00b1 3.5 4.5 \u00b1 2.5 0.058 0.954 forearm pronation (degrees sD) 6.2 \u00b1 5.9 1.569 0.134 Wrist radial deviation 13.8 \u00b1 5.3 12.5 \u00b1 6 0.493 0.628 Table 2. results of logistic regression analysis of age and preoperative radiographic outcomes in masada type i versus type iib.

Murcia. Spain, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Symbrachydactyly is a unilateral hand mal- formation characterized by failure of formation of fingers and presence of rudimentary nubbins that include elements of nail plate, bone, and cartilage. Surgical treatment of symbrachydactyly is indicated to improve web space con-tracture, unstable digits, and inability to pinch. Our aim is to analyze whether there is a relationship between the severity of the involvement and the type of approach: non-operative or surgical treatment. Methods: Retrospective comparative study of patients evaluated in a pediatric referral center with a diagnosis of symbrachydactyly between 1998-2015. Demographic data (age, sex), family (congenital malformations, abortion) and medical history (syndrome, pregnancy disorders), clinical and radiological data of the hand malformation (side, Blauth, Foucher classification) and treatment were collected. A comparative analysis between different treat-ment groups was performed. Results: Fifty-eight patients were included (2 excluded due to foot involvement), with a mean age of 6.83 \u00b1 4.29 years, 34 (58.6%) being male, and 41 (70.7%) with left-sided involvement. Distribution according to syndromic involvement, and Blauth's and Foucher's classifications are shown in table 1. Treatment was non-operative in 45 (77.6%) and surgical in 13 (22.4%) (including commis-sure opening and syndactyly release in 6 (13.6%), toe to hand transfer in 3 (5.2%) and combinations in 1 (1.7%)), with significant differences in Blauth's (p = 0.0275) and Foucher's (p = 0.047) classifications. When patients were subdivided into those receiving some treatment vs. no treatment, there were no significant differences in classi-fications (p > 0.05). However, when the groups were sub- divided according to management with prosthesis vs. other treatments, significant differences were found for both classifications (p < 0.001) (Table 2,Figure 1). No dif- ferences were observed between subgroups regarding syndromic involvement or history of pregnancy abnor - malities (p > 0.05).Table 1.

The purpose of this paper was to com-pare radiographic parameters following acute osteotomy of the distal radius in children with HME. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all children treated at our institution with a diagnosis of HME. Patients were included if they underwent radial osteotomy, had preoperative/follow-up radiographs and minimum followup of six months. Radiographic parameters were measured preoperatively, Table 2.

Measurements included radial articular angle (RAA), carpal slip (CS), ulnar variance (UV) and sagittal radial tilt (RT). Statistics were calculated and ANOV A or Friedman test were used to compare data. Bonferroni cor - rection was applied. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: 16 patients with 17 forearms were included. The median age at the time of surgery was 11.5 years (IQR 3.6 years). The mean follow-up was 2.4 years (\u00b11.7 year). Preoperative RAA (43 o) improved postoperatively (23o) (p < 0.0001) with recurring deformity seen at most recent follow-up (32o) 0.0001) and toward recur - rence at most recent followup (39%) (p = 0.738). Figure 1 highlights the changes for RAA and CS. UV (-8mm) did not change with intervention or over the follow-up time period. One patient underwent revision for over-correction of RT. Conclusions: Acute radial osteotomy in children with HME can improve the wrist deformity. However, consid- eration should be given to perform this operation near skeletal maturity and/or advise the family that recurrence is possible if performed at a young age and revision may be necessary.EPOS Abstract Book 107 UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY GROUP SG-1 Elbow and radial head dislocation in neonatal brachial plexus a University, Dieu de France Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon Introduction and Objective: According to population- based studies, the incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) ranges from 1.6 to 5.1 per 1000 live births. Radial head dislocation (RHD) and elbow dislocation (ED) are rare but reported complication of NBPP. The pur - pose of this study was to assess the relationship between the level of injury and occurrence of RHD and ED in new-borns with NBPP. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken on 442 consecutive children with NBPP. For each case, age, sexe, affected side, level of the injury, clini-cal exam at presentation and during follow up were exam-ined and evaluated. Cases with elbow or radial head dislocation were identified and analyzed for the purpose of this study. Results: In 442 patients, 53% were female and the right upper limb was affected in 61% of the cases. The C5-C6 nerve roots were the most affected, being present in 61.1% of the patients. This was followed by the C5-C7 roots being present in 18.5%, then the C5-T1 roots present in 15.6%, the C7, C5-C8 and C7-T1 having the same propor - tion which is 0.45% and C7-C8 being present in only 0.23% of the patients. Only 3.22% of the patients had unknown affected nerve roots. RHD occurred in 5 patients (1.13%) with a mean age of presentation being 7.5 years. Four out of these five (80%) patients had total involvement of the brachial plexus. ED occurred in 4 patients (0.9%), with a mean age of presentation at 10.4 years. 3 patients had a total involvement of the brachial plexus (75%). Conclusions: The most common nerve roots involved in NBPP were the C5-C6 roots. Most of the RHD and ED were accidentally found on x-rays, and associated with a total involvement of the brachial plexus. UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY GROUP SG-2 Is the thumb Children, Osaka, Japan 2Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Izumi, Japan Introduction and Objective: IIIB thumb hypo- plasia is usually treated with pollicization of the index finger. In Asian countries, however, the parents are often concerned about the number of digits and may not con-sent to pollicization of the index finger. We are using non-vascularized toe phalanx transfer to create the first metacarpal and to stabilize the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb, so that we can salvage the thumb in type IIIB thumb hypoplasia. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 12 non-vascularized toe phalanx transfers in 12 children with Blauth type IIIB thumb hypoplasia. Stability and mobility of the thumb, lateral pinch power, and %thumb ray length was evaluated. Outcomes were also assessed using Functional Dexterity test and the Visual Analogue Scale for daily use of the operated thumb and for overall parents' satisfaction. Results: Age at operation ranged from 0.9 to 11 years. The follow up period was 7.6 years. Ten out of 12 cases underwent secondary reconstruction. All cases except one acquired good carpometacarpal stability. Thumb opposi-tion was possible up to the little finger in 7, up to middle 108 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) finger in 2, and not possible in 3 cases. The mean lateral pinch strength was 18% when compared to the contralat-eral normal side. The length of the thumb was 57% on average. Time required to complete the FDT was 220% of the contralateral side. V AS for appearance and function of the thumb was 76 and 70 respectively. Conclusions: Thumb reconstruction with non-vascularized toe phalanx transfer provided satisfactory results in func-tion and appearance in Blauth IIIB thumb hypoplasia. UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY GROUP SG-3 The Oberlin and McQuillan flap for the treatment of Manske type France Introduction: The objectives of cleft hand reconstruction are (1) to restore a functional and stable thumb-index pinch, and (2) to improve the aesthetic appearance. The main complications reported with the most popular flaps in the literature are skin necrosis, 1 st web retraction or index malrotation of the index finger. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and radiological outcomes of the Oberlin and MacQuillan technique in children with Manske type IIB cleft hands. Materials and methods: Six patients (7 hands, mean age 12.4 months) undergoing a cleft hand reconstruction between 2010 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical assessment consisted of: the 1 st commissure opening angle, the thumb opposition to the middle, 4th or 5th finger, the presence of a rotational disorder defined by a frontal deviation in flexion > 10 \u00b0, and the height of the 2nd commissure. Cosmetic aspect of the hand and the 1st commissure shape (\"V\" or \"U\" shape) were also reported. The metacarpal divergence and the inter meta-carpal distance were measured on standard radiographs. Results: At mean follow-up of 46 months., the 1 st web opening angle was significatively improved from 56\u00b0 to 88\u00b0, (p = 0.045). The thumb opposition was possible to the 5th finger in 5 cases, and to the 4th finger in the other cases. The height of the 2nd web was of 78 and 22 mm in the operated and contralateral hand respectively. No rota-tional disorders wasere found. Aesthetic results were very satisfactory in 6 patients with a \"U-shape\" of the 1 st com- missure. The metacarpal divergence was significatively improved from 40\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 (p 0.024). bone malunion occurred.Conclusion: The Oberlin and MacQuillan flap is a reliable and reproductible technique for the treatment of Manske type IIB cleft hands. with satisfactory functional, aesthetic and radiological outcomes. UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY GROUP SG-4 Supracondylar Osteotomy for the Treatment of Post- Traumatic Cubitus Varus in Children: A Cross-Sectional Descriptive Study of Long-Term Clinical Results and Two Different Fixation Methods Saymen Semaan Beirut, Lebanon 2Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon Introduction: Cubitus varus is a common complication of paediatric supracondylar fracture.The goals of this study were to evaluate the long-term clinical results of valgus osteotomy compared to the preoperative state and contra-lateral side, and to evaluate the long-term results of 2 dif-ferent fixation methods. Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study on 48 patients who had previously presented to a single institution for cubitus varus. Patients were operated of supracondylar osteotomy using lateral closing wedge and 2 different fixation methods:3K-wire construct/wires + 8 plate or a stapler. Mean age at time of osteot-omy was 4 \u00b1 1.8 years, with a mean follow up of 10 \u00b1 4.5 years. Parameters were compared. Results: Postoperatively, patients showed an increase in active flexion compared to preoperative values (140\u00b0 vs 122\u00b0, p < 0.001). However, the contralateral side yielded better active flexion compared to postoperative values (149\u00b0 vs 140\u00b0, p = 0.005). Clinical carrying of postoperatively of valgus on the contralateral side (p = 0.001). Radiological carrying angle was 7\u00b0 of valgus of varus preoperatively (p < 0.001). Postoperatively a mean clinical and radiological carrying angle correction of 22\u00b0\u00b16.6 and 25\u00b0\u00b17.6, respectively, was achieved.No significant differences were found for active extension. Active flexion was also improved in 85% of patients.However, 7 patients experienced a mean loss of 5\u00b0 of active flexion: 3 in the k-wire group and 4 in the augmented construct group.No differences were found between the 3 K-wire and augmented construct groups (all p > 0.05).EPOS Abstract Book 109 Discussion: Although active flexion, clinical and radio- logical carrying angle were significantly improved, 15% of patients experienced modest postoperative loss of flex-ion in both fixation methods. However, functional results were good, and patients were satisfied. Both fixation meth-ods yielded good long-term results. Conclusion: Supracondylar lateral closing wedge osteot- omy yielded excellent outcomes with minor complications. No benefit was found in augmenting 3K-wire constructs. UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY GROUP SG-5 Osteotomy design of the proximal ulna for radial head reduction in chronic Monteggia fracture Lin Feng Zeng1 1Guangzhou Huaxin Orthopedic Hospital, Guangzhou, China Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine the ideal direction of the osteotomy in the proximal ulna to reduce proximal ulna deformity when reducing the radial head and chronic Monteggia fractures in children. Materials and methods: From 2019 to 2022, We retro- spectively reviewed 13 patients with chronic Monteggia fractures who were treated surgically by one surgeon in our department . Open reduction and relocation of the annular ligament were performed using Henry's approach. The proximal ulna osteotomy was performed through a posterior approach using different osteotomy designs. Eight children (Group A) were treated with anterior superior to posterior inferior direction osteotomy of the proximal ulna and five cases (Group B) the osteotomy extended from anterior infe-rior to posterior superior. the plate bend angle was assumed to represent the ulna angulation and was measured in each patient. Group differences were analyzed using t-test. Results: The average follow-up of the patients was 11 months (range 1-28 months). The ulna angulation of group A was 26 degrees (range, -9-33 degrees) and group B was 14.8 (range, 20-32 degrees) (p < 0.05). Redislocation occurred in two patients in group A, while subluxation occurred in two in group A and group B separately. No nerve injuries, heterotopic ossification, or synostosis, were noted in follow-up. Conclusion: Osteotomies performed from anterior inferior to ulna osteotomy created less proximal ulnar deformity during reduction of the radial head in the treatment of chronic Monteggia fracture. Our study provides a specified direction for the proximal ulna osteotomy during PRUJ reconstruction.UPPER EXTREMITY STUDY Novel Surgical Technique for Paediatric Essex Lopresti Injuries and Systematic Review in Current Surgical Techniques Emma Fossett 1, Arash Afsharpad1 1Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom Essex-Lopresti Injuries (ELI) are an uncommon injury involving a fracture of the radial head, disruption of the interosseous membrane (IOM) and dislocation of the distal radio-ulna joint (DRUJ). They are usually caused by a high energy fall and the true extent of the injury is missed in up to 20%. A systematic review looking at published surgical man- agement of ELI was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane AND (Treat* OR Manag* OR Surg* or Techni*). Joint replacement and excision formed the exclusion criteria to allow relevance to management of paediatric ELI. 459 studies were screened by 2 independent reviewers, 13 studies were included with a total of 16 patients, average age 40 (S.D. 12.7). Surgical management varied from radial fixation, IOM repair, DRUJ and PRUJ fixation, annular ligament repair, ulna osteotomy and frame appli-cation. Data analysis did not show a statically significant difference (CI = 95%) between treatment groups which highlights the rarity of this injury and no common surgical treatment method. The most significant predictor for suc-cessful intervention was the chronicity of the injury, favouring acute intervention regardless of the method (p < 0.05). No studies have previously reported on the management of Essex-Lopresti injuries in the paediatric population. We report a case of a 10-year-old boy with an ELI vari-ant. Radiographs showed dislocation of the radial head, disruption of the DRUJ and plastic deformation of the ulna. A proximal ulna scarf osteotomy was performed to facilitate reduction of the radial head and maintain sta-bility in rotation. The annular ligament was augmented using triceps tendon and the DRUJ stabilised with a kirschner wire, removed at 4 weeks. The functional and radiological assessment appeared identical to the contra-lateral side at 11 months, with stable radiocapitellar joint throughout achondroplasia: ten year follow-up Luiz Carlos Almeida da Silva1, 1Alfred I DuPont Objective: Thoracolumbar (TLK) deformities in children with achondroplasia resolve in 70% of cases one year after independent walking and 90% by 10 years old. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship with spinopelvic parameters, beginning before walking, up to 10 years of age. Materials and Methods: Patients with achondroplasia with lateral spine radiographs at pre-walking (PW), 1-year post-walking (1YPW), 5 years old (5YO) and 10 years old (10YO) were identified. Development motor delay (DMD), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), apical vertebra wedging for height (A apical vertebra translation (A VT) were analyzed.Results: Sixty-two children (32 male, 30 female) were identified. There was no required posterior spinal decom-pression or fusion for progressive deformity or symptom-atic spinal stenosis. Association exists between DMD (p = 0.001), A VWH (p = 0.001) or A VT (p = 0.001) with TLK > 20\u00b0. Twenty-four patients had follow-up at 10YO and were divided into two groups according to the first radiograph 1YPW: positive PT (7) and negative PT (17). At 1YPW, children with negative PT had higher SS (p = 0.006), higher LL (p < 0.001), and lower PI (p < 0.001). This relationship remained constant 10YO follow-up: chil-dren with negative PT had higher SS (p = 0.012), higher LL (p = 0.002), and lower PI (p < 0.016) (Figure 1). When comparing the PT groups, there was no association with the persistence of TLK. Conclusions: In this largest series to date, spontaneous resolution of TLK in children with achondroplasia was 65% at 1YPW, and 89% in children followed to 10YO. With early identification and regular follow-up with patient education, no patient in this series required treat-ment or developed symptomatic spinal stenosis. While not predictive of resolution of TLK, the dichotomous pre-sentation of PT in young children with achondroplasia persists at 5 and 10 years of age, and reliably predicts the spinopelvic parameters. EPOS Abstract Book 111 CONGENITAL, SYNDROMIC & DYSPLASIAS OP-129 Is there a relationship between the functional level of juvenile and adolescent patients with Down syndrome and hip dysplasia? Mar\u00eda Gal\u00e1n-Olleros 1, \u00c1ngel Jes\u00fas, Madrid, Spain 2Neural and Cognitive Engineering group, Center for Automation and Robotics, CAR CSIC-UPM, Madrid, Spain Background: The prevalence of hip dysplasia among patients with Down syndrome (DS) is higher than in the general population. We hypothesize that a relationship may exist between functional level and hip dysplasia in DS, but this has not been studied to date. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is such a relationship between functional level and radiographic parameters of hip dysplasia or other measures. Methods: Retrospective comparative study of 652 patients with DS from a pediatric referral center database. Patients over 8 years of age with an anteroposterior pelvis radiograph and with no exclusion criteria were selected, totaling 132 patients (264 hips, 54.55% female; mean age 12.96\u00b12.87 years). Several radiographic parameters of the acetabulum, the proximal femur, and joint congruence were assessed (Table-1). Patients were classified into 2 levels based on functional skills (Figure-1). A multivariate association analysis was performed between radiographic parameters and functional level. Figure 1. Classification of Down syndrome patients' functional skills. Results: Sixty-one patients were compatible with a func-tional level-I and 71 with level-II. Forty-six hips were dysplastic and 60 were borderline according to W-CEA. A statistically significant relationship was found between the numerical and categorical distribution of certain radio-graphic measurements of hip dysplasia and classification by functional level (Table-2). A significant ROC curve was obtained for W-CEA with a cut-off point at 26.35\u00ba for level-I (AUC = .763; p < .005, sensitivity = .800 and speci-ficity = .644). There was a fairly high correlation between EI and TA (.749; p < .0005), EI and p and TA and W-CEA (-.748; p < .0005). Numerous hips showed signs of acetabular retroversion, with no signifi - cant differences found between functional levels (Table-2) or association with hip dysplasia measures. Conclusions: The present study reveals a relationship between increased risk of hip dysplasia and reduced func-tional level in DS children. These findings may guide indi-vidualized clinical follow-up of hip development in DS children considering their functional level.112 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Tables: Table 1.

Etiology is largely unknown, however, multiple NOF have beendescribed with some genetic syndromes. Limited information is available on NOF in rickets population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate NOF frequency and characteris-tics in congenital forms of rickets. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients with congenital forms of rickets and at least one bilateral lower extremity radiograph followed at two tertiary care centers in United States and Canada. Results: Sixty-four patients (mean age 14.1 \u00b1 5.1 years, 67% females, XLH, n = 55, 86%) were included in the study. NOF was present in 15 (23.4%) patients, predomi-nantly in the femur (n = 13, 72%) and medially located (n = 17, 94%) with mean length of 24.8 \u00b1 14.1 mm. Fractures were found in 20% of lesions and 3 patients (20%) presented with multiple NOF. Patients presented with angular deformities (AD) (n = 13, 87%, right limb: varus, n = 9, 69%, valgus, n left limb: varus, n = 8, 62%, valgus, n = 5, 38%) with mean mechanical axis deviation (MAD) from neutral of 21.9 \u00b120.2 mm. There was a propensity towards higher frequency of AD and AD corrective surgery in limbs with NOF compared to limbs without NOF (87% and 60% vs. 71% and 45%, respectively). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest report of frequency of NOF in children with congenital forms of rickets. NOF was found in nearly a quarter of patients with rickets and presented with relatively high frequency of angular deformity surgery. This may signify a correlation between osteomalacia, rickets severity, and NOF. Significance: The findings of this study have a prognostic value that could predict a risk for angular deformity for patients with rickets and non-ossifying fibroma. This could potentially help consult families to determine the follow up plan. CONGENITAL, SYNDROMIC & DYSPLASIAS OP-131 Intramedullary Rodding of Long Bones in Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: To Supplement with a Plate or Not to Supplement with a Plate? Amelia Lindgren 1, Kenneth Jeanne Franzone1 1Nemours Childrens Health - DV, Wilmington, United States 2Nemours Childrens Health, Wilmington, United States Introduction: Intramedullary fixation is standard for long bones in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), however it does not always provide adequate stability. Supplementary plate and screw constructs (PSC) can augment rotational and longitudinal stability.

Methods: A retrospective review identified OI patients who underwent IMR from 2014-2021, with minimum one year follow-up and sufficient fracture data. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, instrumentation and refractures. Results: 225 segments in 56 patients included 25 females; 93 femurs, 86 tibias, 28 humeri, 18 forearms. OI Types: 29 type-3, 20 type-4, 6 type-I, 1 type-8, 1 Bruck Syndrome. The average age at surgery was 8.4 years (1.7-23.9); 94.6% were on bisphosphonates. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years PSC was used for 63 (28%) segments. 67/162 (41.3%) segments without a plate were revisions; 48/63 (76.2%) segments with a plate were revisions (p < .05). The mean plate size was 2.5mm (2.0-3.5mm), with 6.0 (3-10) screws, 79.7% bicortical, primarily locking screws. 11 plates were used at nonunions, 1 buttress, 2 supporting allograft and 50 for rotation/length control. One plate broke, 1 became loose. 12 plates were removed with one fracture at a prior screw hole. The re-fracture rate per year of segments without a rod was 0.18 and with a rod was 0.12 (p = 0.44). Of the plate re-fractures, 19 were adjacent to the plate; 15 were elsewhere. Three fractures adjacent to the plate (4.5%) had deformity requiring revision. Five segments without plates (3.1%) had a fracture with acute rod bend requiring revision. Conclusion: Supplementary fixation with PSC and IMR for OI patients may provide additional stability at an oste-otomy or nonunion without incurring an increased fracture rate. A subset of re-fractures adjacent to a plate caused bending requiring revision and may support routine post-healing plate removal. CONGENITAL, SYNDROMIC & DYSPLASIAS OP-132 Technique of Telescopic Nailing of the Femur by Retrograde Approach (FRA) in Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: Clinical and Radiological Outcomes Mathilde Gaume nailing of the femur by antero- grade approach is the most common technique for the treatment of deformities and fractures in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). However, correction is uncertain with this approach, with a risk of residual coxa vara and inaccurate centering at the distal end of the femur. The objective of this work was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of telescopic nailing of the femur by retrograde approach (FRA). Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study involved 23 children with a mean age of 3.5 years (min age 1-year, max age 12years), operated according to the FRA technique, between 2004 and 2019, unilaterally (7) or bilaterally (16), i.e. 39 FRA. Radiographs were used to evaluate the mean postopera- tive cervico-diaphyseal angle, the horizontality of the joint interline in frontal and sagittal plane, and the quality of the centering of the nail within the distal femoral epiphysis. Joint mobility at one year follow-up, mechanical and infectious complications were recorded. Results: Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Mean postopera- tive cervico-diaphyseal angle was 92% of the postoperative cervico- diaphyseal angle greater than 130\u00b0. The horizontality of the postoperative joint interline in the frontal and sagittal planes was normalized in 90% of cases. The nail was centered in the frontal and sagittal planes in 87% (34/39). No complications related to the technique were reported.Knee mobility was unchanged at one year follow-up. Conclusion: Telescopic nailing of the femur by retrograde approach allows a satisfying femoral axis correction, particularly the valgisation of the femoral neck, which is essential to reduce varus stresses, a source of recurrence of deformities and fractures. The alignment of the knee in the frontal and sagittal planes was corrected. In addition, the distal epiphyseal implant was centered, thus preserving the nail anchorage and telescoping effect. SPORTS OP-133 Recurrent Patellar Pharmacy, Bucuresti, Romania Introduction and Objective: Patellofemoral instability is a frequent cause of knee pathology affecting quality of life among the pediatric population. Conservative treatment usually consists of brace or splint immobilization, result-ing in longer rehabilitation periods as well as a recurrence rate of up to 44%.EPOS Abstract Book 115 Materials and Methods: We present a prospective cohort study which included patients who had undergone surgical management using the lateral release and medial imbrication approach (LRMI) or medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFL-R). Patients were ran-domly assigned to a surgical group. The object of this study was to assess the quality of life among children that have undergone surgical treatment for patellar disloca-tion. Quality of life was assessed before and after surgery using the Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee form (Pedi-IKDC). Postoperative scarring was evaluated using The Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale. Results: One hundred and eight patients were selected and grouped according to the type of procedure.The aver - age patient age at diagnosis of patellar dislocation was 13.3 years \u00b1 2 years. Most patients (96%) had at least two more luxation episodes between diagnosis and surgery. Before surgery, the two groups had similar mean Pedi-IKDC scores (41,4 MPFL-R vs. 39,4 LRMI p = 0.314). The MPFL-R technique showed promising outcomes. When comparing the two surgical groups, there was a signi ficant difference in favor of MPFL-R group (MPFL-R 77.71 vs. LRMI 59.74 points, p < 0.0001-95% CI (11.22-24.72)). Using the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale, a significant difference in scar quality in favor of MPFL-R was observed (4,5 MPFL-R vs. 2,77 LRMI p = 0.002). Conclusions: patient quality of life more than LRMI. MPFL-R interventions are minimally invasive, reduce postoperative recovery time and increase quality of life. This study provides further evidence for the recommendation of MPFL-R as the gold standard for patellofemoral instability. SPORTS OP-134 Growth disturbances after transphyseal anterior reconstruction Transphyseal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) bears several advantages and becomes widely used. The main concern is the risk of growth disturbance. Our purpose was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of growth disturbance in pediatric patients who underwent transphyseal ACL reconstruction.We hypothesized that this procedure would generate neither clinically relevant Limb Length Discrepancy (LLD) nor axis deviation. Material and methods: This prospective, consecutive, single center series included skeletally immature patients who underwent primary Femoral Angle (LDFA), and Medial mea-sured. The definition of postoperative growth disturbance was defined as 10mm for LLD or 3 for axis deviation in comparison to the contralateral lower limb. Predictive variables included age at surgery, gender, side, and dia-meter of bone tunnels. Results: Fifty consecutive patients were included. Forty- seven patients (31 boys, 16 girls) with a mean age of 13.2 years (range, 9 to 16) at the time of surgery were available for analysis. Six patients had a LLD of at least 10 mm. Twenty-five patients had a difference in MPTA of a least 3\u00b0 (range, 5 to 8). Sixteen patients had a difference in LDFA of a least 3\u00b0 (range, 4 to 9). No patients presented either a clinical deformity or related symptoms. Regarding coronal angulation, there was no statistical difference in MAD, LDFA or MPTA. Gender, side, age and bone tunnel diameter did not influence growth disturbances. Conclusions: Transphyseal pediatric ACLR did not gener - ate clinically relevant growth disturbances and may be considered safe. Mild proximal tibial deviation may occur in patients operated on near skeletal maturity and should be further investigated. SPORTS OP-135 Functional Outcomes of Non-Operative Management of First-Time Patellar Dislocation in the Montefiore, Bronx, United States 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, United States Introduction: Patellar instability is one of the most com- mon injuries among active children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of recurrence and its risk factors, and the functional outcomes after non-operative management of first-time patellar dislocation. Methods: A retrospective review of pediatric patients presenting with a first-time patellar dislocation was 116 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) performed. All recurrent patellar instability/dislocation episodes were extracted, and statistical analysis was per - formed to determine the risk factors for recurrence. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) including the Lysholm score, Pedi-IKDC, and KOOS-Child were selected to determine the changes of functional outcomes with time. Results: 176 knees in 158 patients (102F) (14.0 \u00b1 2.5 years) (were included.Patients were followed for a mean of 16.4\u00b117.1 months. 72 knees experienced recurrent patellar instability (41%). On a multivariate binary logistic 95%CI:1.61-12.7, P = 0.004), Patella CD index > 1.3 P = 0.001), and TT-TG > 15mm (OR:2.49, 95%CI:1.3-6.03) were significant risk factors for recurrence (Table 1). Both groups were similar in all PROMs at the initial visit (Table 2). The Lysholm score, Pedi-IKDC, KOOS-Child pain, and KOOS-Child QoL improved significantly at the final follow-up in all patients. Conclusion: We found a 41% recurrence TT-TG > 15 being the most important risk factors for recurrence. Our findings also sug-gest that all children and adolescents will experience sig-nificant improvement in their PROMs after non-operative treatment of a first-time patellar dislocation. Interestingly, we found similar improvements regardless of the recur - rence status, except for the KOOS-Child Sports and Play subscale, which was significantly lower in patients who had recurrence. This study suggests that despite the rela-tively high risk of recurrence, non-operative treatment of a first-time patellar dislocation is still a viable option with excellent functional outcomes. EPOS Abstract Book 117 SPORTS OP-136 Anterolateral augmentation procedures during anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions in skeletally immature patients - scoping review of surgical techniques and outcomes Martijn Dietvorst after ante- rior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in children and adolescents are higher compared to adults. Studies have highlighted young age, hyperlaxity and rotatory instability as risk factors for graft failure and to require anterolateral augmentation procedures during ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The recosn-truction (ALLR) or lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) in skeletally immature children and adolescents is scarce. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the current anterolateral augmentation procedures in skele - tally immature patients and to discuss bio mechanical char - acteristics, surgical considerations regarding the physes and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: This scoping review was per - formed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) state-ment extension for scoping reviews. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for literature regarding ACLR with ALLR or LET. LET or ALLR techniques combined a transphyseal ACLR, transphyseal) were 118 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) included in this review. Specific parameters of the surgi- cal technique used in each study were collected, including the femoral attachment, tibial attachment and graft type. Findings from biomechanical studies of ALLR and LET were collected. Clinical outcomes, such as graft failure and growth disturbances were extracted. Results: Sixteen studies were included in this systematic review after screening 1.287 abstracts. Thirteen studies describe LET techniques and 3 studies ALLR techniques. Most of the LET procedures were performed during an over-the-top ACLR, with low graft failure rates. Literature on ALLR in this population is scarce. Conclusions: there are many LET techniques for skele- tally immature children, which are most often performed with an over-the-top ACLR, with promising clinical results. There are other LET and ALLR techniques for transphyseal, all-epiphyseal or hybrid ACLR in skeletally immature patients. SPORTS OP-137 The management of isolated meniscal tears in skeletally immature children. An international expert consensus Matthew Hampton 1, Nicolas Nicolau2, Fazal Ali2, Daniel Reed1, Adil Ajuied1 1Guys and Evelina Hospitals, London, United Kingdom 2Sheffield Childrens Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom Introduction and objective: The prevalence of meniscal tears in children are increasing in both number and com-plexity. There is currently very little evidence which can be used to guide surgeons treating skeletally immature patients with suspected meniscal injury. The aim of our modified Delphi study was to develop comprehensive rec-ommendations for the management of isolated meniscal tears in skeletally immature children. Materials and Methods: An international, two round, modified Delphi consensus was completed. Included 'experts' were identified as having an established adult and/or paediatric knee practice and either: 1) Faculty at the international kid's knee meeting, 2) Active member of the complex national paediatric MDT group, or 3) faculty on recognised national course aimed at teaching knee surgeons regarding the management of meniscal lesions. Areas where evidence is poor quality, inconclusive, or absent were explored and form the focus of the study. A threshold of 70% was used to identify consensus.Results: A total of 43 experts (Round 1) and 41 experts (Round 2) took part in the Delphi study. Surgeons from the UK, Europe, USA and South America took part. 34 state-ments were identified exploring 4 main domains - clinical diagnosis, investigation, management and specialist tears. Following round 1 consensus was reached on 17 (50%) statements, subsequently after completion of round 2 consensus was reached on 28 (82%) statements, leaving 6 (18%) with no consensus. The areas of no consensus included investigation of painless clicking, most sensitive clinical test for meniscal pathology, treatment of small radial tears, ability to reduce chronic bucket handle tears and timing of surgery. Conclusions: This is the first modified delphi consensus which provides evidence for surgeons treating skeletally immature children with isolated meniscal tears. Further studies are required to provide evidence for the areas where no consensus was reached. SPORTS OP-138 Medial Patellofemoral Ligament (MPFL) Reconstruction Clinic, Rochester, United States Background: Patellar instability has the highest incidence in adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years. The unique relationship between the medial patellofemoral ligament and the distal femoral physis in skeletally patients warrants precisely positioned and specifical atten-tion for MPFL graft insertion in this patient population. Purpose: To assess if surgical MPFL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients using allograft tendon results in stable patellofemoral joint conditions by analyzing redislocation and reoperation rates, radiological outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Prospectively collected data were retrospec- tively analyzed for 72 skeletally immature patients who experienced a first-time or recurrent lateral patellar dislo-cation and were treated with anatomical MPFL reconstruc-tion. Preoperative radiographic imaging was reviewed and analyzed, imaging. Trochlea dysplasia, tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG), and patella height were evaluated. Demographic data, concom-itant injuries, surgical procedure details, complications, EPOS Abstract Book 119 and postoperative history were assessed by review of medical records and patient charts. Results: A total of 81 physeal-sparing medial patellofemo- ral ligament reconstructions (72 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of our patient cohort was 14.9 (range, 12.1-17.2) years. Within the mean follow-up time of 30.5 \u00b1 16.8 months (range, 12 - 85 months) after surgery, there were twelve clinical failures resulting in re-operation. At the final follow up patients had a mean Lysholm score (1-100) of 96.5 \u00b1 6.7, a mean Kujala score (1-100) of 96.4 \u00b1 7.4, and a mean score of 4.9 \u00b1 1.3 on the Tegner Activity Scale (0-10). Patellar height and trochlear dysplasia did not influence redislocation or clinical scores. Fifty-seven out of 63 patients (90.5%) who were engaged in sports before injury returned to the same or higher level of competition. Conclusion: Physeal-sparing anatomic reconstruction of the MPFL the distal femoral physis in skeletally immature patients is a safe and effective treatment. SPORTS STUDY GROUP SG-8 MPFL reconstruction: the Chassaing technique vs tunnel (MPFL) reconstruction in recurrent patellofemoral insta-bility. The purpose of the study was to compare clinical outcomes and further complications of MPFL reconstruc-tion tunnel technique versus Chassaing technique. Methods: Retrospective study of 114 patients younger than 18 years old with recurrent patellofemoral instability treated with MPFL reconstruction. Demographic data, age at first dislocation, age at surgery, and age at follow-up were noted. Type of graft, type of fixation (Chassaing vs tunnels), and additional procedures performed was noted. Caton Deschamps index and TG-TT distances were mea-sured. Patients were asked to fill out the Lysholm ques-tionnaire and their level of activity. Results: 114 patients (139 knees) with a mean age at the time of surgery of 14.5 years (SD 2.3) were included. The Chassaing technique was used in 49 knees and the tunnel technique in 90 knees. Patients with tunnel technique were slightly younger (13.8 vs 15.6 years; p < 0.001), with a higher CD index (1.3 vs 1.1; p < 0.001), with distal realignment done concomitantly more frequently (46% vs 12%; p = 0,02), with a higher proportion of allograft (50% vs 0%), and with a higher follow-up (37.5 vs 20.2 months; p < 0.001). Lysholm score was significantly higher in the tunnel group (94.3 vs 89.1; p = 0.003). Differences in the incidence of patients who needed to adapt their sport activities after surgery (22.5% in the Chassaing group and 13% in the tunnel group) was non-significant (p = 0.127). Conclusion: Both techniques obtained good results although Lysholm score was significantly higher in the tun- nel group. This difference could be related to the younger age, the higher proportion of patients with allograft and concomitant distal realignment. Further studies are needed in order to investigate if the better Lysholm score is due to the technique of fixation (tunnels), the type of graft (allograft) or the concomitant distal realignment. SPORTS STUDY GROUP SG-10 Does the flexed knee position improve the diagnostic performance of MRI for RAMP lesions? asso- with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture are frequent (28% of patients) and difficult to diagnose on 120 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) MRI. MRI in a flexed knee position, by flushing the synovial fluid posteriorly, may improve diagnostic per - formance. Our objective was to compare the diagnostic performance of MRI in a flexed vs extended knee posi-tion in a paediatric population with ACL rupture. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study of 28 consecutive patients (11 girls and 17 boys), with a mean age of 14 years (11-17). All patients had an MRI in extended then flexed knee position before ACL recon-struction. The diagnostic criteria were: complete fluid fill-ing (completely interposed fluid signal intensity between medial meniscus posterior horn and capsule margin), irregular appearance of the posterior wall of the medial meniscus, and bone bruise of the posteromedial tibia. Gold standard for diagnosis was arthroscopic exploration. Results: Eight patients had a ramp lesion, of which one was diagnosed on MRI in extension, 6 were diagnosed on MRI in flexion. The combination of the first 2 MRI diag-nostic criteria had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 65%. Bone bruise was found in one patient who did not have a ramp lesion on arthroscopy. Using the combination of the first 2 criteria provided a positive predictive value of 46% and a negative predictive value of 87%. Regarding treatment, 3 lesions were managed with a simple debride-ment through a posteromedial portal, 1 was repaired using an all inside technique, and 5 had a repair through the posteromedial portal. Conclusion: MRI in a flexed knee position improves the diagnostic performance of MRI for ramp lesions, using the association of complete fluid filling and irregular appear - ance of the posterior wall of the medial meniscus. SPORTS STUDY GROUP SG-11 Etiology and type of patellar instability predict the rate of failure after patellar realignment in children and adolescents Giovanni Trisolino Introduction and objective: Patellar instability is the most common disorder of the knee during childhood and adolescence. Surgical treatment significantly reduces the rate of re-dislocation, but underlying pathologies and pattern of instability may affect the results. We aimed to report the clinical and functional outcomes of the three-in-one procedure for patellar realignment in a cohort of skeletally immature patients with or without syndromes and various patterns of chronic patellar instability. Materials and methods: We retrospectively investigated 130 skeletally immature patients (174 knees) affected by idiopathic or syndromic patellar instability, who under - went patella realignment through a three-in-one procedure. We classified the instability according to the score pro-posed by Parikh and Lykissas. Results: Patellar dislocation 73 55.7%) and syndromic in 57 (77 knees; 44.3%). The mean age at surgery was 11.7 years (range 4-19) and was significantly lower in syndromic patients. Syndromic patients exhibited also more severe clinical pattern at presentation, based on the Parikh and Lykissas score. The mean follow-up was 5.3 years (range 1.0-15.4). Redislocation occurred in 20 cases with 10 cases requiring further realignment. The Parikh and Lykissas score and the presence of congenital ligamentous laxity were independent predictors of failure. 23 knees in 19 patients required additional surgical procedures. The post-operative Kujala score was significantly lower in patients with syndromic patellar instability. Conclusions: The three-in-one procedure is an effective treatment option for patellar realignment. The type of instability and the presence of underlying syndromes negatively affect the rate of redislocation and the clinical and functional outcome. SPORTS STUDY GROUP SG-12 Successful Fixation of Traumatic Articular Cartilage-Only Fragments in the Juvenile and Adolescent Knee: A Case Series Emmanouil Grigoriou1, Aaron Krych1, Michael Stuart1, Milbrandt1, Clinic, Rochester, United States Background: Pure chondral fragments of the knee are often treated with excision due to the longstanding belief that they have little or no healing potential. However, there may be reevaluation of that concept as some are now considering fixation of traumatic chondral-only fragments in young knees, but little data remains to guide treatment.EPOS Abstract Book 121 Purpose: To determine if surgical fixation of chondral- only fragments in the juvenile knee results in an adequate healing response with successful radiographic and clinical outcomes. Methods: Data were collected on 16 skeletally imma- ture patients treated with fixation of chondral-only fragments with a minimum of 1-year follow-up to radiographic healing. Patients were selected by the operating surgeons based on the quality and size of the chondral fragment. Radiographic imaging was reviewed and analyzed. Demographic data, lesion characteris-tics, surgical procedure details, complications and postoperative history were assessed by review of medi-cal records. Clinical follow-up was conducted at a mean of 3.5 years.Results: The mean age of our patient cohort was 14.9 years. The mean size of the repaired defects measured 3.2 cm2. Within the mean follow-up time of 42.3 months (range, 15-145 months) there was one clinical failure with loosening of the chondral fragment and the need for re-operation. At final follow up patients had a mean IKDC score of 95.2 (IQR, 94.3 - 100), a mean score of 11.5 (IQR, 11.5-16) on the Marx Activity Rating Scale, a mean 90% (IQR, 88.75-100%) PROMIS psychological health score and a mean score of 5.69 (IQR, 4.75-7) on the Tegner Activity Scale. Conclusion: Our study indicates that primary repair of pure-chondral injuries with internal fixation can be a suc-cessful treatment option in selected patients. 122 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S)Table 1. patient Demographics, procedure Details and ouctomes.\u00b9 bmi fragment, m 21,5 2,8 lfC 7 chondral darts 17 N 90 100 7 100 10 100 5 2 14 f 31,8 7,5 trochlea 1 bioabsorbable compression screw + 2 chondral darts 37 y 90 75 22 100 16 100 9 3 14 f 16,7 1,5 lfC 1 bioabsorbable compression screw + 4 chondral darts 44 y 100 100 28 100 16 100 8 4 14 m 17,2 3,1 mfC 2 bioabsorbable compression screws + 4 chondral darts 20 y 100 100 28 100 12 92 6 5 15 m 25,3 1,7 lfC 3 chondral darts 72 y 95 95 20 100 12 95,4 4 6 14 m 24,2 3 patella 1 metal compression screws 24 y 95 85 26 97 12 95,4 6 7 15 m 18,6 4,5 mfC 1 bioabsorbable compression screw + 6 darts 15 N 90 90 0 96 0 96,6 3 8 16 f 21,9 1,2 lfC 8 chondral darts 82 y 95 95 16 94 12 94,3 5 9 16 m 28 5 mfC 3 chondral darts 145 y 100 100 18 92 13 96,6 7 10 16 m 33,3 6 lfC 4 chondral darts 21 N 75 50 13 98 12 96,6 5 11 16 m 20,5 2,5 lfC 2 bioabsorbable compression screws + 4 chondral darts 16 y 100 100 20 98 16 95,4 7 12 16 f 23,1 1 trochlea 2 push lock anchors + fibrin glue 14 N 100 100 0 84 0 82,8 3 13 16 m 26,6 3,23 trochlea 3 metal compression screws 77 y 80 50 19 92 16 94,3 7 14 14 m 21,6 3,75 lfC 1 bioabsorbable compression screw + 4 chondral darts 16 y 100 100 28 100 16 100 7 15 13 m 18,6 3,78 trochlea 7 chondral darts 42 y 100 100 26 100 16 100 6 16 15 m 30,7 4 lfC 4 smart nails 15 N 90 100 0 82 0,00 84,20 3 all chondral darts used acid) hospital for special surgery pediatric functional activity brief scale; rtp, return to sport; N, no; y, yes.TUMOURS & MISCELLANEOUS OP-139 Physeal distraction before excision of metaphyseal malignant bone Carla Spain Background: Improvements in imaging methods and adjuvant chemotherapy have increased survival rates in children with bone sarcomas up to 80%, therefore long-lasting limb salvage procedures are needed. Purpose: To describe a case series of pediatric patients who have undergone physeal distraction prior to tumor resection in treatment of metaphyseal malignant bone tumors. Methods: Between January 2007 to December 2020, 8 patients (5 boys and 3 girls) with a mean age of 7.2 years (2-13), underwent physeal distraction as the first stage of a tumor resection protocol. Six patients had Ewing's sarcoma and two had distal fibula (1 each). The affected bones were replaced with cadaver allograft in 6 patients; there was also one fibula autograft and one vascularized fibula graft. Chemotherapy was administered pre- and post-surgery; one patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. Average follow-up was 62.6 months (8-152). Results: Physeal distraction lasted an average of 10.6 days (3-15); delay to definitive resection was 17 days (range 13-22). Mean length of resection was 10.7 cm (range 5-14) all had negative margins. There were no local recurrences. Three patients suffered disease pro-gression with metastasis and died. Surgical complica-tions included: one case of pin infection, two surgical site infection, one allograft fracture and three nonunion of the diaphyseal junction. Final lower limb length discrepancy was 1.5cm (range 1-2cm). Normal joint function was achieved in 6 patients. The mean MSTS score was 75% (53%-97%). Conclusions: Physeal distraction technique is an onco- logically safe limb salvage procedure with good functional results and it should be considered in the treatment of metaphyseal pediatric malignant tumors.EPOS Abstract Book 123 TUMOURS & MISCELLANEOUS OP-140 Surgical treatment of benign lesions of the proximal femur in children Ryszard Tomaszewski1, Child Katowice, Katowice, Poland 2Department of Pediatric Surgery ,University Children's Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland 3Department of Orthopaedics, The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia Objective: We aimed to evaluate outcomes in children with benign lesions of the proximal femur treated with curettage, bone grafting, and plate fixation. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 30 chil- dren (median age 10.5 years; range 1.1-17.8 years) suffer - ing from bone cysts and tumor-like lesions of the proximal femur region treated between 2002 and 2018. We analyzed plain X-ray images and CT scans in all children and obtained MRI scans in a selected group of children (63.3%). We examined histo- pathologic biopsy results for all bone lesions before initiating treatment. Surgical man-agement comprised tumor curettage with adjuvant high-speed drilling and allogenic bone grafting supplemented by bone graft substitutes before plate fixation. Median follow-up interval was 87 months (range 24-156 months). We evaluated the healing of lesions according to Capanna's classification and rated functional outcomes according to Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 and Postel score. Results: Overall, 25 of 30 (83.3%) patients were admitted to hospital because of a pathologic fracture. We diagnosed simple bone cysts in 15 (50.0%) patients, aneurysmal bone cysts in 7 (23.5%) patients, and fibrous dysplasia in 8 (26.5%) patients. Bone consolidation was achieved in 22 of 30 (73.3%) patients after a mean of 5 months (range 3-7 months). The main complication was recurrence of the lesion in 4 of 30 (13.3%) patients. With respect to the Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 and Postel scores, 17 of 30 (56.7%) patients obtained an excellent result (18 points), while 12 (40.0%) patients had a good result (15-17 points) and only 1 (3.3%) patient had a fair result (14 points). Conclusion: Surgical treatment of bone cysts and tumor like lesions of the proximal femur by local resection, fol-lowed by filling the defect with bone graft material and internal stabilization represents a safe and effective treat-ment option in children.TUMOURS & MISCELLANEOUS OP-141 The Prevalence of Malignant Transformation in Pediatric Patients with Multiple Hereditary Exostoses Institute, West Palm Beach, United States 2Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland 3Paley European Institute, Warsaw, Poland Introduction/objective: Previous literature has reported 1-5% rate of malignant transformation in patients with mul-tiple hereditary exostoses (MHE), but there is a paucity of literature regarding this topic in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of malignancy in pediatric patients with MHE and share our experience with the resection of these tumors. Materials/methods: A retrospective chart review was per - formed on all patients ages 0 -18 years with a diagnosis of MHE who had at least one osteochondroma removed at our institution from 2012 - 2022. Demographic data was col-lected. The total number of surgeries, indications for removal, location of the tumors and pathologic findings were recorded. Complications related to the procedure was also recorded. Results: 109 patients were reviewed. The mean age at the first surgery was 10.0 years (\u00b14.0 years). 322 operations included removal of at least one osteochondroma. Each patient underwent a median of 2 (IQR 3) operations to remove osteochondromas. Indications for tumor removal included: pain, nerve compression, tendon irritation or concomitant site of deformity correction. 1276 osteochon-dromas were removed with a median of 10 osteochondro-mas/patient (IQR 11). The most common sites are seen in Figure 1. 1268/1276 (99.3%) of the pathology reports were read as osteochondroma, negative for atypia. One report was read as inconclusive. This was an osteochondroma taken from the distal ulna and the specimen was too small for analysis. Seven osteochondromas did not have report in the system. Five complications (1.6%) were identified: a retained drain (1), cerebral spinal leak (1), foot drop (1) and infection requiring antibiotics (2). Conclusion: In this review of 1276 osteochondromas, we did not find a single tumor that demonstrated malignant features in the pediatric MHE population.

It also has potential applications to many other clinical scenarios. mFels users evaluate chronological age, sex, and 7 AP knee radiographic parameters to produce a skeletal age estimate. Our group developed a free mobile application to minimize the learning curve of mFels radiographic parameter evaluation. We sought to identify the reliability of mFels for new users. Materials and Methods: 5 pediatric orthopaedic sur - geons, 5 orthopaedic surgery residents, 3 orthopaedic nurse practitioners, and 5 medical students completely na\u00efve to mFels each evaluated a set of 20 pediatric AP knee radiographs with the assistance of the \"What's the Skeletal Maturity?\" mobile application. They were not provided any guidance regarding mFels beyond the instructions and examples imbedded in the app itself. The results of their radiographic evaluations and skeletal age estimates were compared to those of the mFels devel-opers. Inter-rater reliability analyses utilized the kappa coefficient, Spearman's rho, and intraclass correlation coefficient, as appropriate. Results: Averaging across participant groups, inter-rater reliability for each mFels parameter ranged from 0.73 to 0.91. Inter-rater reliability of skeletal age estimates was 0.98. Regardless of group, skeletal age estimation reliability began to improve by the fourth x-ray measured, reaching steady proficiency by the 10 th x-ray measured (Figure 1). Conclusions: mFels is a highly reliable means of skeletal maturity evaluation. No special instruction is necessary for first time users at any level to utilize the \"What's the Skeletal Maturity?\" mobile application, and proficiency in skeletal age estimation is obtained by the 10 th radiograph. EPOS Abstract Book 125 TUMOURS & MISCELLANEOUS OP-143 Sports Participation in Patients with Lower Limb Deficiencies Katherine Miller1, Mary Dubon2, Viviana Bompadre3, Vincent Mosca3 1Paley Orthopedic Palm Beach, FL, United States 2Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States 3Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, United States Sports participation has documented physical, social, functional and health benefits for children with and with-out disabilities. A 2019 survey of U.S. children 6-12 years old reported that 71% participated in either a team or indi-vidual sport. Based on experience from a limb deficiencies clinic at a single center, we hypothesized that patients with lower limb deficiencies without comorbid diagnoses participate in sports at a level similar to that of the general population. A retrospective review was performed of patients 3-21 years of age seen in lower limb deficiencies clinic from 2005-2016. Patients were included if they had a congenital or acquired amputation or leg length discrepancy requiring the use of a prosthesis. Chart review was performed and descriptive statistics were used to report frequency and type of sports participation, diagnosis, amputation level, and laterality. Eighty-four patients were included in the study. The most common diagnosis was congenital limb deficiency fol-lowed by trauma, infection and tumor. Participation in an organized or individual sport was noted to be much lower in patients with a genetic, neurologic, oncologic and/or cardiovascular comorbid diagnosis (39%) than patients with orthopedic only diagnoses (66%) or no comorbid diagnoses (74%). Patients with bilateral deficiencies and amputation level through knee or above had lower partici-pation rates (36%, 43%) than patients with unilateral defi-ciencies or amputation level below the knee (60%, 62%). Prior studies report low rates of sports participation among children with disabilities, but much of this literature focuses on patients with neurologic or other comorbid con-ditions. Results from this study suggest that patients with unilateral lower extremity amputation without comorbid diagnoses participate in sports at a level comparable to the general population. This information is invaluable in coun-seling families of children with congenital deficiencies who must decide between treatment with amputation and prosthetic fitting versus reconstruction and lengthening. SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 2023 BEST OF TRAUMA OP-144 Natural outcome and life quality after pediatric spinal compression fractures Sofia Belov1, Reetta Kivisaari1, Petra Grahn2, Ilkka Helenius3, Matti Ahonen2 and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland 2Helsinki University Children's Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland 3Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Helsinki, Finland Objective: To evaluate the natural outcome and the impact of follow-up in pediatric spinal compression fractures. Methods: The radiographs of children with spinal com- pression fractures admitted to our institution 2014-2020 were re-evaluated. All the patients were contacted. The participants were examined in outpatient policlinic with a standard protocol. They filled questionnaires for life qual-ity (PedsQL, Oswestry) and pain (PedsQL), and control radiographs were obtained. Children with pre-existing risk for fractures were excluded. Results: Forty-eight patients (116 vertebral units) were included. All the patients were treated with activity restric-tion without bracing. The median age during the injury was 11.0 (IQR 9.0-13.8) years and the median follow-up time was 2.7 (IQR 1.6-4.0) years. Forty patients had isolated compression fractures and eight patients had multiple 126 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) traumas. The median number of injured vertebrae was 2 (IQR 1-3). Thirty-eight patients had injured thoracic, 12 lumbar, and 4 thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The radio-graphs were compared with the age-specific reference val-ues. In the initial radiographs 10 patients had hypolordosis and 14 patients had increased kyphosis. In five cases with hypolordosis and in 7 cases with increased kyphosis the radiograph was normalized in follow-up. None of the patients with normal lordosis developed hypolordosis. Six patients without primary increased kyphosis developed it later. In hypolordosis the median difference to reference was 7.8 (IQR 3.8-10.8) o and in increased kyphosis 4.4 (IQR 3.1- 6.0)o respectively. We found no association with degree of deformity and patient-reported pain, but there was minor negative correlation with life quality (PedsQL: emotions p = 0.038, school p = 0.025). Multiple traumas were associ- ated with lower overall functionality score (p = 0.008). Conclusions: We found that the overall life quality after spinal compression fractures in pediatric population is good (fig. 1) and minority of the patients remain to have mild spinal deformity. Routine follow-up seems to be unnecessary and should be targeted to the patients with multiple traumas. BEST OF TRAUMA OP-145 Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (25-PROMIS\u00ae) Scores for adolescents and young adults with a history of pelvic fractures in childhoodYasmin D Hailer1, Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden 2Section of Orthopaedic Surgery Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden 3Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gotheburg, Sweden Introduction and Objective: Childhood pelvis fractures are rare. Regardless of the etiology or treatment, long-term Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement after pediatric pelvic fractures has not been investigated. Patients and Methods: 223 patients between 6 and 17 years of age at pelvic fracture (ring and acetabular) between 2015 and 2021 were identified through the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR). Information on injury mechanism, AO-classification, and performed treatment was retrieved. All patients were invited to answer the 25-PROMIS\u00ae questionnaire with an additional open question. Results: 63 patients answered the questionnaires (28%). 44 patients had A-fractures of the pelvis and 41 of these were treated non-surgically. 13 patients had B- or C-fractures of the pelvis and 7 of these were treated sur - gically. 6 fractures weren't classified, all of these were treated non-surgically. The mean age at follow-up was 18 years (SD: 3) with a mean follow-up time of 3.6 years (SD: 1.8). The mean and median T-scores for all domains (mobility, anxiety, depression, fatigue, peer relationships, pain) were around 50 or showed better scores (figure). The majority (> 90%) reported no concerns with anx- iety, depression or fatigue. 15% had moderate or consid-erable concerns with mobility and 14% had moderate or considerable concerns with peer relationships. 12% had moderate or considerable concerns with pain. Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that the T-score for depression improved with increasing time to follow-up. Pain t-score improved with younger injury age. All other associations were found. 11 patients responded to the open question expressing pain or dis-comfort such as hypoesthesia during physical activity or sitting. Conclusion: Adolescents and young adults with a history of pediatric pelvis fracture reported normal 25-PROMIS\u00ae- scores in all domains. In this small cohort, some impair - ments were seen in mobility and peer relationships. Interestingly, neither the fracture class nor treatment had an obvious impact on these 25-PROMIS\u00ae domains.EPOS Abstract Book 127 BEST OF TRAUMA OP-146 Effect of the number, size, and location of cannulated screws on the incidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in pediatric femoral neck fractures: a review of 153 cases Wentao Wang 1, Federico Canavese2, Shunyou Chen3 1Scientific Research Center, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, ShenZhen, China 2Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille University Center, Lille cedex, France 3Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, FuZhou Second Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, FuZhou, China Introduction and Objective: The correlation between the number, size, and location of cannulated screws and the incidence of avascular necrosis (A VN) in children with femoral neck fractures treated surgically is uncertain. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 153 children (mean age: 10.6 \u00b1 3.7 y) with femoral neck fractures treated by internal fixation with 2 (n = 112) or 3 (n = 41) cannulated screws. The diameter of the screw was measured and recorded as a percentage of the femoral neck width. The distance (D) between the mid-point of each screw at the base (B) of the femoral neck and at the tip (T) of each screw and the superior and anterior cortices of the femoral neck, respectively, were measured on antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (L) radiographs. Values were expressed as the ratio between the measured distance and the width of the femoral neck (BD AP%, TDAP%, BDL%, and TDL%). The correlation between the number, size, and location of the screws and A VN was analyzed. Results: Patients with type II of initial displacement treated with 2 cannulated screws had a lower A VN rate (21.4%) than those treated with 3 screws (44.8%) (P = 0.027). Screw diameter (19%) in patients with A VN was larger than (17%) in patients without A VN (P < 0.001); patients with A VN had a lower BD AP% (48.6%) than those without A VN (56.4%) (P < 0.001). Screw size and BDAP% were risk factors for A VN (P < 0.05). Further, screw diam- eter > 16.5% and BDAP% < 51.6% of the femoral neck width were the cutoff values for an increased A VN rate (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients treated with 2 cannulated screws showed a lower rate of A VN than patients treated with 3 screws. Screws of larger size and screws closer to the piri-formis fossa on AP radiographs increased the risk of A VN in children with femoral neck fractures treated surgically. 128 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) BEST OF TRAUMA OP-147 Pediatric forearm fractures treated with bio absorbable intramedullary nails - lessons Medicine and Research,Danube University Krems, Krems, 3Department Universitarie Vaudois, Surgery, University of P\u00e9cs, P\u00e9cs, Hungary 8Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany 9Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria 10Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery ,Helios University Hospital Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany 11Deparment of Introduction: Bioabsorbable intramedullary implant (Activa Im Nail) received CE approval in August 2020 for the treatment of pediatric forearm fractures. A multicentric post market follow-up study was started to evaluate the effectiveness of the new technique. This study aims to report data on operative time, radiation exposure, safety and outcome of children with displaced diaphyseal fore-arm fractures treated by these implants. Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria: children aged 3-13 years, with diaphyseal forearm fractures that would require elastic intramedullary nailing (ESIN). The following parameters were studied: operative time, fluoroscopy time, implants size, need for conversion to standard ESIN, closed or open reduction, and other complications. Results: 118 children were available for review. The mean age at surgery was 8.9 (Range: 3-13). The most frequently used implants were 3.2 and 2.7 mm in diameter. Open reduction was required in 7 patients (5.93%). Conversion to ESIN was required in 5 children. (4.23%). The reasons for the conversion were: 1) medullary cavity too narrow (n = 3); 2) the insertion of the implant was not possible (n = 2). The mean length of surgery was 56.93 minutes (range, 15-260) and the mean fluoroscopy time was 200.1 seconds (range, 33-545). During the six-week period following the procedures 2 children required unplanned surgery due to soft tissue irritation caused by the implant. We observed implant related technical problems such as breakage or splitting of the nail in 7 patients (5.98%). There were no septic complications. Conclusions: 96 percent of forearm fractures requiring surgical treatment could be treated with a bioabsorbable nail. The operative time is comparable to ESIN technique, although the fluoroscopy time is longer. The surgical technique is more complex and may cause specific complications. The influence of the learning curve is not clear yet. The biggest advantage is that hardware removal is not needed.

Understanding the factors that increase the probability for surgical treatment can raise awareness to patients who are more likely to require additional care, and assist clinicians in counseling families, targeting treatment plans and constructing follow up protocols. We hypothe-sized that the age of the patient, the amount of initial frac-ture displacement and the angulation of the fracture would predict the need for operative treatment.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 276 proximal third diaphyseal forearm fractures at a single tertiary care insti-tution. Following a univariate analysis we constructed a binary multivariate logistic regression model that included age, initial translation and initial angulation to assess asso-ciation between tested variables. Results: A regression model revealed that age, (10 years and older, OR 8.2 95%CI: 3.9 to 17.24, P < 0.001) and radius translation of more than 100% (OR 7.06 95%CI: 2.69 to 18.52, P < 0.001) were associated with the need for surgical treatment. Initial fracture angulation lacked an association with surgical treatment (OR 0.81 95%CI: 0.38 to 1.74, P = 0.59). Conclusion: Older patients with an initial translation of the radius were more likely to undergo surgery. Initial angulation, although often being the most remarkable radiographic feature, was not associated with a non-opera-tive treatment failure. We recommend an initial reduction attempt after counseling patients and their families that there is a high rate of conversion to operative treatment when the above features are met. Table 1.

Errol Mortimer1, Luke Latario1, Marc Lubitz1, Ankur Narain1, 1UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, United States 2Lahey Hospital and Medical Center, Burlington, United States Background: Supracondylar humerus fractures are com- mon pediatric injuries encountered by orthopedic sur - geons, with a spectrum of severity. Displaced fractures are treated operatively with closed reduction and percuta-neous pinning or open reduction of injuries that cannot be adequately closed reduced. The purpose of this study is to identify preoperative injury characteristics associ-ated with a higher incidence of open reduction. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed of all AO type 13A (Gartland type) supracondylar humerus fractures in patients age 2-13 treated surgi-cally at a single level 1 trauma center over 6 years. Preoperative demographics and radiographic parame-ters were obtained for all patients. Primary outcomes were closed reduction or conversion to open reduction of fractures prior to k-wire fixation. Initial bivariate analysis was done using chi-square tests. Final multi-variate analysis with Bonferonni correction was per - formed using a backwards, stepwise regression model including potential predictor variables identified in the bivariate analysis. Results: 211 total patients received surgical treatment and 18 of those patients (8.5%) failed closed reduction and underwent open reduction. Final multivariate analy-sis demonstrated that only flexion type (Relative risk (RR) 10.2) and coronal displacement > 7 mm (RR 4.49) were significant preoperative factors for conversion to open reduction (figure 1). Fracture configuration and sagittal plane displacement were not determined to be independent risk factors. Conclusions: Patients with greater coronal displace- ment and flexion-type injuries are more likely to repre-sent diffiicult reductions and are at higher risk for conversion to open reduction after failed closed reduc-tion.

Traditionally, this is corrected with osteotomy, requiring a non-weightbearing. Guided growth has been investigated for torsional deformities, performed with stiff plates or circumferential cable implants that cause knee stiffness and may put the physis at risk. We present preliminary results of rotational guided growth in femur and tibia using a novel technique of peripheral flexible tethers. All patients treated with rotational guided growth of femur or tibia were reviewed. Flexible tethers, separated halves of a hinge plate (Pega Medical Orthopediatrics, Lavalle, Quebec, Canada), are fixed to the epiphysis and age at insertionDiagnosis site preoperative rotational profile removal rotational profile time to Correction hip ir hip er tfa hip ir hip er tfa r l r l r l r l r l r l 10,50 femur anteversion bilateral femur 60 65 20 20 40 40 50 45 15 5,42 Cpt ext tib torsion right tibia 30 5 19 14 18 7,67 Neonatal sepsis right tibia -7 15 10 10 11 8,58 Neonatal sepsis right femur 60 75 40 40 50 90 60 45 8 15,67 CfD int tib torsion left tibia 10 -15 5 -10 10 2,58 femur anteversion bilateral femur 90 90 0 0 45 45 35 35 7 metaphysis at 45-degree angles to the physis and con- nected with Fibertape (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Implants are placed medial and lateral in the opposite 45-degree inclination, determined by the desired direction of rotation. Five patients underwent insertion of 6 rotational tethers (2 bilateral femur, 1 unilateral femur, 3 unilateral tibia). One patient was treated for tibia and subsequently, femur. Diagnoses included idiopathic femoral anteversion congenital pseudarthrosis of tibia (1). Median age at insertion was 8.1 years. Average treatment time was 12 months. All patients resumed presurgical level of activity. All patients corrected the rotational malalignment. Average rotational change was 30 degrees in femurs and 9.5 degrees in tibias. Average follow up was 18 months (range 3-34 months) with no recurrence of the rotational deformity. No change in longitudinal growth was seen in the patients who underwent bilateral treatment. Rotational guided growth with flexible tether devices is a novel technique that successfully corrects torsional malalignment without invasive osteotomy surgery. The use of a flexible device appears to result in less knee stiff-ness and may be safer and less abrasive to the physis.132 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) BEST OF THE BEST OP-151 Long-term follow-up of untreated individuals with increased femoral anteversion at a mean age of of Orthopaedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway 2Section for Children's Orthopaedics and Reconstructive Surgery, Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, oslo, Norway 3Section for Children's Orthopaedics, Division of Norway Objective: Increased femoral anteversion (IFA) is a common problem in children, but the condition usually normalizes spontaneously over time. Persisting IFA can be treated with derotational osteotomy, but the surgical indications remain controversial and there is limited knowledge of the long-term consequences. The purpose of our study was to examine functional and radiographic manifestations of untreated IFA in patients of more than 20 years of age at follow-up. Material and Methods: Patients were recruited from a former study, published in 1991, that described the natu-ral course of IFA in children. Inclusion criteria were untreated IFA with an CT-verified anteversion angle 29\u00b0. Outcome measures were the sub-scores of pain and symptoms of HAGOS (The Hip And Groin Outcome Score) and foot progression angle. A control group of 14 individuals were examined using the same methods. Results: 46 patients (39 females) with a mean age of 45.2 years (\u00b1 9.1) and a mean A V angle of 40.7\u00b0 (\u00b1 8.1) were included in the study. Follow-up after last examina-tion in childhood was 32.8 years (\u00b1 8,4). The control group had a mean age of 46. 2 years (\u00b1 6.7) and a mean A V angle of 24.4\u00b0 (\u00b1 4,4) (p < 0.001). The mean HAGOS pain score was 83.8 in the study group and 97.1 in the controls (p = 0.001). The mean HAGOS symptom scores were 80.7 and 93.6, (p = 0.001). Mean foot progression angle was -0.1\u00b0 in the IFA patients and 5.5\u00b0 in the controls (p = 0.01). Conclusion: In this long-term study of adults with untreated IFA, participants displayed greater pain, symp- toms and more pronounced intoeing gait as compared with individuals in the control group. Still longer follow up is needed to assess the association between IFA and hip osteoarthritis.BEST OF THE BEST OP-152 Rule Breakers Achieve Successful Shoulder Balance: Unraveling the Myth of UIV Selection Criteria Michael Heffernan1, Drake1, Lindsay 1Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States 2Children's Hospital New Orleans, New Orleans, United States 3School of Public Health, LSU Health Science Center, New Orleans, United States Current upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) selection criteria are based on preoperative relative shoulder height. The purpose of this study was to compare shoulder balance at 2-year follow-up in patients designated \"rule breakers\" (RBs) vs \"rule followers\" (RFs) based on commonly used upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) selection guidelines. We hypothesized that violating UIV selection guidelines would not impact shoulder balance after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). AIS patients who underwent PSF between 2015 and 2017 with minimum of 2-year follow-up and complete clinical and radiographic data were included. Patients with Lenke type 5 curves were excluded. Radiographic measurements of shoulder balance were documented at preop, postop, 6 months, 1 year, and 2-years. Measurements included first rib angle (FRA), T1 tilt, coracoid process height difference (CPHD), and clavicle angle (CA). Shoulder balance was defined as CPHD < 1 cm. Relative preoperative shoulder height was utilized to create RB and RF groups based on commonly utilized UIV selection guidelines. Postoperative outcomes were compared between groups using mixed models adjusting for preoperative values, including sur - geon as a random effect. 88 patients were included (33 RF, 55 RB). Age, gender distribution, pre-operative T1 tilt, FRA, CA, and CPHD were similar between groups (p > 0.05). Immediate post- surgical outcomes did not differ between groups (Table 1). At 2-year follow-up, no difference was observed between RB vs. RF in T1 tilt (4.9 vs. 4.2\u00b0, p = 0.340), CA (2.2 vs. 2.3\u00b0, p = 0.716), and CPHD (8.3 vs. 8.7 mm, p = 0.815). FRA was higher in RB vs RF (4.1 vs. 2.9\u00b0, p = 0.031). Shoulder balance was achieved in 63.9% of RB and 62.5% of RF at 2-year follow-up (p = 0.878). Shoulder balance was similar between RB and RF groups at 2-year follow-up. Results of this study suggest current UIV selection criteria alone may be insufficient to predict postoperative shoulder balance in AIS.EPOS Abstract Book 133 BEST OF THE BEST OP-153 Health-related quality of life in Idiopathic toe walkers:- A multicentre prospective study Alpesh Kothari1 Oxford, United Kingdom 2St George's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom 3Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom 4Chesterfield Royal Hospital Trust, Chersterfield, United Kingdom Introduction: Idiopathic toe-walking (ITW) is a very common presentation but little is known about its effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In this study we hypothesised that ITW would be associ- ated with impaired HRQOL as measured using the Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for Children (OxAFQ_C), and that OxAFQ_C physical domain scores would be directly related to contracture severity. Methods: Twelve centres across the United Kingdom par - ticipated in a prospective, cross-sectional observational study of children under 18 years old with ITW. Data were collected on:- demographics, duration toe-walking, passive ankle range of motion with Silverskiold test, asso-ciated autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), previous and planned treatments and OxAFQ_C scores (children > 5 years old). Data were collected between May and July 2022. OxAFQ_C domain scores in ITW were compared to a historical healthty control group (N-36) and degree of plantarflexion contracture using Table 1. outcomes1 measured post-surgery and at 2 years postoperative. outcome n rf (N = 33) lsm (sem)rb (N = 55) lsm (sem)p-Value Postoperative t1 tilt, degrees 86 5.1 (0.6) 5.6 (0.5) 0.515 first rib angle, degrees 88 3.8 (0.5) 4.5 (0.4) 0.252 Clavicle angle, degrees 86 2.9 (0.4) 3.4 (0.3) 0.302 Coracoid process height difference, mm 86 12.5 (2.1) 14.5 (1.8) 0.342 2 years postoperative t1 tilt, degrees 87 4.1 (0.5) 5.1 (0.4) 0.143 first rib angle, degrees 85 2.9 (0.5) 4.3 (0.4) 0.017 Clavicle angle, degrees 84 2.3 (0.3) 2.2 (0.2) 0.836 Coracoid process height difference, mm 85 8.6 (1.3) 8.2 (1.1) 0.785 lsm = least square mean; rf = rule followers defined as fusion constructs adhering to current uiV selection guidelines (rose, p. s. & lenke, 2007); rb = rule breakers, defined as fusion constructs ending above or below current uiV selection guidelines (rose, p. s. & lenke, 2007); sem = standard error of the mean; uiV upper instrumented vertebra. 1model included preoperative values as covariates. standard statistical methods. Baseline characteristics of this population were also evaluated. Results: Data were collected from 157 children (M:F, 94:63). Mean age 10.8 years (Range 2-18, SD 4.1 years). Significant reductions in physical, school and play and emotional OxAFQ_C domain scores were noted in the ITW group compared to controls (Figure 1 p < 0.001). A significant correlation was noted between passive ankle dorsiflexion range in the ITW group and OxAFQ_C physi-cal domain scores (r s = 0.36, p < 0.001). 59 of 157 were new patients, and 98 follow-ups. Of the follow-up patients 11/98 had had previous surgical intervention, 87/98 non-operative management. There were no significant differ - ences in OxAFQ_C scores between patient group by management method (p > 0.05). Conclusion: ITW in children is associated with impair - ments in HRQOL measured using the OxAFQ_C, com- pared to heathy controls. Impairments are observed not only across the physical domain, but also the school & play and emotional domains. The more severe the equinus contracture the worse the HRQOL.134 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics BEST OF THE BEST OP-154 Validation of the Patient/Parent Reported Outcome Measure of Fracture Healing (PROOF-UE ) Questionnaire for Upper Extremity Fractures in Children 1, for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada Objective: Clinical trials of pediatric fracture treatments seldom show differences based on patient-reported out- come measures (PROMs), possibly because the PROMs used do not adequately capture patients/parents' pers-pectives. The Patient Reported Outcomes of Fracture Healing (PROOF) questionnaires are a new set of PROMs designed specifically for children's fractures. It comprises of 4 domains (Scores:0-100): on how it \"looks'; \"feels\"; \"works\"; \"healed\" (recovery experience). This project evaluates the reliability and validity of the PROOF-UE questionnaires for pediatric upper extremity fractures. Methods: Children (1-17 yrs) with upper extremity fractures were prospectively enrolled. Parents and children ( > 8yrs) completed the parent & child versions of the PROOF-UE, respectively, at 4 time-points until full recovery. Test-retest reliability two weeks apart (intraclass correlation coefficient) and internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha) were deter - mined at final healing. Known-groups validity was assessed as was convergent validity by comparing the PROOF-UE to the QuickDASH and PODCI. Responsiveness (sensitivity to change) was evaluated over 3 time-points using standardized response means (SRM). Parents' scores were compared with their children's. Results: 294 children's fractures (188 boys/106 girls, mean age 7.8 yrs) were included (Table 1). The PROOF-UE demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability for the Total and 4 domain scores for children (ICC:0.67-0.98) and par - ents (ICC:0.57-0.84); and high internal consistency for children (0.62-0.88) and parents (0.76-0.90), respectively. As hypothesized, fractures with vascular or nerve injuries, or associated with complications scored significantly worse on the Total and relevant domain scores than uncomplicated fractures (p < 0.05). There was moderate correlation with the QuickDash (R = -0.58) and PODCI (R = 0.66/0.84). The PROOF-UE was highly responsive with SRMs exceeding 1. Children's scores correlated strongly with their parents' (R = 0.85) with parents' Total scores an average of 1.5 points lower than children's. Conclusions: The PROOF-UE questionnaires are reliable, valid and responsive condition-specific PROMs to mea-sure upper extremity fracture outcomes that matter to children and their parents.

However, existing literature suggests that VBT is not modulating spine growth in a way that significantly affects Cobb angle. This study examines the effect of VBT in changing Cobb angle in AIS. Materials/Methods: AIS patients who underwent VBT with \u00b32 years follow-up from December 2013-January 2020 in a multi-center registry were reviewed. Change in Cobb angle from first erect postoperative radiograph to final follow-up was examined. A change in Cobb angle < 5 degrees was considered within normal mea- surement variability. Results: A mean of 6.6 levels were tethered in 113 patients with mean age 12.9 years (SD 1.3) and mean follow-up of 3.7 years (range: 2.0 to 6.8). Preoperative mean major Cobb angle was 51.1\u00b0 (range: 32\u00b0 which corrected 53\u00b0) on first erect radiographs. was 31.1\u00b0 (range: -50\u00b0 to 69\u00b0). 50.4% (57/113) of curves were stable (Cobb angles within 5 degrees of first erect radiograph on final fol-low-up). A total of 41.6% (n = 47) had > 5 degrees of increase in Cobb angle, 8% (n = 9) showed > 5 degrees of decrease in Cobb angle, and 4.4% (n = 5) had > 10 degrees of correction during the follow-up period. 2 of the 5 patients that corrected more than 10 degrees over - corrected, ending up with 30\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 curves in the opposite direction. Conclusions: Although this technique holds promise and many curves remained stable from first erect to final fol-low-up (50%), only 9 of 113 VBT patients in this series demonstrated improvement in Cobb angle over time, including 2 patients that overcorrected. Further research is needed to identify differentiating factors that determine which patients are most likely to benefit from VBT.

E-POSTERS BEST E-POSTERS EP-2 1Meir Aviv University, kfar saba, Israel Background: Spica cast has been used for many years to treat a variety of pediatric femur pathologies. Although a generally successful modality, it also involves a signifi-cant burden on patients and families. It is a large and heavy cast, that covers a significant proportion of the body, and leads to complete dependence and possible treatment complications, including pressure ulcers and treatment failures. There is a need for a more friendly non-operative modality. Methods: We conducted a technical study as part of the final project for biomedical engineering bachelor's degree. A three-dimensional computerized spica cast model has been developed, on which potential forces have been applied, that was similar to forces that act on normal spica casts. We then applied spica casts on experiment dolls and modified techniques according to a pre-planned endoskel-eton that would carry the expected loads and allow us to eliminate un-needed cast material from the total construct. These casts have been tested in a physics laboratory where forces have been applied to them in order to detect break-ing points and compare strengths.136 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Results: Three models have been compared- (A) a classical two-limb spica cast, (B) a similar cast with a BDRY mate-rial splint endoskeleton and a ventilated abdominal wall, and (C) a similar cast with a BDRT fiberglass endoskeleton and a ventilated abdominal wall. All three casts were able to bear a load of at least 0.4 KN (about 40 kg) without breaking. Model A (classical) was found to be less elastic and reached a breaking point at 0.8 KN (about 80 kg). Conclusions: This is a preliminary limited study that is part of the quest toward a modified spica casting technique. While it seems that a cast endoskeleton in load-bearing areas allows to eliminate cast material further technical and clinical studies are needed. BEST E-POSTERS EP-3 The incidence of physeal fractures in the lower limb and the frequency of premature physeal closure, limb length discrepancy, and angular deformity David Cant 1, Christian Faergemann1 1Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark Introduction and Objective: Physeal fractures represents 15-20% of all pediatric fractures. Fractures involving the physeal growth plate may lead to premature physeal closure (PPC). The aim of this study is to estimate the inci-dence rates of physeal fractures in the lower limb and to estimate the frequency of premature physeal closure (PPC) leading to limb length discrepancy (LLD), and/or angular deformity (AD). Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated 236 children treated for a physeal fracture in either tibia, distal femur, or distal fibula 2013-2020. All medical records and radiographs/CT scans were reviewed to obtain information regarding the development of PPC leading to LLD and/or AD. We also included information regarding age, gender, Salter-Harris classifications, accompanied frac-tures, and type of treatment (Table 1). Overall, 100 children had planned growth evaluations or were referred to pediatric orthopaedic evaluation due to symptoms of PPC. Results: The overall incidence rate (IR) was 34.6 (CI: per 100,000 and 1.1%, respectively (Table 2). We discovered a significant higher prevalence of PPC in fractures treated surgically (p < 0.001) and fractures with an initial displacement greater than 3 mm (p = 0.01) (Table 3). Conclusions: The study showed that a considerable pro-portion of children with physeal fractures in the lower limb develops PPC leading to LLD and/or AD. The highest prevalence was found among fractures treated surgically and those with initial displacements > 3 mm. This study accentuates the importance of a consistent and uniform growth evaluation after physeal fractures in the lower limb.

BEST E-POSTERS EP-4 Management of Syndesmotic Ankle Injuries: Results of a While literature on operative adult syn- desmotic injury management has shown improved out- comes with suture-button versus screw fixation, this has yet to be demonstrated in pediatric populations. This study evaluates trends in management and identifies fac-tors influencing surgeon choice of implant for pediatric syndesmotic injuries. Methods: A survey regarding implant preferences for pediatric syndesmotic injuries was emailed to all Pediatric 138 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) mem- bers. Responses were collected from 10/1/2021-5/15/2022. Respondents were excluded if they opted out of the survey, treated < 1 pediatric syndesmotic ankle injury in the past year, or had conflicting financial/contractual obligations. The significance between post-training years and tech-nique preference was assessed using logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant factors (P-values < 0.05). Results: One hundred and three members responded to the survey. One-quarter of respondents were < 5 years post-training, 24% were 5-10 years, 21% were 11-15 years, and were > 15 years post-training. Twenty- three percent (24/103) preferred screws to treat pediatric syndesmotic ankle injuries versus 76% (78/103) preferred suture-button fixation. Members > 15 years post-training were 4.7 times more likely to prefer screw implants than members < 5 years post-training (OR = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.14- 19.34; p = 0.03). Since the start of their clinical practice, 62 respondents (60%) reported a change in implant preference, with avoid-ance of secondary surgery (46/62; 74%) and extrapolation from outcomes in adults (39/62; 63%) as primary motivat-ing factors (Table 1). Of the 40 members with no change in preference, 83% (33/40) cited that this was due to their comfort with the procedure. Conclusion: Suture-button implants have gained popular - ity as an alternative to screw fixation for pediatric syndes- motic ankle injuries. Our data demonstrates surgeon interest in decreasing the need for implant removal and extrapolation from superior outcomes seen in adult popu-lations are primarily responsible for this shift. EPOS Abstract Book 139 BEST E-POSTERS EP-5 The flipping wedge osteotomy: how Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) suggested a simple and reliable type of osteotomy Alessandro Depaoli 1, Grazia Chiara 2Department Alma University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy 3University of Firenze, Firenze, Italy Introduction and objective: The three main types of osteotomies for bone correction are closing wedge oste-otomy, opening wedge osteotomy and dome osteotomy. Each type has its well-known advantages and disadvan-tages. We present the flipping wedge osteotomy method, which allowed to obtain length-preserving correction with two monoplane cuts (Figure 1A-C). Materials and methods: During our experience with Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP), we developed a simple method to plan the correction of angular and rotational deformities without changing bone length. This method was verified through 3D models and has been applied to treat two cases of post-traumatic deformity of the elbow in pediatric patients. Results: The angle of a deformity (alpha) can be cor - rected by flipping of 180\u00b0 a specific bone wedge with a section approximated to a rectangle trapezoid. This trap-ezoid is constructed as follows: the major leg is obtained by cutting the bone at the CORA along the transversal bisector line of alpha (Figure 2B), the minor leg is obtained by cutting the bone perpendicularly to one of the bone axes (Figure 2C). The bases of this trapezoid can be cut as long as needed. This method can correct the deformity using the bone wedge at the osteotomy site as autograft by simply flipping it (Figure 1B and 2D), with no changes of bone length. If a residual torsional defor - mity is present, it could be corrected at the non-CORA osteotomy site. Even in multiapical deformities, where the main CORA is located outside the bone shaft, this method may be applied by simply flipping the segment of bone between two osteotomies performed along each transversal bisector line of the proximal and distal CORAs (Figure 3). Conclusions: This method is a simple and reliable strategy to treat uniapical and multiapical deformities in metaphy-seal and diaphyseal EP-7 Can Collapat II help reducing perioperative blood Robert Debr\u00e9 Hospital, Paris, France Introduction: AIS surgery is a major hemorrhagic proce- dure. Patient blood management has been developed to avoid perioperative blood transfusion, which is correlated with increased morbidity and infections. Collapat II is a bone substitute material made of collagen and ceramised hydroxyapatite, with associated haemostatic properties, that has shown efficiency in maxillo-facial surgery. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of Collapat II use in the perioperative blood loss in AIS surgery. Methods: After IRB approval, all AIS patients undergoing primary correction were prospectively included over a 9-month period, with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patients receiving Collapat II at the end of the procedure (Collapt group) were compared to a control group without any haemostatic agent or bone substitute. The same peri-operative blood saving strategy, associating tranexamic acid, cell salvage and preoperative erythropoietin were used in both groups. Closed suction drainage (2 subfascial 140 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) 8 mm drains) was used for all patients. Perioperative blood loss were compared between groups. Results: Overall, 34 patients were included in each group, with similar demographic and radiological data. No differ - ence in the volume of drainage was observed at day 1, but the reduction was statistically different at day 2 (1135 mL [800-1640] versus 930 [480-1510] p = 0.028) and also in the total drainage volume (0.63 ml/Kg/h [0.4-0.92] versus 0.46 [0.29-0.7], p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis found that the use of Collapat II was associated with a significant decrease in the postoperative blood loss estimated from the drains (OR = 0.85 [0.80-0.96]). The transfusion rate was lower in the Collapat II group (0 (0% versus 3(8.8%), p = 0.076) but not statistically different. No complication related to the biomaterial was reported. Conclusion: With 27% reduction in drain volume, Collapat II can be considered as a blood salving strategy in AIS sur - gery. The role of the biomaterial in fusion rate still needs to be further assessed. BEST E-POSTERS EP-8 Factors influencing Treatment Time in Conservative dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the the most common disorders in newborns. Ultrasound examina-tion of the hip allows early diagnosis followed by early conservative treatment in almost all cases. Conservative treatment is required until a stable mature hip is reached. However treatment time shows a wide variation and pre-diction is still not possible. The aim of this study therefore was to determine factors influencing conservative treatment duration in newborns with developmental dysplasia of the hip and to investigate how these factores influence the duration of treatment. All patients treated at our institution within a ten-year period were included in this study. Treatment consisted of observation (Graf - type 2a and 2a+ hips), in flexion -abduction therapy (Graf type 2b, 2c) and reposition with subsequent cast application in dislocated hips (Graf - type D, III, IV). A data - based general linear model according to Wald was created and several factors (sex, age, alpha angle, hip instability) were tested on it. 503 (m = 87 f = 416) newborns with DDH were included in the study. A general model according to Wald was created based on the worst alpha angle of the newborns (29 degrees), the mean age at treatment start (1,34 months) and a bilateral pathological hip. Age, alpha angle and bilaterality influence treatment time significantly. Hereby a 10-degree increase of alpha angle reduces the treatment time by one month and four weeks more of age lead to two weeks more of treatment time. Also bilateral pathology increased treatment time by two weeks while sex and hip instability had no significant influence. This model shows that age, affected number of hips and alpha angle are significant factors influencing the duration of conservative treatment in DDH. BEST E-POSTERS EP-9 Minimally invasive surgery vs standard posterior approach in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis: a two years follow-up efficacy of posterior minimally invasive surgery(MIS) to standard posterior spinal fusion(PSF) surgery in adolescent idiopathic sco-liosis (AIS). Methods: We retrospective collected 111 patients with Lenke type 1-6 AIS with Cobb angle curve 70\u00b0 who treated with MIS (n = 47) or PSF (n = 64) between February 2018 and February 2020. All of them attempted an outpa-tient follow-up for at least two years from surgery. We col-lected values of Cobb angles degrees to study the correction rate of the structural major curve. Level of apical and distal fusion, operative time, postoperative hemoglobin reduc-tion, full length of hospitalization and time to accomplish verticalization were recorded.NRS medium score was assessed for pain value during the stay. Complications recorded included: temporary or permanent nerve lesions, fever, surgical wound infection, mechanical complication and postoperative pain assessment. Results: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of radiographic and clinical features. The correction rates of the structural curve were not observed to be significantly different between MIS and PSF (64.6% vs 60.9%) as for the correction rate of secondary curve (59.1 vs 59.2). The two groups had non significantly lon-ger operative time (209.9 vs 215min). The MIS group had a significantly lower decrease of postoperative hemoglo-bin in comparison to PSF group (2.8 vs 4.3). The evalua-tion of pain using NRS score showed a lower score in MIS EPOS Abstract Book 141 Tab3 complications (n) mis pfs intraop neurological deficit - 1 Wound deiscence or infections - 7 screw loosening 1 rod breakage 1 - Neurological pain 1 2 fever - 1group (1,8 vs 2,8). PSF group was observed to have sig- nificantly lengthier time of hospitalization (5.2 vs 6.3) than MFS. Complications were more frequent in PSF group rather than in MFS group (11 vs 3), with no infectious complication in MIS group.Conclusion: Posterior MIS is a safe and capable alterna-tive to standard open approach for AIS patients with curves < 70\u00b0,with analogue capacity of scoliosis correction and same operative time, but the advantages with MIS tech-nique of less blood loss, length of stay and pain.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can mediate tissue repair through secretion of exosomes, and we hypothesize that MSC exosomes are thus an alternative approach for ACL repair. This study investigates the efficacy of MSC exosomes for primary ACL repair in a rabbit model. ACL tears were surgically created in the unilateral knee joints of 12 rabbits. Rabbits were randomized to 2 groups (n = 6) which received either (1) MSC exosomes and fibrin sealant (Exosome+FS), and (2) FS alone, intraoperatively after ACL suture repair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively. At 12 weeks, samples were harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. ACL repair was assessed through general morphology and degree of ligamentous integrity restoration. To investigate cellular processes mediated by MSC exosomes, cell metabolic activity, DNA content, cell migration, collagen deposition and gene expression were measured at 4, 24, 48 and 72h post-treatment. 1 rabbit in the FS group showed sustained ACL healing on MRI from 6 to 12 weeks. In comparison, 5 out of 6 rabbits in the Exosome+FS group showed sustained ACL healing on MRI at both time points, with complete restoration of ligamentous integrity and rich deposition of predominantly type I collagen, similar to native ACL. The FS group had mainly type III collagen, with partial restoration of liga-mentous integrity. MSC exosomes dose-dependently enhanced cell metabolic activity (p = 0.002), proliferation (p < 0.001), migration (p < 0.001), suppressed ACL matrix degradation and enhanced collagen synthesis at 48h post-treatment (p = 0.015). These findings were supported by significantly increased gene expression for proliferation (PCNA, FGF-2; p < 0.001), migration (FGF-2; p < TGF-1; exosomes with biologically enhance ACL by augmenting ACL cell functions. E-POSTERS EP-12 Systematic Isolation of Key Parameters for Estimating Skeletal Maturity on Shoulder Radiographs Ryan Furdock1, Noah Wickerham2, Matthew Folkman3, Alexander Benedick1, Raymond Liu1 1UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States 2Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States 3University of Toledo School of Medicine, Toledo, United States Introduction and Objective: The proximal humerus ossification system (PHOS) is a new skeletal maturity system (SMS) that is uniquely useful in treating scoliosis. Integration of an additional medial fusion parameter increases PHOS's ability to predict likelihood of progres-sion to a surgical curve magnitude, but decreases the pro-portion of readable posteroanterior (PA) shoulder XR. We sought to improve accuracy, readability, and reliability of PHOS by integrating new radiographic parameters. Materials and Methods: Utilizing the prospectively col- lected, historical Bolton-Brush longitudinal growth study, demographic factors (age + sex), PHOS, and four novel radiographic parameters were evaluated on serial peripu-bertal shoulder radiographs, using Greulich and Pyle (GP) skeletal age from corresponding hand radiographs for com-parison. Stepwise linear regression and generalized esti-mating equations were used to identify ideal radiographic and demographic parameters for estimating skeletal matu-rity based on 90% of final height (a corollary of peak height velocity). Accuracy of 5 SMS were compared: GP, PHOS, PHOS + demographics, PHOS + demographics + medial fusion, and PHOS + demographics + novel radiographic parameters (expanded PHOS). Results: 368 peripubertal radiographs from 79 patients (41 girls and 38 boys) were included. The PHOS + demo- graphics SMS estimated skeletal maturity with a mean discrepancy of 0.51-year and was more accurate than GP EPOS Abstract Book 143 alone (0.67-year, p < .001) or PHOS alone (0.73-year, p < .001). The addition of medial fusion resulted in similar accuracy in skeletal maturity estimation (0.50-year, p = .07). The expanded PHOS system, which included novel radiographic parameters, estimated skeletal matu-rity with better accuracy than PHOS + demographics (0.48 vs 0.51-year, p = .002).Conclusion: Integration of demographic information into PHOS leads to greatly improved skeletal maturity estima-tion accuracy with minimally increased time and effort applying the system. For quick clinical use in skeletal maturity estimation, PHOS + demographics may be suffi-cient. However, utilization of the expanded PHOS may yield more accurate results. E-POSTERS EP-13 Metabolic Impacts on Post-Surgical Outcomes Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States 2University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada Purpose: Hemiepiphysiodesis is a growth modulation sur - gery used to correct angular limb deformities associated with hypophosphatemic rickets. We aimed to evaluate the effects of metabolic control on surgical outcomes in chil-dren with genetic forms of hypophosphatemic rickets. Methods: this was a multicenter retrospective study. records and radiographs of children with genetic forms of hypophosphatemic rickets who underwent hemiepiphys-iodesis, were reviewed. The study period was 12 months pre- to 24 months postoperative. Serum alkaline phospha-tase activity (ALP) was used to assess metabolic controlas a percentage above the upper limit of normal (%ALP ULN) due to different reference ranges for age and sex. Mechanical axis deviation (MAD), was measured serially to assess surgical correction. Results: Twenty-four surgery 9.3 3.6 years, 92% bilat-eral deformities). Pre and postoperative radiographs were available for 36 total limbs (72% varus). Correction to neutral was achieved in 13/29 (45%) limbs by 12 months and in 22/29 (76%) by 24 months. Correction occurred in all valgus deformities but only 56% of varus deformities. Preoperatively, limbs that corrected had lower preopera-tive MAD (mean 38.3 vs 56.0 mm, p = 0.008) but no significant difference in %ALP ULN corre- lated positively at 12 months postop (r = 0.8, p = 0.005), while %ALP ULN at 12 months postop correlated nega-tively with both MAD rate of change (r = -0.72, p = 0.02) and overall percentage MAD change (r = -0.75, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Postoperative metabolic control of rickets as assessed by ALP appears to influence the rate of angular deformity correction regardless of preoperative values. Optimization of metabolic control and follow up are prudent for these patients to improve surgical out-comes. Larger studies are needed to further assess pre-dictive factors for success after hemiepiphysiodesis.144 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-14 Regional Neuromuscular Blocks and Pain Catheters for Perioperative Pain Control in the Setting of Osteogenesis Imperfecta pain control for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) patients undergoing upper and lower extremity procedures is an important aspect of care. Adjunctive options to general anesthesia may provide perioperative pain control. Our objective is to report a series of regional nerve blocks for OI patients undergoing extremity procedures. Methods: This is a retrospective review of OI patients undergoing extremity procedures with regional blocks. Chart review was completed for demographics, proce-dures, block type, opioid use and pain scores. Results: We identified 40 surgical encounters (29 patients) (17 male, 42.5%), average age 9.7 years (3-26), average weight 24.67 kg (9.8-47.3). The number of procedures per surgery was 1 (72.5%), 2 (17.5%) and 3 (10%). OI type 3 was most common (21, 52.5%). The two most common procedures were humeral and femoral rodding, 10 each (25%). Twenty-five (62.5%) procedures The most frequent blocks were lumbar plexus for lower extremities (15/27, 55%) Morphine, Dilaudid and Oxycodone use first 24 hours was 0.034, 0.0017, and 0.168 respectively. Average pain scores in the PACU and at 24 hours were 0.7 (SD = 1.2) and 1.7 (SD = 1.6) respectively. There were no adverse events related to the regional blocks. Conclusion: The use of regional nerve blocks with indwelling catheters was safe and effective in this series of OI extremity procedures as demonstrated by low pain scores and minimal perioperative opioid use. Future work is underway to compare pain medication requirements to a control group.E-POSTERS EP-15 Results of a Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire Prior to Limb Lengthening in Institute, West Palm Beach, United States 2Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland 3Paley European Institute, Warsaw, Poland Introduction and objective: Increasing height through limb lengthening is an option for patients with Achondro-plasia. However, spinal stenosis is common in this patient group and may become lead to neurologic complications while lengthening. The purpose of this study was to review the preoperative questionnaire we developed to prevent complications in patients with Achondroplasia undergoing limb lengthening. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all children treated at our institution with a diagnosis of Achondroplasia. Patients were included if they had answered the Achondroplasia Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire prior to surgery for limb lengthening sur - gery. A sample questionnaire is found in Figure 1. Data collected includes patients' responses to the questionnaire, MRI findings of stenosis and whether or not lengthening was postponed due to these findings. Binomial regression was performed to determine if one question contributed more than the others to the questionnaire. Results: 32 patients completed the questionnaire. The mean age at the time of questionnaire was 11.7 years (\u00b14.9 years). Twelve patients had no positive findings on the question-naire. The average number of positive responses for patients with at least 1 positive response was 3.2/5. Eighteen patients had 2 positive responses and none of these patients under - went decompression prior to lengthening or had complica-tions during lengthening with regards to their spinal cord/nerves. Fourteen patients had had 3 positive responses. 8/14 underwent spinal decompression prior to lengthening. Only one patient answered affirmatively to bowel/bladder incontinence. This patient had a score of 5/5 and underwent spinal cord decompression and fusion. The regression model did not find any question to be more significant than another. Conclusions: The Achondroplasia Spinal Stenosis Ques- tionnaire helps determine which patients may be at risk for complications from spinal stenosis during limb lengthen-ing. Scores of 2 or less appear to be safe for lengthening.EPOS Abstract Book 145 E-POSTERS EP-16 Study to Establish the Disability Weight and country-specific Utility Weights for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Helena Nathan Saxby2, Daniel Corlew3, Daniel Perry4, Manon Pigeolet5 1Harvard Medical School, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Boston, United States 2Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa, United States 3Harvard Medical School, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, The Program in Global Surgery and Social Change, Boston, United States 4Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom 5Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Faculty of Medicine, Avenue de Lennik 808, Brussels, Belgium Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a spectrum of hip pathologies. Allocation of priorities for public health research and policy requires quantifica-tion of the relative impact of health problems. Methods to quantify disease burden include disability weights, which measure the level of disability for a health state, and utility weights, which estimate the effect on quality of life with a lower utility weight associated with greater loss in quality of life for the person affected by the disease. However, these values have been calculated for few orthopaedic con-ditions. This study aims to calculate the disability weight and country-specific utility weights for DDH. Methods: Participants were fully licensed Orthopedic surgeons contacted through national and international Orthopedic organizations. A survey utilised three exercises to estimate disability weight of DDH: preference-ranking exercise, time trade-off exercise and visual analogue scale. A global disability weight was calculated using a random effects model through an inverse-variance approach. A country-specific utility weight was calculated as 1 minus the country-specific disability weight given by the time trade-off exercise and visual analogue scale. Results: 181 surgeons participated over four months with 116 surgeons included in the final analysis. The global disability weight for DDH was calculated to be 0.18 (range, 0.11 to 0.24). Compared to other musculo-skeletal conditions, this disability weight falls between amputation of one leg (disability weight: 0.173) and severe neck pain (disability weight: 0.229). Country-specific utility weights for DDH ranged from 0.26 in Morocco to 0.89 in Finland. Conclusion: This is the first time that a global disability weight and utility weights have been estimated for DDH, which may assist in economic evaluations and the devel-opment of health policy. The methodology may be applied to other orthopedic conditions.

During spica immobilization, femoral head progress acetabulum bottom.146 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) The aim of the study was to highlight and quantify this progression docking index (PDI) whose importance can be one of the predictive sign of the success of hip reduction. Materials and methods: A retrospective study included 31 children treated for DDH by this method between 2015-2021. Only unilateral DDH were included. spica were done under anesthesia for all children after traction period. We measured the distance between the center of the femoral epiphysis and the lower edge of the ilium for both hips. These measures were done by two reviewers on pelvic x-ray done before immobilization. Ratios were than obtained between dislocated and unaffected side eliminating x-ray magnification effect. PDI was than calculated for each x-ray period and compared according to success or failure of hip reduction. Results: Thirty one children included , mean age was 17 months (9-30) at treatment. Hip reduction was obtained in 23 patients (74%). Progression ratio was 75,29%\u00b19,73% [49%-89%] before the 1 max- of femoral progression has occurred between the 2 nd and the 4th month after immobilization. If this index exceeds 80% after the 2nd spica , successful docking will occur (sensitivity: 100%). The ratio of femoral head progression after 4 month spica was respectively 94% and 72% for children with successful reduction and failure one (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Femoral docking occurs in spica in DDH closed reduction. PDI can be an objective measure to appreciate soft tissue interposition (capsule, labrum..). This ratio could be an additional prognostic sign to antici-pate unsuccess and indicate open reduction.

Adhiambo Witlox2, De Witte3, Netherlands 3Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands 4Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands 5Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, Netherlands 6University Medical Center Eindhoven, 8Reinier and Objective: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is one of the most common pediatric orthopedic disorders, affecting 1-3% of all newborns. The optimal treatment of centered DDH is currently under debate. This randomized controlled trial aims to study the (cost)-effectiveness of active monitoring versus abduction treatment for infants with centered DDH. Materials and Methods: This is a multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial study-ing the (cost) effectiveness of active monitoring versus abduction treatment for infants with centered DDH in fourteen hospitals in the Netherlands. In total, 800 infants with centered DDH (Graf IIa-/IIb/IIc), aged 10-16 weeks, will be randomly allocated to the active monitoring or abduction treatment group. Infants will be followed up until the age of 24 months. The primary outcome is the rate of normal hips, defined as acetabular index lower than 25 degrees on an antero-posterior radiograph, at the age of 12 months. Secondary outcomes are the rate of normal hips at the age of 24 months, complications, time to hip normal-ization, influence of patient characteristics on the rate of normal hips, compliance, costs, cost-effectiveness, budget impact, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the infant, HRQoL of the parents/caregivers, and parent/care-giver satisfaction. Conclusions: The outcomes of this randomized controlled trial will contribute to improving current care-as-usual for infants with centered DDH.

E-POSTERS EP-19 Developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants referred for a combined pediatric orthopedic and radiologic examination. A prospective cohort study Simon Norl\u00e9n 1, Christian Faergemann1 1Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark Introduction and objective: In XXXX, all newborns/ infants with risk factors associated with DDH are referred for a combined pediatric orthopedic and radiologic assess-ment. This selective screening is resource demanding and previous studies have found variating effects of such screening. This study aimed to determine the proportions of infants with DDH and hip dislocation in all infants referred for combined pediatric orthopedic and radiologic assessment, and to describe the association between DDH and different reasons of referral. Materials and methods: A prospective, consecutive study of all infants aged 0-6 months referred for combined exam-ination of the hips 2013-2009 in the XXXX. The referred infants were examined by an experienced pediatric ortho-pedic specialist and an experienced radiologist did ultraso-nography. An -angel 59\u00b0 and/or a femoral head coverage 50% was considered diagnostic of DDH. Ortolani and/or Barlow positive hips were considered unstable. The overall proportion of DDH and unstable hip(s) and the proportions stratified by different reasons of referral were calculated. The algorithm for examination and treatment of DDH in XXXX are summarized in Figure 1. Results: Of the 1,989 infants included, 17% had radio- logic confirmed DDH, and 4.7% had unstable/dislocated hip(s) (Figure 2).

In the early detection, ultrasound and Pavlik's treatment have been an undoubted improvement. In cases of late detection from 4 months the spica casting is the recomended treatment. The aim of this study is evaluate our clinic and radiological results in cases of late detection or failure of Pavlik's harness treatment. We have made a retrospective revision of 128 hips in 102 patients had been treated in our center with the same protocol (spica casting) between 2005-2016. The minimal follow-up was 5 years. Demografic, ultrasound and radio-logic data were collected and were related with the results and the appearence of NA V . Were excluded from the study patients with no minimal follow-up and those in which a reduction was not obtained after the arthrographic study. Patients were divided following the IHDI classification in type I hip (16%), type II (42%) and type III/IV (42%). According side, we found 26 bilateral cases, 49 left and 27 right. The treatment was satisfactory in the 78% of the cases, understanding as success the non-need for surgery. According to the degree of displacement the type I/II hips were succesful in 95% of the cases and in type III/IV the success descended until 56%. A VN was present in 5,5% (7/128 cases), without relationship with previously trac-tion, adductor tenotomy or Pavlik harness treatment. We have observed an improvement in the first six months of the acetabular index above 9,5\u00ba as the factor with the best prognosis. In the contrary, severe type III/IV forms were the criterion of worst prognosis to require future surgery. 150 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-21 A Chen1, David Roye1, Xu Li1 1Shantou University Guangzhou Huaxin Orthopedics Hospital, Guangzhou, China Introduction and Objective: It's widely accepted that Salter Innominate Osteotomy (SIO) is one of the most effective methods to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in children. We elucidate a new technique of SIO which is much less invasive. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this new technique for the treatment of DDH patients. Materials and Methods: Forty-one patients (51 hips) who underwent new SIO technique were included. We investi-gated the age at operation, and duration of follow-up. Several radiographic parameters were implemented and compared preoperatively and at the latest examination. The new SIO technique is made to form three-segment osteot-omy line to enable two-point contact between proximal and distal bone fragments. Results: The mean age at operation was 2.1 (1.3-4.5) years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.2 (3.9-6.8) years. The preoperative mean value of acetabular index (AI), extru-sion index (EI), acetabular depth-to-width ratio (ADR, multiply value by 1000) were 37.51\u00ba, 98.18%, 212.17, and at the latest follow-up, the postoperative mean value were 10.29\u00ba, 9.67%, 321 respectively. Forty patients (97.6%) preoperatively have International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI) classification grade III or IV and post operatively 100% of patients were IHDI Grade I. At the last follow up, Three hips (5.9%) demonstrated Bucholz-Ogden type II avascular necrosis. One hip (1.9%) Bucholz-Ogden type III avascular necrosis and eight hips (15.7%) Bucholz-Ogden type IV avascular necrosis. Conclusions: New SIO technique is a less invasive proce- dure which has no need for the splitting of the iliac apoph-ysis and bone graft. Also no separation of outer table muscles and no damage to the gluteal muscles and acetab-ular rim blood supply. It can also provide two points of contact between proximal and distal bone fragments. The follow-up outcomes show that our approach is an effective procedure to treat patients with DDH. E-POSTERS EP-22 Fibrin Glue is a Viable Alternative to Fat Graft for Interposition After Tarsal Miller School of Medicine, Miami, United States 2University of Miami Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Miami, United States 3Nicklaus Children's Hospital, Miami, United States Introduction and Objective: Tarsal coalition is a com- mon foot and ankle pathology in children, yet there is no consensus regarding what to interpose after resection. Fibrin glue could be considered, but the literature com-paring fibrin glue to other interposition types is sparse. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effective-ness of fibrin glue for interposition compared to fat graft by analyzing the rate of coalition recurrence and wound complications. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed examining all patients who underwent a tarsal coalition resection at a free-standing children's hos-pital in the United States from 2000 to 2021. Only patients undergoing isolated primary tarsal coalition resection with an interposition of fibrin glue or fat graft were included. Coalition recurrence was defined as symptom-atic reossification that underwent reoperation. Wound complications were defined as concern for an incision site that prompted the use of antibiotics. Comparative analy-ses were conducted using Fisher's exact test to examine relationships between interposition type, coalition recur - rence, and wound complications. tarsal coalition resections met inclusion cri- teria. Fibrin glue was used for interposition in 29 cases and fat graft was used in 95 cases (Table 1.). The differ - ence in the coalition recurrence rate between fibrin glue and fat graft interposition (Table 2.) was not statistically significant (6.9% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.624). The difference in wound complication rate between fibrin glue and fat graft interposition was not statistically significant (3.4% vs. 7.4%, p Conclusion: Fibrin glue interposition after tarsal coalition resection is a viable alternative to fat graft. Fibrin glue has similar rates of coalition recurrence and wound complica-tions when compared to fat graft. Given our results and the lack of tissue harvesting required with fibrin glue, fibrin glue may be superior to fat graft for interposition after tar - sal coalition resection.EPOS Abstract Book 151 E-POSTERS EP-23 Ponseti method is superior to surgical treatment in clubfoot - outcomes of a prospective randomized shifted from exten- sive surgical release to conservative Ponseti method. However, randomized prospective long-term trials up to skeletal maturity are lacking. The goal of the study was to compare the long-term results of Ponseti versus surgical clubfoot treatment in terms of morphology, functional out-comes, overall health, and ability to participate in normal daily activities using validated scores. In 2001 we began a single center, prospective, random- ized, controlled trial with a parallel design.

Twenty-two feet were ran-domly assigned in two groups: 12 feet to the Ponseti group and 10 were treated surgically. We followed both groups at 3 years, 10 years and at the skeletal maturity after 18 years with validated scoring systems (FRS = Functional Rating Score, PODCI = Pediatric outcomes Data Collection Instrument). and clinicall measurements. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOV A with LSD post-hoc test were used to statistically evaluate the results. Both groups were comparable at the beginning of treat- ment with no significant difference in the Pirani score. The long term results showed more favorable outcomes in Ponseti concerning total FRS score (p < 0,001). Moreover, Ponseti group reached better sub scores of FRS for motion, function and pain (p < 0,001). Only FRS - Gait sub score was not different between groups. Also PODCI showed better functional status of Ponseti method (p = 0,023). Surgically treated clubfeet had troubles performing sports (p = 0,002), were clinically stiffer (p = 0,03) and experi- enced more pain and inferior results in happiness domain of PODCI (p < 0,009). However, in the transfer and mobil- ity item of PODCI scored both groups the same (p = 0,062). In this prospective randomized long-term study the Ponseti method presented superior outcomes to surgery in the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot deformity. E-POSTERS EP-24 Predictors of Failed Non-Operative Management of Symptomatic Accessory Navicular in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Hillary Nguyen1, Mahan1, Samantha with symptomatic acces- sory navicular (AN) can have reduced quality of life. While many respond to conservative measures, surgery is occasion-ally needed. Our purpose was to assess predictors of failed non-operative management and surgical outcomes. Materials/Methods: This single-institution, retrospective case-cohort study included patients below age 19 presenting 2000-2021 with symptomatic AN and treated with standard-of-care. CPT code 28238 identified surgical cases, indicat-ing failed non-operative treatment. The sub-cohort was randomly sampled from all patients with symptomatic AN. Results: One-hundred-twenty cases of failed non-opera- tive management were identified, failing at a median of 5 months (IQR 2-15 months). The sub-cohort contained 23 152 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) failures and 97 non-failures. Failure subjects had greater proportions of bilateral AN (failure 73%; sub-cohort 58%) and activity limitation at presentation (failure 68%; sub-cohort 36%). Univariate Cox modeling found age, sex, activity limi- tation, and AN type were associated with the hazard of failure. With multivariate analysis, each additional year of age at presentation increased the hazard of failure by 19% (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.05-1.34; p = 0.006), and patients presenting with activity limitation had 2.8 times the haz-ards of failure (HR 2.75; 95% CI 1.66-4.54; p < 0.001). Compared to type I, type II AN had 51% reduced hazard of failure (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.27-0.87; p = 0.01) and type III had 68% reduced hazard of failure (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.13-0.82; p = 0.02). BMI, sports, and pes planus on weight- bearing x-rays (talonavicular coverage angle, Meary's angle, calcaneal pitch angle) were not associated. Among those failing non-operative treatment, nearly all reported pain improvement (114/119, 96%), full symptom resolution (99/117, 85%), and return to primary sport (93/108, 86%) after surgery. Conclusions: Symptomatic AN predominantly affects female athletes. Conservative/non-operative treatment may be less successful in older females presenting with activity limitation and type I AN, though type 2 AN is more prevalent overall.

Michelle Mo 1, Nicholas Sullivan1, Patricia Miller1, Susan Mahan1 1Boston Children's Introduction: The Evans calcaneal lengthening osteot- omy, with its associated soft tissue procedures, has been widely accepted as the standard of care for the treatment of painful pediatric flexible flat feet. However, few stud-ies have compared outcomes of the Evans procedure to the SESA procedure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine outcomes in post-operative radio-graphic foot alignment between the SESA and Evans procedures. Methods: 35 patients, who were < 20 years old, and who underwent either the SESA or Evans procedure at a single institution, were identified. Of the 35 patients, a total of 46 feet underwent surgery. Feet were stratified into SESA (n = 23) and Evans (n = 23) cohorts. Weight bearing pre-operative and minimum 3 month weight bearing post-operative X-rays were obtained in all patients and analyzed by a single senior surgeon. Comparisons were conducted using Student's t-tests and chi-square tests. Results: There were no differences with regards to age (13.8 years versus 12.7 years, respectively; p = 0.188), BMI (24.7 9 respectively; p 0.583) or laterality of the procedure (p = 0.556) between the SESA and Evans cohorts. There was a higher propor - tion of female patients in the SESA cohort (70% versus 40%, respectively; p = 0.038). Operative time was significantly shorter in the SESA cohort compared to the Evans cohort (56 versus 168 min-utes, respectively; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between the SESA or Evans cohorts in radio-graphic improvement of the talus to 1st metatarsal angle on standing AP X-rays (14.87\u00b0 versus 11\u00b0, respectively; p = 0.143), talonavicular coverage angle on standing AP X-rays (22.78\u00b0 versus 18.04\u00b0, respectively; p = 0.264), and talus-first on X-rays 12.61\u00b0, respectively; p = 0.589). Conclusion: The SESA procedure when compared to the Evans procedure demonstrates similar improvements in post-operative radiographic foot alignment, with the added benefit of shorter operative time and easier post-operative course.EPOS Abstract Book 153 E-POSTERS EP-26 Surgical Treatment of of James Kasser1 1Boston Children's Hospital / Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States 2Cary Hospital / WakeMed Raleigh Campus, Raleigh, United States 3Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States Introduction: There is little consensus regarding classifi- cation and optimal treatment of macrodactyly of the foot. We aimed to review the management of pediatric foot macrodactyly at our institution. Methods: A single-center tertiary care departmental data- base was queried for all cases of foot macrodactyly between 1995 and 2020. Medical records were reviewed to identify cases of isolated macrodactyly. Clinical, demo-graphic, and radiologic data were analyzed. Results: Thirty-five patients with thirty-eight involved feet were treated surgically and included in the study. Twenty-five feet had lesser toe involvement only (sec-ond toe most common, 20/25, 80%), and thirteen feet had great toe involvement. Preoperatively, sixteen of thirty-two (50%) were unable to wear shoes. Most com-mon procedure at index surgery was debulking (30/38, 79%), followed by ray resection phalangeal joint fusion (9/38, 24%). Twenty-one patients underwent second, and ten patients underwent third procedures. These were primarily for additional debulk-ing, interphalangeal joint fusions, and epiphysiodesis. Median age was 2 years (range, 0.5-15.3) at initial sur - gery and 4.4 years (range, 1.2-12.7) at second surgery. Median follow-up from index procedure was 5.5 years (range, 0.8-21.5). At final follow-up, 29/38 (76%) denied pain, 9/38 (24%) had occasional symptoms, and no patients had persistent discomfort. All post-operative feet were shoe-able, with 6/38 (16%) requiring a larger size. Gait was noted to be clinically normal in all but two patients. Of the 26 patients who underwent ray resection, average decrease in metatarsal spread angle was 14.5 degrees (range, 8-25). Conclusion: The treatment of macrodactyly is complex, requiring multiple surgeries to address abnormal and changing foot and toe morphology. We have utilized our results to propose an algorithm for surgical management of both great toe and lesser toe macrodactyly (Figure 1). Our study demonstrates this condition can be safely managed to provide a shoe-able, pain-free foot with normal gait. E-POSTERS EP-27 Wide-awake local anaesthesia in pediatric foot surgery - experience of two years Marcell Varga1 1Manninger Jeno National Trauma Center, Objective: Wide-awake local anaes- thesia (WALANT) technique is a surgical anesthesia that has become increasingly popular in recent years. During WALANT, the patient is awake, only the surgical area is infiltrated with a specific mix of lidocaine, epinefrine, bicarbonate and saline. There is only a minimal data on the use of the technique in pediatric patients. We retrospectively reviewed our patients who were operated with this technique. Materials and Methods: Between January 2020 and December 2021 we performed foot and ankle surgery on a total of 24 children ( 38 operations) under WALANT anesthesia. The types of operations were as follows: sub-talar arthroereisis in 14 children,( 28 operations) ankle ligament reconstruction in 3 children, hallux bone cyst surgery in 1 child, accessory bone removal in 4 patients, Achilles tenoromy in 2 children. Before applying the technique, the child was psychologically assessed and prepared. During operations, the possibility of conversion to general anesthesia was always given. Anxiety and pain scores were collected during the operations and after 24 hours. We also collected a standardized feedback survey from parents and children. Results: No specific complications of anesthesia were observed. Conversion to general anesthesia was not required in any case. Additional mild sedatives were required during surgery in four children. All children and parents would have chosen the same anesthesia based on the feedback. In the case of bilateral operations, all chil-dren/caregivers chose the same anesthesia for the second operation. Postoperative pain and discomfort showed a significant reduction compared to similar surgeries per - formed under general anesthesia. Conclusions: Based on our small number of patients, WALANT technique may be an alternative of general anaesthesia for minor lower limb surgeries in children. The technique is cost-effective and minimizes the risks of E-POSTERS EP-28 Femoral Head Decompression Injection in Pediatric Sickle-Cell Related Necrosis Introduction: Femoral head A VN affects 10-40% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of femoral head core decompression and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (CD-BMAC) injection in pediatric patients with SCD. Methods: Retrospective review of a prospective cohort of pediatric patients with SCD who underwent femoral head CD-BMAC from 2010 to 2020 with > 1 year follow-up were identified. Visual analog score for pain (V AS), hip outcome score (HOS), mHHS, and the UCLA activity score were used as PROMs pre-operatively, at 5-9 months post-operatively, and final follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as total hip arthroplasty (THA) or V AS score > 3 at final follow-up. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for treatment failure. Results: The final sample included 23 hips in 17 patients (13 male), with median age of 15.8 (IQR:13.1-17.8). Patients were followed for 4.25\u00b11.73 years. Radiographi-cally, 10 hips showed a 1-stage increase in the Ficat stage at the final follow-up, while 11 retained the same stage, and one patient had a 1-stage regression. Pre-operatively, thirteen hips were classified as pre-collapse, which decreased to 11 at the final follow-up. All PROMs showed significant improvement from the pre-operative visit to short-term follow-up, but the pre-op to final follow-up improvement was not significant (Table 1). Overall, 6 treatment failures were recorded, including 3 THAs and 3 painful hips at the final follow-up. In a logis-tic regression model, only skeletal maturity (OR = 16.2, 95%CI: 1.44-183.0, P = 0.024) and femoral head collapse at the time of surgery (OR = 12.0, 95%CI: 1.1-130.5, P = 0.041) were significant predictors of treatment failure (Figure 1). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CD-BMAC in pedi- atric patients with SCD offers significant improvement in pain and functional outcomes in the short-term, with a very low risk for complications. Skeletal maturity and femoral head collapse were significant predictors of failure. EPOS Abstract Book 155 E-POSTERS EP-29 Assessment of the effectiveness of greater trochanteric epiphyseodesis (GTE) in patients with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (LCPD)Assessment of the effectiveness of greater trochanteric epiphyseodesis (GTE) in D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany leads to relative greater tro- chanteric (GT) overgrowth, which might be prevented by GTE. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of GTE radiographically and to determine the impact of gen-der and age at time of surgery. Methods: In this retrospective study 46 children (33 male, average age at GTE 8 \u00b1 1,3 years) with unilateral LCPD undergoing GTE with 2 screws and curettage of the epiph-ysis were included. On a.p.-view of the pelvis pre- and postoperatively up to maturity (average follow-up-period 3,5 years postoperatively) the following parameters were (TH), articulotrochanteric distance (ATD) and center-trochanter-distance (CTD) and compared to the untreated contralateral side. The impact of gender and age (< 8 and 8 years) were investigated as well. Results: GTE reduced significantly trochanteric growth by 29% (p < 0,01) measured by TH: until maturity GT of the unaffected hip grew on average 20,4 mm, of the affected hip 14,5 mm (p < 0,01). Regression analysis revealed an inhibition of trochan- teric growth of 1 mm/year; age had an impact of 18% on TH, gender no influence (p = 0,18). ATD of the affected hip increased (preop: 11,2\u00b17 mm; maturity: 18,5\u00b110 mm, p < 0,01) compared to no change on the healthy side (preop: 19,3\u00b15 mm, maturity: 18\u00b16 mm, p = 0,69). affected hip stayed unchanged (preop: -7,9\u00b17 mm; maturity -7,8\u00b19 mm, p = 0,13). On the healthy side CTD became negative, indicating the center of the femoral head below the tip of GT (preop: 0,9\u00b16 mm, maturity: -6,5\u00b15 mm, p < 0,001). There was no statistical significant impact for age or gender (p > 0,05). Relating to ATD 68% achieved a physiological result, 32% were under-/overcorrected. Conclusion: The study demonstrated a positive effect of GTE on GT-growth and therefore for hip anatomy. Further studies have to show whether these positive effects also result in biomechanical and functional benefits.HIP 156 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics EP-30 How are adults with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) functioning after a total hip replacement? Results of an international Web-based survey Michael Millis 1, Vakulenko-Lagun2, Hospital, Harvard Medical Center, Boston, United States 2University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel 3Scottish Rite for Children, Dallas, United States Introduction: LCPD can cause a permanent head defor - mity and osteoarthritis requiring a total hip replacement (THR). Currently, there is little data on how patients are functioning after a THR from patients' perspective. The purpose of this study was to collect a large patient-reported outcome data on adults with LCPD, including those who had a THR, using a Web-survey method and to compare their outcomes to a normative population. Methods: An English REDCap-based survey was built and made available on a LCPD study group website. The survey included childhood and adult LCPD history, SF-36 Health Survey, and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Statistical analysis included t-test and linear and proportional odds regressions. Results: Of the 1182 participants who completed the sur - vey, 261 participants (89 M, 172 F) had a THR. The mean age at survey was 44.6\u00b112.4 years (range 20-79). The mean duration since THR was 7.2\u00b18 years (median 4, range 0-43). Gender and age matched analysis showed that THR participants had significantly lower HOOS Quality-of-Life and Sports scores (p < 0.0001) for all age groups in comparison to a normative cohort. In women, the HOOS Symptoms, Daily Living, and Pain scores were also significantly lower in the < 55 age groups (p < 0.05). Similarly, SF-36 scores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in female < 45 age groups in 5 out of 8 SF-36 scales. Overall, hip dysplasia and the number of years-from-THR were the main factors associated with worse SF-36 and HOOS scores. In comparison to the non-THR partici-pants, THR participants had higher scores in most of the HOOS and SF-36 scales. Conclusion: LCPD cantly worse HOOS and SF-36 scores in most of the scales studied than a normative cohort, especially in women. There is significant disability even after a THR, warranting continued efforts to improve treatment and outcome. EPOS Abstract Book 157 E-POSTERS EP-31 The Free-Gliding SCFE screw - is it safe, does it glide and does age matter? Stephanie Buchan1, Edward Lindisfarne1, Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom 2Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Queensland, Australia 3Danat Al Emarat Hospital, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Introduction and Objective: The Free-Gliding (FG) SCFE screw is a novel device to enable ongoing growth of the femoral neck after pinning in situ. The aim of this study was threefold: to assess whether this device pre-vents further slip; whether, in practice, it allows length-ening/gliding; determine if patient age impacts the extent of glide. Materials and Methods: All cases of FG SCFE screws used at our institution, with at least three years follow-up, were reviewed as part of ongoing governance. All pre and post fixation radiographs were scrutinised. Patient demo-graphics, grade of slip, distance of barrel lengthening, and restoration of Klein's line were recorded. Sub-analysis was performed according to gender and age. Results: There were 19 hips in 13 patients for analysis. Mean age at operation was 11.5 years (range 9-13) and mean follow-up was 63 months (range 45-83). Thirteen FG SCFE screws were inserted for fixation of mild or moderate SCFE, with six contralateral prophylactic fixa-tions. No SCFE hip showed a worsening slip after fixation and no complications were reported. Lengthening occurred in 15 of 19 hips (79%), with a mean barrel lengthening of 6.8mm at final follow-up (range 2.5-13.6mm). Remodeling occurred in all hips that demonstrated lengthening, with restoration of Klein's line. Lengthening was statistically greater in those patients 11 years old or younger, regardless of gender (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The FG SCFE screw is effective in pre- venting further slip. Lengthening of the barrel occurred in most hips, thus allowing remodeling. This was most marked in younger children, regardless of gender. Based on this study, the FG SCFE screw should be considered in children eleven years or younger instead of standard in situ pinning.E-POSTERS EP-32 The role of surgery in the management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis : effect of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in pediatrics Jung Yun Bae 1, Kyeongbaek Kim1 1Pusan National University School of Medicine/Pusan Hospital, Yangsan, South Korea Introduction: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) is a common invasive infection encountered in the chil- dren.The primary treatment of AHO is antibiotics. The reported rates of operative treatment have varied widely from 8% to 80%. The optimal time to initiate antibiotics to prevent treatment delays while maximizing culture yield is not well studied in the pediatric population. Purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of anti-biotic timing on surgical culture yield in children with AHO. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of cases of AHO aged less than 18 years was performed from 2010 to 2019. A total of 60 cases met inclusion criteria. 34 patients in the pre-treatment group and 26 patients in the post-treatment group. All patients had both blood and \"Other\" culture samples. \"Other\" cultures were cultures from wound, abscess, soft tissue, bone or joint fluid col-lected from operative site. Data collected on these patients included socio-demographics, presenting symp-toms, timing of antibiotics, clinical outcomes ,laboratory results, and results of microbiologic and radiographic studies. Results: Overall, 26.7% of blood cultures (rate of positive blood cultures, 23.1% (pre-treatment) versus 29.4% (post-treatment); p = 0.58) and positive \"Other\" cultures, 73.1% (pre-treatment) versus 55.9% (post-treatment); p = 0.17) were positive. Compared with children who did not receive antibiotics prior to culture, there were no significant differences in odds of a positive culture in children whose cultures were pre-treated with anti-biotics for any of the culture types. Conclusions: \"Other\" samples cultures have a higher diagnostic yield compared to blood cultures. Pre-treatment of patients with antibiotics prior to culture was not associ-ated with a significant change in culture yield. Our results suggest that children presenting with suspected AHO should receive appropriate systemic antibiotics promptly after blood cultures are obtained.158 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-33 Institutional Performance and Validation of Severity of Illness Score for Children with Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis Ezan Kothari 1, Michael Conklin1, Shawn Gilbert1 1University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, United States Objectives: Copley et al. devised a scoring system that uses parameters within the first 4-5 days of hospitalization to determine the severity of illness (SOI) in children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO). To our knowl-edge, no additional studies to date have examined the validity of the SOI score outside of the institution of ori-gin. This study evaluates the performance of the SOI score in a retrospective cohort of cases at our institution. Methods: Patients admitted to our institution over the past 5 years with AHO who met inclusion and exclusion crite-ria were analyzed. Parameters including CRP over the first 96 hours of hospitalization, febrile days on antibiotics, ICU admission, and presence of disseminated disease were used to calculate the SOI score for each patient.

Significantly higher SOI scores were noted for patients with bacteremia, ICU admission, fever for 2 or more days on presentation, mul-tiple surgeries, and any complication. Markers of disease severity that significantly correlated with SOI score were total length of stay (TLOS), LOS, duration of antibiotic course, number of surgical procedures, and case mix index. Conclusions: The SOI score functioned well as higher scores were associated with sicker patients. The SOI score is helpful for determining which patients will require lon-ger hospitalizations and more intense treatment in a setting other than the institution of origin.EPOS Abstract Book 159 Table 3.

However, the type of drainage procedure remains controversial. Some authors recommend arthro-centesis (Ac) whereas some prefer arthrotomy (At). The aim of the present study was to compare Ac with lavage on double intra-articular needle to At as first-line drainage treatment in paediatric hip and knee septic arthritis. The second objective was to identify risk factors of second articular drainage. Material and method: A retrospective review of the medical record of all patients treated at our pediatric orthopaedic department for hip or knee septic arthritis was conducted. Inclusion criteria were: children under 15.5 years old with an arthritis confirmed by a positive bacterial analysis of the joint fluid. Demographic, radio-graphic and biological data were recorded. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical treatment they had: Ac or At. Results: 69 patients with an established diagnostic of septic arthritis, 25 hips and 44 knees, 42 were treated by Ac and 27 by At. Nine out of 69 patients had a revision surgery. Among these 9 patients, 8 belonged to the Ac group and 1 to the At group (p = 0.08). There was no dif- ference between the hips and knees neither between Ac and At concerning the type of germ. In the univariate analysis, revision surgery was associated with MSI, posi-tive blood cultures and initial temperature. Multivariate analyses identified only associated MSI as independent risk factor for revision surgery [OR = 11.8; 95 % CI = 1.2- 114.2; p < 0.001]. Conclusion: No significant difference was found between Ac and At regarding revision surgery rate. Other risk fac-tors rather than the technique were reported : associated MSI, virulent germs, preoperative elevated inflammatory syndrome and treatment delay.E-POSTERS EP-35 Preliminary results of two novel epiphysiodesis devices for height reduction in tall stature Andrea Toporowski1, 2Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark Reduction of excessive predicted final height in tall stat- ure patients can either be achieved by hormonal treat-ment or surgically by epiphysiodesis (ED). Hormonal treatment has been associated with severe long-term effects, while ED for reduction of tall stature has not been sufficiently investigated. In the present study, clinical and radiographic data of 34 patients (16 girls, 18 boys) with tall stature who were treated with two novel devices for either temporary (tED; 11 patients) or permanent ED (pED; 23 patients) between 2015-2020 was retrospec-tively evaluated. For tED, bilateral implantation of four RigidTacks was performed around the knee. pED was achieved by physeal ablation with an EpiStop trephine. So far no studies have evaluated results and complica-tions of ED performed with these devices. The mean overall follow-up time of this study was 2.9 years. At the last follow-up, 26 patients (76.5%) had achieved skeletal maturity. Mean age at surgery was 12.3 years in girls and 13.2 years in boys. Mean height at surgery was 175.2 cm in girls and 184.7 cm in boys. Mean predicted final height was 191.4 cm in girls and 210.4 cm in boys. Evaluating the final height in skeletally mature patients showed a mean height reduction of 5.9 cm in girls and 8.7 cm in boys, corresponding to a reduction in remaining growth of 46% in girls and 38% in boys. Regarding adverse events, secondary frontal plane deformities of the knee were detected in 45.5% in the tED group and 4.3% in the pED group. tED and pED have both proven to be efficient for reduc- tion of excessive predicted final height. However, tED has been associated with an increased risk of secondary frontal deformities and requires subsequent surgery for implant removal. pED thus appears to be more favor - able. However, long-term results of both procedures are pending.EPOS Abstract Book 161 E-POSTERS EP-36 Congenital Pseudarthrosis of the Treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia represents a major challenge in pediatric orthopaedics. The main goal of treatment is to obtain long-term bone union and prevent refracture. Various surgical procedures have been proposed in the past. However, the long-term outcome remains poor in most cases. Materials and Methods: A retrospective radiological and clinical evaluation has been carried out to assess the outcome of different reconstructive treatment strategies, with a particular focus on bone union and complication rates. 26 patients who had received reconstructive treat-ment between 1997 and 2019 were included. The study population was subdivided into 3 groups (A, B and C). All patients in Group A and B received excision of the pseudarthrosis, as well as 2 patients in Group C. In Group A, 6/26 patients underwent subsequent bone trans-port through external fixation. In Group B, 15/26 patients received either previous, simultaneous, or subsequent extrafocal lengthening through external fixation. In Group C, 5/26 patients underwent internal fixation with intra-medullary nails. Results: Overall, the primary bone fusion rate was 69%, but results varied profoundly between the study groups. There were 4 refractures, all occurring in Group B. The long-term bone union rate without refracture was 54%. The overall complication rate was 54%. 23% showed persistent pseudarthrosis. 2 secondary amputations were performed due to failed bone fusion. Conclusions: Excision of the pseudarthrosis and extrafo- cal lengthening achieves a satisfying bone union rate. Bone transport does not offer significant advantages but shows higher complication rates. However, it should be considered in case of large bone defect. Intramedullary stabilization shows lower bone union rates when used as a stand-alone treatment regimen, but should be applied to maintain bone union. The probability of long-term bone union, however, remains unpredictable. 162 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-37 Temporary epiphysiodesis using the RigidTack for treating leg length discrepancy and tall stature: Benefits and limitations of a novel implant Gregor Toporowski Reconstruction and Foot Surgery, Muenster, Germany 2Muenster University Hospital, Department of General Orthopaedics and Tumor Orthopaedics, Muenster, Germany Introduction and Objective: Temporary epiphysiodesis (ED) is a common surgical procedure for children and ado-lescents with leg length discrepancy (LLD) or tall stature (TS). Blount staples (BS), as well as eight-plates TM (EP), are well-established in clinical practice, however, second-ary frontal-plane deformities are frequently reported. Thus, the RigidTack (RT) has been developed for easier applica-tion and reduction of complications. Materials and Methods: ED was performed in 56 patients - 45 patients with LLD and 11 patients with TS - using 222 RT. 38 patients with LLD were treated by 124 EP and 137 patients in 422 physeal sites using 1266 BS. ED was indicated if the predicted LLD at skeletal maturity was > 2cm. Mean LLD at implantation was 2.7(1.2-10) cm. Mean age at implantation was 12.1(8-14) years, mean follow-up was 24.4(8-49) months. Implant removal was performed at skeletal maturity or when LLD was levelled. Perioperative parameters, treatment efficiency, clinical and radiological complications were measured. Results: The mean LLD was significantly reduced to 1.1 (0.2-7.5) cm in the total cohort without any statistical dif- ference between the implants. The body height of patients with TS was reduced by 18.3 (4-32) cm using RT com-pared to the prognostic body height. A reduced surgery time for implantation and explantation of RT was observed compared to EP (37%/24%) and BS (37%/41%). Similarly, radiographic exposure was decreased at implantation and explantation using RT compared to EP (51%/76%) and BS (70%/96%). Secondary axial deviations in patients with LLD could be reduced using RT (11%/2%) in the frontal and sagittal plane compared to EP (34%/20%) and BS (34%/39%) (Figure1). An increased risk for secondary frontal-plane deviations in TS by 46% was observed. Conclusions: RT offers a safe and effective treatment option for LLD. The mechanical advantages of the BS and the EP can reduce secondary deviations. However, patients with TS should not be treated by ED due to an increased risk for secondary deviations. E-POSTERS EP-38 Does type of intramedullary alignment impact on complication rate in lower leg Orthopedic Surgery \"Banjica\", Belgrade, Serbia Introduction and Objective: The purpose of this com- parative study was to evaluate the complications associ-ated with lower leg lengthening and various types of intramedullary alignment (IA) in children treated with the Ilizarov external fixator (IEF). Materials and Methods: The study was performed in a fourteen-year period (from 2005 to 2019) in 73 pediatric patients (aged 3-18 years) who underwent the lower leg lengthening procedure with average follow up 5.69 years (range 1-14 years). Participants were classified in three groups: group I who underwent the lower leg lengthening procedure using IEF alone (39 participants), group II (16 participants) treated with the combination of IEF and IA using two Kirschner wires (K-wires) and group III (18 par - ticipants) treated with combination of IEF and Titanium Elastic Nails (TEN).EPOS Abstract Book 163 The following parameters were compared: occurrence of complications according to the Caton classification and duration of initial hospitalization (expressed in days). Results: We found the higher rate of complications in patients treated using an isolated IEF compared with those treated using the combination of IEF and IA, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (Table 1 and 2). Comparing the duration of initial hospital-ization between groups we found longer hospitalization in participant treated with IEF alone, with statistical signifi-cance in comparison to group treated with TEN as method of IA (Table 3 and 4). Conclusions: IA has multiple advantages as a method of treatment of lower leg length inequality. The major effect of applying IA in association with a circular IEF is signifi-cantly reduced complication rate and duration of initial hos-pitalization, particularly when using TEN as a method of IA. This method of treatment also decreases hospital costs. Table 1.

Many different devices have been developed to improve the quality of life for patients who undergo this type of surgery. All procedures require accurate planing and close follow-up for its inherent risks and potential complications. Methods: A retrospective study at a specialized limb reconstruction center identified all patients subjected to limb lengthening with a magnetic remote control endo-medullary nail (PRECICE) from January 2017 through December 2020 in a pediatric population. The minimum follow-up was 12 months. Clinical and radiological results were evaluated, being the primary outcomes the time and rate of consolidation. Secondary outcomes were patient functional outcomes and satisfaction. Results: Twelve patients (15 femurs) with a mean age of 15 y.o. (13-18) were included. The mean of limb length discrepancy (LLD) was 5.9 cm and the mean of total bone elongation was 5.7 cm (3.6-8.5). The precision of elonga-tion was 98%. The mean time of complete consolidation of the regenerate was 4.7 months, and it was accomplished in all patients. As complications, one infection was observed, requiring a debridement and replacement of the endomed-ullary nail. Another patient presented equinism secondary to the lengthening that required a zetaplasty of the Achilles tendon. All patients were very satisfied with the results. Conclusions: The results of the PRECICE system as a limb lengthening method in pediatric population is compa-rable to other intramedullary lengthening devices, such as its precision. Complications are not negligible, though the patients show high satisfaction with the system. E-POSTERS EP-40 Deformity correction using intramedullary Reconstruction and Foot Surgery, Muenster, Germany 2Muenster University Hospital, Department of General Orthopaedics and Tumor Orthopaedics, Muenster, Germany Introduction and Objective: X-linked hypophosphatae- mia (XLH) is a rare disorder leading to impaired bone mineralization. Severely diseased patients may present three-dimensional deformities of the lower limbs, leading to pain and limited mobility. Various surgical techniques have been described for reconstructing these complex deformities, however, a high recurrence rate remains com-mon. Thus, our study retrospectively analyzed multilevel correction osteotomies using intramedullary nails (IN) in XLH patients. Materials and Methods: Between 2002 and 2020, 45 lower limb reconstructions with a total of 165 osteotomies in 26 patients with XLH using IN have been performed. Femoral IN were introduced in retrograde, tibial IN in ante-grade technique. 2-5 osteotomies per leg were necessary for anatomical deformity correction. The median age at surgery was 24(13-62) years. Pre- and postoperative exam-ination was performed clinically and radiographically. Results: The mean follow-up was 76.7(24-201) months. The mean mechanical axis deviation was significantly corrected from 54.3\u00b131.0 mm before surgery to 12.8\u00b18.9 mm at follow-up (p < 0.001). The mechanical lateral dis- tal femoral angle improved significantly from 99.0\u00b110.9\u00b0 to 90.5\u00b14.4\u00b0 < the medial posterior angle 76.7\u00b19.0\u00b0 to 80.4\u00b14.2\u00b0 (p = 0.018). The lower extremity functional scale score improved significantly from 45\u00b112 to 55\u00b112 (p = 0.006) (Figure 1). 2/43 (4.7%) of the lower limbs presented a recurrence at follow-up and were surgically revised. Complications were observed in 17/45 (37.8%) treated limbs, 14/45 (31.1%) needed a surgical revision. Of these, 8/14 removals of dislocated screws or Implant-associated infec-tions were described in 3/45 (6.7%) treated lower limbs. Conclusion: The reconstruction of complex deformities of XLH patients using IN presented a significant improve-ment of clinical and radiographical parameters at a low recurrence rate. However, complications that require sur - gical revision can be frequent. IN should remain in situ to prevent fractures and recurrence.EPOS Abstract Book 165 E-POSTERS EP-41 Donor site sequelae after fibular graft in pediatric who is Spain Introduction and Objetive: Fibular graft is used for great bone defects treatment as it can be harvested in almost its full length and it is known its thickening and remodeling capacity. In growing patients the lack of fibula has been related to tibia and ankle deformities, especially ankle valgus. Ankle valgus can be prevented or treated before great deformity appears. The aim of this work is to identify those patients at risk of ankle deformity at the donor site after fibular graft excision. Material and Methods: We present 24 patients (28 fibu- lar grafts) with a minimum follow up of two years. Clinical evaluation and standard anteroposterior and lateral x-rays were taken for evaluation of valgus deformity (lateral dis-tal tibial angle) and Twenty cases developed valgus deformity (71%). Risk factor identified was lower patient\u00b4s age at surgery. No differences could be found among proce- dures done to prevent ankle deformity or length of the fibular remanent. Conclusions: Younger children who undergo fibular graft procedures are at greatest risk of developing valgus ankle deformity. In our series no preventive procedure was found better to prevent deformity. As mild deformity was found highly prevalent we recomend to follow up these patients with ankle x-rays. E-POSTERS EP-42 Hibernation of percutaneous hemiepiphysiodesis plates is safe Claire Shannon1, Dror Paley1 1Paley Orthopedic and Spine Institute, West Palm Beach, United States 2Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, United States Children with congenital deficiencies of the lower extrem- ity (fibular hemimelia (FH), genu valgum. Open hemi- epiphysiodesis using a plate screw device for gradual cor - rection is the gold standard treatment but may cause injury to the physis. A percutaneous technique has been devel-oped to combat this risk. Once the leg is aligned, the tether must be deactivated to prevent overcorrection. The valgus deformity recurs, necessitating additional surgery to reinsert the hemi- epiphysiodesis plate. Given the frequency of rebound deformity, a \"hibernation\" technique was developed; removing only the metaphyseal screw to deactivate the tether, ceasing further correction, while leaving the plate in place for future use. Hibernation necessitates a smaller incision, shorter surgical time, easier recovery, and easy reactivation in the future than complete removal. Case reports of physeal tether formation after hibernation of plates placed with open technique have raised concerns. We hypothesize that hibernation of percutaneously inserted hemi-epiphysiodesis plates is safe due to less aggressive dissection of the periosteum. Thirty-seven cases of percutaneous hemi-epiphysiodesis for genu valgum in patients with FH (15) and CFD (22) between 2009 and 2018 were reviewed. Rates of recurrent valgus were recorded as well as incidence of hibernation and unintended overcorrection. Average age at insertion was 5.8 years. Mean mechanical axis deviation (MAD) was 16.9mm and mean mechanical femoral-tibial angle was 9.5 degrees valgus at insertion. 166 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Average time to correction was 8.9 months. All patients achieved correction of genu valgum. Nineteen patients (51%) had hibernation. Sixteen patients (37%) developed recurrent valgus, with 13/16 patients treated with reactiva-tion of previously hibernated plate. Three patients required insertion of new plates. No patient had unintended over - correction of the mechanical axis. Hibernation of percutaneously inserted hemi-epiphysiode- sis plates is a safe procedure that does not result in physeal bar formation. E-POSTERS EP-43 Greater trochanter height as an indicator of bone age in children Hui Taek Kim1, Min Jun Choi1, Han Eol Seo1 1Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan, South Korea Purpose: Traditional methods to measure bone age are prone to inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as being complex and time-consuming. One method recently introduced, using the height of the greater trochanter (GT), seems to meet this requirement and we evaluated the accu-racy of this method. Methods: 32 patients (16 males, 16 females) with genu valgum who underwent hemiepiphysiodesis using percu-taneous epiphysiodesis using transphyseal screws (PETS) are included. None of the patients had abnormal bony pathology or any other associated disease. All patients underwent screw removal after correction of genu valgum. Their chronologic mean age at the time of undergoing PETS was 11.6 years. One senior orthopedic resident and one intern performed bone age measurements by the GT and Greulich and Pyle (GP) method. Each patient's bone age was measured (once a day, every 3 days for a total of 15 days). The difference between values measured by the two doctors, and between the GP and GT methods, were evaluated by an equivalence test. Results: Bone age measured by GP and GT methods in two doctors were statistically equivalent (p < 0.001) with a high percent agreement (range 92.9-96.0%). The mean chronologic age of 32 participants were 11.63\u00b10.94 (range, 9-14), the mean GP age 12.56\u00b10.95 and the mean GT height bone age 12.03\u00b11.13. The difference of bone ages measured by two methods ranged from 0.02 to 2.67, with 3 participants greater than 2.2 differences. The mean difference was 1.00\u00b10.66 (p = 0.0475) and the mean difference with 3 outliers re-evaluated were 0.87\u00b10.50 (P = 0.0638). The GT height bone age calculation by the resident and intern had 92.9-96.0% ICC (p < 0.001) depending on sex and the GP bone age.Conclusion: Bone age measured by using the height of GT in children is equivalent to that measured by the GP method. E-POSTERS EP-44 Will Video Kill the Orthopedic Star? The majority of orthopedic trainees report being recorded in the workplace despite existing policy prohibiting this behavior Christina Herrero 1, Taylor Wingo1, Joie Cooper1, Cordelia Carter1 1NYU Langone New York, United States While the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets has cer - tainly afforded some benefits to society, recording persons without their consent - particularly in a workplace training environment - is a common practice fraught with ethical dilemmas that remain unsolved. The purpose of this proj-ect was to characterize orthopedic residents' experiences having their voices and/or likenesses captured digitally during a pediatric orthopedic encounter. We created an anonymous, one-time survey of structured multiple-choice questions to assess trainees' experiences being recorded in the workplace (Figure). The survey was entered into REDcap and distributed via QR code to ortho-pedic trainees at a single academic urban training program in September 2021. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Twenty-two trainees completed the survey. 63.6% (14/22) reported being filmed in the workplace while treating a pediatric patient and 59% (13/22) reported being photo-graphed; in each case, 50% of respondents noted it occurred > 3 times in the previous year. The majority of recordings occurred in the emergency room. The vast majority noted that the person recording the professional encounter did not ever ask permission (87%). 80% of trainees reported being uncomfortable with being recorded. 60% asked the person recording to stop and 20% were not comfortable doing so. 78% reported requesting not being filmed/recorded with the recorder questioning them and/or seeming unhappy. Patients' parents performed the record-ing 93% of the time. Trainees had knowledge of institu-tional policies. The majority of orthopedic trainees report that their voice and/or likeness was recorded during a medical encounter with a pediatric patient in the last year. In most instances, the patient's parent was capturing the recording and per - mission was not asked of the trainee. Trainees reported feeling uncomfortable with recordungs and experiencing pushback if they requested not to do so. Policies to prevent residents from being recorded in the workplace should be created and implemented.EPOS Abstract Book 167 E-POSTERS EP-45 Paediatric Pain Management in Trauma and Julie Doherty1, Miss Jo Dartnell1 1Maidstone Tunbridge Wells Hospital NHS Trust, Kent, United Kingdom Introduction: The management of pain is an essential component of paediatric care. We conducted a retrospec- tive audit examining the levels of pain experienced by pae-diatric trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) inpatients at our local hospital, in particular, scrutinising the prescribing habits and pain management. Methods: Data was retrospectively collected on paediat- ric T&O inpatients from 2019, 2021 and 2022. The study population was identified by randomly selecting the first twenty case in each month to avoid bias. Any procedure that is classed under T&O was considered. A set of ques-tions were answered retrospectively to gain a better under - standing of the patients' experience post-operatively. The particular area of focus was on whether the maximum doses were being prescribed according to weight, the medication was being given regularly, and documentation of the pain scores were being done. Results: A total of 57 patients aged from 11 months to 17 years were identified. 1 document from 2021 and 2 docu-ments from 2022 were unattainable. The mean admission length decreased from 0.5789 in 2021 to 0.3889 in 2022. Patient satisfaction increased, with the correct doses being prescribed according to weight rising from 68.4% in 2019 to 77.8% in 2022. Analgesia administered as prescribed significantly increased from 45% in 2021 to 94.4% in 2022. 4 hourly pain scores were documented well. Hourly pain scores post analgesia is an area to improve, with 20% not being documented. Conclusion: This clinical audit focuses on the overview of acute pain management of paediatric T&O inpatients. Patients are receiving the initial assessments on pain and the correct doses according to weight, which are being adminis-tered frequently as prescribed. Continued training of ward staff is required to maintain these high standards, as well as further training on checking the pain scores 1-hour post analgesia to ensure there has been no escalation. E-POSTERS EP-46 Does burnout spare french pediatric orthopedic surgeons ? Results of a nationwide survey Aline Bischoff1, Federico Canavese1, Nicolas Mainard1 1Lille University Hospital Center, France Introduction: Burnout is a pathology affecting profes- sions involved in a helping relationship such as the health professions. However, this fact is not known among French pediatric orthopedic surgeons, residents or surgeons. We conducted a national survey in order to 1) evaluate the prevalence of burnout syndrome among French pediatric orthopedic surgeons 2) determine the risk and protective factors related to this syndrome. 168 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Hypothesis: The prevalence of burnout among French pediatric orthopedic surgeons is at least as high as in other medical and surgical specialties. Materials and Methods: We conducted a national survey during June and July 2022 by disseminating a questionnaire by e-mail. Burnout syndrome was assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) score. Demographic (table 1) and professional practice data were also collected. Results: Thirty-eight pediatric orthopedic residents and 65 pediatric orthopedic surgeons participated in the survey, for an estimated participation rate of 78.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Twenty-six percent (n = 10) of the residents and 13.9% (n = 9) of the surgeons had MBI scores sugges- tive of moderate or severe burnout (table 2). Respectively 20.8% (n = 9) and 9.2% (n = 6) of the residents and sur - geons reported suicidal ideation during the past year. After statistical analysis, medical errors (OR: 3.4336; CI95%: 1.7164 - 6.869; p < 0.001) burnout. Having children (OR: 0.495; CI95%: 0.2491 - 0.983; p = 0.044) emerged as a protective factor (table 3). Discussion: With a large participation rate, this study reveals a high burnout rate among French pediatric orthopedic residents and surgeons even if slightly lower than those found in other surgical specialties. Residents seem to be more exposed to this risk than their masters. The consequences of burnout are varied but can be dra-matic. These results require us to be vigilant about the occurrence of burnout in nursing staff, and to take care of it if necessary. E-POSTERS EP-47 Management Orthopedics, Poznan, Poland, Poznan, Poland Introduction and Objective: In children with myelome- ningocele the ability to stand upright and walk using orthoses can be limited due to knee flexion contracture. A contracture \u00b330\u00b0 may signify indication for surgical correction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the dura-bility of the results and its functional impact. Materials and Methods: Between 2016 and 2021 sixteen consecutive knee joints (13 children, 7 girls and 6 boys) aged 9.1 (3-15 years) were surgically treated (posterior capsulotomy from double approach) due to flexion con-tracture. Sharrard functional groups I through IV angle was 49.3\u00b0 (30\u00b0-80\u00b0). Clinical and radiological assessment were performed before, immediately after, one year after the procedure and at the last follow-up of 3.25 years (1-6 years). The patient's ability to stand upright and walk was assessed, and clinical data were analyzed for complications and recurrences. Results: At follow-up, all children were verticalized in orthoses while 7 patients (Sharrard III or IV) were capable to walk in orthoses. The knee flexion contracture was cor - rected from 49.3\u00b0 to 9.0\u00b0 post-op, 7.8\u00b0 at one year and 8.4\u00b0 at follow-up. No significant loss of knee extension was found at one year (p = 0.5417) and at follow-up (p = 0.3750). After one year three patients had full exten- sion, seven had an extension deficit < 5\u00b0, four 5\u00b0-10\u00b0, while in two patients the deformation recurred to 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. The extension deficit after one year tended to nega-tively correlate with patient's age r = -4860, p 2 fractures poste-rior knee subluxation requiring PCL Conclusion: correction of the knee flexion contrac- ture in myelomeningocele revealed effective at follow-up; it was helpful in restoration of upright standing and walking in orthosis, the function previously lost by the children. E-POSTERS EP-48 Pre-operative Psychosocial Assessment in Pediatric Patients with Cerebral Palsy Decreases Length of Stay after Spine Fusion Nancy Lennon 1, Carrie Sewell-Roberts1, Tolulope Banjo1, Denver Burton1, M Wade Shrader1 1Nemours Children's Hospital, Wilmington, United States Introduction and Objective: Caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP) experience significant stress surround-ing orthopedic surgery, which is exacerbated in families with pre-existing socioeconomic stressors. A pre-operative psychosocial assessment (PSA) can help identify stress risk factors and connect caregivers with resources. This study examined the relationship between a pre-operative PSA and hospital length of stay (LOS) for children with CP who underwent spine fusion (PSF). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis, Forty-six patients undergoing PSF who met inclusion criteria (diagnosis of CP, age less than 21, and GMFCS IV or V) and had a pre-op PSA were matched by age, sex, EPOS Abstract Book 169 race, GMFCS level, and severity of central nervous system (CNS) impairment) to a group without pre-op PSA. Pre-op PSAs by a medical social worker included evaluation of family support, financial needs, transportation, equipment, housing, therapy, and other services. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared analyses were used to examine differences between the matched groups. A stepwise linear regression was run to identify which factors influenced hospital LOS. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the groups with/without pre-op PSA. Statistical significance was set at p 0.05. Results: The matched groups of 46 patients (with/without PSA) had no significant differences in age (10.8y/11.2y) sex, (M 28/21) (F18/25) race (Caucasian 28/28, African (IV 17/16, V 29/30) and CNS issues (zero 8/6, one or two 23/24, three or four 15/16). Pre-op PSA tended to significantly decrease LOS (p = 0.000228), 7 days compared to 12.5 without PSA Conclusions: Completion of a pre-op PSA for youth with CP was associated with a significantly decreased hospital LOS in patients who underwent spine fusion. Findings sug-gest that the clinical practice of identifying and addressing psychosocial needs of youth with CP and their families prior to orthopedic surgery can lead to more timely discharge. E-POSTERS EP-49 Scoliosis Development in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: The Influence of Genetic Severity, Functional Level, and Disease-Modifying Agents Armagan Ulusaloglu 1, Ali Jason Children's Wilmington, United States Introduction and Objective: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by abnormalities of the SMN1 gene, leading a loss of spinal cord alpha motor neurons. Newer disease-modifying agents (DMA) - including Nusinersen and gene replacement therapies - have improved gross motor/respiratory function, but their impact on scoliosis development has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for scoliosis develop-ment in SMA, specifically genetic severity (by SMN2 copy number) and DMA use. We hypothesized that genetic severity would increase the scoliosis risk, while DMA use would be protective. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort. Children with SMA, minimum 2-year follow-up, were included. Primary outcome was the prevalence of sco-liosis [major curve (MC) 40%]. SMN2 copy number ( < 3 or 3), Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMS), ambulatory status [Functional Mobility Scale at 50m (FMS50)], DMA (> dis- placement [migration percentage (MP40%)]. Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Results: 82 patients (52% female) with SMA Type I (44%), II (39%), and III (17%) met the inclusion criteria, with a total follow-up duration of 7.3 (SD:4.5) years. The prevalence of scoliosis was 52.4%, with age of onset 7.2 (SD:3.0) years. The age at first scoliosis x-ray was 5.5 (SD:3.2) years, with major curve amplitude 34 (SD:22). At last follow-up, the major curve amplitude was 48 (SD:29). Significant risk factors for scoliosis by univari-ate analysis were: SMA Type (I/II, p = 0.006/0.08), SMN2 copy (< 3, p = 0.03), non-ambulatory status (FMS50 = 1, p = 0.04), and hip displacement (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that only hip displacement was an inde-pendent risk factor (p = 0.002) (Table). Conclusions: The development of scoliosis in SMA is high, with risk factors associated with proxy measures of disease severity, including SMN2 copy number, SMA type, ambulatory status and, most notably, the presence of hip displacement. DMA use was not found to be protective for scoliosis development.170 Journal of Medical Center, Okinawa, Japan Purpose: Lumbar spondylolysis generally occurs during growth spurts when fatigue fractures occur. However, we occasionally experience cases of lumbar spondylolysis in children with cerebral palsy even before the growth spurt or in children who do not walk. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of lumbar spondylolysis in children with cerebral palsy and to examine the factors contributing to its occurrence. Subjects and Methods: Of 278 children with cerebral palsy who underwent elective posterior root amputation for spastic cerebral palsy at our hospital from November 2000 to May 2022, 216 cases (138 boys and 78 girls) with confirmed preoperative CT were included. The mean age at surgery was 5.5 (2-15) years. The gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) was level I in 23 cases, II in 54 cases, III in 37 cases, IV in 56 cases, and V in 46 cases. The presence of lumbar spondylolysis was con-firmed by CT taken preoperatively. patients, 17 (7.9%) had lumbar spon- dylolysis. The mean age was 6.2 years, and the height of separation was L2 unilateral in one case, L5 unilateral in seven cases, and L5 bilateral in nine cases. Only one patient complained of low back pain, and the incidence rates for each GMFCS level were 3/23 (13.0%) for I, , and 1/46 (2.2%) for V . The incidence of separation was higher in the cases with lower levels of cerebral palsy. Discussion: Lumbar spondylolysis in children with cere- bral palsy is likely to be strongly influenced by congenital predisposition, unlike the common factor caused by fatigue fracture. On the other hand, however, high walking ability was also involved in the occurrence of spondylolysis, sug-gesting that acquired factors may also be influential. E-POSTERS EP-51 Fracture rates in children with cerebral palsy: Hospital, Randers, Denmark 2Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 3Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 4Department of Children's Orthopedics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 5Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, G\u00f8dstrup Regional Hospital, G\u00f8dstrup, Denmark 6Centre of Rare Diseases - Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 7Department of Child and Youth, Randers Regional Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 8Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark Introduction and Objective: In children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) fracture rates have been reported to be higher than in the general population. But age-specific fracture rates have not been directly compared and the effect of comorbid epilepsy needs elucidation which impairs decision making regarding bone health interventions. Therefore, we aimed to establish the age-specific frac-ture rates in children with CP with and without epilepsy in Denmark. Materials and Methods: Data from Danish registers were combined to establish cohorts of children with and without CP born in Denmark from 1997 to 2007. Fracture rates were estimated for 1997-2016. Results: (Present your results in a logical sequence in text, table, and illustrations). We identified 1,451 children with CP and 787,159 with- out CP. Female/male rates were 23/27 with CP and 23/29 without CP. Male sex, epi-lepsy and anti-seizure medication, but not the diagnosis of CP or GMFCS-level, were associated with higher fracture rates. Relatively more lower extremity fractures occurred in non-ambulant children with CP. Conclusions: We found no increased fracture rates in children with CP when compared to peers, however, frac-ture locations suggested bone fragility in non-ambulant children with CP. All children with epilepsy and on anti-seizure medication had increased fracture rates. We sug-gest bone health optimization in these groups to prevent fragility fractures.EPOS Abstract Book 171 E-POSTERS EP-52 A Systematic Review: Comparing Efficacy of Virtual Reality/Video Game Therapy to CIMT for Pediatric Upper Extremity CP David Ahn Purpose: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent form of developmental disorders affecting children, and effec- tive treatment can improve a child's quality of life. New therapies for improving upper extremity function imple-ment Virtual Reality (VR) and videogames (VG), but the efficacy of these therapies has not been established. This study aims to quantify the effectiveness of VR and VG interventions on upper extremity function by comparing the outcomes of VR and/or VG modalities with CIMT, a well accepted treatment for CP.Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to screen papers for cerebral palsy, upper extremity, treatment and pediatric PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane. A total of 6 VR/VG papers (n = 84) and 10 CIMT papers (n = 161) were selected for their utilization of the QUEST scale in evaluating patients pre and post treatment upper extremity function. A difference in pre and post intervention QUEST scores was calculated for each study. Based on the number of participants in each study, a weighted average and standard deviation was calculated for the VR/VG group and for the CIMT group; a t-test was used to determine statistical significance. Results: 3855 papers were screened to narrow down to 16 studies matching the inclusion criteria. Pre and post inter - vention QUEST scores were compared between CIMT (n = 161) and VR / VG (n = 84) treatment modalities. VR/VG resulted in a greater improvement (p = 0.0049) in QUEST scores for extremity function than CIMT for CP patients. This prom-ising new treatment modality should be considered as an alternative to traditional treatments, and may also increase patient satisfaction and adherence as VR/VG could be per - formed in a clinic and at-home setting. 172 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-53 Changes in upper limb kinematics in children with cerebral palsy after lower Turkey Introduction and Objectives: The upper limb can be involved in children with cerebral palsy (CP), while the lower limb is more commonly affected. Little is known regarding the alterations in the upper limb kinematics after the orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity during gait. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in the upper limb kinematics in children with CP between preoperative and postoperative parameters. Material and Methods: The study group included 30 chil- dren with CP (17 diplegics, 13 hemiplegics; mean age = 12,9, range = 5-16; 18 boys, 12 girls) and the control group consisted of 29 healthy children (15 boys, 14 girls; mean age = 9 years, range = 5-15). Video-based gait analyses of all children were retrospectively evaluated. In both groups, bilat- eral upper extremity measurements were performed using Kinovea 0.8.15. Measurements included flexion/extension angles of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints in addition to the head and trunk during 8 phases of gait in the sagittal plane. Shoulder abduction, head, and neck lateral flexion were also measured during initial contact and midstance in the coronal plane. To evaluate the efficacy of the surgery, the Edinburgh score was calculated in patients pre-and postoperatively. Results: In the sagittal plane, significant differences were observed in mid-stance, terminal stance, pre swing, initial, and terminal swing phases for the wrist joint. (p < 0,05) There were also significant differences in the elbow joint flexion and extension angles during initial contact and mid-stance phases (p < 0.05). Postoperative Edinburgh scores were found lower compared to preoperative scores. Conclusion: Evidence from this study has revealed that lower extremity surgeries could affect upper extremity kinematics, and thus it might be more beneficial to start with lower extremity surgeries before the upper extremity surgery. Nonetheless, the current study is retrospective and has limitations; thus, prospective randomized studies are needed in the future. EPOS Abstract Book 173 E-POSTERS EP-54 Long-Term Results Equinus Deformity Treatment Of The Feet By Ulzibat And Strayer Surgery Methods In Children With Cerebral Palsy Paviel Rakhman 1, Oleksandr Korolkov2 1Kharkiv Regional Trauma Hospital, Lviv, Ukraine Background: Equinus deformity of the feet the first deformitie that are noted in children with CP. The most common method is Z-achiloplasty and Strayer's surgery, but the Ulzibat method is also quite common. Objectives: To conduct a retrospective comparative assessment of the effectiveness of the Ulzibat method and Strayer's surgery in the longt-erm postoperative period. Study Design & Methods: 125 children with CP (71 boys and 54 girls), aged 4-10, identical in gender, age, type of pathology: according to the GMFCS: 43 patients (34.4 %) - Level II, 47 (37.6 %) -III, and 35 (28.0 %) - IV . The aver - age follow - up period is 4.7 years (3 -6.5 years). Two groups: I - 49 children treated by Ulzibat technique (in 17 cases - once, and in 32 - from 2 to 4 times with interval of 6-12 months.); II -76 children with Strayer surgery. Results: The initial assessment of the condition of children with cerebral palsy after surgical treatment of Equinus deformity in both groups was carried out 3 months after the intervention. In both groups, a correction was achieved : in 1 group - 95.6% of cases, in 2 groups - 94.9%. However, according to GMFM-88 data, it can be noted that children of II group performed motor tasks in the standing position more clearly, and walking greater duration and confidence compared to I group. At 6 and 12 months after surgical treatment: in Group 1, in 48.98% of cases, clinical and radiological data of the feet significantly worsened, in Group 2-18.4%. 24 months - shows deterioration of verti-calization and walking characteristics in Group 1. Conclusions: The data obtained give grounds to assert that the Ulzibat technique carries a high risk of complications in the separated period, after 6-12 months, despite a good immediate result (3 months). E-POSTERS EP-55 The short-term impact of Botulinum Neurotoxin type A injections on lower-limb muscle morphology in common prob- spastic Cerebral Palsy (SCP) with Botulinum Neurotoxin type-A (BoNT-A) widely used to reduce the hyperactive stretch reflex. Yet, the immediate impact of BoNT-A on this stretch reflex and the impact on the mor - phology of muscles remains unknown. Objective: What are the short-term effects of BoNT-A injections on muscle morphology of the medial gastrocne- mius (MG) and semitendinosus muscles (ST) in children with SCP? Material and Methods: Of twenty-six children, median age 6.3 years (4.6 - 8.2), gross motor function classification level (GMFCS) I/II/III (15/8/3), the mor - phology of the MG and distal compartment of ST mus-cle of the most affected leg was assessed by 3D-freehand ultrasound. A subset of participants (n = 14) underwent an instru- mented spasticity assessment, expressing the change in the hyperactive stretch reflex post-BoNT-A by the difference in EMG response on passive muscle stretch. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to evaluate treatment effects (alpha = 0.05). Results: Twenty-five children received BoNT-A (Botox\u00ae) in the MG (median dose 2.7 units/kg (2.2-3.0)) and 21 children received BoNT-A in the ST (median dose 1.8 units/kg (1.6-2.0)). The median interval between pre- and post-treatment evaluation was 2.1 months (1.9-2.4). The results of the different outcome parameters are pre-sented in Table 1. Conclusions: These results indicate that BoNT-A treat- ment does successfully reduce the hyperactive stretch reflex, but negatively affects muscle volume of the MG and distal compartment of the ST during the first months after injection. No harmful effects on muscle lengths were found. These results confirmed that there is need for close monitoring during the post-treatment follow-up and accurate treatment selection. Future studies should investigate long-term effects, include microscopic and molecular analyses of muscle properties, functional evaluations and explore strategies to accelerate muscle recovery post-BoNT-A, to critically appraise the benefit-harm balance of Fusion? Peter Cirrincione1, Roger Widmann1, Jessica Heyer1 1HSS, New York City, United States Introduction and Objective: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is known to increase a patient's height, but the impact on body mass index (BMI) is uncharacterized. Other surgeries, such as anterior cruci-ate ligament reconstruction, are described to significantly affect the BMI percentile of pediatric patients; as such, this study was designed with the aim of assessing BMI and height changes over time after PSF for IS. Materials and Methods: BMI and height percentiles for follow ups after PSF performed for IS between January 2016 and August 2022 were calculated and con-verted to an age and sex-adjusted percentile based on growth charts from the Center for Disease Control. Follow-up was classified using the following scale: 2 weeks ( < 42 days), 3 months (42-120 days), 6 months (120-270 days), 1 year (270-548 days), and 2 years (548-1,096 days). The data was analyzed for normality with a Shapiro-Wilk test and percentiles were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank treatment (1.32 - 1.94) 1.49 (1.20 - 1.71) 0.006* nmtu (% leg mg = medial gastrocnemius, N = number, nml = muscle length normalized to leg length, nmV = muscle volume normalized to body weight, ntl = tendon length normalized to leg length, nmtu = muscle-tendon unit length normalized to leg length, p25 = 25th percentile, p75 = 75th percentile, rms = root mean square, \u00b5V = microvolts. i = the sample number differs between muscles because of variable muscle selections for boNt-a treatment or bad quality data, instrumented spasticity assessments were performed in a subgroup. ii = the average change in rms-emg between a high- and low-velocity passive stretch of the muscle. iii = average rms-emg during a high-velocity passive stretch of the muscle. Results: 272 patients met inclusion criteria. On average, surgery was performed at 14.4\u00b1 1.9 years, 12.2\u00b1 2.2 levels were fused, and percentiles for BMI and height at surgery were 55.7\u00b1 29.4% and 54.9\u00b1 30.5%, respectively. There were significant decreases the 2-week (-10.7%, 0.001) follow ups compared to BMI percentile at surgery. At 1 and 2 years, the difference in BMI percentile was not significantly different from the BMI percentile at surgery (-2.2%, p = 0.116 and -2.3%, p = 0.228, respectively). Height percentile was significantly increased at all time points, with the greatest increase being, on aver - age, 8.3% at the 2-week visit (P < 0.001), or 2.41\u00b1 1.72 cm. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that by one and through two years after PSF, BMI percentile returns to preoperative values, even though the percentile remains increased.EPOS Abstract Book 175 E-POSTERS EP-57 Autofusion in Early Onset Scoliosis: Occurrence, Risk Factors, and Impacts on Growth Constructs Bryan Menapace1, Nichole Leitsinger1, Lindsay Schultz1, Viral Jain1, Peter United States Intro: Autofusion (AF) during distraction-based growing rod (GR) for early onset scoliosis (EOS) has been sparsely reported. Its incidence, causes, and impacts are not known. This study aimed to answer all of these questions. Methods: Surgeon calculated AF determined as a percent- age of bridging bone across vertebral levels between fusion masses. This numeric score was converted to Grades I-V , e.g. minimal-to-no AF to 100%. Cobb spinal lengths measurements determined preop, after index GR, and after PSF.

E-POSTERS EP-58 Beam-like Rods Do Not Provide Additional Improvement to Thoracic Kyphosis Restoration When Compared to Sagittal Reinforced Rods in Adolescents Undergoing Spinal Fusion with Pedicle Screw Instrumentation for Idiopathic of Orthopedics and Traumatology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland 2Department of Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland 3Department of Pediatric Orthopedics and Traumatology, Helsinki New Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland 4Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University of Turku and University Hospital, Turku, Finland176 and in patients undergoing pedicle screw instrumen- tation (PSI) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Our objective was to compare two different designs of asym-metrical rods in adolescents who underwent PSI for AIS with an emphasis on thoracic kyphosis restoration. We hypothesize that dual cup pedicle screws with beam-like rods would provide improved correction of thoracic hypokyphosis with similar main curve correction to tulip-ine pedicle screws with sagittal reinforced rods. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six consecutive adolescents (mean age 15.6 years, SD 2.0, Table 1) were followed prospectively with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Thirty-nine patients were operated with sagittal re inforced rods and 37 patients were operated with beam- like rods. Their clinical, radiographic, and health-related quality of life outcomes were assessed preoperatively, postoperatively, and during the 6 months and 2-years fol-low-up visits.Results: At the last follow-up, the mean thoracic curves were 13\u00b0 (6.2\u00b0) and 13\u00b0 (6.0\u00b0) (p = 0.717, Table 1). Corrections were 75% in the sagittal reinforced group and 73% in the beam-like rod group (p = 0.517). The (SD) thoracic was 24\u00b0 (11\u00b0) (7.8\u00b0) in the reinforced rod and beam-like rod groups (p = 0.517). There was a slight negative correlation between the major curve correction and thoracic kyphosis change in both groups, although this was not statistically significant (R = -0.19, p = 0.094 in the sagittal reinforced rod group, R = -0.16, p = 0.180 in the beam-like rod group). SRS-24 total score was significantly better in the beam-like rod than in the sagittal reinforced rod group at a 2-year follow-up (mean 4.3 vs 3.9, p = 0.003). No neurological complica- tions or deep surgical site infection occurred in the patients. Conclusions: There are no significant differences in the coronal or sagittal deformity restoration in patients who underwent a posterior spinal fusion with sagittal reinforced rods or beam-like rods for AIS.

E-POSTERS EP-59 Is minor bleeding disorder affecting activated cephalin time a predictive factor for blood transfusion in AIS Robert Debre, Paris, FranceEPOS Abstract Book 177 Introduction: AIS surgery is a major hemorrhagic pro- cedure. Patient blood management is commonly used to avoid allotranfusion, thatremains necessary in 5 to 10%. Prolonged activated cephalin time (TCA) is often diag-nosed in adolescents, but whether or not it should be con-sidered is still unclear. The goal of this study was to assess if minor bleeding disorder affected blood loss and transfu-sion rate in AIS surgery. Materials: After IRB approval, all AIS patients undergo- ing posterior fusion were included between 2018 and 2020. Hemostasis blood tests were systematically per - formed preoperatively . All patients received the same blood salvage strategies associating cell salvage, preopera-tive erytropeitin and tranexamic acid during the procedure. The continuous infusion was improved to 10mg/Kg/H when the surgeon observed an abnormal bleeding. The fre-quency of minor bleeding disorder and transfusion rate were analyzed.. Results: Overall 202 patients were included. Twelve patients (5.8%) required blood transfusion, 6 intraopera-tively and 6 during the 3 postoperative days. Nineteen (9.4%) patients had a minor bleeding disorder, but none of them was transfused. Factors influencing transfusion rate were revision surgery (p = 0.05), use of preoperative halo (p = 0.001), gibbectomy (p = 0.065) and an intraoperative increase of tranexamic acid asked by the surgeon (0.06). Minor bleeding disorder was not associating with blood transfusion (p = 0.293). After linear regression, the dose of tranexamic acid, linked to the surgeon observation, was the only predictive factor to avoid blood transfusion (OR = 2.85 [2.75-2.93]) Conclusion: Minor bleeding disorder with asymptomatic prolonged TCA do not increase transfusion risk in AIS. E-POSTERS EP-60 Growing Rod versus Posterior Spinal Fusion Treatment of Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis: Unique Characteristics and Surgical Outcomes Elizabeth Wacker Nichole Leitsinger1, Viral Jain1, Peter United States Introduction: Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (JIS) is uncom- mon and challenging to treat. Treatment strategies aim to maximize natural growth of the spine while minimizing curve progression. Growing rods (GR) or posterior spinal fusion (PSF) are utilized when conservative management fails to control curve progression. The purpose of this study is to compare the patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and surgical outcomes in GR and PSF treatment of JIS. Methods: Retrospective review of the demographics, radiographs, and surgical data of all JIS patients requir - ing surgical treatment (traditional GR, magnetic GR, or PSF) between 2012-2020. Patients who underwent either type of GR treatment were compared to those who under - went PSF. Results: 36 patients underwent surgical treatment of JIS(13 GR, 23 PSF). The average age was 10.2 years and the 8.3% (3/36) of male patients all underwent GR treat-ment. Pre-operative Cobb angle did not differ between the GR and PSF cohorts (p = 0.558), but the GR group had shorter pre-operative T1-S1 length (p = 0.002). Post- operative T1-S1 length was shorter in GR patients (p = 0.002), but the change in T1-S1 length as a result of surgery did not differ between groups (p = 0.548). The PSF group had longer anesthesia and operative time (p < 0.001), higher EBL (p < 0.001), longer hospitalization (p = 0.02), and a greater correction of Cobb angle with surgery (p < 0.001). 8 patients initially treated with GR went on to definitive PSF treatment. Those patients had a longer T1-S1 length before PSF (p = 0.006), similar immediate post-PSF T1-S1 length (p = 0.437), and shorter change in T1-S1 length from PSF (p = 0.020) than the patients that underwent primary PSF. At final follow-up, patients who underwent primary PSF versus PSF after GR treatment had a similar T1-S1 length (p = 0.842). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the surgical intervention chosen to manage progressive spinal deformity in JIS differs based on patient characteristics ultimately impacting several surgical and radiographic outcomes. An understanding of these differences can help guide orthopedic surgeons managing JIS.178 Journal of Children's Applicability of Shoulder, Olecranon, and Wrist-based Skeletal Maturity Estimation Systems to the Modern Pediatric Population Ryan Furdock1, Andy Kuo2, Kallie Chen1, Raymond Liu1 1UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States 2Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, United States Introduction and Objective: The proximal Modified Fels wrist skeletal maturity system (mFels wrist) were recently developed or updated using the same historical, mostly white, pediatric population used to produce the Greulich and Pyle skeletal age atlas (GP). These skeletal maturity systems (SMS) have demon-strated skeletal age estimation performance superior or equivalent to GP in historical patients. Their applicability to modern pediatric populations has not yet been evaluated. Materials and Methods: We reviewed anteroposterior (AP) shoulder, lateral elbow, and AP hand or wrist x-rays of four pediatric cohorts: White males, Black males, White females, and Black females. Peripubertal x-rays were evaluated: males 9-17 years and females 7-15 years. Five non-pathologic radiographs for each age and joint were randomly selected from each group. Skeletal age estimates made by each of the three SMS were plotted against the chronological age associated with each radiograph and compared between cohorts, and with the historical patients. Results: 540 modern radiographs were evaluated (180 shoulders, 180 elbows, 180 wrists). All radiographic parameters had inter- and intra-rater reliability coefficients at or above 0.79, indicating very good reliability. For PHOS, white males had delayed skeletal age compared to black males (-0.12 years, p = .02) and historical males (-0.2 years, p < .001). For OAOS, White males (-0.37 years, p < .001) and Black males (-0.29 years, p < .001) had delayed skeletal age compared to historical males. For mFels wrist, White males (0.29 years, p < .02), Black males (0.57 years, p < .001), and Black females (0.44 years, p < .001) had advanced skeletal age compared to his- torical counterparts of the same sex. All other comparisons were not significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The PHOS, OAOS, and mFels wrist SMS can be applied to modern pediatric populations with small to moderate corrections based upon race and sex of the patient. E-POSTERS EP-62 Prospective cohort analysis of patients with acute hand and forearm injury : Is there a need for a new scoring system for the pediatric population? Arman Acute injuries related to hand and forearm in children differ from adults in terms of injury mechanism and severity. Using same injury scoring system in both population may lead to misconceptions due to different characteristics. Widely used Modified Hand Injury Severity System (MHISS) could fail to propose prognostic value in pediatric cases. It was aimed to inves-tigate the validity/prognostic value of MHISS in pediatric cases and also defining characteristics of such injuries. Materials and Methods: An observational prospective cohort study carried out in tertiary trauma center between EPOS Abstract Book 179 September 2021- September 2022. 374 adult and 91 pedi- atric patient with open wound injuries in hand and forearm was included. Demographic findings, mechanism, time, injured structures and occupational status were noted. Daily, monthly, seasonal distribution were analyzed. Comparative evaluations were made with the MHISS scores of adult patients (Figure). Results: Mean age was 10,58 years and patients were homogeneously distributed in terms of age. Two thirds of patients were male. Yearly distribution of cases showed accumulation in spring (%41,8). Most common mecha-nisms were cuts (%56) and blunt traumas (%26). %49,5 of the cases were home accidents while %4,4 were occupa-tional injuries. Fingertips were most common injured structure (%35,6) followed by tendons (%30). Concomitant fractures were seen in %34,1 of cases. Severity distribu-tion among groups of MHISS were: %19,8 minor, %28,6 moderate, %30 severe, %17 major. Mean severity score was 68,23 in children and 63,95 in adults (p > 0,05). Conclusion: While 51% of the patients were classified as severe or major according to the MHISS scoring system, this rate was less accurate in pediatric hand injuries with completely different mechanism, type, treatment method and prognosis compared to adults. Specific injury severity assessment system is also required for pediatric hand injuries, which are often more easier to treat than adult hand injuries (Table).Table. mhiss scores and classifications between adults and children. n (%) mhiss adults min\u00f6r 73 (19,4) moderate 121 (32,3) Children min\u00f6r 18 (19,8) major 17 (18,7) 6-640 (52) 68,23\u00b176,99 E-POSTERS EP-63 Midterm Results of Serial Derotation Casting and Bracing as a Strategy to Delay Surgery Nicholas Lopreiato1, Bryan Menapace1, Viral Jain1, Peter Sturm1 1Cincinnati Center, Cincinnati, United States Introduction: Congenital Scoliosis is a rare form of sco- liosis that can manifest itself as a large progressive curve in a young child. Surgery is often performed to prevent progression, as casting and bracing are felt to be ineffec-tive. Risk of posterior spinal fusion in young patients com-plicate the decision to proceed with operative management. The purpose of this study is to report on our institution's experience with serial derotation casting for children with congenital scoliosis as a strategy in delaying surgical care. Methods: 15 patients with congenital scoliosis who under - went serial derotational casting. We recorded the age at time of initial casting as well as the initial Cobb angle of the curve involving the vertebral anomaly and the Cobb angle of any compensatory curve. We then recorded the same values at either the time of surgery if the patient underwent surgery or at the patient's last follow up if they did not. All patients were treated with a a derotation cast that was changed every 1-3 months until age 4, at which time they were switch to full time brace wear until skeletal maturity. Results: Initial casting mean age 25.4 +/- 10.5 months, underwent average of 7.9 +/- 7.4 casts during the course of treatment. Initial Cobb angles 57.8\u00b0+/-13.6\u00b0 for the involved curve and 39.2\u00b0+/-14.4\u00b0 for compensatory curve. An average follow up 57.5 +/- 35.8 months, final Cobb angles measured 54.6\u00b0 +/- 15.1\u00b0 for the involved curve and 32.6\u00b0+/- 18.6\u00b0 for compensatory curve. Out of the 180 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) 15 patients, 5 (33.3%) underwent surgery for their curve and 10 (66.7%) did not. None of the patients sustained a casting related complication. Conclusion: We found that congenital scoliosis patients did not have progression of their curve with serial derota- tional casting, and majority of patients were able to delay surgery. E-POSTERS EP-64 Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Paediatric Scoliosis Surgery: A Pilot Study Stacy Wei Ling Kim Luan Lee1, Mini Abraham1, Woei Boon 1KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion (PSIF) remains the gold standard when treating severe scoliosis. Complications like surgical site infection (SSI), wound dehiscence and seroma formation cause increased mor - bidity. While negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used extensively in spinal SSIs, evidence on NPWT following primary closure in paediatric scoliosis correc-tion is sparse. This was a retrospective review of patients under 21 years who underwent PSIF between 2019-2022. Between April 2021-March 2022, we commenced routine use of PREVENA dressing following primary wound closure. Prior to April 2021, patients received standard dressings of steristrips and AQUACEL \u00ae Ag. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The first comprised patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and PREVENA applica-tion (Group P-IS). They were compared against a matched group who received standard dressings (Group S-IS). The second group comprised patients with non-idiopathic scoliosis (NIS) and PREVENA application (Group P-NIS). They were compared against a matched group who received standard dressings (Group S-NIS). 31 patients (Group P-IS) were compared to 35 patients (Group S-IS). Seroma formation, wound dehiscence, SSI, hospitalization duration and visits till the wound healed was higher in group S-IS, although statistical significance was not reached. 17 patients (Group P-NIS) were com-pared against 13 patients (Group S-NIS). Seroma forma-tion, hospitalization duration and visits till the wound healed was higher in group S-NIS. More slough and wound dehiscence was noted in group P-NIS though this was not statistically significant. NPWT following primary closure in scoliosis surgery resulted in reduced seroma formation, wound dehiscence and SSI in patients with IS, and reduced seroma formation in NIS patients. The beneficial role NPWT plays in aug-menting wound healing following paediatric spinal sur - gery can be further examined in larger-scale prospective studies. The duration of hospitalization and clinic visits till the wound healed was reduced in both IS and NIS groups who received NPWT. Table 2.

Egea-G\u00e1mez1, Mar\u00eda Gal\u00e1n-Olleros2, Ignacio Universitario Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas., Madrid, Spain 3Neural and Cognitive Engineering group, Center for Automation and Robotics, CAR CSIC-UPM, Madrid, Spain Introduction and Objectives: Patients with Down syn- drome (DS) have a higher incidence of scoliosis than the general population; however, it is unknown whether func-tional level (FL) influences the characteristics and severity of the deformity. The aim of this study is to determine whether a relationship exists between FL and spinal defor - mity in patients with DS. Methods: Of 649 patients with DS included in a pediatric referral center database, we identified 59 with a diagnosis of scoliosis (59.32% female; mean age, 14.19\u00b11.82 years); the 46 patients who met the inclusion criteria comprised the study cohort. According to their functional gait skills and gross motor skills, they were classified into 2 levels. Different coronal and sagittal parameters were measured using whole-spine standing radiographs. The need for sur - gical treatment and history of thoracotomy were recorded as well. Finally, a multivariate association analysis was performed between radiologic parameters and FL. Results: Twenty-two patients had an FL consistent with a level I and 24 with level II. Twelve curves were thoracic, 10 thoracolumbar, and 24 lumbar. A statistically signifi- cant relationship was found between FL I and II and curve magnitude: 18.92\u00ba (6.78) vs (20.28) (p with a cut-off point at 22.3\u00ba (area under the curve = 0.919, p < 0.005, sensitivity = 0.917 and specific- ity = 0.818) (Figure 1B). The relationship between patients who required surgery and level II was also significant (p = 0.016) (Figure 1C). No relationship was found between FL and coronal and sagittal balance, nor with other radio-logic parameters or with curve location (Table 1). Finally, 18.75% of the patients had a previous thoracotomy, but no relationship was found between a history of thoracotomy and thoracic curves (p = 0.432). Conclusions: DS adolescents with poorer FL were associ-ated with larger curves and greater risk for surgery. These findings may provide valuable guidance for the follow-up of scoliosis in patients with DS based on their FL.

When severe, AIS causes pain, pulmo-nary consequences and difficulty in physical activities, predisposing to psychological disturbances. Only 0,1% of patients need surgical intervention and knowledge on how this impacts their quality of life (QoL) is limited. This study aims primarily to assess the post-surgery QoL of patients with AIS when compared with healthy control individuals, and secondarily to determine the relationship between their radiological outcomes and self-reported QoL.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, surgically-treated AIS patients between 2014 and 2019 by a spine differentiated surgical unit were enrolled, along with age matching controls. Patients were excluded in case of neuromuscular scoliosis, scoliosis secondary to syn-dromic, metabolic, infectious or tumoral and surgical re-interventions. QoL data was gathered using SF36 and SRS24 questionnaires. Pre and postoperative Cobb angles were measured by two independent researchers. Disagreements were solved by consensus. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS sta-tistics, version 26. This study was approved by the hos-pitals' ethical committee. Results: 43 AIS patients and 50 controls were enrolled. Mean follow-up time was 4,91 +/- 1,76 years. Except for SF36 general health and health change and SRS24 general self-image and functioning from back condition, all other QoL parameters were significantly higher in the control group. SRS24 postoperative self-image was the only parameter with a significant correlation with Cobb angle reduction in patients with lumbar curves. Conclusion: AIS patients report an overall worst QoL, when compared to matched healthy individuals. Evenmore, the reported QoL correlates poorly with correction of Cobb angle. This highlights the need for appropriate tools to assess the success of this procedure, rather than to rely solely on the radiological outcomes.level 1 level 2 p 3 0.00% (0) 4.17% (1) Quantitative variables represented as mean (standard deviation) and qualitative variables as percentage (count). p-values were derived from multivariate analysis of covariance (maNCoVa) and tests, respectively.Table 1. (Continued)EPOS Abstract Book 183 E-POSTERS EP-67 The Use of 3D Modeling and Patient Specific Instrument in Hemivertebra Resection and Short Posterior Fusion of Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel Study Design: A retrospective comparative study.Objectives: The aims of this study is to present the use of 3D modeling and patient specific instrument (PSI) in hemivertebra (HV) resection and short posterior spinal fusion in the treatment of progressive congenital scoliosis (CS). Background: The treatment of progressive CS is chal- lenging. The disturbed anatomy and the irregular shape and orientation of the pedicles makes the screws implanta-tion difficult. Furthermore, understanding the three dimen-sional deformity of the HV with a two dimensional imaging isn't sufficient. We use 3D modeling in order to better understand the deformity and to perform a preoperative simulation of the maneuvers required for the HV resection. We also use PSI in order to achieve a safer and more solid screw implantation. Methods: We collected all patients with CS that have completed HV resection and short posterior spinal fusion using 3D modeling and PSI between 2019-2021 (Group 1) and compared them to a control group of patients that completed the same procedure with the same indication between 2012-2018 without the use of 3D modeling (Group 2). We compared between the two groups. Results: We had 13 patients in group 1 and 8 patients in group 2. The demographic and radiographic param- eters between the two groups were similar. The time of screw implantation around the HV is 31 min in group 1 and 36 min in group 2. The total time of surgery was 175 min in the Group 1 and 243 min group 2. We had no neuromonitoring events in both groups. Three patients were reoperated due to implant failure, two in group 1. Conclusions: We find the use of 3D modeling and PSI in HV resections for congenital scoliosis to be useful for better understanding of the deformity and safer screw implantation, allowing to achieve shorter opera-tive time.E-POSTERS EP-68 Impact of Patient Characteristics on Successful Lengthening of Magnetically Controlled Growing Rods in Early Onset Scoliosis Zachary Crawford1, John Sturm2 1University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States 2Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, United States Introduction/Objective: Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) are increasingly used in the treatment of early onset scoliosis (EOS). Few studies have reported on patient characteristics in successful desired lengthening of MGCRS in EOS. In this clinical study of EOS patients, the purpose was to evaluate patient factors such as previous instrumenta-tion or type of EOS that impact successful lengthening. Materials/Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on EOS patients with single and dual MCGRs placed 4/2014-4/2022 and distracted at a single institution. Rod distraction was measured at each visit using ultra-sound. Pre-operative major curve at time of implantation and patient demographics including scoliosis type, under - lying diagnosis, and previous growing rods were collected. Student's t-test and One-way ANOV A with Post-Hoc Tukey were used to identify differences in percent of intended distraction between patients with and without prior instrumentation and scoliosis types, respectively. Results: Eighty-five patients were included, there were 26 (31%) patients with prior growing rods or posterior spinal instrumentation with an average major curve size of 73.2 (\u00b119.97) degrees at time of initial instrumentation. Types of early onset scoliosis included 27 neuromuscular, 24 syndromic, 18 idiopathic, and 16 congenital. Distraction success at initial, one-year, and all-time lengthening was similar between patients with or without previous hard-ware (p-value: 0.745, 0.241, and 0.907, respectively). Those with neuromuscular EOS demonstrated no signifi-cantly improved lengthening compared to other types. Patients with idiopathic scoliosis had worse lengthening success compared to syndromic or respectively). Conclusion: This study shows prior instrumentation does not reduce rod lengthening success. Patients with neuro-muscular scoliosis achieve similar lengthening success compared to other scoliosis types. Patients with idiopathic scoliosis may be less likely to achieve success in lengthen-ing compared to syndromic The Impact of Mental Health on Post-Operative Outcomes for Adolescents Undergoing Posterior Spinal Fusion for Idiopathic Scoliosis at a Tertiary Care Children's Hospital in an Underserved Region Leila Mehraban at Montefiore, Bronx, United States 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, United States Introduction: The orthopedic community has strived to better understand the impact of psychosocial variables on musculoskeletal conditions. Within the field of orthopaedic surgery, studies in adult patients have shown that pre-surgi-cal depression or anxiety can lead to post-operative pain and new-onset mental illnesses. In this retrospective study, we seek to evaluate this association in pediatric patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who underwent pos-terior spinal fusion (AIS-PSF) and between pre-operative mental health and post-operative well-being. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 258 AIS-PSF patients (14.9\u00b12.09yrs, 75.9%F), from single center between 2013-2019. Patients were asked to complete disease-specific surveys (SRS-30 or SRS-22) throughout their pre- and post-operative course. Pearson bivariate correlations identified correlations between pre- and post-operative survey domains. Results: Bivariate analyses demonstrated associations at the 0.01-significance level between: health and pre-operative tive mental health post-operative mental 0.476); 6-week post-operative mental health and 6-month post-operative mental health (r = 0.765). Additionally, 6-week post-operative mental health was significantly associated with 6-month post-operative pain at P = 0.05 (r = 0.605). Moreover, it was discovered that between pre-operative and 6-week post-operative assessments, 28.8% of patients had worse mental health scores (while 55.8% reported improved mental health and 12.5% reported no change) , and between pre-opera-tive and 6-month post-operative assessments, 32.3% of patients had worse mental health scores (while 55.9% reported improved mental health and 11.8% had no change) figure (1,2). Conclusion: AIS-PSF patients with low pre-operative mental health scores were more likely to have worse mental health, self-image, and pain scores post-opera-tively. Our results support the growing literature on the interconnectedness of physical disease, mental health, and general well-being. This study has the potential to counterbalance several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. EPOS Abstract Book 185 E-POSTERS EP-70 Partial Instrumentation Removal for Prominent and Painful Spinal Implant after Posterior Spinal Fusion Vivian Chen1, Tyler 1Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States Introduction/Objective: The literature contains little information on the outcomes of partial removal of painful spinal instrumentation in scoliosis patients. The purpose of this study was to report the outcomes of patients with ado-lescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treated with posterior spinal fusion (PSF) that later underwent partial implant removal due to pain secondary to implant prominence. Materials/Methods: This retrospective review examined all scoliosis patients from January 2004 to January 2019 at a tertiary pediatric hospital to identify patients with a diag-nosis of AIS, previous PSF with segmental instrumenta-tion, and partial implant removal for pain secondary to prominent implants. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for resolution of pain and deformity progression after par - tial implant removal. Results: 9 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 18 \u00b1 2 years and mean follow-up was 19.0 \u00b1 18.3 months. Mean time from PSF to partial implant removal was 57.4 \u00b1 18.7 months. All patients had segments of prominent, palpable spinal instrumentation with pain localized to the soft tissue overlying the prominent implants. Unilateral partial implant removal was performed in 88% (8/9) of patients, and bilateral implant removal occurred in 11% (1/9); an average of 3 pedicle screws or rib hooks were removed per patient. Following partial implant removal, 100% (9/9) of patients had complete resolution of pain and returned to full activities. In the 5 patients with > 1 year of follow-up after partial implant removal, the mean change in spinal deformity was 3 degrees or less in the coronal and sagittal planes with a maximum of 8 degrees. Conclusions: Removal of prominent, symptomatic seg- ments of instrumentation resulted in complete resolution of pain and was not associated with significant change in deformity. Surgeons should consider performing partial spinal implant removal in AIS patients that present with focal pain and tenderness secondary to prominent instru-mentation after PSF.E-POSTERS EP-71 Sanders Maturity Scale in Pediatric Orthopedics, Pozna University of Medical Sciences, Pozna, Poland Introduction and objective: Skeletal maturity assess- ment in Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS) is used for evaluation of the deformation progression risk, as well as selecting a method of treatment. Sanders Maturity Scale (SMS) is based on the ossification of phalanges, metacarpal bones and radius rated on AP radiograms of the left hand. Radiograms are classified as one of eight types of matu-ration. This retrospective study aimed to compare SMS to other skeletal maturity assessment methods used in daily practice. Material and methods: Radiograms of 39 female patients with IS (50 series of radiograms), mean age 13.4 yo, range 10.3 to 17.3 were evaluated by three observers: medical student with no experience, resident who was familiar with the methods, and orthopaedic surgeon who was experi-enced with the methods. Skeletal maturity was assessed using the Sanders Maturity Scale (SMS), Risser sign, Greulich and Pyle (GP) atlas, as well as the closure of the triradiate cartilage. Results: Most patients, 17 of 50 (34 %) were classified as type 3 (adolescent rapid - early). Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability for the SMS were very good (Krippendorff's alpha > 0.95). The GP and Risser method showed good reliability, whereas the triradiate cartilage closure assessment reliability was lower. The Risser 0 grade corresponded with as many as four Sanders stages, 16 of 20 (80 %) of them were rated as Sanders 3. All radiograms with open triradiate cartilage (7/50, 14 %) were rated as Sanders 2 or 3; they all received Risser 0 grading. Conclusions: The SMS proved to have a very good intra- observer and inter-observer reliability, it is easy to be used by physicians. The SMS enhances the assessment of skel-etal maturity of IS patients by providing additional stages in the early phase of growth (Risser 0), when progression risk for IS is highest.186 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-72 Comparison of perioperative outcomes of dual young surgeons versus single senior surgeon approach for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis Pawin Gajaseni 1 1Pharmongkutklao hospital and college of medicine, Bangkok, Thailand Background: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of idiopathic scoliosis. Correction sco-liosis is a complex surgery. A dual attending surgeon resulted in reduction of blood loss and complication rate. There was no comparison between a senior surgeon and young sur - geons under the same surgical team environment. Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive AIS patients undergoing PSF between 2011 and 2021 was performed. All eligible patients met a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients were divided into 2 groups (group 1S; single senior surgeon and group 2Y; two young surgeons). Patient demographics and radiographical parameters were recorded. The outcome measures included total blood loss, operative time, hemoglobin change, blood transfusion, percent of correction, post-operative hospital stay, compli-cations and SRS-22 score. Chi square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 96 patients (55 patients from group 1S and 41 patients from group 2Y) were included. There were no significant differences demographics between the two groups (p > 0.05). Total blood loss was comparable (p = 0.427) between group 2Y (800 ml.) and group 1S (800 ml.). Operating time was comparable (p = 0.172) between group 2Y (390 min.) and group 1S (367.5 min.). Length of stay and were also similar among 2 groups (p = 0.497). Group 1S (76.69\u00b110.37%) had better percentage of correction (P = 0.043) compare with group 2Y (72.02\u00b1 11.91%). SRS-22 score was not significant between group (p > 0.05) but better self-image/appearance in 1S group (1S VS 2Y , 4.10\u00b10.29 VS 3.96\u00b10.35) (P = 0.027). Conclusions: Dual attending two young surgeons demon-strated total blood loss, operative time, Hb change, blood transfusion, post-operative hospital stay and SRS-22 score and provided complication rate comparable to a senior sur - geon. We recommend dual attending surgeon strategy for the beginner young surgeons who attempting PSF for AIS. E-POSTERS EP-73 Evaluating the use of prophylactic loaded George's University of London, London, United Kingdom 2Department of Complex Spine Surgery, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Introduction: The objectives of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) correction surgery are to prevent defor - mity progression, achieve spine balance, maintain neu- rological function, preserve spinal motion, and achieve cosmesis. Spine Surgery Infection (SSI) management is important in noninfected and infected patients. In poste-rior surgery patients, the use of antibiotic-loaded cal-cium sulphate beads as opposed to traditional topical antibiotic powders is an innovative way of administering topical antibiotics useful for biofilm reduction, slow continuous elution, and dead space reduction. Calcium sulphate bead use in anterior surgery is inappropriate due to thoracic structures, therefore used in posterior surgery only. Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of all posterior approach surgical patients for AIS patients. Patient demographics; surgery approach and type; verte-bral levels infection rate were analysed at a level-1 complex spine surgery unit. Results: 119 AIS posterior surgery patients (27.7% Male:72.3% Female) underwent posterior only approach (n = 102) and 2-staged anterior/posterior or posterior/ anterior approach (n = 17). The average number of levels for posterior instrumentation was 12.02 (lowest:2, high-est: 22) Prophylactic antibiotic to prevent spinal surgery infection regime: Vancomycin + Cefuroxime powder loaded calcium sulphate beads (n = 84); Vancomycin + Gentamycin + Cephalexin (n = 22); Vancomycin (n = 5); Vancomycin + Cephalexin (n = 2); Cephalexin + Gentamycin (n = 1); Vancomycin + Gentamycin (n = 2); and no antibiotics (n = 3). 5 debridement surgeries: Patient 1 and 2: Vancomycin + Gentamycin + Cephalexin (infection rate: 9.1%); Patient 3,4 and 5: (infection rate: 3.5%). Conclusions: Antibiotic-loaded calcium sulphate bead use is a safe method of preventing SSI. The local effect has a dose-dependent activity even against \"resistant\" infections as this is not systemic dosing. There is excel-lent biofilm reduction, slow continuous elution, and dead space reduction making it an excellent option for non-infected or infected posterior spinal surgery cases.EPOS Abstract Book 187 E-POSTERS EP-74 3D Custom Modelled Navigation Jigs in Posterior Spinal Fusion: A Retrospective Case 1St George's University of London, London, United Kingdom 2Department of Complex Spine Surgery, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Navigation of the spine is an established technique to improve accuracy of pedicle screw place- ment. Intra-operative CT is often required, and some-times two scans are required depending on the length of fusion, which can increase intra-operative time and infec-tion risk. The use of 3D printing in spinal surgery is a growing tech- nique. Traditionally, this was limited to use as a pre-opera-tive visual aid, however, now it has been used to create intra-operative patient specific screw jigs. A whole spine, low dose, 1mm axial cut CT scan is used to create a 3D model of the spine, to which 3D custom modelled naviga-tion jigs (3DCMNJ) are created unique to each vertebra. This allows for accurate and precise techniques for pedicle screw insertion. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of pos- terior spinal fusion for scoliosis patients using 3DCMNJ from 22/09/2020-01/09/2022 at a level 1 spine surgery unit was done. Age, gender, time for screw insertion, blood loss during screw insertion, and screw density data was analysed. Results: There 76% female, 24% Average time for screw insertion was 84 minutes (\u00b1 37), N = 36. The aver - age blood loss during screw insertion was 191.16ml (\u00b1 135.55), N = 25. Average screw density was 1.62 (\u00b1 0.35), N = 41. Two patients returned to theatre, one due to a spinal cord monitoring event, and one due to wound dehiscence. Conclusion: The use of 3DCMNJ in posterior spinal fusion allows for rapid insertion of pedicle screws, thus limiting blood loss during this phase. Preoperative low-dose CT allows for reduced operating time compared to intra operative CT for navigation or robotic pedicle screw entry. Less time of spine or metal work exposure could lead to decreased risk of infection.E-POSTERS EP-75 Posterior dynamic deformity correction device (PDDCD) Pedi\u00e1trico - CHUC, EPE, Coimbra, Portugal Introduction and Objective: Gold standard surgical treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is deformity correction and rigid posterior spine fusion. New less invasive and fusionless techniques are emerging, as Posterior dynamic deformity correction device (PDDCD), with promising initial results. We aimed to evaluate com-plications associated with PDDCD and identify possible causes. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study including AIS patients, who underwent surgical treatment with PDDCD, period 2017-2020. Demographic, radiological data and complications were recorded. Results: Twenty patients included, all female, mean age 15\u00b12 years, most Risser 3/4 (75%), Lenke 1 and 5 in equal proportion, 24 \u00b1 9 months follow-up. Major curve reduced from 50\u00b17\u00b0 (preoperative) to 24\u00b17\u00b0 (postoperative) (p < 0.001). Twelve complications were recorded in eight patients (40%) (two patients with 2 complications and one patient with 3), which required implants removal (n = 3) or definitive surgery (n = 3). Complications occurred at 19 \u00b1 8 months. Ball-and-socket mechanism inverted in three patients, with late septic detachment in one of them. In two patients, proximal screws failure was observed (one under - went screws revision, with subsequent septic loosening). Distal screw failure occurred in one patient, which was reviewed; later, rod failure occurred twice. One patient had rod failure. One patient had pain without identified cause and metallosis was found in the revision surgery. Major curve increased to 27\u00b114\u00ba at last follow-up (p = 0.332). Patients with complications had higher major curves at last follow-up (39\u00b110\u00b0 vs 19\u00b18\u00b0, p < 0.001), regardless of curve severity preoperatively. Complications tended to occur in more severe (52\u00b18\u00b0 vs hypokyphotic (18\u00b17\u00b0 vs 26\u00b112\u00b0), preoperative curves. Conclusions: Although PDDCD provides promising clini- cal and radiological results in AIS treatment, important complication rates should be expected. Large-scale pro-spective studies are needed to better evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of this technique.188 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-76 Clinical outcomes of different autografts used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in skeletally immature patients - a systematic review St\u00e9phanie Objectives: Different types of grafts can be used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). There is little published data regarding skeletally immature patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the clinical outcomes and complications for different autograft types used in all-epiphyseal, transphy-seal and partial epiphyseal/hybrid ACLR in skeletally immature children adolescents. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically or bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts in skeletally immature patients. Studies were included if they studied at least one of the following outcomes: graft failure, return to sport(s), growth disturbance, arthrofibrosis or patient reported out-comes and had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Case reports, conference abstracts and studies examining allografts and extra-articular or over-the-top ACL reconstruction tech-niques were excluded. Graft failure rates were pooled for each graft type using the quality effects model of MetaXL. A qualitative synthesis of secondary outcomes was performed. Results: The database search identified 242 studies. In total 31 studies were included in this review, comprising of 1358 patients. Most patients (81%) were treated using hamstring autograft. The most common used surgical tech-nique was transphyseal. The weighted, pooled failure rate for each graft type was 12% for hamstring tendon Confidence intervals were overlapping. The variability in time to graft failure was high. The quali-tative analysis of the secondary outcomes showed similar results with good clinical outcomes and low complication rates across all graft types. Conclusions: Based on this review it is not possible to determine a superior graft type for ACLR in skeletally immature. Of the included studies, the most common graft type used was the hamstring tendon. EPOS Abstract Book 189 E-POSTERS EP-77 Patient Reported Outcomes Following Arthroscopic Treatment of Symptomatic Discoid Meniscus in Pediatric and Adolescent Population Mauricio Einstein Medical School, Bronx-NYC, Introduction: Saucerization alone or with meniscus stabi- lization is the current treatment for symptomatic stable or unstable discoid meniscus, respectively. It is unclear whether meniscus instability negatively affects complica-tion rate and functional outcomes. Purpose of this study is to report and compare patient reported outcomes scores (PROS) following discoid meniscus saucerization +/- repair in pediatric and adolescent population. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for discoid meniscus with minimum 1year follow-up. PROS electronically collected pre and postoperatively, including Tegner-Lysholm, IKDC, KOOS for symptom, pain, ADL, sport and QOL. Cohort was divided in 2 groups: group 1 included 20 patients with stable discoid meniscus who underwent saucerization and group 2 included 39 patients with unstable discoid meniscus who underwent sauceriza-tion and repair. ANOV A and pair t-test were performed to compare groups. Results: Fifty-nine patients were included for analysis with mean age of 12 (3-18y), BMI 25.3 (15.1- 44.4). Thirty-four (57.6%) were males and 31(53%) were skele-tally immature. Patients less than 10 years old and skele-tally immature had an odds ratio of 1.5 to have meniscus instability. Complication rate for saucerization was 10% (1 arthrofibrosis, 1 osteochondral defect) and 7% for saucerization combined with repair (2 retears, 1 arthro-fibrosis). Overall PROS were significantly improved including Tegner-Lysholm (44.9 vs 75.2; p = 0.08), IKDC (50.4 vs 74.7; p = 0.01), KOOS symptom (60.9 vs 84.5; p = 0.01), KOOS pain (55.3 vs 84.1; p = 0.01), KOOS ADL (70.4 vs 87.7; p = 0.07), KOOS sport (51.2 vs 77.2 p = 0.02), and KOOS QOL (46.9 vs 67.6; p = 0.04). Comparative analysis demonstrated no significant difference in PROS regardless meniscus instability. Conclusion: PROS are significantly improved following arthroscopic treatment of symptomatic discoid meniscus with minimum 1-year follow-up, regardless meniscus instability. Patients less than 10 years old and skeletally immature have a 1.5 increased risk to have meniscus instability.Table 1. graft failure rates, time to graft failure and definition of graft failure per graft type. study hamstring graft failure rate (n, %) time to graft failure (months) Definition of graft failure astur[4] 18 (35) mean 18.2, range 14-24 aCl graft re-rupture Calvo[6] 4 (15.4) 7, 17, 35, 99 traumatic rupture of aCl graft during contact sports Chambers[7] 2 (8) 19.7, 49.5 aCl graft failure due to traumatic injury Cohen[8] 3 (11.5) 4 (n = 1), > 12 (n = 2) traumatic rupture of aCl graft Cordasco[10] 2 (8.7) 10, 18 traumatic re-rupture graziano[24] 4 (9.5) 3, 10, 12, 24 Non-contact aCl injuries Koch[28] 2 (16.7) 6-12 weeks, 24 symptomatic graft failure Kocher[29] 2 (3) 14, 21 graft failure Kopf[31] 0 (0) . graft failure lemaitre[32] 0 (0) . tear recurrence mcintosh[36] 2 (12.5) 4, 24 traumatic graft disruption Nikolaou[40] 4 (4) mean 16 (range 9 - 25) traumatic graft re-rupture pennock[43] 12 (21.4) mean 18 \u00b1 10.8 graft failure sasaki[49] 3 (16.7) mean 10.0 \u00b1 1.6 graft re-ruptures Wall[58] 4 (14.8) < 18 failure 3 (8) . aCl revision after adequate sports trauma pennock[43] 1 (3.7) 30 graft failure BPTBmcCarroll[35] 3 (5) . graft failure memeo[37] 1 (10) EP-78 Anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation for the 10 to 18 year old adolescent athlete: practice guidelines based on International Delphi Consensus Nicky Veldhoven, Netherlands Introduction and objectives: For adolescent athletes with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, there are two treatment options: high-quality rehabilitation alone (non-surgical treatment) or ACL reconstruction plus high-quality rehabilitation. However, there is no clear content descrip-tion of this high-quality rehabilitation for adolescent ACL athletes. Using an International Delphi consensus, we aimed to develop a practice guideline for adolescent ACL rehabilitation which can be used in day-to-day practice. Materials and methods: A three-round online Inter - national Delphi consensus study was conducted. A mix of open and closed literature-based statements were formu-lated and sent out to twenty International ACL rehabilita-tion experts. Consensus was reached at 70% agreement between experts. Statements were divided into three domains: non-surgical rehabilitation, prehabilitation, and postoperative rehabilitation. Results: Experts reached consensus on rehabilitation being different for 10 to 16-year-olds compared to 17 and 18-year-olds with a need to distinguish between prepubertal athletes and mid-postpubertal athletes. Experts reached consensus on the following topics: educational topics during reha-bilitation, psychological interventions during rehabilita-tion, additional consultation of the orthopaedic surgeon, Table 3. minimum set of criteria a 10-16 year-old adolescent aCl athlete should meet before rts clearance (percentage of consensus in parentheses).

The most notable differences between pre-pubertal and mid-postpubertal athletes are described for resistance training and return to sport criteria. Conclusions: A rigorous consensus method led to key rec- ommendations for adolescent ACL rehabilitation. Together with available evidence this formed a practice guideline for non- surgical rehabilitation, prehabilitation and postopera-tive rehabilitation. This is an important step toward reduc-ing practice inconsistencies, closing the evidence-practice gap, and improving quality of rehabilitation after adoles-cent ACL injury.EPOS Abstract Book 191 E-POSTERS EP-79 Does the AMIC technique result in positive outcomes for the repair of cartilage lesions in the knee in adolescent patients? Matthieu Peras1 1HIA Sainte Anne, Toulon, France osteochondral lesions of the knee in skeletally immature patients, whether they have their origin as trauma or as a sequela of osteochondritis, can result in serious long-term sequelae, such as knee arthrosis. While there have been an abundance of studies concerning chondral repair techniques, there have been relatively few studies that have examined outcomes fol-lowing cartilage repair in skeletally immature patients. Therefore, we planned to document outcomes following the use of the autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique in this specific patient population. Materials and methods: This is an international, multi- center study, including 27 patients aged from 12 to 20 years, with an average defect size of 2.7 cm 2. All patients had been treated with the same surgical technique (AMIC) which involved bone marrow stimulation followed by the application of a bilayer collagen matrix over the treated defect site. Post-operative outcomes were assessed by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results: Results showed a significant improvement at a mean follow-up of 2.6 years (min 2 years, max 6 years) across all KOOS domains: 55 vs. 69% (p < 0.001) on symptoms, 58 vs. 87% (p < 0.001) on pain, 31 vs. 71% (p < 0.001) on quality of life, 29 vs. 73% (p < 0.001) on sports and leisure activities, and 67 vs. 90% (p < 0.001) on activities of daily life. There were 3 failures, thus a response rate of 0.89. Conclusion: In adolescent patients, repair of knee carti- lage lesions using the AMIC technique resulted in satisfac-tory clinical improvement at an average of 2.6 years status post with a high response rate and very few failures. E-POSTERS EP-80 Height is a predictor of hamstring tendons length and closed socket anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction graft characteristics in adolescents Martijn Dietvorst 1, Marieke Van potential string tendon length is relevant for planning ligament recon-structions in children and adolescents, as it is not uncommon to encounter small hamstring tendons intra operatively. The aim of this study is to predict semitendinosus and gracilis tendon length based on anthropometric values in children and adolescents. The secondary aim is to analyse hamstring tendon autograft characteristics in a closed socket anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions and to evaluate the rela-tionship with anthropometric variables. Materials and Methods: This observational study included two cohorts of adolescents undergoing ligament reconstruc-tions between 2007-2014 and 2017-2020. Age, sex, height and weight were recorded preoperatively. Semitendinosus and gracilis tendon length and graft characteristics were measured intraoperatively. Regression analysis was per - formed on tendon length and anthropometric values. Subgroup analyses of the closed socket ACL reconstruction were performed and the relation between anthropometric values and graft characteristics were analysed. Results: The population consisted of 171 adolescents from 13 to 17 years of age, with a median age of 16 years. The median semitendinosus tendon length was 29 cm [IQR 26-30] and gracilis tendon length was 27 cm [IQR 25-29]. Height was a significant predictor of semitendinosus and gracilis tendon length. Subgroup analysis of the closed socket ACL reconstructions showed that in 75% of the procedures, the semitendinosus tendon alone was suffi-cient to create a graft with a minimum diameter of 8.0 mm. Additional use of the gracilis tendon was more often nec-essary in females and patients of shorter height. Conclusions: Height is a significant predictor of semiten- dinosus and gracilis tendon length in adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age and outcomes are similar to data in adults. In 75% of the closed socket ACL reconstructions, the semitendinosus tendon alone is sufficient to create an adequate graft with a minimum diameter of 8mm. E-POSTERS EP-81 No correlation between functional and radiographic outcomes in Monteggia fractures treated with elastic stable Bogdanowicz Children's Hospital, Warsaw, Poland 2Department of Radiology and Imaging, The Medical Centre for Postgraduate Education, Warsaw, Poland192 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Introduction and Objective: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of radiological indicators of the humero-radial joint instability to predict the outcomes of di Monteggia fractures treatment. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients who between 2016 and 2021 underwent closed reduction and elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) of the ulna and closed reduction of the dislocation of the radial head. After analyzing 42 cases of di Monteggia fractures, we reviewed 26 which were treated with ESIN. The indications for the intramedullary fixation included transverse and short oblique fractures. The direction of the dislocation has been analyzed with use of Bado classification. The following radiological indicators were assessed at least three months after ESIN removal: Radiocapitellar Line (RCL), Lateral Humeral Line (LHL), Proximity Index (PI), Radial Head displacement Index (RHDI). The outcomes of the treatment have been assessed with Oxford Elbow Score (OES) and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the complications have been assessed with use of modified Clavien-Dindo-Sink scale. Results: Seventeen girls and 9 boys, with a mean age of 7 years (range, 3-11) were treated with a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 3-36 months). Bado IV fractures were present in 4 children, with the rest presenting with Bado I fractures. Three patients were lost to follow-up. One patient presented with poor outcome - OES 19 and MEPS 40. He was treated with ESIN two days after previous failed treat-ment with percutaneous radio-capitellar fixation with K-wire. For the remaining patients, OES was over 44 points (maximum of 60) and MEPS was over 90 (maximum of 100). The radiographic outcomes are presented in Table 1. Conclusions: No coincidence between bad functional and radiological outcomes have been shown. Primary surgical treatment with use of TEN fixation of the ulna allows res-toration of good elbow function, regardless of initial radio-logical parameters.

This study aimed to investigate outcomes of surgical repair. Materials and Methods: Pre-school-aged patients who experienced fingertip amputation and underwent surgery within the past decade were eligible for this retrospective case series. Patients whose distal amputation parts were lost or mangled were excluded. Medical record data extracted included age, cause of injury, type and level of amputation, surgical procedure, and outcome. Results: Thirteen digits in 11 patients (average patient age at injury: 3.3 years), including seven patients who experienced pinching injuries, two who were injured with scissors, and two who were injured by a fruit-sorting machine, were included in this study. Ten complete and three incomplete amputations, and two clean cut, five blunt, five crush, and one avulsion amputations were included. Using Ishikawa's classification system, the amputations were classified as subzone 1 (n = 4), subzone 2 (n = 2), sub- zone 3 (n = 2), or subzone 4 (n = 5). Composite grafting was performed for subzone 1 ampu-tations, which all had complete take. Replantation or revascularization were performed for the remaining nine amputations. The arteries were anastomosed in all ampu-tations and vessel grafts were used in six amputations. Venous anastomosis was performed for three subzone 4 amputations. Eight amputated distal parts survived, though one that was found after left in the hot sun was necrosed. The average follow-up period was 26.8 months, patients with successful replantation and revasculariza-tion did not experience any pain, coldness, or atrophy, though one digit required corrective osteotomy for a sec-ondary deformity. Conclusions: Composite grafting was successful amputations. Subzone 2 and more proximal ampu-tations were difficult to save without vessel anastomosis; however, the arterial anastomosis was possible and the success rate was high. Conservation of the distal amputa-tion part is preferred during the initial surgery.EPOS Abstract Book 193 E-POSTERS EP-83 Medial Epicondyle Fracture Management: Cost Analysis of Steven D. Criss1, Maya Fajardo2, Collin J. May1,2 1Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA 2Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Introduction: Pediatric medial epicondyle fractures (MEF) of the humerus are increasingly treated operatively with surgical fixation, as opposed to nonoperatively with non-surgical immobilization only. We assessed the cost implications of both treatment pathways. Methods: A single-center tertiary care departmental data- base was queried to identify patients who underwent treat-ment for MEF between 2016 and 2022. Patients were matched with financial data from their respective MEF-related encounters. For each encounter, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and associated charges were col-lected for both hospital and professional billing. Charges are presented as relative multiples of operative patient val-ues divided by nonoperative values. The Student's t-Test was used to calculate statistical significance. Results: In total, 190 patients were identified, with 186 having both hospital and professional charges, three with professional charges only, and one with hospital charges only. Operative fixation was performed for 67% of patients (n = 127), with nonoperative treatment comprising the remaining 33% (n = 63). Hospital charges Operative patients averaged 5.3 billed hospital CPT codes compared to 3.7 for nonoperative patients (1.4 times, p = 0.007). Charge value for operative patients on average was 6.3 times that of nonoperative patients (p < 0.001). Outpatient treatment, including outpatient day surgery and recurring outpatient visits, made up 90% of operative and 91% of nonoperative billed CPT codes. Professional charges Operative and nonoperative patients averaged 12.7 and 8.0 billed professional CPT codes, respectively (1.6 times, p < 0.001). Operative patients averaged 4.8 times the charge value of nonoperative patients (p < 0.001). For operative patient encounters, orthopaedic surgery and anesthesia accounted for 50% and 39% of total charge value, respectively. For nonoperative patient encounters, charge value was disbursed primarily between orthopae-dics (69%), radiology (12%), and general pediatrics (10%). Conclusions: Operative management of MEF resulted in significantly greater billed CPT codes and total charge value compared to nonoperative management. These findings indicate that operative management requires greater resource consumption in treating MEF patients and, therefore, higher economic burden. E-POSTERS EP-84 Prognosis in tibial tuberosity fractures. Are the results really so good? Miguel Angel Garcia Cancho1, David Raluy1, tuberosity fractures are rare and mostly limited to adolescents and have a reported good prognosis. Objective: Use a functional score to confirm its prognosis. Assess if fracture shape plays any effect on the final func- tional result. Methods: Retrospective review of prospective data of upper tibial physeal injuries (2019- 2021). Clinically the knee's range of motion and joint stability were assessed. The KOOS pediatric score, and return to previous physical activity, were the outcome measures. Fractures were classified according to the Odgen Classification. On the final examination, comparative x-rays were used; for measuring the slope angle (SA) and the Insall Salvati index (ISI). Other factors assessed were the method of fixation, signs of preexisting Osgood Schlatter disease, complications related to treatment. Results: 10 patients (9 males/ 1 female) fulfilled the crite- ria mean age 13 (12-15). Mean follow-up 18m (13-34). According to Ogden; 4 fractures were IIIA, 4 IVB, 1 IV A, and 1 type V . All fractures occurred during sports activities. 30% had signs of preexisting Osgood Schlater. Mean return to sports was 4 months. The global functional score shows a good result in the fields of pain, symptoms, and activities of daily living, while scores in QOL were low (See table 1). Fractioning results by type of fractures show that results were better in type IIIA, with scores above average, while type IVb showed low scores in the domains of pain, sports and playing, and QOL. Only 30% reported bursitis or pain over screws. Only one case (type IIIA) presented obvious changes in the slope and Insall-Salvati ratio. Conclusions: Despite, reports of good global reports based mostly on x-Rays and return to sports. Detailed functional results are not so optimistic, especially in the field of quality of life. The result may depend grossly on the type of fracture.194 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-85 Reduction of Opioids Following Surgical Treatment of Supracondylar Humerus Fractures in Children Bryl1, Vidyadhar Upasani1 1Rady Hospital, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States Introduction: This quality improvement initiative (QII) aimed to reduce the opioid prescribing practices of pedia-tric orthopedic surgeons in the post-operative setting by decreasing the percentage of children with surgically treated supracondylar humerus (SCH) fractures who were prescribed opioid medications at discharge from a baseline of 39% to 10% (a 75% reduction) over 6 months. Methods: After assessing baseline prescription rates, a multidisciplinary team of health professionals developed a key driver diagram (Figure 1A). Primary interventions included education on current orthopedic literature, newly defined department prescription guidelines, public reporting of provider prescription rates during monthly conferences, and one-on-one case-specific feedback.

We used statistical process control to examine changes in measures over time. Results: During the 32-month QII period 664 children underwent CRPP for a SCH fracture (average monthly surgeries: 20.8\u00b15.9). Baseline opioid prescription data was collected from January 2020 to February 2021. QII inter - ventions started in March 2021. Monthly opioid prescrip-tions for surgically treated SCH fractures decreased from a baseline of 39% to 8% over a period of five months and these levels were sustained for a total of 12 months (Figure 1B). A slight increase in the opioid prescription rate (14%) was observed in August 2022, likely with the start of a new class of pediatric orthopedic surgery fellows. Conclusion: We decreased the number of children with surgically treated SCH fractures discharged with an opioid prescription by almost 80% over five months and sus-tained the reduction for a total of 12 months. Simultaneously, no qualitative increase in return visits or decrease in pain control was reported by providers. This was accomplished through department-defined prescription standardization, monthly prescription reporting, and case-specific prescrip-tion review with providers not meeting guidelines.EPOS Abstract Book 195 E-POSTERS EP-86 A Novel Biobased Polyester Cast versus Conventional Synthetic Fiberglass Cast in the Treatment of Upper Limb Fractures in Children -- a randomized control trial of clinical outcome and patient satisfaction Tsungyu Lan 1, Syang-Peng Rwei2, Chin-Wen Chen2 11. Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital 2.Institute of Organic and Polymeric Materials, National Taipei University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan 2Institute of Organic and Polymeric Materials, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan Introduction: Fractures of forearm and distal humerus are common pediatric orthopedic trauma, which are tradition-ally managed with closed reduction and cast immobiliza-tion. We introduce a novel biodegradable cast to access its clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction in the population of pediatric upper limb fractures in comparison with the conventional fiberglass one. Methods: From Feb 2022 to June 2022, we undertook a single-center prospective randomized trial involving 60 children of upper limb fractures requiring closed reduction with cast immobilization. These cases were randomized by sealed envelope into either biobased polyester or synthetic fiberglass group. All patients were regularly followed-up with cast removal at around 4~6 weeks. Objective clinical findings and subjective patient questionnaire were all col-lected and analyzed. Results: According to the radiographs taken on the day of cast removal, there was no loss of reduction in both groups. The incidence of skin problems was three times(50%) in the conventional group. For the subjective questionnaire, the novel biobased cast was all superior in every sub-item. Discussion: Our study strongly suggests that the novel biobased cast provides excellent stability as the conven-tional one and improves the patient satisfaction in a more eco-friendly and safer way. The commonly-used non-bio-degradable fiberglass cast contains toxic ingredients which are proven to result in associated skin problems and asthma. Despite all its superiority of the novel cast, its high cost, two times as the conventional one, should be taken into consideration. Conclusion: In summary, biobased polyester cast provides stable immobilization and better overall patient satisfac-tion in management of pediatric upper limb fractures. 196 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) E-POSTERS EP-87 Management supposed in newborns Florian Kruse1 1Department of pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital, Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Paris, France Introduction and objective: The supracondylar fracture of the infant before 6 months is a rare entity. It is frequently diagnosed as an elbow dislocation due to the absence of the lateral condyle ossification node. The injury occurs during delivery or in the early months of life, but no con-sensus has been reported either for the diagnosis or the management. The aim of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a newborn supracondylar fracture. Materials and methods: All consecutive infants with a supracondylar fracture before the age of 6 months and treated between 2005 and 2020 were retrospectively included. Radiological exams for the diagnosis were ana-lyzed (X-ray, ultrasound and MRI) as well as the thera-peutic management (orthopaedic or surgical treatment). All the patients were seen for an outpatient clinic visit with a minimum of 2 years follow-up for clinical and radiographic examination.Table 1. patient satisfaction questionnaire.

The main cause was an obstetrical trauma-tism (n = 8). The diagnosis was made on the X-ray for 4 chil- dren. For the remaining 5 children, complementary imaging was performed to assess the degree of displacement (ultra-sound (1), MRI (2) and ultrasound + MRI (2)). Six patients had reduction and cast immobilization under general anes-thesia, 3 were treated surgically with an open reduction. At mean follow-up of 53 months, 2 complications occurred. One axillary abscess due to the cast and one cubitus varus deformity. All children had a full functional recovery. Conclusions: The supracondylar fracture in the newborn is a rare entity that should be managed conservatively. Complementary radiological examination (MRI and ultra-sound) might help to evaluate the degree of displacement and the lack of contact between the fragments. E-POSTERS EP-88 Pediatric trauma injuries related to electric Matilde Molina1, Electric scooters are a novel, rapid and conve- nient means of mean transport with increasing accessibility across the world. The use by children raises a new concern in paediatric emergency departments leading us to carry out this study. Methods: Paediatric multicentre prospective observa- tional study analysing non head trauma orthopaedic inju- ries caused by falls, collision or run over caused by electric-scooter during the period of a year (2019-2020). Patient demographics, circumstances of the accident, injuries sustained and clinical progress were analysed. Results: 60 children were admitted. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall in 47 patients, collision in 5%, run-over in 16%.None helmet, knee or elbow pads were used. 12 patients (20%) were under 9 years of age of which 5(41%) suffered an e-scooter fall while they were trans - ported by their parents, 7 of them (58%) required surgery and 4 (33%) closed reduction and cast under sedation. Conclusions: The recent increase in e-scooter is related to an increase in accidents of accidents. Although most of them are not life-threatening, the severity of these injuries in the paediatric population and the high percentage of patients requiring surgical management should raise con-cern. Guidelines were written to prevent these injuries, as well. Accidents with E-Scooters can cause serious injuries and, therefore, represent a further burden to emergency departments. Further efforts at safety education and enforcement should be made to prevent accidents and min-imise the impact of these injuries. The imposition of an age limit for e-scooter use is an additional measure that policy-makers ought to explore. E-POSTERS EP-89 Distal Radius Autograft in Adolescent Scaphoid Nonunion Outcomes Garrett Rupp1, Patrick Curran2, James Bomar2, Eric Edmonds2, C. Douglas Wallace2 1University of California, San Diego, San Diego, United States 2Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, San Diego, United States Introduction: Adolescent scaphoid fractures are an uncom- mon injury with excellent outcomes when treated early with cast immobilization. However, nonunion is not uncommon, particularly in patients with a delayed presen-tation. Adolescent scaphoid fracture nonunion management is controversial. This study presents adolescent scaphoid fracture nonunions treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with distal radius cancellous autograft. Materials: Children with scaphoid fracture nonunions treated at a single center were identified via electric data-base 2010 to 2021 who underwent scaphoid nonunion repair via ORIF with distal radius autograft. Pre-operative data included interval between injury and surgery, initial x-ray and CT findings including presence of deformity, displacement, or avascular necrosis. Perioperative data included graft size and type, screw size and type, tourni-quet time, and estimated blood loss. Pre- and postoperative radiographic data including carpal alignment and time to union were assessed. Postoperative data including immo-bilization time and time to union were assessed. Results: Seventy-six wrists in 75 patients met inclusion criteria (71 males, 4 females) with a mean age at presenta-tion of 16.3\u00b11.7 years (range 10.1 to 19.8 years) with 50 secondary to fall on out stretched hand (Table 1). Mean tourniquet time was 77.3\u00b116.5 minutes (range 31 to 116 minutes). Fifty-three wrists achieved radiographic union at a mean 36.8\u00b117.6 weeks post-op (range: 10.7 to 79.7 weeks). Follow-up in the 23 wrists that did not achieve radiographic union was 16.6\u00b19.8 weeks (range: 6.9 to 50.6 weeks). Follow-up for the entire cohort was 33.1\u00b121.6 weeks (range: 6.9 to 106.4 weeks).

These are more difficult to treat, having higher probability of neurovascular complications and need for open reduction. We aimed to compare the functional results obtained in children surgically treated for supra-condylar fractures of the humerus displaced in flexion versus extension (Gartland III-IV). Materials and Methods: Retrospective comparative study, including children treated for supracondylar humerus fractures displaced in flexion versus extension (Gartland III-IV), single institution, period 2010-2018. Demographic, clinical and radiographic data were collected. QuickDASH questionnaire was applied for functional assessment. Statistically significant differences considered for p < 0.05. Results: We included 214 children with supracondylar humerus fractures, 197 with extension-type fractures (GExt) and 17 with flexion-type fractures (GFlex). 141 boys in GExt and 14 in Gflex (p = 0.340). Median age: GExt = 6 years(1-12) and Gflex = 7years(3-14), (p = 0.033). Left elbow affected in 125 GExt and 11 Gflex (p = 0.918). Closed reduction performed in most cases, with open reduction needed in 1 GFlex patient and 2 GExt (p = 0.101). Fixation with divergent lateral K-wires in all GFlex and 188 GExt, crossed K-wires in 9 GExt (p = 0.368). Nerve injury present in 2 GFlex cases (ulnar) and GExt cases (median-33, Vascular 14 GExt and 0 GFlex. (p = 0.256). Complications observed in 32 GExt cases and in 7 GFlex (p = 0.011). At median 49months GFlex (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Median age was significantly higher in patients with flexion-type supracondylar humerus fractures, contrary to what has been previously described. Although prevalence of neurovascular injury was similar in both groups, complications were significantly more frequent in children with flexion-type fractures, who also had signifi-cantly poorer functional results.EPOS Abstract Book 199 E-POSTERS EP-91 Supracondylar humeral fractures in children: when the outcome Elena Ludovica Auregli1, Supracondylar humeral fractures (SCHF) are the most common elbow fractures in paediatric population, accounting for 3% of all paedi-atric fractures and the most frequently requiring surgery in children. The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the medium-term functional results of the SCHF in relation to the severity of the dislocation and type of treatment. Materials and methods: Thirty-one paediatric patients, treated for SCHF (19 Gartland II, 12 Gartland III) were evaluated in our department. Eight patients underwent closed reduction and cast immobilization, 22 patients were treated with closed reduction percutaneous pinning (Fig.1) and 1 patient underwent open reduction and inter - nal fixation with plates. Clinical and functional data were collected at follow-up, including elbow and forearm range of motion (ROM), grip strength, carrying angle, Flynn's criteria and DASH score. Student's T-test value < 0.05 was used to define the significance of the differences between continuous variables. Results: The average follow-up was 3.3 years (\u00b11,4 years, range 4 months- 6 years). All patients showed good functional recover. According to Flynn's criteria, 85% of the patients had a satisfactory outcome in the elbow flexion and 81% in the carrying angle. We had no Table 1. flynn Criteria for grading sChf. cases of nerve injuries. Two patients in Gartland II group treated with closed reduction and casting resulted in cubitus varus. Loss of flexion strength was observed in children with Gartland III fractures (p-value = 0,05). In SCHF Gartland II treated with reduction and pinning, functional and clinical outcome was better than the group conservatively treated (p-value < 0,05). Conclusions: In the literature the choice of conservative or surgical treatment for SCHF remains controversial. The medium-term functional outcomes were good in all patients in this study, highlighting better results with surgi-cal treatment in Gartland II fractures when compared to those conservatively treated.

A case control study investigating different surgical options Yunan Lu 1, Federico Canavese2, Shunyou Chen1 1Fuzhou Second Hospital of Xiamen University, Fuzhou, China 2Lille University Centre, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille, France that most commonly affects the diaphysis of the tibia and fibula of children, the best treatment is still debated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with OFD of the tibia (n = 22) and fibula. Cases were divided into four groups (Gr.): Gr. 1: observation (n = 4); Gr. 2: curettage and allograft (n = 6); Gr. 3: curettage, allograft and elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) fixation (n = 9); Gr. 4: extra-periosteal resection and bone transport (n = 5). One patient received two different treatments suc- cessively (23 patients and 24 cases). Results: In Gr. 1, four asymptomatic patients underwent observation after biopsy. Gr. 4 had the lowest local recur - rence rate: 0 cases (0%) vs 4 (66.7%; Gr. 2) vs 1 (11.1%; Gr. 3) (p = 0.002), incidence of deformity: 0 case (0%) vs 0 (0%; Gr. 2) vs 3 (50%; Gr. 3) (p = 0.023), and pathologi- cal fracture: 0 case (0%) vs 0 (0%; Gr. 2) vs 1 (16.7%; Gr. 3) (p = 0.006), although the consolidation time was lon- ger: 6.8 vs 2 (Gr. 2) vs 2.7 months (Gr. 3) (p = 0.017) and the rate of complication was higher than those of Gr. 2 and Gr. 3 (p < 0.05). Gr. 3 had a lower local recurrence rate: 1 case (11.1%) vs 4 cases (66.7%) (p = 0.002), incidence of deformity: 0 case (0%) vs 3 cases (50%) (p = 0.023), and pathological fracture: 0 case vs 1 case (16.7%) (p = 0.006) than Gr. 2. Discussion: Observation should be reserved for asymp- tomatic patients, while surgical treatment for patients with persistent pain, pathological fracture or significant deformity. ESIN is a valid option to preserve the ana-tomical axis of the tibia in symptomatic patients with lesions of limited size; large circumferential lesions or recurrence can be managed by extra-periosteal resection and bone transport, although the complication rate can be relatively high. 202 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) EPOS Abstract Book 203 E-POSTERS EP-93 Anatomic consideration of the radial nerve in relation to humeral length for unilateral external fixation: an MRI study Jae Jung Min1, Young Bundang Hospital Dept. of orthopedic surgery, Seongnam City, South Korea 2Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Dept. of Radiology, Seongnam City, South Korea 3Bumin Hospital Dept. of Orthopedic surgery, Seoul, South Korea Background: Humeral lengthening is performed to cor - rect deformities in the humerus. For most procedures, the insertion of a distal pin is performed without open explora- tion, leaving chances for radial nerve injury. We aimed to present a safe zone for distal pin insertion for external fixa-tion during MRI. Methods: All patients who took at least one upper arm MRI from June 2003 to July 2021 were searched via a clinical data warehouse. For measuring humerus length, the proximal and distal landmarks were set as the highest protruding point of the humeral head and lowermost mar - gin of ossified bone of the lateral condyle, respectively. For children or adolescents with incomplete ossification, the lowermost ossified margin of the ossification center of the capitellum was set as the distal landmark. The anterior exit point was where the radial nerve leaves the lateral intermuscular septum to the anterior humerus, and the dis-tance between the distal margin of the humerus and ante-rior exit point was measured. The proportions between anterior exit point and humeral length were calculated.204 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) Results: 136 patients were enrolled for final analysis. The mean humerus length was 29.4 cm (range 12.9-34.6 cm). The mean distance between the ossified lateral condyle and anterior exit point was 6.6 cm (range 3.1-10.6 cm). The mean ratio of the anterior exit point and humeral length was 22.5% (range lengthening an external fixator may be safely done within 15% length of the distal humerus. If pin inser - tion is required proximal to 15% of the length, an open procedure or preoperative radiographic assessment is advised to prevent iatrogenic radial nerve injury.

Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations but holds the risk of complications such as radial nerve palsy (RNP) and insufficient bone regenerate. Reported numbers of adverse events associated with humeral lengthening procedures in achondroplasia using external fixators vary widely. Materials and Methods: Clinical and radiographic data of 28 patients with achondroplasia who underwent bilat-eral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fix-ator between 2012-2019 was retrospectively evaluated. The median age at surgery was 8 years (range 8-10). The median follow-up time was 6 years (range 2-9). The initial median humerus length was 12 cm (range 11-13). A 9-item patient-reported outcome measure evaluated functional improvement, activities of daily living, and satisfaction. Results: Lengthening was successfully completed in 53/56 humeri. Median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (range 3-10), corresponding to 73 % of the initial humeral length. All patients who underwent lengthening reported functional improvement, were (very) satisfied, and would undergo the treatment again. Long-term sequelae were observed in 1 patient with an upper limb length discrep-ancy. Temporary RNP occurred 1-7 days The goal was not achieved due to RNP in 3/56 segments. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all cases. Refractures of the bone regenerate were observed in 6/56 humeri without long-term sequelae. Conclusions: Bilateral lateral external fixator increases self-care and independence in achondroplasia, but is associated with several adverse events. We report refracture of the bone regenerate in 11% and transient RNP in 39%, resulting in delayed initiation of distraction, extended duration of treatment, and unplanned revision surgeries. However, there were very few long-term sequelae, while the functional outcome was satisfying. E-POSTERS EP-95 In-clinic assessment of upper extremity motion in Royal Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Purpose: Brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) is the most common nerve injury in children with significant upper extremity (UE) impairment. Clinical assessment is chal-lenging due the complex range of motion of the UE. The Microsoft Kinect is a video game system that can measure EPOS Abstract Book 205 UE motion in a clinic setting. The purpose of this study is to measure volume of reach in extremities in children with BPBP. Methods: Patients who underwent UE motion exam with the Microsoft Kinect system were reviewed. The motion of the UE was analyzed using the Microsoft Kinect system in the clinic room. Motions analyzed included functional reach (FR) of the extremity and tasks to simulate activities of daily living. The FR of the extremity was determined by calculating the volume of reach of the hand relative to the shoulder and normalized by subject height. The relative position of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand were assessed during functional tasks. Patients were assessed with the modified Mallet classification. Statistical analysis was performed with significance set at p < 0.05.Results: Twenty patients with a history of BPBP (age 11.9\u00b14.2 years; 9 female) were included. The normalized FR of the extremity was significantly less for the affected arm (0.22\u00b10.11 m 3/m) compared to the unaffected extrem- ity (0.39\u00b10.11 m3/m). There was a strong positive correla- tion between height and FR of the unaffected extremity (r = 0.89), suggesting predictive normalized FR. There was a moderate correlation between FR in the affected arm and the total modified Mallet score (r = 0.50) and abduction Mallet subscore (r = 062). Conclusion: The FR of the extremity is reduced in the affected side and correlates with clinical outcome measures in children with BPBP. The unaffected upper extremity reach is strongly correlated with patient height and may serve as a standard for comparison of affected extremity or predicted reach. E-POSTERS EP-96 Ulnar longitudinal deficiency: are ulnar length or Coimbra, PortugalIntroduction: Ulnar longitudinal deficiency (ULD) is a rare condition that affects the entire upper limb, including the elbow, forearm, and hand. Classification systems focus on anomalies of the elbow/forearm (Kummel, Bayne) and hand (Ogino & Kato), but few focus on the thumb and first web space (Cole & Manske). In line with the latter authors, we hypothesize that treatment strategies should focus on restor - ing thumb function rather than improving ulnar length. Methods: A retrospective observational study of patients with ULD treated between 1995-2019 in a pediatric refer - ral center was conducted. Demographic data, clinical and radiological characteristics to classify the malformation, functional impairment and treatment were evaluated. A descriptive and a comparative analysis were performed 206 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) to determine the relationship between function and treat- ment according to the different classifications considering the elbow, forearm, hand, and thumb. Special attention was given to the thumb condition to evaluate it as a func-tional and therapeutic prognostic factor. Results: Thirty-six patients (42 forearms) were included in the study. Descriptive data are shown in table 1. Function was statistically significantly related to the severity of elbow, forearm, and thumb impairment (p < 0.001), with no influence of the absence of ulnar rays (p = 0.445). Regarding surgical treatment, statistically significant differences were observed according to the degree of involvement of the thumb in Cole & Manske and Blauth classifications (p < 0.001), but no significant differences were found for the rest of the classifications assessed: Kummel (p = 0.504), Bayne (p = 0.645), Ogino & Kato (p = 0.764). Conclusions: ULD is frequently associated with abnor - malities of the thumb and first web space. The absence of ulnar rays of the hand has no influence on function, whereas the severity of the impairment of the elbow, the ulna, and the thumb play an important role. The decision to perform surgical treatment is closely related to the degree of involve-ment of the thumb, therefore its assessment should be con-sidered and included in future ULD classifications.

E-POSTERS EP-97 Ray resection of the Hand in Pediatric Age following Trauma Marcos Carvalho1, Jo\u00e3o Marques1, Maria EPE, Coimbra, Portugal Introduction: Pediatric hand ray resection is rare and reserved for patients with non-functional digital rays that globally affect the function of the other fingers and the hand. The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional, emotional and social adaptation of pediatric patients sub-mitted to digital ray resection. Materials and Methods: Observational retrospective study of pediatric patients submitted to digital resection in between 2016-2022, following trauma. Minimum post-operative follow-up:10 months. Demographic data, loca-tion and surgical procedure were registered. Functional outcome (QuickDASH), social integration and emotional profile (PEDSQL) were assessed. Results: Four patients were included, median age 12.5 years (min:3;max:16), female predominance (75%, n = 3) and median follow-up of 15 months (min: 10; max: 66). Cause of injury: power wood splitter (n = 2), industrial bread machine (n = 1), electrocussion (n = 1). Right side was the most commonly affected (75%, n = 3) and second ray the most commonly resected (n = 3). All patients had at least one attempt at digital revascularization previous to ray resection. In 3 patients, there was an early digital ischemia after revascularization, which led to subsequent 2 nd ray resection in 2 patients and MCP disarticulation of the 4th finger in another. In the patient in whom revascu- larization of the second digit was effective, there were significant sequels which led to second ray resection. For second ray resection, a flap was performed recreating the 1st interdigital space and for the 4 th ray resection a transposition of the 5th to the 4th ray was performed and an arthrodesis of the PIP and DIP of the 3 rd finger added for better balance and function of the hand. A median QuickDASH score of 13 (min: 11, max: 18), 100) were registered. Ray resection in children is a useful tech- nique in selected cases and despite having a relevant social and aesthetic impact it provides a good functional outcome and psychosocial adaptation. E-POSTERS EP-98 Unplanned Staged Posterior Spinal Fusion Kenneth Illingworth1, 1Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States Introduction/Objective: Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) are often medically complex with severe 208 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics 17(1S) curves. Despite their complexity, surgeons often attempt one-stage procedures to address their spinal deformity. However, staged posterior spine fusion (PSF) can be a necessary intra-operative decision when there are patient safety concerns. We hypothesize that despite the need for an unplanned two-stage procedure, patients will have similar outcomes. Materials/Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive NMS patients undergoing PSF at a tertiary pediatric hospital between 2004 and 2019. Patients with history of prior spinal surgery, absent baseline neuromonitoring signals or planned two stage procedures were excluded. Postoperative compli-cations were collected. Two groups were compared, a one-stage PSF group and an unplanned two-stage PSF group. Results: 12 (4.9%) of 243 NMS patients had an unplanned two-stage PSF. Reasons for aborting surgery prior to com-pletion were change in intra-operative neuromonitoring signals (n = 5), significant blood loss (n = 6) and anaphy- laxis (n = 1). 231 (95.1%) of patients underwent a one- stage procedure. The average pre-operative Cobb angle was larger in the two-stage group, 26.5\u00b0 vs. one-stage group (p = 0.0017). There was a trend toward greater percent Cobb correction in the one-stage group, 81.9% vs. 63.4% for the two-stage group, though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2290). There was a similar complication rate in both groups (p = 0.710), with 3/12 patients in the two-stage group (25%) having complications compared to 41/231 (17.7%) in the one-stage group (p = 0.459). Complications included infection, wound dehiscence, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) and instrumentation revision (Table 1). Conclusions: The overall rate of unplanned staged PSF in NMS was low at 4.9%. There was no significant increase in complications with an unplanned two-staged PSF in NMS, providing reassurance that a two-staged PSF can be implemented without increasing complications when there are intraoperative concerns about patient safety. E-POSTERS EP-99 Evaluation of Alternate X-rays to Reduce Hip Surveillance Imaging in Children with Cerebral Palsy Stacey Miller1, Ceilidh Children's Hospital / The University of British Columbia), Vancouver, Canada 2British Columbia Children's Hospital), Vancouver, CanadaIntro and Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate hip positioning in alternate x-rays and whether migration per - centage (MP) measured is consistent with MP measured on AP pelvis radiographs. Materials and Methods: Radiographic data, including MP and acceptability of the imaging, as measured by degree of hip adduction/abduction from neutral and inter - foraminal ratio (IFR), were exported from our province's hip surveillance database. Alternate x-rays were included if an AP pelvis radiograph was taken before or after the alternate image. Results: Fifty alternate x-rays were reviewed: 34 abdomi- nal, 8 hips to ankles, and 8 scoliosis images. Images were from children at GMFCS levels I to V (1, 7, 3, 11, 28) and mean age of 9yrs,0mo (SD 4.0). There were 73 pairs x-rays for comparison. Hip abd/adduction was categorized as acceptable or borderline ( 12 degrees from neutral) in 49% of the alternate and 80% of AP pelvis x-rays; it could not be assessed in 26% of alternate x-rays and 3% of AP pelvis x-rays. IFR was acceptable (0.5-2.0) in 80% of alter - native and 97% of AP pelvis radiographs; IFR could not be measured in 12% of alternate x-rays and < 1% AP pelvis x-rays. The overall mean difference for MPs was -0.26 (SD 7.27) and did not differ by GMFCS or time between images. Bland Altman analysis found a mean difference of -0.26% (95% CI = -1.4, 0.9) with lower and upper limits of agree- ment being - 14.5% (-16.5, -12.5) Conclusions: Positioning of non-AP pelvis radiographs was acceptable less than 50% of the time but MP values were consistent between the x-rays. Limits of agreement suggest not all images provide accurate measures of MP. Alternate radiographs can be appropriate for monitoring hip displacement while reducing lifetime radiation expo-sure and decreasing caregiver burden associated with repeated imaging. E-POSTERS EP-100 The Lifetime Risk of Radiation-Induced Malignancy in Paediatric Cerebral Palsy Patients is Not Trivial: A Retrospective Cohort Study Bejaan Jivraj 1, Children's / The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada 2Center for Hip Health and Mobility / University of British Columbia, Vancouver, CanadaEPOS Abstract Book 209 3Newcastle University Biosciences Institute, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom 4University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom Introduction and Objective: The study investigated the overall radiation exposure and lifetime risk of radiation induced malignancy in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and its relation to Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) level. Materials and Methods: 45 pediatric CP patients were included in our retrospective study, nine from each GMFCS level. The mean follow-up was 17 years. Effective doses (EDs) were calculated using cohort-based conver - sion coefficients and literature data. Health Protection Agency standards were used to derive the estimated life-time risk of malignancy (ELRM) from cumulative EDs. Results: A mean of 35 radiating films per patient (inter - quartile range 15-55) were identified. The mean cumulative ED was 12.49 mSv (range 0.09-48.83 mSv) with a median ELRM (interquartile range of 0.02%-0.15%). As a result, 51% of patients (n = 23) had a \"moderate\" lifetime risk of developing radiation related malignancy, 36% (n = 16) had a \"low\" risk, and 13% (n = 6) had a \"very low risk\". No patients had a \"minimal\" or \"negligible\" lifetime risk. There were increased odds of having a higher radia-tion exposure for each increase in GMFCS (OR 1.40, 95% CIs 0.93-2.14). Plain film radiographs for total ED, computed tomography (CT) scans for contrast for nuclear medi-cine for 4%. Pelvic and spine radiographs were the largest contributors for radiographic ED while CT head and pelvis were the largest contributors from CT scans. Conclusion: The lifetime attributable risk of radiation- induced malignancy in children with CP was neither negli-gible nor minimal. There was a non-significant trend towards higher radiation exposures with greater gross motor functional impairment. This finding raises an impor - tant question of whether children with CP are being over - exposed to radiation. Clinicians and surgeons should consider re-evaluating their threshold for imaging in this patient population. E-POSTERS EP-101 How well does physical examination predict radiographic hip displacement in children with Cerebral Palsy?Unni Narayanan1, Kerr Graham3, Hip Outcom Investigator Group7 1The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada 2Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand 3Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia 4British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada 5Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, United States 6Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, United States 7International Multiple Institutions, Toronto, Canada Introduction/Objective: Hip surveillance programs for CP recommend standardized radiographs because physical examination is believed to be an unreliable predictor of hip displacement. This study evaluates whether physical examination (PE) of the hip can rule out or predict a clini-cally significant hip displacement (MP30%). Materials and Methods: 622 non-ambulant children with CP (GMFCS IV/V) enrolled prospectively in the interna-tional CP Hip Outcomes Project (CHOP) were evaluated at baseline for range of motion (ROM: R1 and R2) of hip abduction with hips and knees flexed; hip abduction with hips and knees extended; hip flexion contracture; and pop-liteal angles. ROM assessments were correlated with the respective migration percentages(MP) of each hip mea-sured from the standardized AP radiograph of the pelvis, using linear regression, with analysis conducted for each side. Receiver operating curves were created for each spe-cific ROM with area under the curve (AUC) reported to quantify the power of each test to predict MP 30%. Results: Mean(range) age was 6.9 yrs (2-18yrs); mean MP was 58% (0%-100%) on each side. There was a non-linear relationship between hip abduction R1 and R2 and MP. ROM > 30\u00b0 had little correlation with the MP. When hip abduction was < 25\u00b0, there was a stronger negative corre- lation between ROM and increasing MP. (Fig.1) However, the predictive value was poor with an AUC of 54% to 59% respectively, for hip abduction both with knees flexed or extended. (Fig.2) Conclusion: This study confirms empirically in a large prospective data set, that PE based on hip ROM is a poor predictor of hip displacement, justifying the rationale of radiographs for hip surveillance programs. ROM might be useful to inform indications for specific interventions such as local spasticity management or muscle contracture releases based on type and magnitude of contractures, but PE should not be used to predict hip displacement.210 Journal of Children's Orthopaedics "}
