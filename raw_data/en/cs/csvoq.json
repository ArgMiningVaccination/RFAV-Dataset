It provides the body with an active protection against viruses, bacteria and infections and represents the deepest principle of immunity of all human bodily tissues. Its weakening caused by excessive stress, psychological imbalance, negative emotions, accumulation of toxic waste in the digestive tract, metabolic disorders, improper diet, and unhealthy lifestyle.

Use How to use Ayurvedic teas To serve as a remedy to enhance physical and mental functions, the Himalayan herbs are traditionally boiled for 3 - 5 minutes. Such decoction has a stronger effect, milder taste and positive influence upon our digestion, that enables proper assimilation of health-promoting extracts of the Himalayan herbs. The teas are drunk as a part of daily drinking regime for the period of duration of health disorders. When undertaking herbal therapy, the tea can be used for a period of 1 to 3 months in accordance with a daily dosage indicated on the particular label. Allow one-week pause after finishing each tea box. We recommend using a maximum of two kinds of teas at the same time. For reducing symptoms of common ailments, more of the teas can be switched in daily or weekly periods. Such being the case, teas are drunk separately with one-hour interval. When drinking as a preventive, stimulating or supportive remedy, herb infusion is sufficient with unlimited period of use. For stronger health effectivity, teas are used warm before meal. The specific taste of each tea is a part of its therapeutic effect and corresponds to the Ayurvedic properties of six tastes. Thus, any kind of sweetener is not recommended. How to use Ayurvedic elixirs Ayurvedic herbal elixirs enhance nutrition of the bodily tissues (dhatus) and purification of bodily systems (srotamsi). They are part of the rejuvenating and revitalising therapy for body and mind (rasajana). Traditionally they are used with a cup of warm milk or water, commonly used in the Ayurvedic medicine as a medium or environment (anupama) for preparation, use, direction and better assimilation of the health effects of the herbal supplements. Other mediums that increase therapeutic functioning of herbs (vehikula) include honey, cane or raw syrup, clarified butter (ghee) or oil. We recommend using maximum of two herbal elixirs at the same time. More elixirs can be switched in a day or week period in case we use them for normalising common symptoms of distorted balance of body or mind. For their optimal effect use only one elixir at a time before meal allowing one-hour time gap. For more complex therapy for body and mind restoration, elixirs should be used for a longer period of the Ayurvedic treatments from 1 to 3 months following dosage indicated on the label. Specific taste of each elixir represents part of its therapeutic functioning and corresponds to the Ayurvedic properties of six tastes. For its sattvic properties, the Ayurvedic medicinal system recognises lukewarm or boiled milk as a common ingredient of health recipes. It decreases the heat of Pitta dosha and calms down turbulent emotions. It is also a substantial nourishment and a healthy tonic for people with predominant Vata dosha. The milk enhances formation of life-force ojas which is the essence of the healthy immune system connected with efficient presence of Kapha dosha. People with sensitive digestion or slow metabolism can suffer from digestive disorders after milk consumption. Being such case, put a little of ginger, clove, cardamom, cinnamon or nutmeg into the milk for improvement of the digestive fire. Organic milk is always preferable. Dietary supplement. Keep out of reach of children. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Do not use as a substitute for a balanced diet. Store in a dry place under 25\u00b0C.

She wakes at night in pain, but nothing helps her. After she tried your tea (VYANA) she feels much better. Thanks for her.VYANA I would like to share my experience with DHATAKI tea for heavy menstruation. This tea helped me a lot for the incredibly severe pain and cramps that I had during every single period of menstruation and for which I often had to stay at home lying down. Nothing helped me, I tried many drugs and teas, but my body reacted to everything by refusing it and it was even worse. This tea is the only one that helped me. I drink it a few days before menstruation and also on the first day of heavy menstruation, my pain is only light and I can function normally. I recommend it to all women who have such problems.DHATAKI Thanks for the VATA tea. Satisfied. These herbs really work. Greetings and thank you.VATA Hello, I definitely recommend trying smoothies with hot drink mixtures! They are a wonderful helper in detoxification procedures. I am grateful that these products are available and I believe that more people will discover their potential! I am 50 years old and I am in perimenopause. I have noticed menstrual changes accompanied by some physical and sometimes emotional discomfort. I started drinking ASHOKA tea and I feel better and more balanced because menstruation, although irregular, now flows more naturally and with fewer additional symptoms. I also experience less mood swings. I am very grateful for that!ASHOKA Hello. I am very happy with your teas. I have tried several of them and all of them were super.
