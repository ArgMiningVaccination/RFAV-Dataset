The onset and spread of COVID-19 tested our hearts and minds as never before, all against a backdrop of national social, political and economic turmoil. Each day, we've learned more about this new virus and how to treat it. We've also learned that the pandemic's impact is falling drastically harder on communities already struggling against economic and social disadvantages. Throughout this crisis, our medical professionals and staff have been compassionate and expert while caring for patients inside our walls, and innovative in creating ways to provide virtual care. They've risen magnificently to the challenge of keeping our facilities safe and sanitized. And many throughout our system have been working hard in a wide range of programs to help our communities stay healthier and to eliminate healthcare disparities. At Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton, our \"Farm to Family\" program addressed food insecurity in our community, which has worsened during the pandemic. The partnership between RWJUH Hamilton community health educators, Snipes Farm and the CYO/Bromley Center helps children and families experiencing significant financial distress by providing weekly shares of fresh produce. Community Education programming continues in the virtual space with robust offerings of health and wellness programs for all ages, which can be enjoyed online and on the phone. RWJUH Hamilton remains committed to your health and wellness. At RWJBarnabas Health, we've learned something else this year: how strong and encouraging the communities we serve are. We can never thank you enough for your ongoing generosity. While we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic together, we want you to be as healthy and strong as you can, and we pledge to do everything possible to help you achieve that goal.

Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 7 RWJUHH_Cal_Winter21_final.indd 7 12/10/20 9:14 AMA HEART-HEALTHY EATING PLAN A DIETITIAN EXPLAINS HOW SIMPLE TWEAKS CAN SLASH YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASE. ASK THE EXPERT Q&A February is American Heart Month, which is focused on eradicating heart disease and stroke. So, there's no better time to take stock of your own cardiovascular health. One key component of a healthy heart is, of course, your diet. Here, Alyssa Luning, RD, CSOWM, a dietitian who's board-certifi ed in obesity and weight management at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton, shares her best advice on how to eat for better cardiovascular health. What are the components of a heart-healthy diet? It should include a healthy dose of fiber (at least 30 grams for most people), which is found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, beans and peas. Aim to eat at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily. (A serving is equivalent to the size of your fist or a closed hand.) Fiber helps to improve blood cholesterol levels. In addition, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting your sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams per day. It's also important to limit your consumption of saturated fat. This can be found in red meat and dairy products; tropical oils (palm and coconut, for instance); and ultra-processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, ice cream, pizza and bacon. Avoid foods that contain trans fats, which are found in shelf-stable baked goods, crackers and margarine. Look for the words \"partially hydrogenated\" on food labels. What are some common misconceptions about heart-healthy foods? People may think that if they don't add any salt to their food, they're eating a low-sodium diet. Th e problem is that many foods contain a surprisingly high amount of sodium. Th e AHA has bundled them together as \"the salty six\": breads and rolls, pizza, sandwiches, cold cuts/processed meats, soup and burritos/tacos. What are some examples of heart- healthy snacks? If you're craving something salty, try making your own microwave popcorn. Combine 1 tsp oil and 1/4 cup popcorn kernels in a brown paper bag. Fold it shut and microwave for about 2 to 6 minutes. Even if you add a pinch of salt, the popcorn will still have less sodium and trans fat than the prepackaged variety. If you're craving sweets, don't hesitate to reach for a piece of fruit. In a study of more than 7,000 people at risk of cardiovascular disease, those who consumed higher amounts of fruit or fiber had a 41 percent lower risk of dying. Are there any apps that can help people size up the nutritional value of foods? I like MyFitnessPal and Fooducate. They let you pull up nutrition information and give you alternatives, as needed, to enhance your smart, heart-healthy lifestyle. Your heart doesn't beat just for you. Get it checked.

However, some people are not symptomatic until they are exercising.\" Th ink of the heart as an engine, he sugg ests. \"You can only get so much information when the engine is at rest; to really see how it's working, you have to rev it up and take it for a drive. A stress test lets us see how the heart acts and how blood fl ows through the body while it's moving.\"MONITORING YOUR HEART WHILE YOU EXERCISE IS SAFE AND CAN GIVE YOUR DOCTORS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. SHARAN MAHAL, MD CARDIAC STRESS TESTS THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STRESS TESTS. Th e most common is the exercise stress test as described in \"What Happens During an Exercise Stress Test?\" above. Depending on your risk factors, your physician may prescribe a nuclear stress test, which is the same as an exercise stress test, except that a safe radioactive dye is injected and an imaging machine is used to take pictures. If for some reason you can't handle the physical activity of a stress test, your doctor can prescribe a medication that will mimic the eff ects of exercise.THERE'S NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF A STRESS TEST. \"It's a simple, cost-eff ective and low-risk procedure,\" says Dr. Mahal. \"You'll be carefully monitored the whole time, and if there's any problem at all\u2014which only about one in 10,000 patients will experience\u2014be reassured that your cardiologist is prepared and will be able to take care of you.\"STRESS TESTS ARE PRESCRIBED WHEN SYMPTOMS EXIST. Unlike a colonoscopy or mammography, there's no recommended age for a person to begin having stress tests. \"People need a stress test if they're having symptoms, usually chest pain or shortness of breath with activity, or unexplained passing out,\" says Dr. Mahal. \"In the absence of symptoms, you might also want to do a stress test if a patient has a family history of cardiac disease, or as a precautionary measure if a patient who has been sedentary wants to start an exercise program.\" CARDIAC FAST FACTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS DURING AN EXERCISE STRESS TEST? Most stress tests are done in a cardiologist's of ce. Patients should wear comfortable clothes and refrain from eating or smoking for four hours in advance. The patient is connected to heart- monitoring equipment, then walks on a treadmill under the supervision of a doctor or healthcare professional. At rst, the pace is a gentle 1.7 miles per hour. The pace will gradually be increased to a brisk walk or light jog. At the same time, the incline of the treadmill is increased by two degrees every three minutes. It begins at 10 degrees and progresses to 16 degrees. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure and breathing are monitored throughout the test, which can last up to 15 minutes. The patient can stop at any time if needed. After the stress test, the patient will be observed for ve minutes during cooldown. Your heart doesn't beat just for you. Get it checked.

Among those treatments are advanced and complex surgeries, some of which are only available at Rutgers Surgery has been a mainstay of cancer treatment for millennia\u2014in fact, the use of surgery to treat cancer appears in Egyptian papyri dating back as far as 2500 BC. Today, medical breakthroughs have opened exciting new possibilities for the successful surgical treatment of cancer. As critical as surgical advances are, however, they're most eff ective when they're part of a continuum of cancer care, says H.

These are minimally invasive and very precise, and are performed with the most up-to-date technology on the market. HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) surgery, used for cancers that have spread to the abdominal cavity. This treatment strategy involves the surgical removal of metastatic cancer, followed by heated chemotherapy given within the abdominal cavity, which is designed to obliterate the remaining invisible cancer cells that may be present in the tissues. Preventive, or prophylactic, surgery, in which sophisticated testing and analysis is used to identify high-risk patients and remove an organ or gland before cancer can develop. This may be recommended for people at risk of developing breast, colon, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, thyroid and many other types of cancer. Experience counts when it comes to cancer surgery. \"There's a large body of literature showing a relationship between the volume of operative procedures done and how successful the outcomes are,\" says Dr. Alexander. \"The more experience surgeons and hospitals have, the better patients do in terms of a shorter length of stay, fewer complications and the return to a normal life more quickly. \"That's something we do especially well at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health,\" he says. \"We have the experience and technology to recognize potential complications early on and intervene as necessary.\" NEXT STEPS When a patient is told that cancer surgery is needed, how should he or she decide what to do next? The first step, says Dr. Alexander, is to do further research. \"Every doctor wants the best outcome for their patients, and no doctor should object to a patient asking for a referral for another opinion,\" he says. Patients also have the option of calling the RWJBH Oncology Access Center at 844.CANCERNJ (844.226.2376). \"The call will be taken by a specialist who is trained to gather information about the patient and identify the appropriate experts to evaluate and potentially provide treatment for them,\" explains Dr. Alexander. Be sure to consider the continuum of care in the place where you will receive treatment. \"Treatment that is fragmented, or administered in different locations without proper coordination, becomes more challenging,\" he says. \"To me, it's always best for a patient to get cancer treatment from a multidisciplinary team of specialists who have good communication and coordination, from diagnosis through treatment, discharge and survivorship.\" To help keep communication flowing smoothly among all experts treating a cancer patient at RWJBH facilities and Rutgers Cancer Institute, an oncology nurse navigator assists each patient throughout the cancer journey. \"When it comes to cancer treatment, patients shouldn't move forward until they're absolutely certain the best care plan has been presented to them,\" says Dr. Alexander. \"We're uniquely positioned to provide that plan through the partnership between Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health.\"CANCER CAN'T WAIT Because of the pandemic, cancer patients may have concerns about scheduling surgery. However, cancer care shouldn't be delayed. Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health facilities have taken every precaution to keep patients, visitors and care-team members safe, including: COVID-19 screening and testing of all patients and staff prior to working in an operating room or being involved in a surgical procedure Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices in recovery room spaces, frequently touched surfaces, exam rooms and terminals.

Here, she explains what patients should know. What is a hospitalist? A hospitalist is usually an internal medicine-trained physician who has undergone a residency training and is dedicated to and skilled at inpatient care. Whether a patient is admitted to the hospital from the Emergency Department or as part of a planned admission, the hospitalist will manage that patient's care during the time the patient is in the hospital. How does the hospitalist manage a patient's care? Th e hospitalist will see the patient every day during the hospital stay, sometimes more than once. In addition to evaluating the patient, they will spend a large amount of time coordinating their care. Th is means making sure all consultants and specialists are on the same page, keeping the primary care physician in the loop and If you're admitted to a hospital, you'll be cared for by a specialist physician known as a hospitalist. Though the specialty has been growing fast for more than 20 years, many patients and family members may not be familiar with what a hospitalist does. Maninder \"Dolly\" Abraham, MD, has been a WHAT A HOSPITALIST CAN DO FOR YOU MANINDER ABRAHAM, MD Healthy Together | 12 | Winter 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 System_Hospitalist_Winter21_Final.indd 12 12/9/20 3:18 PMcommunicating with nurses, social workers, case managers and discharge planners, as well as the patient's family. Schedules are usually in blocks of days to ensure continuity of care for patients. Why doesn't a patient's \"regular doctor\" see him or her in the hospital? As medicine has evolved, primary care doctors need to dedicate more time to seeing patients in an outpatient setting. In addition, as treatments have become more sophisticated, doctors are able to treat more patients on an outpatient basis. As a result, patients who are admitted to the hospital these days tend to be those who are very sick. They require a lot of time and attention, which hospitalists are able to provide. Primary care providers entrust their patients to us. We become an extension of that primary care physician. How does a hospitalist get up to speed on a patient's history and condition? There is a steep learning curve on day one. The primary care or referring physician sends over a patient's file and has a phone conversation with the hospitalist. At the first encounter with the patient, the hospitalist will do a detailed history and physical exam on the patient, getting to know him or her as well as possible. Electronic sharing of medical records has made this process much easier and faster. We have access to the patient's history and to all the doctors involved. In addition, we have HIPAA-compliant, secure text messaging, so we can communicate with other physicians efficiently. How does a hospitalist communicate with the patient's family members? Hospitalists spend a lot of time talking with patients and family members. We train new hospitalists on how to talk with them in layman's terms and not use medical jargon. We ask families to designate one person to be our contact, and we make every effort to communicate with the patient's family every day. What advantages does a hospitalist have when it comes to treating a patient? Hospitalists have broad knowledge of most illnesses and how to manage cases, including surgery patients, diabetes and cancer patients and more. We are specialists in inpatient care. We organize care throughout the hospital. We're there to order tests, track the results and order follow-up tests promptly. We can clear a patient for surgery and manage him or her post-operatively. We're also available to explain test results to patients and family members and respond to any medical crises. Then, at discharge time, we have all the tools needed for a smooth handoff to the next step of the healthcare plan. A hospitalist is like a star quarterback who knows how to call the plays and navigate you through the system to get you home as quickly as possible.FAST FACTS ABOUT HOSPITALISTS To find a physician at an RWJBarnabas Health facility, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/doctors.Sources: Staffcare.com, Society of Hospital Medicine1996 IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW FIELD The term \"hospitalist\" was coined in 1996.60,000 IT'S GROWING FAST More than 60,000 physicians practice hospital medicine, up from just a few hundred 20 years ago.30%/20% THEY SAVE TIME AND MONEY Studies show that hospitalists can reduce patient lengths of stay by up to 30 percent and reduce hospital costs by up to 20 percent.March 4 NATIONAL HOSPITALIST DAY is held on the first Thursday in March every year (this year, March 4). \"A HOSPITALIST IS LIKE A STAR QUARTERBACK WHO KNOWS HOW TO CALL THE PLAYS AND NAVIGATE YOU THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO GET YOU HOME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.\" Healthy Together | 12 | Winter 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 System_Hospitalist_Winter21_Final.indd 13 12/9/20 3:18 PMDo old age and depression go together\u2014especially in a pandemic? We asked two people who know: Jessica Israel, MD, Senior Vice President, Geriatrics and Palliative Care, at RWJBarnabas Health, and Frank Ghinassi, PhD, ABPP, Senior Vice President of Behavioral Health and Addictions at RWJBarnabas Health and President and Chief Executive Officer of Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care. Many people expect older adults to be depressed, or at least unhappy. Is that fair? DR. GHINASSI: Seniors get a bad rap about that. In fact, the age 40 to age 58 group is more likely to be prone to depression. For every older person who is strugg ling, there are probably seven or eight who are doing very well as they transition to the later stages of their career and life. DR. ISRAEL : Th at expectation is a stereotype and needs to change. In fact, chances are that someone who has had 80 years to develop strategies to deal with stresses in life is, in many ways, better at coping than a younger person. How does social isolation affect seniors? DR. ISRAEL: In my experience, people of any age who were already prone to depression have seen their symptoms magnifi ed since the pandemic began.

I would say that a signifi cant number of my patients were able to stay safe at home and fi nd new resources to help them stay connected, although some of them needed extra help to fi nd those connections and services. DR. GHINASSI : Th e folks we worry most about have a troubling package of circumstances\u2014for example, they live alone, their children have moved away or they never had children, friends are beginning to die off , or they've moved to a community where they don't have an existing network. Some may begin to show cognitive decline. If that's combined with a history of depression or anxiety, that's when we get most concerned. What are signs of depression? DR. GHINASSI: At any age, changes in baseline behavior are concerning: somebody who had a good sense of humor no longer laughs, somebody who had a healthy appetite isn't eating, somebody who was a good sleeper now has sleep disturbances. Have they stopped doing things they enjoy? Are they saying things like, \"What's the point of going on?\" DR. ISRAEL : Th ese days, it may be harder to pinpoint these changes because people have less contact with other people\u2014they haven't been going to the gym, or they no longer get together with their knitting circle. How can loved ones help? DR. ISRAEL: It's so important to reach out to someone who may be isolated and depressed\u2014to learn more about the situation surrounding the person, and what's happening inside that situation. If you see signs of depression, know that it's treatable. Th e fi rst step, the critical one, is to reach out. DR. GHINASSI: Th is is the time to connect with seniors more frequently than usual. Options range from phone and video calls to screen porch visits and talking through windows\u2014even providing iPads. Visual contact can be a godsend for both the senior and his or her family.

KEEP TO A CONSISTENT ROUTINE. Studies show that a regular daily routine, especially a consistent pattern of sleeping and waking, has distinct bene ts for mental health. Create new routines for daily and weekly activities, including time for self-care, such as exercise or meditation. SPEND TIME WITH CRAFTS AND HOBBIES. People who take part in creative activities feel higher levels of positive emotion, according to recent studies. Creativity includes not only hobbies such as drawing, knitting or woodworking, but even simple activities like coloring or keeping a diary. TAKE A DAILY WALK. Walking helps maintain a healthy weight, improves heart health and elevates your mood by increasing your body's levels of endorphins, the feel-good hormones. If you can get outside, so much the better: Numerous studies have shown that time in nature is an antidote for stress. If weather or slippery conditions prevent going outside, put on your sneakers, put on some music and walk in place at home. READ BOOKS. Reading books reduces stress, decreases blood pressure and lowers heart rate. Reading actually strengthens the brain by promoting the development of neurons. Moreover, studies show that reading ction books increases the ability to empathize. If you use an e-reader, turn to a print book at bedtime. The blue light from screens can interfere with sleep. LISTEN TO PODCASTS. Podcasts are mini-radio shows created on every topic you can imagine, and they're available free online or through apps for iPhone or Android. A 2016 study found that listening to podcasts activates multiple parts of the brain and can soothe, excite or make you laugh. LISTEN TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC. Music is an effective form of mood regulation, helping us to calm down, feel pleasure or even indulge in a good cry. One study found that adults with chronic osteoarthritis who listened to music daily for two weeks reported less pain. KEEP AND BUILD YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK. A range of studies has shown that meaningful social connections increase longevity and feelings of well-being. Stay connected by reaching out to friends and family, whether it's via your phone or laptop, or the \"old-fashioned\" pen-and-paper way. SPEND TIME WITH CRAFTS AND HOBBIES. TAKE A DAILY WALK.

Jennifer Fecowycz was only 13 weeks pregnant when she learned her baby wasn't developing normally in utero. Doctors could see that he wasn't bending at his wrists, knees, ankles or elbows, and diagnosed a rare condition called arthrogryposis\u2014a congenital joint contracture (stiff ness) in two or more areas of the body. When Jen's baby, Oscar, was born he faced a myriad of complications: club feet, hyperextended knees and elbows, and wrists that hooked under the wrong way. All necessary healthcare services, including surgery and casting, began right aft er birth. Th en, when he was just six weeks old, he began weekly physical therapy sessions at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in Mountainside. TRUSTING THE PROCESS Because Oscar couldn't bend his elbows, \"tummy time\" to strengthen the neck was very diffi cult. Nighttime splints were needed to increase the ability of his arms to bend. He had casts on his legs from the age of fi ve weeks to six months, which made rolling over a big challenge. Oscar and his therapist Diana Deshefy, PT, DPT, PCS, worked on exercise modifi cations. When the leg casts were removed, Deshefy taught him how to roll over. Deshefy also served as a friend and confi dant to Jen and made sure Oscar's entire care team had the most up-to-date information on his case. \"When Oscar was born, we were told that the only way he'd ever walk would be if we amputated his legs at his knees,\" says Jen. \"Children's Specialized made sure that was a decision we never had to make.\" Because Oscar couldn't bend his knees, physical therapists began by having him stand and put pressure on his legs. \"Th e team at Children's continued to work with us each week, fi guring out where his legs needed the most support and creating bracing options for his unique needs,\" Jen says. Just before Oscar's second birthday, Deshefy helped him take his fi rst independent steps. Today, Oscar is a typical 5-year-old boy who loves to spend time outside hiking, swimming and throwing rocks into the creek. He also enjoys coloring, building with Legos and playing with trucks, cars and dinosaurs. Oscar continues to see Deshefy weekly and interact with all of his friends at CSH. \"My advice for parents going through a similar situation is to take a deep breath, be patient and trust your therapists and the process,\" Jen says. \"It can be overwhelming to hear the therapists set goals for three, six and 12 months and worry that your child isn't going to hit them. But your therapists work with you and your child, adjusting the plan as needed. I'm so grateful to Children's Specialized for all they've done for Oscar and our entire family.\" To learn more about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.childrens-specialized.org.

The group of 30 members under age 40 knew they couldn't have their annual spring fundraiser, the \"All in Good Taste\" beer and wine mixer, which is held at The Boathouse at Mercer Lake. So, they came up with an idea for a new event: a safe and social family movie night. \"We realized we wanted to focus on families,\" says Robert Boka, Chair of the YPG and a partner in a technology software company. \"We thought this would be a great option for the community.\"A REPRIEVE DURING THE PANDEMIC On September 18, 325 people gathered in the outfield of ARM & HAMMER Park, the home of Trenton Thunder Baseball, to watch \"Trolls World Tour.\" Attendees, who paid $30 for individual tickets and $100 for a family of four, received a gift bag that included blankets, popcorn and food truck and water ice vouchers, which were used at one of three food trucks\u2014D&D Catering, Beach Shack and Chill Out Italian Ice. They were required to wear masks and have their temperature checked. \"It was a reprieve in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" says Brian Hartmann, former YPG Chair, chair of the movie night and a certified financial planner at Knox Grove Financial in Pennington. \"We were able to get out with the kids and enjoy ourselves.\" The group honored Kacie Hurley, a longtime YPG member and Business Development Executive at Withum, as the \"Young Professional of the Year.\" \"It was an easy decision,\" says Hartmann. \"She's admired professionally and for her community work.\" Also honored was Ritchie & Page Distributing Company, Inc. as Corporate Honoree for its commitment to the community. The event, which raised more than $30,000, helped the YPG complete a three-year, $150,000 pledge that it made to the Cancer Center. \"To have raised that amount of money during a pandemic is pretty incredible,\" says Boka. The event was so successful that the group plans to hold another movie night next year around the same time. It won't replace \"All in Good Taste,\" which will be held this spring. Community members enjoyed a socially distanced movie night.

A TALE OF THREE SPINE SURGERIES Denise and Michael Newkirk are able to enjoy quality time with their grandchildren now that they've regained their mobility. Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 19 Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2021 RWJUHH_SpineSurgery_Winter21_final.indd 18 12/10/20 9:21 AMOne day in 2018, Denise Newkirk of Hamilton picked up her 1-year-old granddaughter and felt sharp, burning pain in both legs. \"I couldn't move for a week,\" recalls the 55-year-old nurse. \"I couldn't twist from right to left or get out of a chair.\" When she became more mobile, she had trouble walking, standing and lifting. She and her husband, Michael, have an RV, and they are typically on the road for seven months each year. Every 28 days, they move to a new campsite. \"I lift supplies, firewood and equipment to set up our campsites,\" says Denise. As a result of her back pain, the couple was forced to stop traveling. REGAINING MOBILITY Denise's daughter had had spine surgery several years earlier, so Denise made an appointment with her surgeon, Marc J. Levine, MD, Director of Orthopedic Spine Surgery at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton and Clinical Assistant Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. An X-ray and MRI revealed that Denise had lumbar stenosis, in which the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on nerves. She also had spondylolisthesis, in which a spinal bone slips forward, causing pain. Dr. Levine recommended a minimally invasive spinal fusion, in which two or more spinal bones are connected, to stabilize her lower back. \"I had confidence in him because he operated on my daughter,\" says Denise, who was reluctant to have the operation. \"But he never pressured me to have the surgery. He always said, 'Let me know when you're ready.'\" Dr. Levine prescribed physical therapy and pain medication, but Denise didn't experience much relief. She put off the surgery until October 2018, when she couldn't cope with the pain any longer. To improve her chances of a quick recovery, Dr. Levine used a minimally invasive technique to go through Denise's side rather than the front or back of her body. \"There was no blood loss or damage to her back muscles or spinal canal,\" says Dr. Levine. \"This surgical approach also reduces the risk of infection.\" Denise did well and resumed her usual activities. Then, in April 2019, Denise was in a car accident and suffered a neck injury, which caused tingling and numbness in both of her arms. She saw Dr. Levine, who recommended surgery, which included fusing two spinal segments in her neck. \"It was a fast recovery,\" says Denise, who wore a neck brace afterward but didn't need physical therapy. \"I feel much better. The tingling in my arms has stopped, and I can pick up my grandkids now.\" Denise and Michael babysit their grandchildren two nights per week. RELIEF AFTER 15 YEARS OF PAIN Michael, a former nursing technician at a psychiatric hospital, was injured at work in 2004. He suffered a perforated eardrum, a torn rotator cuff and a herniated disc in his neck. He had surgery to reconstruct his ear and repair his shoulder, but he put off the neck surgery. \"I was told that surgery might not improve the pain,\" he says. The neck injury caused pain in both arms, although it was worse in the left arm. \"The pain would cause my arm to 'jump' at night,\" he says. \"I had trouble lifting things, and I would drop things\u2014even something light, like a plate of food.\" Denise took over driving the RV, but the tingling in Michael's arm and fingers was so uncomfortable that the couple would have to pull over at rest stops so he could take pain medication. After Denise had her surgeries, Michael, 64, decided it was time to do something about his neck. \"I was tired of taking medication,\" he says. Michael saw Dr. Levine, who recommended a time-tested procedure called a cervical decompression and fusion. In October 2019, Dr. Levine removed the damaged spinal discs in Michael's neck; inserted an implant to increase the space between two spinal bones, reducing pressure on the nerves; and covered the bones with a plate. \"Michael did well,\" he says. \"He wished he'd had the operation sooner.\" Michael wore a neck brace for six weeks. After he took it off, it was like he had a \"new neck,\" he says. \"There was no pain and no tingling.\" Michael didn't need physical therapy, but he does perform exercises, such as stretches and \"mini push-ups,\" to strengthen his neck muscles. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented Michael and Denise from resuming their road trips. As soon as it's safe to do so, they will pack up their RV. Says Denise: \"We're ready to hit the road.\" STATE-OF-THE-ART CARE At Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton, orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, radiologists, physical therapists and nurses collaborate to care for patients with back and neck conditions. \"All of our services are under one roof,\" says Marc J. Levine, MD, Director of Orthopedic Spine Surgery and Clinical Assistant Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In addition, the hospital's physicians perform research and organize national spine meetings. \"We want to use new technologies to deliver the safest and most effective surgical solutions,\" says Dr. Levine.

In addition, a disinfection robot is used for cleaning. A COMMITMENT TO SAFETY Healthy Together | 20 | Winter 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 21 RWJUHH_InfectionPrevent_Winter21_final.indd 20 12/10/20 9:24 AMAT RWJUH HAMILTON, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS USE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF INFECTION. Safety has always been at the forefront of patient care at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck last spring, staff members took routine precautions up a notch. \"We implemented additional safety measures to ensure the well-being of our patients and staff,\" says Anne Dikon, BSN, RN, CIC, Director of Infection Prevention. \"We had to stay abreast of what was happening outside Hamilton so we could decide how to move forward inside Hamilton.\" Dikon follows guidance from the New Jersey Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the early weeks of the pandemic, visitors and vendors were not permitted to enter the hospital; temperature, symptom and travel history screenings were taken; and elective surgeries were temporarily halted. Hand sanitizer was made available in all patient and staff areas. In addition, hand hygiene guidelines, which are in line with the CDC's recommendations, were (and still are) strictly enforced. They include using an alcohol-based hand rub or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after touching a patient and immediately after removing personal protective equipment. Dikon worked closely with hospital staff members to ensure they have the tools they need to safely care for patients, including personal protective equipment, such as masks and gowns. \"It's been a collaborative effort, and I'm proud of the way our teams have worked together,\" says Dikon. INNOVATIVE CLEANING TECHNOLOGIES The pandemic gave Dikon the opportunity to expand the use of innovative technologies, such as the Tru-D disinfection robot. After a patient room or other clinical area is cleaned, the robot is placed inside the space and activated remotely. Tru-D uses ultraviolet light to disinfect all hard surfaces. The hospital already had one of these robots, which was used to clean rooms occupied by patients with serious infections like C. difficile. Since May, two additional robots were purchased to clean all patient rooms. Recent safety precautions include screening hospital staff members, patients and visitors. Today, everyone who enters the hospital must wear a mask. To facilitate social distancing, the hospital reduced the amount of time patients spend in waiting areas, spaced chairs at least six feet apart, marked floors with tape at appropriate intervals, and kept an eye on the number of patients to avoid crowding. All admitted and surgical patients are tested for COVID-19. In addition, Emergency Department (ED) patients who have flu-like symptoms are tested. Hospitalized patients can connect with loved ones virtually through apps, such as FaceTime. In addition, RWJUH Hamilton continues to offer telemedicine visits for patients who are unable to see their providers in person. NATIONAL RECOGNITION Today, patients can safely have elective surgeries, receive routine screenings like mammograms and come to the ED if they have symptoms of serious conditions, such as a heart attack or stroke. RWJUH Hamilton's commitment to patient safety and best practices was recently recognized with an \"A\" Hospital Safety Grade\u2014the highest patient safety rating\u2014by The Leapfrog Group, an independent national healthcare watchdog organization. This is the ninth time the hospital has received such recognition. Still, Dikon remains vigilant. \"We won't let our guard down,\" she says. \"We want to provide the safest care for our patients and for everyone in our community.\" If you've put off care due to COVID-19, please don't delay it any longer.

Healthy Together | 22 | Winter 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 23 RWJUHH_ColorectalCa_Winter21_final.indd 22 12/10/20 9:31 AMIn November 2019, Melanie Wright had back surgery. A month later, she had her annual mammogram. Th ere was a suspicious fi nding in her left breast, and follow-up scans and a biopsy confi rmed she had ductal in situ, or DCIS, a noninvasive precancer that's confi ned to the milk ducts. At the end of January 2020, she was back in the operating room for a lumpectomy. Even aft er all she'd been through, Melanie, 64, of Trenton, still faced a diffi cult road ahead. Rachana Singh, MD, Melanie's radiation oncologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton, recommended four weeks of radiation treatment, an accelerated schedule that allows patients to return to their lives more quickly. Th e radiation didn't worry Melanie as much as the machine used to deliver it. She had to lie on her stomach on a table so the treating arm of the machine could rotate around her. \"I'm extremely claustrophobic, and I had to lie fl at on my stomach with my head down,\" says Melanie. \"It was very unnerving for me.\" It didn't help that Melanie was still experiencing soreness from her back surgery, making it diffi cult to get on and off the table and remain comfortable during each of the 15-minute treatments. A SOOTHING SOLUTION Melanie was so anxious that she had to take a tranquilizer prior to the first few radiation sessions. But then she discovered a more soothing solution: aromatherapy, which was offered through the hospital's Holistic Program. Thanks to funding from the RWJUH Hamilton Foundation, cancer patients can receive a range of complementary treatments, including Reiki (a hands-on healing technique), meditation, massage, pastoral care, nutrition counseling and art, music and pet therapies, all free of charge. For 30 minutes before each radiation session, Melanie relaxed in a reclining chair with warm blankets and lavender aromatherapy. \"It was a half hour of peace and quiet,\" Melanie says. \"Th e aromatherapy was very calming and relaxing, and it put me in a better frame of mind. It was extremely helpful.\"Th e aromatherapy was so benefi cial that Melanie was able to stop taking a tranquilizer before her treatments and relied only on pain medication for her back. \"Th e aromatherapy gave her time to center herself and get ready for her treatment sessions,\" says Dr. Singh. \"She tolerated the treatment well. By the end, she was so calm.\" Holistic therapies can benefi t patients emotionally and spiritually, says Dr. Singh. \"Very oft en, these specialized services are off ered at bigg er hospitals, so patients have to travel,\" she says. \"Th e stress of travel negates the benefi t. So being able to off er these services at our center has been amazing. We want to help our patients get through treatment in the most stress-free way possible.\" Th e Holistic Program has been in place for more than a decade but has become even more robust in recent years as interest in complementary therapies has grown and doctors are focusing more on treating the mind as well as the body, says Maqsood Amjad, MD, director of medical oncology at the RWJUH Hamilton Cancer Center. \"Th e fi eld of oncology has progressed signifi cantly in the last decade with newer medications, and we are treating the diseases much more eff ectively,\" says Dr. Amjad. \"But we don't always pay attention to the patient as a whole. Th at's why we are looking at pa tients not only in terms of their physical ailment but also what goes on in their mind, their spirit. It's about integrating a holistic approach into our conventional treatment.\" Th e approach has been very successful, and the hospital is continually striving to off er evidence-based holistic therapies that meet patient needs and interests, says Dr. Amjad. STAYING WELL Melanie is now cancer-free, and her only treatment is to take a daily medication that can help prevent a recurrence of her cancer by lowering her estrogen levels for 10 years. She's still doing aromatherapy for relaxation. \"I'm a believer in holistic therapies,\" she says. \"I think they play a big part in helping people get well. Now I do aromatherapy at home with a diff user a couple times a week. I even have one in my car.\" MAQSOOD AMJAD, MD RWJBarnabas Health and RWJBarnabas Health and RWJBarnabas Health and RWJBarnabas Health and Robert Wood Johnson University Robert Wood Johnson University Robert Wood Johnson University Robert Wood Johnson University Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, in partnership Hospital Hamilton, in partnership Hospital Hamilton, in partnership Hospital Hamilton, in partnership Hospital Hamilton, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's Cancer Cancer Center\u2014provide Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014provide Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014provide close-to-home access to the most close-to-home access to the most close-to-home access to the most close-to-home access to the most close-to-home access to the most advanced treatment options.
