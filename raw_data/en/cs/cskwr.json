Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1936. 8th edition, 2020 pp., index, illus. First published in 1885 as Practice of Pharmacy under the pen of Joseph Remington, this textbook has remained the \"bible\" of American pharmacy practice up through its most recent edition (1990). The eighth edition is the last that bridged the character of the old \"Remingtons\" with modern developments.

By \"professional pharmacy\" the authors meant stores \"in which the majority of the business is in prescriptions, and in which only the professional phase is promoted.\" Of the estimated 60,000 drug stores in the USA in 1933, only about 400 met these criteria.

The chapter also contains sketches of several pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of the mid-nineteenth century, especially in the Philadelphia area. Practice of Pharmacy 101 388. Gathercoal, E. N., ed. The Prescription Ingredient Survey. n.p.: American Pharmaceutical Association, 1933. 163 pp. As chairman of the National Formulary Revision Committee, Gathercoal collated seven prescription surveys done between 1885 and 1932, with the purpose of aiding the revision of the NF and the U. S. Pharmacopoeia. The data from the five most detailed surveys is tabulated together alphabetically by proprietary or official title. All told, over 500,000 prescriptions were analyzed. 389. Ginzburg, Isaiah. \"A Pharmacist in Tsarist Russia: A Reminiscence, 1892-1909.\" in History 27 (1985): 139-159. This version of Ginzburg's reminiscences, edited by Cleo Sonnedecker, touches on several aspects of Russian pharmaceutical life and practice. It contains details about daily pharmacy work that could be compared profitably with practices in other nations. 390. Griffenhagen, George. \"The Pharmacy in History.\" Journal of the International College of Surgeons 29 (1958): 789-803. An illustrated introduction to the form and function of the pharmacy from ancient times up to the early twentieth century. 391. Haffner, Gerald O., and William E. Wilson. \"The Medical Inventory of a Pioneer Doctor.\" Indiana Magazine of History 46 (March 1960): 37-63. In 1833 Dr. Andrew Rodgers of Charlestown, Indiana, died, and an inventory of his shop was taken. The inventory includes his personal belongings (horses, furniture, and so forth) as well. There is limited discussion about most of the medicinal items listed. 392. Helfand, William H., and David L. Cowen. \"Evolution of Pharmaceutical Oral Dosage Forms.\" Pharmacy in History 25 (1983): 3-18. This short review includes descriptions of the materials and techniques used in pill and tablet coating as well as capsule filling by pharmacists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Most of the article, however, deals with more modern, manufacturing developments. The authors focus on timed-release dosage forms: Unna's enteric coating with Karatin in 1884, Smith Kline and French's Spansule system of 1952, and contributions of Theeuwes and Higuchi to the recent development of the Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System. 393. Kalman, Samuel H., and John F. Schlegel. \"Standards of Practice for the Profession of Pharmacy.\" American Pharmacy 19 (1979): pp. 133-146. Provides in outline form the basic responsibilities and tasks of American pharmacists of the late twentieth century. The standards are concrete and direct, advocating a high level of practice but short of an ideal level. 394. Kilmer, F. B., and Charles D. Deshler. \"Drug Clerks One Hundred Years Ago.\" Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association 18 (1929): 711-722. Before becoming a writer, Charles Deshler worked as a drug clerk (employed pharmacist). His reminiscences of his experiences came into the hands of Kilmer, who edited them for publication. Although heavy on anecdotes, Deshler provides valuable details about day-to-day practice in the 1830s in New Jersey. 395. Lyman, Rufus A., ed. American Pharmacy. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1945. Practice of Pharmacy 103 Pharmacist-historian George Urdang served as the technical editor of this overview of American pharmacy practice. Much of the work covers the preparation of dosage forms, and some of the authors included historical background on their subjects. 396. MacEwan, Peter. The Art of Dispensing. London: Chemist and Druggist, 1900. 6th edition, 473 pp., index, illustrated. This compact manual covers the essential aspects of English pharmaceutical practices ca. 1900. Its chatty style is in contrast to the stiff prose of American manuals. 397. National Association of Retail Druggists. The Independent Druggist (Report Number One). n.p.: Curtis Publishing, 1945. 112 pp., tables. The study was based on survey replies from 1,723 independent store owners in 1944. It provides a snapshot of the \"average\" drugstore of the period. For example, of the stores surveyed, 9.4% had marble floors, 73% extended credit to customers, and 75% had soda fountains. With peace at hand, about 50% planned on remodeling their stores. 398. Noel, H. S., ed. The Modern Apothecary. Indianapolis: Eli Lilly & Company, 1941. 225 pp., illus. This book contains 26 essays on modernizing pharmacies covering topics as diverse as location, personnel, promotion, and lighting. The second part of the work deals with pharmacy interiors, exteriors, and displays, including floor plans and several illustrations of contemporary stores. It is a mixture of ideal elegant pharmacies and the traditional corner drugstores. 399. Parrish, Edward. An Introduction to Practical Pharmacy . . . Philadelphia: Blanchard and Lea, 1856. 525 In contrast to Procter's edition of Mohr and Redwood's Practical Pharmacy, Parrish's Introduction is truly illustrative of American pharmaceutical practice at mid-century. Parrish had been teaching pharmacy to physicians for several years and his book reflects the reality of a nation where most prescriptions were not compounded by pharmacists. 400. Porter, Glenn, and Harold Livesay. Merchants and Manufacturers. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1971. 248 pp., index, bibl. In this general study of American manufacturing and distribution, the authors include a short case study of Troth and Company, a Philadelphia drug wholesaler. Although just a small part of the book, the treatment is excellent and insightful. 401. Shannon, Michael C. \"The First National Organization for Employee-Pharmacists, 1910-1934.\" Pharmacy in History 17 (1975): 58-68. Although focused mainly on the history of the organization, this article does portray the differences in hours, practice, and pay between owners and employee pharmacists in the early twentieth century. 402. Smith, George Winston. Medicines for the Union Army: The United States Army Laboratories During the Civil War. Madison, Wisconsin: American Institute of the History of Pharmacy, 1962. 119 pp., index, illus. This small book not only describes the practice of military pharmacy in the mid-nineteenth century, it also touches upon general practices as well. The main context of the book deals with the manufacturing efforts of E. R. Squibb, John Maisch, and others. Full documentation is included as well as a copy of the U. S. Army's drug supply table. Practice of Pharmacy 105 403. Soubeiran, E[ugene]. Nouveau trait\u00e9 de pharmacie Paris: Crochard et Cie, 1840. The theoretical and practical sides of French pharmacy at its height are described by Soubeiran. Emulated by Procter in the USA, Soubeiran had great influence on American practice through Procter's Syllabus of Study. There are only a few illustrations in these two volumes, so Mohr is much more valuable for information about mid-nineteenth century apparatus. 404. Sprowls, Joseph B. \"An Introduction to Dosage Forms.\" In American Pharmacy. ed. Joseph B. Sprowls, and Harold M. Beal, pp. 1-26. 6th ed. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1966. 415 pp., index. In his introductory essay, Sprowls pulled together much of the historical material scattered throughout previous editions of American Pharmacy. His comments on the ancient world should be used cautiously, but his later analysis appears more sound. 405. Steele, I. K., ed. Atlantic Merchant-Apothecary: Letters of Joseph Cruttenden, 1710-1717. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1977. 124 pp., index. An edited and annotated set of 122 letters from Joseph Cruttenden, a London druggist, to his overseas customers during the years 1710-1717. Sprinkled among the letters (mainly to Boston, New York, and Barbados) are many references to drugs and their prices. The historical information about the drugs given by the editor is scanty and should be verified by the reader. Above all else, the letters document the difficulties of cross-Atlantic trade in the early eighteenth century. 406. Strickland, W. A. \"Quinine Pills Manufactured on the Missouri Frontier (1832-1862).\" Pharmacy in History 25 (1983): 61-68. Dr. John Sappington's Anti-Fever Pills are the focus of this piece. The author compares surviving samples of the Pills with replicas he made using the original formula. 407. Wertheimer, Albert I., and Mickey Smith (eds.). Pharmacy Practice: Social and Behavioral Aspects. 3rd edition. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 1989. 441 pp., index. This textbook is a mixture of original essays and classic articles on various aspects of pharmacy practice from a social science perspective. Several of the contributions to the book analyze practice issues historically. Full references are provided for all articles. 2b\u2014Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 408. Albert, Adrien. \"Relations Between Molecular Structure and Biological Activity: Stages in the Evolution of Current Concepts.\" Annual Review of Pharmacology 11 (1971): 13-36. Much more technical than other historical articles on this subject but useful because the coverage extends to the mid-twentieth century. 409. Autian, J., and G. Wood. \"The Role of Toxicology in the Pharmacy Curriculum.\" American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 40 (1976): 378-82. For the most part, this concentrates on contemporary teaching of toxicology, but it also has a brief discussion on the growth (or absence) of this discipline in pharmacy schools, and the reasons why. Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 107 410. Bachmann, C., and Marcel H. Bickel. \"History of Drug Metabolism: The First Half of the 20th Century.\" Drug Metabolism Reviews 16 (1985-86): 185-253. A sequel to the article by A. Conti and M. H. Bickel on drug metabolism in the nineteenth century (citation #418). The introduction cites several histories of the field besides Conti and Bickel. It covers conjugation reactions, the mechanisms of which awaited elucidation until the twentieth century; metabolism of selected compounds (e.g., barbiturates, morphine, and sulfonamides) that received considerable attention; and the physiological role of drug metabolism reactions. The authors have several useful tables with chronologies, publication output from different institutions, and principal workers in the field, and they cite over 260 primary sources. 411.

This series of 23 short articles was written by a septuagenarian pharmacist looking back over his years of practice. Mixed among various \"old yarns\" are details about pharmacy design, in-shop manufacturing techniques, relations with physicians, and general practices not available elsewhere. 414. Butler, T. C. \"Some Historical Reflections on Drug Metabolism.\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 179 (1971): 502-507. A brief article that emphasizes drug metabolism work in the nineteenth century by Buchheim, von Mering, and Schmiedeberg. It mentions the slow recognition of the importance of drug distribution and the kinetics of drug elimination, due to limited progress in analytical chemistry. On the other hand, author cites the work on sulfas and antimalarials in the 1930s and 1940s as trailblazing with respect to distribution and elimination kinetics. 415. \"C\u00e9l\u00e9bration du bicentenaire de la 117-242. A special number of the Revue devoted to this key figure in the early history of pharmaceutical chemistry. This issue has several articles and appendices of note, including P.

With the preceding work by Bachmann and Bickel (citation #410), the most comprehensive study of the subject. It is arranged by major pathways (oxidation, glycine conjugation, etc.). While quite technical, this article includes a useful section on \"General Comments,\" a chronology of developments, and nearly 150 references to the primary literature. 419. Cowen, David L. \"The History of the Science of Pharmacy.\" Pharmacy in History 7 (1962): 17-20. A brief but useful examination of the historiography of science as a component of the history of pharmacy. He attributes the lack of much attention to science in the history of pharmacy to George Urdang's vision that history of pharmacy be established as an independent discipline. The author advocates the addition of pharmaceutical science to the study of history of pharmacy. 420. Cowen, David L. \"Materia Medica and Pharmacology.\" In The Education of American Physicians: Historical Essays. ed. Ronald L. Numbers, pp. 95-121. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980. Excellent treatment of the transition from materia medica to pharmacology in American medical education, eighteenth century to the present. He conveys the character of how each discipline was presented, how and why the teaching changed, and he relates some of the principals involved, including John Morgan, John Jacob Abel, and Arthur Cushny. 421. Cowen, David L. Overview of the contributions of American pharmaceutical scientists to the development of pharmacokinetics, from the 1950s forward.

Examination of theories and supporting experiments of drug action along nerves vs. blood transport, from the seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. This draws on the work of John Jones and others to represent the neural route, and Felice Fontana, Fran\u00e7ois Magendie, and James Blake to suggest drug action via blood circulation. The neural route was not fully discredited until the second half of the nineteenth century. 426. Earles, Melvin P. \"Pharmacy and Its Relation to Scientific Education in Nineteenth-Century Britain.\" Pharmacy in History 11 (1969): 43-49. Discusses the efforts of the nascent Pharmaceutical Society to institute systematic scientific training for pharmacists in 1840s Britain. 427. Earles, Melvin P. \"Studies in the Development of Experimental Pharmacology in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries.\" (Ph.D. diss., University College, London, 1961.) Compares the ballooned materia medica of the early eighteenth century with the subsequent relational approach to therapeutics, relying on animal experimentation to demonstrate the effects of poisons and drugs. He follows with a discussion of the increasing attention to route of administration and posology vis-\u00e0-vis debates over neural versus vascular drug distribution in the body. Finally, he discusses the impact of the isolation of active ingredients from crude drugs. 428. Estes, J. Worth. Dictionary of Protopharmacology: Therapeutic Practices, 1700-1850.

(1990), \"Goodman and Gilman\" is a historically conscious source that addresses the evolution of pharmacological and clinical knowledge of drugs or drug groups of current therapeutic interest. On the development of this source, see Henry Swain, \"G & G: The textbook which structured American pharmacology,\" The Pharmacologist 26 (1984): 41-44. Historical backgrounds are given for most major Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 115 drugs and drug classes, but they tend to become shorter over successive editions, and are not updated even in the face of important new research. The material presented in the successive editions over fifty years is itself a major primary source for the history of pharmacology. 439. Helfand, William H., and David L. Cowen. \"Evolution of Pharmaceutical Oral Dosage Forms.\" Pharmacy in History 25 (1983): 3-18. Survey of developments since the nineteenth century, beginning with pill coatings and pill encapsulations. The authors focus on timed-release dosage forms: Unna's enteric with Karatin in 1884, Smith Kline and French's Spansule system of 1952, and contributions of Theeuwes and Higuchi to the recent development of the Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System. 440.

Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 117 446. Kraemer, Henry. \"Rise and Development of Pharmacognosy.\" Pharmaceutical Era 45 (1912): 633-36, 697-700, 763-67. First two parts focus (almost filiopietistically) on the great men in the history of pharmacognosy, such as Fl\u00fcckiger, Tschirch, Maisch, and others. The last part takes a more topical approach, examining the role of chemistry and crystallography and drug standardization methodology. 447. Kuschinsky, Gustav. \"The Influence of Dorpat on the Emergence of Pharmacology as a Distinct Discipline.\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 23 (1968): 258-71. Begins with the contributions of Rudolf Buchheim, who set up the first real institute of pharmacology in 1847 at the University of Dorpat and published one of the earliest texts devoted to pharmacology two years later (Beitr\u00e4ge zur Arzneimittellehre). He mentions the resistance to pharmacology by some of the established medical faculty in Germany. Finally, he covers the furtherance of pharmacology as a discipline under his successor at Dorpat in 1869, Oswald Schmiedeberg. 448. Leake, Chauncey D. An Historical Account of Pharmacology to the Twentieth Century. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 1975. This is the only narrative history of pharmacology yet published. It contains several errors, and only short bibliographic citations are given in the text. 449. Leake, Chauncey D. \"The Status of Pharmacology as a Science.\" American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 23 (1959): 173-96. Looks at some specific themes in pharmacology, such as the relationship between dose and therapeutic effect, drug absorption, and the mechanism of drug action (each of which are covered in far greater detail in later articles by others). Includes a useful bibliography on classic works, current texts, and periodicals. 450. Leicester, Henry M. Development of Biochemical Concepts from Ancient to Modern Times. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974. Good general history. 451. Lesch, John. \"Conceptual Change in an Empirical Science: The Discovery of the First Alkaloids.\" Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences 11 (1981): 305-28. Puts Sert\u00fcrner's discovery of morphine in the context of chemical theories of acids and bases of the day and explains why French chemists exploited this discovery. This was a crucial period in the history of pharmaceutical chemistry, involving the recognition of a new class of chemical compounds, the plant alkalis, as a result of the isolation of morphine and its identification as a salifiable base. 452. Lynn, E. V. \"A Century of Research in Pharmaceutical Chemistry in Schools of Pharmacy in the United States.\" American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 17 (1953): 183-93. A discussion not so much of the research itself as where the research was coming from; little research was actually being done at this time. This addresses APHA's query system as a means of stimulating research in the nineteenth century and mentions several of the leaders in research by the late nineteenth century. Finally, the article discusses the disappointment with productivity from pharmacy schools and how this might be alleviated. Undocumented. 453. Natural Product Reports 4, no. 4 (1987): 1-75. Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 119 This issue is devoted to the centennial of the birth of Robert Robinson, a twentieth-century giant in the synthesis of numerous therapeutically significant substances of natural origin. Several articles discuss his life and work. 454. Parascandola, John. The Development of American Pharmacology: John J. Abel and the Shaping of a Discipline. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. 212 pp., notes, bibl. essay, index, illus. Describes Abel's role in establishing pharmacology as a discipline in the United States. He identifies several elements that constitute discipline formation in this field, including creation of a national society and expansion of the workforce into government and industry. The coverage is from the nineteenth century to about World War II. 455. Parascandola, John. \"The Beginning of Pharmacology in the Federal Government.\" Pharmacy in History 30 (1988): 179-87. The personnel and character of the work, c. 1900 to World War I, of the Division of Pharmacology of the Hygienic Laboratory, the United States Public Health Service, and the Bureaus of Chemistry, of Plant Industry, and of Animal Industry in the United States Department of Agriculture. 456. Parascandola, John. \"Carl Voegtlin and the 'Arsenic Receptor' in Chemotherapy.\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 32 (1977): 151-71. Contrasts Voegtlin's views about the mechanism of action of organic arsenicals with those of Ehrlich. Both concluded that arsenicals worked by combining with sulfhydryl groups of the pathogen molecule, but Voegtlin's conclusion came from a series of premises that explicitly criticized Ehrlich's assumptions. 457. Parascandola, John. \"The Controversy over Structure-Activity Relationships in the Early Twentieth Century.\" Pharmacy in History 16 (1974): 54-63. Discusses arguments by those who championed physical properties (surface tension, osmotic pressure, etc.) as an explanation for drug activity as opposed to chemical composition and structure. A. R. Cushny, H. H. Meyer, C. E. Overton, and even the early Ehrlich illustrate the former group. He concludes that both sides were right to some degree, and the debate facilitated a broader view of drug action. 458. Parascandola, John. \"Structure-Activity Relationships: The Early Mirage.\" Pharmacy in History 13 (1971): 3-10. Examines the increasingly sophisticated efforts of James Blake, Benjamin Ward Richardson, Alexander Crum Brown, and Thomas R. Fraser in the nineteenth century to experiment with inorganic and, later, organic compounds, from which they tried to draw generalizations or even laws about the relationship between chemical constitution and expected therapeutic action. But neither general rules nor rational therapeutic applications could be derived from their work. 459. Parascandola, John. \"The Theoretical Basis of Paul Ehrlich's Chemotherapy.\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 36 (1981): 19-43. Definitive treatment of the intellectual foundation of chemotherapy. This discusses the evolution of Ehrlich's ideas about selective affinity, the side-chain theory of immunity and why he was at first reluctant to apply this drug action, the application of his theories to produce Salvarsan, modification of the side-chain theory to explain chemotherapy, and his principal therapeutic tactics stemming from his theories of chemotherapy. Basic Pharmaceutical Disciplines 121 460. Parascandola, John, and Ronald Jasensky. \"Origins of the Receptor Theory of Drug Action.\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 48 (1974): 199-220. A lucid account of the pioneering contributions of Paul Ehrlich and John Newport Langley to the development of receptor theory. Addresses the development of Ehrlich's side-chain theory of immunity, his reluctance to extend this to drug action, and how J. N. Langley's own work on receptors as an explanation of drug action, together with Ehrlich's studies on drug resistance, eventually led Ehrlich to postulate his receptor theory of drug action. 461.
