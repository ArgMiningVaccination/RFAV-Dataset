Vaccines are safe, effective, and authorized for anyone over six months old, and they drastically reduce the chance of hospitalization and death. - Have a plan for testing - If you plan to be near someone at high risk for severe disease, hospitalization, or death, consider getting tested prior to gathering. - Increase airflow and ventilation - While indoors, use HEPA filters or increase ventilation and airflow by opening windows or increasing air circulation. Consider moving activities outdoors for the best protection. - Keep your loved ones and community safe by following BCPH recommendations for isolation and quarantine, including getting tested if you are exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms of COVID-19. - Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds regularly throughout the day. - Consider wearing a well-fitting, medical-grade mask as an added layer of protection, especially in close indoor settings or when close to people at high risk for severe disease, hospitalization and death. - If you are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease: - Talk to your healthcare provider about whether you need to wear a mask and take other precautions. - Talk to your healthcare provider about whether you are a candidate for treatments like oral antivirals, such as Paxlovid, and make a plan ahead of time to access testing and treatment if needed. - In the week or two leading up to important events, travel, or visits with loved ones who may be at higher risk of severe disease, take steps to avoid becoming ill such as wearing a well-fitting, medical-grade mask in public and reducing non-essential indoor activities to limit your exposure and getting tested ahead of time.
