Park Road, London, N.W.LAT THE CENTRE OF MAN'S BEING: I Anthroposophy, a way of thought rather than a body of dogma, springs from the work and teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). He spoke of it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe The aim of this Annual is to publish writings which bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on ques tions and activities relevant to the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \"Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the God, whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which he was to full his mission on earth .... It represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external nature \".Evil and the Power of Thought Rudolf Steiner The rst of two Lectures given at Dornach on September 23-4, 1921^ I F a n o r i e n t a l s a g e o f e a r l y t i m e s , w h o h a d b e e n i n i t i a t e d i n t othe Mysteries of the ancient East, were to turn his glance towards modern Western civilisation, he might perhaps say to its representatives: \" You are living entirely in fear; your whole mood of soul is governed by fear. All that you do, as well as all that you feel, is saturated with fear and its reverberations in the most im portant moments of life. And since fear is closely related to hatred,so hatred that plays a great part in your whole civilisation.\" Let us make this quite clear. I mean a sage of the ancient East ern civilisation would speak thus if he stood again to-day among Western people with the same standard of education, the same mood of soul, as those of his own ancient time. And he would make it plain that in his time and his country civilisation was founded on a quite different basis. He would probably say: \" In my days, fear played no part in civilised life. Whenever we wereconcerned to promulgate a world-conception and let action and social life spring from it, the main thing was joy\u2014joy which could be enhanced to the point of a complete giving of oneself in love to the world.\" That is how he would put it, and in so doing he would indicate (if he were rightly understood) what were from his point of view supremely important constituent factors and impulses of modern civilisation. And if we knew how to listen to him in the right way, we should gain much that we need to know in order tond a starting point for trying to get a grip on modern life. In fact, an echo of the ancient civilisation still persists in Asia, even though strong European influences have been absorbed into its religious, aesthetic, scientic and social life. This ancient civilisa tion is in decline, and when the ancient oriental sage says,\" Love was the fundamental force of the ancient oriental culture,\" then it must certainly be admitted that but little of this love can be traced directly in the present. But one who is able to discern it can perceive even now, in the phenomena of decline of the Asiatic culture, the penetration of this primeval element of joy\u2014delight in the world and love for the world. * In those ancient times there was in the Orient little of what was afterwards required of man when that word resounded which found *From a shorthand report, unrevised by the lecturer.

But particu- ear hearing them is likewise sinful.\" larly when the Mysteries began to develop their colonies still further We should be aware that in the course of time many men into the west\u2014a special centre was ancient Ireland\u2014then the teachers Western countries (I am not speaking of Central Europe) learn to and pupils of the Mysteries coming over from Asia were faced, by know in secret societies what has been handed down as tradition virtue of the geographical features of the West and its entirely from the researches of the ancient wisdom. It is received without different elemental conguration, with the necessity of cultivating understanding, although as an impulse it often flows into action, self-knowledge and a true inner vision. And simply because these In later centuries after about the middle of the 15th century\u2014^the Mystery pupils, when still living in Asia, had acquired knowledge human constitution became such as to make it impossible to seeof the outer world and of the spiritual facts and beings lying behind these things in their original form; they could be understood only the outer world\u2014simply by the strength of this fact, they were now intellectually.

And hut how, too, by virtue of his individual constitution, he was also it was only the strongest souls who could endure what they per- ^hle to penetrate into certain mysteries. Thereby he becamec e i v e d . e ^ r a n g e d f r o m t h e o r d i n a r y w a y s o f l i f e .

Many facts must then beover again by the teachers who had already cultivated that vision judged by other than conventional standards. 2 3Of course, it was something quite outlandish when Bulwer travelled about, speaking of his inner experiences with a certain emphasis, while a young person who accompanied him played a harp-like instrument, for he needed to have this harp-music inbetween the passages of his talk. Here and there he appeared in gatherings where everything else went on in a quiet formal, conventional way. He would come on in his rather eccentric garb and sit down, with his harp-maiden seated in front of his knees. He would speak a few sentences; then the harp-maiden would play; then he would continue his talk, and the maiden would play again. Thus something coquettish in a higher sense of the word\u2014one cannot help characterising it in this way at first\u2014^was introduced into the conventional world where Philistinism has made such in creasing inroads, above all since the middle of the 15th century.Men have little idea of the degree of Philistinism into which they have grown; they have less and less idea of it just because itcomes to seem natural. They see something as reasonable only in so far as it is in line with what is \" done.\" But things in life are all interconnected, and the dryness and sleepiness of modern times, the relation human beings now have to one another, belongs to the in tellectual development of the last few centuries. The two things belong together. A man like Bulwer, of course, did not t into such a development; one can quite well picture to oneself people of older times travelling about in the world accompanied by a younger person with some pleasant music. One needs only to perceive the distance between one attitute of soul and another; then such a thing will be seen in the right light. But with Bulwer it was because something lit up in him that could no longer exist directly in the immediate present, but appeared only as a tradition in the modem intellectual age. \u00ab We must, however, recover the knowledge of man that lived in the Mystery colonies of which I have spoken. The average man to-day is aware of the world around him by means of hw seMe- perceptions. What he sees, he orders and arranges in his mmd.Then he looks also into his own inner being. The sense-perceptions received from outside, the ideas developed therefrom, these ideas as they penetrate within becoming transformed by impulses of feel ing and of will, together with all that is reflected into consciousness as memories\u2014^here we have what forms the content of the soul, the content of life in which modern man lives and out of which he acts. At most he is led by a false kind of mysticism to ask: \" What is there really in my inner being? What does self-knowledge yield?\" In raising such questions he wants to nd the answers in his ordin ary consciousness. But this ordinary consciousness gives him only what originated in external sense-perceptions and has been trans formed hy feeling and will. One nds only the reflections, the 4mirror-pictures, of external life, when looking into one's inner being with ordinary consciousness; and although the outer impressions are transformed by feeling and will, man is still unable to tell how feeling and will are actuaUy working. For this reason he often failsto recognise what he perceives in his inner being as a transformed reflection of the outer world, and takes it, perhaps, as a special message from the divine eternal world. But this is not so. What presents itself to the ordinary consciousness of modern man as self- knowledge is only the transformed outer world, which is reflected out of man's inner being into his consciousness. If man really and truly desired to look into his innermost being, then he would be obliged\u2014I have often used this image\u2014to break the inner mirror. Our inner being is indeed like a mirror. We g^e on the outer world. Here are the outer sense-perceptions. We link conceptions to them. These conceptions are then reflected by ourinner being. By looking into our inner being we get only to this mirror within. We perceive what is reflected by the memory- mirror. We are just as unable to penetrate into man's inner being with ordinary consciousness as we are to look behind a mirror without breaking it. This, however, is precisely what was brought about in the preparatory stage of the ancient way of Eastern wisdom so that the teachers and pupils of the Mystery colonies that came to the West could penetrate directly through the memories into the innermost being of man. Out of what they saw they afterwards uttered those words which were meant to convey that one must be well prepared\u2014above all in those ancient times\u2014^if one desired to direct one's glance to the inner being of man. For what does one then behold within? There, one perceives how something of the power which belongs to perception and thought, and is developed in front of the memory- mirror, penetrates below this memory - mirror. Thoughts penetrate below the memory- mirror and work into thehuman etheric body\u2014^into that part of the etheric body which forms the basis of growth, but which is equally the source of the forces of will. As we look out into the sunlit space and survey all that wereceive throu^ our sense-perceptions, there radiates into our inner being something which on the one hand becomes memory-ideas, but also trickles through the memory-mirror, permeating it just as the processes of growth, nutrition and so on permeate us. The thought-forces penetrate rst through the etheric body, and the etheric body, permeated in this way by Ihe thought-forces, works in a very special manner on the physical body. Thereupon a coni- plete transformation sets in of that material existence which is within the physical body of man. In the outer world, matter is nowhere completely destroyed. This is why modern philosophy and science speak of the conservation of matter. But this law of the conservation of matter is valid only for the outer world. Within the human being, matter is completely dissolved into nothingness. 5The very being of matter is destroyed. It is precisely upon this fact that our human nature is based: upon being able to throw back matter into chaos, to destroy matter utterly, within that sphere which lies deeper than memory. This is what was pointed out to the Mystery pupils who were led from the East into the Mystery colonies of the West, and especially of Ireland. \" In your inner nature, below the powers of memory, you bear within you something that works destructively,and without it you would not have developed the power of thought, for you have to develop thought by permeating the etheric body with thought-forces. But an etheric body thus permeated with thought-forces works on the physical body in such a way as tothrow its matter into chaos and to destroy it.\" If, therefore, a person ventures into this inner being of man with the same frame of mind with which he penetrates as far as memory, then he enters a realm where the being of man has an impulse to destroy, to blot out, that which exists there in material form. Forthe purpose of developing our human, thought-lled Ego we all bear within us, below the memory-mirror, a fury of destruction,\" a fury of dissolution, in respect of matter. There is no human self- knowledge which does not point with every possible emphasis towards this inner human fact. For this reason, whoever has had to learn of the presence of this centre of destruction in the inner being of man must take an interest in the development of the spirit. With all intensity he must be able to say to himself: Spirit must exist, and for the sake of the maintenance of the spirit matter may be extinguished. It is only after one has spoken to mankind for many years of the interests connected with spiritual scientic investigation that one can draw attention to what actually exists within man. But to-day we must do so, for otherwise man would consider himself to be something different from what he really is within Western civilisation. Enclosed within him he has a ery centre of destruction, and in truth the forces of decline can be transformed into forces of ascent only if he becomes conscious of this fact. What would happen if men should not be led by Spiritual Science to this awareness? In the developments of our time we can see already what would happen. This centre which is i^lated in man, and should work only within him, at the one single spot within, where matter is thrown back into chaos, now breaks out and penetrates into human instincts. That is what will happen to Western civilisation; yes, and to the civilisation of the whole Earth. This is evidenced by all the destructive forces appearing to-day\u2014^in the East of Europe, for instance. It is a fury of destruction thrust out of the inner being of man into the outer world; and in the future man will be able to nd his bearings in regard to what thus penetrates into his instincts only when a true knowledge of the human being once again prevails, when we become aware oncemore of this human centre of destruction within\u2014a centre, however, which must be there for the sake of the development of human thought. For this strength of thought that man needs in order that he may have a world-conception in keeping with our time\u2014this strength of thought, which must be there in front of the memory- mirror, brings about the continuation of thought into the etheric body. And the etheric body thus permeated by thought works destructively upon the physical body. This centre of destructionwithin modern Western man is a fact, and knowledge merely draws attention to it. If the centre of destruction is there without any awareness of it, this is much worse than if man takes full cognisance of it, and from this conscious standpoint enters into the development of modern civilisation. * It was fear that seized upon the pupils of these Mystery colonies when they rst heard of these secrets. This fear they learnt to know thoroughly. They became thoroughly acquainted with the feelingthat a penetration into man's innermost being\u2014^not frivolously in the sense of a nebulous mysticism but undertaken in all sincerity\u2014 must arouse fear. And this fear felt by the ancient Mystery pupils of the West was overcome only by disclosing to them the whole weight of the facts. Then they were able to conquer by conscious ness what arose in them as fear. When the age of intellectualism set in, this same fear became unconscious, and as unconscious fear it still exists. Under all manner of masks it works into outer life. It belongs, however, to our time to penetrate into man's inner being. \"Know thyself\" has become a rightful demand. It was by a deliberate calling forth of fear, followed by an overcoming of it, that the Mystery pupils were directed to self-knowledge in the true way. The age of intellectualism dulled the sight of what lay in man's inner being, but it was unable to do away with the fear. Thus it came about that man was and still is influenced by this unconscious fear to the degree of saying, \" There is nothing at all in the human being that transcends birth and death.\" He is afraid of penetrating deeper than this life of memory, this ordinary life of thought which maintains its course, after all, only between birth and death. He is afraid to look down into that wWch is eternal in the human soul, and from out of this fear he postulates the doctrine that there is nothing at all outside this life between birth and death. Modern materialism has arisen out of fear, without men having the slightest idea of this. The modern materialistic world-conception is a product of fear and anxiety (Angst).So this fear lives on in the outer actions of men, in the social structure, in the course of history since the middle of the 15th century, and especially in the 19th century materialistic world-con ception. Why did these men become materialists\u2014^why would they 67admit only the external, that which is given in material existence? Because they feared to descend into the depths of man. This is what the ancient Oriental sage would have wished to express from out of his knowledge by saying: \" You modern West erners live entirely steeped in fear. You found your social order upon fear, you create your arts out of fear, your materialistic world- conception has been bom from fear. You and the successors ofthose who in my time founded the ancient Oriental world-concep tion, although they have come into decadence now\u2014you and these men of Asia will never understand one another, because after all with the Asiatic people everything sprang ultimately from love; with you everything originates in fear mixed with hate.\"These are strong words indeed, but I prefer to try to place the facts before you as an utterance from the lips of an Oriental sage. It will perhaps be believed that he could speak in such a manner if he came back, whereas a modem man might be considered mad if he put it aU so radically! But from such a radical characterisation of things we can leam what we really must learn to-day for the healthy progress of civilisation. Mankind will have to know again that intelligent thinking, which is the highest attainment of modern, times, could not have come into existence if the life of ideas did not arise from a centre of destruction. And this centre must be reckoned with, so that it may be kept safely within and not pass over into our outer instincts and thence turn into a social impulse. One can really penetrate deeply into the connections of modern life by looking at things in this way. Thus the realm that mani fests as a centre of destruction lies within, beyond the memory- mirror. But the life of modern man takes its course between the memory-mirror and the outer sense-perceptions. Just as little as man, when he looks into his inner being, is able to see beyond the memory-mirror, so far is he from being able to pierce through allthat is spread out before him as sense-perceptions; he cannot see beyond it. He adds to it a material, atomistic world, which isindeed a fantastic world, because he cannot penetrate through the sense-images.But man is no stranger to this world beyond the outer sense- images. Every night between falling asleep and awakening heenters this world. When you- sleep, you dwell within this world. What you experience there beyond the sense-images is not the atom istic world conjectured by the visionaries of natural science. What lies beyond the sphere of the senses was in fact experienced by the ancient Oriental sage in his Mysteries. It can be experienced only when one has devotion for the world, when one has the desire and the urge to surrender oneself entirely to the world. Love must permeate the act of cognition if one desires to penetrate beyond the sense-perceptions. And it was this love that prevailed especially in the ancient oriental civilisation. Why must one have this devotion? Because if one sought topierce beyond the sense-perceptions with one's ordinary human Ego,one might be harmed. The Ego, as experienced in ordinary life, must be given up, if one wants to penetrate beyond the sense- perceptions. How does this Ego originate? It is brought mtoexistence by man's capacity to plunge into the chaos of destruction. This Ego must be tempered and hardened in that realm which lies within man as a centre of destruction. And with this Ego one can not live on the far side of the outer sense-world. Let us picture to ourselves the centre of destruction in man's inner being. It extends over the whole human organism. If it were to spread out over the whole world, what would then live in the world through man? Evil. Evil is nothing else hut the-, rhflos thrust outside, the chaos which is necessary in man's inn^r hping And in this necessary chaos, this necessary centre of evil in man, the human Ego must be forged. This human Egohood cannot live beyond the sphere of the human senses in the outer world. That is why the Ego-consciousness disappears in sleep, and when it gures in dreams it is often as thou^ estranged or weakened.The Ego which is forged in the centre of evil cannot pass beyond the realm of the sense-perceptions. Hence to the ancient oriental sage it was clear that one can go further only by means of devotionand love, by a surrender of the Ego; and that on penetrating fully into this further region one is no longer in a world of Vana, of weaving in the habitual, but rather in the world of Nirvana, where this habitual existence is dissolved. This interpretation of Nirvana, of the sublimest surrender of the Ego, as it occurs in sleep and as it existed in fully conscious know ledge for the pupils of the ancient oriental civilisation\u2014^it is thisNirvana that would be pointed out to you by such an ancient sage as I placed hypothetically before you. And he would say: \" With you, since you had to develop Egohood, everything is founded on fear. With us, who had to suppress Egohood, everything was founded on love. With you, there speaks the Ego. that desires to assert itself. With us. Nirvana spoke, while the Ego flowed out into the world in love.\" One can formulate these matters in concepts and they are then preserved in a certain sense, but for humanity at large they live in feelings and moods, permeating human existence. And throughsuch feelings they bring about a living difference to-day between the East and the West. In the West, men have a blood, a lymph, that is saturated by an Egohood tempered in the inner centre of evil. In the East men have a blood, a lymph, in which lives an echo of the longing for Nirvana. Both in the East and in the West these things escape the crude intellectual concepts of our time. Intellectual understanding draws the blood from the living organism, turns it into a preparation, places it under a microscope, looks at it and then forms ideas about it. The ideas thus arrived at are innitely crude even from the point 8 9of view of ordinary experience. That is all one can say about it. Do you think that this method touches the subtly graded differences of the people who sit here next to one another? The microscope, of course, gives only crude ideas about the blood, the lymph. Subtle shades of difference are to be found even among people who have come from the same milieu. But these shades of difference natur ally exist much more emphatically between the men of the East and those of the West, although only a crude idea of them can be had by modern thinking. All this comes to expression in the bodies of the men from Asia, Europe and America, and in their relation to one another in outersocial life. With the crude understanding that has been applied in the last few centuries to the investigation of external nature we shall not be able to tackle the demands of modern social life; above all we shall not be able to reach an adjustment between East and West, But this adjustment must be found. * In the late autumn of this year (1921) people will be going to the Washington Conference, and discussions will take place there about matters which were summed up by General Smuts, the Min ister of Africa, with his instinctive genius. The evolution of modern humanity, he said, is characterised by the fact that the seed-ground for cultural activities, which has hitherto been in the regions border ing the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, is now moving to the Pacic. The culture of the countries situated round the North Sea has gradually spread throughout the West and will become a world culture. The centre of gravity of this world culture will be trans ferred from the North Sea to the Pacic. Mankind stands face to face with this change. But men still talk in such a way that their speech savours of the old crude ideas and nothing essential is reached\u2014although it must be reached if we are really to go ahead. The signs of the times stand with menacing signicance before us and their message is: Until now only a limited trust has been needed between men, who in fact wereall secretly afraid of one another. Their fear was masked under all sorts of other feelings. But now we need an attitude of soul that will be able to embrace a world civilisation. We need a condence which will be able to bring into balance the relationship between East and West. Here a signicant and necessary perspective opens out. The assumption to-day is that economic problems can be handled quite on their own account\u2014^the future position of Japan in the Pacic, or how all the trading peoples on earth may have free access to the Chinese market, and so on. But these problems will not be settled at any conference until men become aware that all economic activities and relations presuppose the trust of one man in another. In future this trust will be attained only in a spiritual way. Outer civilisation will be in need of spiritual deepening.AT T H E C E N T R E O F M A N ' S B E I N G : I I The Seeds of Future Worlds* Rudolf Steiner Y e s t e r d a y I s p o k e o f h o w w e n d w i t h i n m a n a k i n d o f c e n t r eof destruction. I showed how as long as we remain within the limits of ordinary consciousness, we retain memories of the impres sions made upon us by the world, but that this is as far as we can go. We receive our impressions from the world; we turn them into experience through our senses and through our understanding, through all the manifold effects they have upon our soul; and later we are able to call up again pictures of what we have ex perienced. We bear these pictures within us; they are for us our i n n e r l i f e . It is indeed as though we had within us a mirror; but one that works differently from the ordinary spatial mirror. For the ordinary mirror reflects what is in front of it in space, whereas the living mirror we carry within us reflects in quite another way. It reflects the sense-impressions we receive, and reflects them in the course of time. Something or other\u2014at some later moment\u2014causes this or that impression to be reflected back again into consciousness, and so we have a memory of a past experience. If we break a mirror that is in space, then we can see behind it; we can look into a realm we cannot see when the mirror is intact. Correspondingly, if we carry out inner exercises of the soul, we come, as I have often suggested, to something like a breaking of the i n n e r m i r r o r . T h e m e m o r i e s c a n a s i t w e r e c e a s e f o r a t i m e \u2014 f o r how long a time depends upon ourselves\u2014 and we can look more deeply into our inner being. As we do this, as we look within behind the memory-mirror, then what I described as a kind of centre and heart of destruction meets our gaze. There must needs be such a centre within us, for only in such a centre can the Ego of man establish itself. It is a centre for the strengthening and hardening of the Ego. But, as I said, if this hard ening of the Ego, if this egoism is carried out into social life, thenevil ensues, evil in the life and actions of men. You may see from this how complicated is the life into which man is placed. Here you have something which has its good use and purpose within man, for otherwise he would not be able to develop his ego, but something which must never be allowed outside.The bad man carries in into the outer world; the good man keeps it inside him. If it is carried outside, it becomes evil and wrong. If it * From a shorthand report, unrevised by the lecturer.

After all, there is really nothing in the world that would not bring blessing to man, were it only in its right place! We should be thoughtless and unreflecting, if we lacked this centre within us. For this centre enables us to experience in it something we would never be able to experience in the external world. In Sie external world we see objects in a material sense, and following the custom of present day science we speak of the conservation of matter, the indestructibility of matter. But in this centre of destruction it really happens that matter is destroyed. Matter is thrown back into nothingness, and we have the power within this nothingness to causethe good to arise. We do so, if instead of instincts and impulses, which are bound to work in the direction of egoism, we pour moral and ethical ideals into the centre of destruction. Then, in this very centre of destruction, the seeds of future worlds arise. Then we, as men, take part there in the coming into being of worlds. When we speak, as you may read in my Outline of Occult Science, of how our Earth will one day suffer dissolution, and of h o w o u t o f a l l m a n n e r o f i n t e r m e d i a t e s t a t e s o f t r a n s f o r m a t i o n t h e Jupiter existence will eventually be evolved, then we have to see itin this way. The Jupiter existence will contain nothing but the new creation that is being formed to-day in man within this centre of destruction. It is being formed out of man's moral ideals, but also out of his anti-moral impulses, out of what works as evil from his egoism. Hence the Jupiter existence will be a battle between the good which man, already here and now, is bringing to birth by carrying his moral ideals into his iimer chaos, and the unmoral and anti-moral which is due to the presence of egoism. Thus, when we look into our deepest selves, we are gazing upon a region where matter is thrown back into notUngness. * I went on to indicate how it is with the other side of human existence, where we are surrounded with sense-phenomena. We behold these phenomena spread aroxmd us like a carpet or tapestry, and we apply our intellect to combine and relate them and discover within them laws, which we then call the laws of nature. But with ordinary consciousness we never get beyond this tapestry of the senses. We penetrate it just as little as we penetrate the memory-mirror within. With a developed consciousness, however,we do come through it. Then men of ancient Oriental wisdom penetrated it with a consciousness informed by instinctive vision.And then they looked upon a world where egohood cannot hold i t s o w n i n c o n s c i o u s n e s s . We enter this world every time we go to sleep. When we fall asleep, the Ego is dulled, and the reason is that beyond the tapestry of the senses lies that world where, to begin with, the ego-power, asit develops for human existence, has no place at all. Hence it is that the ancient Oriental, who had a peculiar longing to live behind the phenomena of the senses, used to speak of Nirvana, of the end and disappearance of egohood. * This brings us to the great contradiction between East and West. In times past the Oriental developed a longing to see behind the sense-phenomena, and in so doing acquired a power of vision intoa spiritual world which is not composed of atoms and molecules but of spiritual Beings. This world was there in visible actuality for the perception of the ancient Oriental. In our days the Oriental, par- iicularly in Asia but also in other parts of the world, is living inthe decadent stages of this yearning to reach the world behind the sense phenomena; while the man of the West has developed his Ego, has allowed that hardening and strengthening to take place within the centre of destruction which we have described. In saying this we are already on the way to seeing what it is that must enter into man's consciousness, now and in the early future. For if the pure intellectualism that has been developing ever since the middle of the 15th century were to continue, mankind would fall into decline; for intellectualism will never help us to pass either behind the memory-mirror or behind the tapestry of the world of the senses. And it is essential that man should acquire once more a consciousness of these worlds. He must do so, if Christianity is again to become a truth for him; it is not a truth for him to-day. Wecan see this clearly when we look at the modern conception of Christ\u2014^if indeed modern times may be said to have any idea of Christ at all. The truth is that we are living in a stage of evolution when man cannot possibly come to an idea of Christ as long as he makes use only of the concepts which he has been developing since the 15th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries he has become in capable of forming a true idea of Christ. Man looks round about him on the world, and uses the combin ing faculty of his intellect to build up natural laws. Following a line of thought that is perfectly possible for the consciousness of the present day , he comes to the point when he could say: \" The worldis permeated with thought, for the laws of nature can be appre hended in thoughts; they are in reality the thoughts of the world. If I follow up the laws of nature I am bound eventually to apply them to the coming into existence of man himself as a physical being, and then I have to admit that within the world I survey with my ordinary consciousness, beginning with sense-perception and goingon as far as the memory-mirror, a spiritual element lives.\" One must needs be ill, pathologically ill, if like the atheistic materialist one is not willing to recognise this spiritual element. We live in this world that is given for ordinary consciousness; we come forth into it as physical man through physical conception and physical birth. But what is observable within the physical world must be 12 13inadequately contemplated if one fails to see behind the physical world a universal spiritual element. When we are born as little babies, we are really for external perception not unlike some creature of nature. Then out of this being of nature, that is virtually in a kind of sleep condition, spiritual inner faculties gradually develop. If we learn to trace back these emerging spiritual faculties in the same way that we trace the gradual growth of the limbs, we nd that we must look for theirsource beyond birth and conception. Thus we come to the point of thinking in a living and spiritual way about the world, where before, in our consideration of external nature, we only built up abstract laws. We come, in other words, to an afrmation of what we may call the Father God. Scnolasticism held\u2014you will remember\u2014that knowledge obtain able by ordinary rational obse^ation of the world includes know ledge of the Father God. It is indeed true that if anyone sets out to analyse the world as it is given for ordinary consciousness, and does not end by gathering up all the natural laws in what is called the Father God, he must be in some way ill. To be an atheist is to be ill; that is how I put it here once before. With the ordinary consciousness, this is as far as we can go. With the ordinary consciousness we can come to the Father God, but no further. It is symptomatic of our times when a theologian of such standing as Adolf Harnack says that Christ the Son does not really belong in the Gospels; that the Gospels are the message of the Father, and that Christ Jesus has place in the Gospels only in so far as He brought the message of the Father God. Here you may see quite clearly how with a certain inevitability this modern think ing leads men to recognise even in theology only the Father God,and to understand the Gospels themselves as containing no more than the message and tidings of the Father God. Thus in the sense of this theology Christ is of account only as having appeared in the world and brought to men the true teaching concerning the Father God. Two things are implied in this. First, the belief that the message of the Father God cannot be read by a study of the world in the ordinary way. The Scholastics still held that it could. They did not imagine that the Gospels were there to speak of the Father God; they assumed that the Gospels were there to speak of God the Son.That men can come forward with the opinion that the Gospels speak only of the Father God is proof that theology, too, has falleninto that way of thinking which has developed as the peculiarly Western method. For in early Christian times, up to about the third or fourth century, when there was still a good deal of the Oriental wisdom in Christianity, men were occupying themselves intently with the question of the difference between the Father God and God the Son.These ne differences that engaged attention in the early Christian 14centuries have long ceased to have meaning for modern man, who has been occupied in developing egohood as a result of the influences I have described. A kind of untruth has thus found its way into modern religious consciousness. Through inner experience, through his analysis and synthesis of the world, man comes to the Father God. From tradition, he has God the Son. The Gospels speak of Him, tradition speaks of Him. Man has the Christ, he wants to acknowledge Him\u2014but through inner experience he has Him no longer. Therefore he takes what he should apply only to the Father God and transfers it to the Christ God. Modern theology has not the Christ at all; it has only the Father\u2014but it calls the Father \" Christ,\" because it has received the tradition of the Christ Being in history and, quite naturally, wants to be Christian. If we were honest, we should simply be unable to call ourselves Christians in modern times. * All this is quite changed when we go further East. Even in the East of Europe it is different. Take the Russian philosopher of whom I have frequently spoken\u2014Soloviev. You find in him an attitude of soul that becomes a philosophy and speaks with full justication of a difference between Father and Son. Soloviev is inwardly justied in so speaking because for him both the Fatherand the Christ are experiences. The man of the West makes no distinction between God the Father and Christ. If you are inwardly honest with yourselves, you will feel that the moment you want to make a distinction between the Father God and the Christ, the two ideas become confused and involved. For Soloviev that would have been impossible. He experiences each separately, and so he has still an understanding for the spiritual conflict that was fought out during the earliest Christian centuries, in the endeavour to realise in consciousness the distinction between the Father God and God the Son. This, however, is the very thing that modern man needs to learn. There must again be truth in calling ourselves Christians. It must not be that we make a pretence of worshipping the Christ and attribute to Him only the qualities of the Father. But to avoid this we must bring forward truths such as I have been indicating to-day. That is the only way we can come to the twofold experience, the experience of the Father and the experience of the Son.It will be necessary to change the whole form of our conscious ness. The abstract form of consciousness in which modern man is born and bred, and which does not permit of more than the recogni tion of the Father God, will have to be replaced by a much more concrete life of consciousness. Needless to say, one cannot set things before the world at large to-day in the way I have describedthem to you here, for people have not yet been sufciently prepared by Spiritual Science and Anthroposophy. Y et there are ways in 15 G.B.\u20142which one can point out even to modern men how they carry in them a centre of destruction, and how in the world outside there is something wherein the Ego of man is as it were submerged, where it cannot hold itself fast\u2014as in earlier times men were told about the Fall and other doctrines of that kind. We in our time have only to find the right form for these truths\u2014a form which would enable them to nd their way into ordinary consciousness; they must become part of ordinary consciousness, even as the doctrine of the Fall of man used to give instruction concerning a spiritual foundation of the world, in ways that were different in their effect from our teaching of the Father God. Our modern science will have to become permeated with concep tions such as those we have expoimded here. At present it is ready to recognise in man only the laws of nature. But in this centre of destruction of which I have been speaking the laws of nature are united with the moral laws; there, natural law and moral law are one. Within man matter is annihilated, and so are all the laws of nature. Material life, together with all the laws of nature, is thrown back into chaos; and out of the chaos a new nature is able to arise, lled through and through with the moral impulses we ourselves lay into it. As we have said, this centre of destruction is below our memory-mirror . So that when we let our gaze penetrate deep down below this memory-mirror, there at last we observe it, though it is always within us. A man is not changed by knowledge: he merelycomes to know what he is like, what his normal condition is. And he must learn to meditate upon these facts. * When we are able to penetrate into this inner core of evil in man, and are able also to become conscious of how into this evil, where matter is destroyed and thrown back into chaos, moral impulses wnnd their way , then we have really found in ourselves the beginning of spiritual existence. Then we perceive the spirit within us in theact of creating. For when we behold moral laws worldng upon matter which has been thrown back into chaos, we are beholding a real activity of the spirit taking place within us m a natmal way. We become aware of the spirit concretely active within us, the spirit that is the seed of future worlds. With what can we compare this nding? We cannot compare it with what our senses tell us of external nature. We can compare it only with a communication made to us by another human bemg through speech. It is indeed more than a comparison when we sayof that which takes place in us, when moral and anti-moral impulses unite with the chaos inside us, that it speaks to us. There we have something that is no mere allegory or symbol, but actual fact.What we can hear externally with our ear is a speech toned down for the earth-world, but within us a speech is spoken &at goes out beyond the earth, for it speaks out of that which contains the seeds 16of future worlds. There we penetrate into what we must call the\" inner word.\" In the words that we speak or hear in intercourse with other people, hearing and speaking are separate and distinct, but in our inner selves, when we dive down below the memory- mirror into the inner chaos, we are in a region of being where speak ing and hearing go on at the same time. Hearing and speaking areonce more united. The \" inner word \" speaks to us, and is heard in us. We have, in fact, entered a realm where it is meaningless to speak of subjective and objective. When you listen to your fellow man, when he speaks words to you that you perceive with your sense of hearing, then you know that his being is outside you, but that you have to give yourself up, to surrender yourself, in order that you may perceive his being in what you hear him saying. On the other hand, you know that the actual word, the audible word, is not merely subjective, but is something placed into the world. Hence we nd that even with the toned-down words that we hear and speak in our intercourse with other men, the distinction between subjective and objective loses meaning. We stand with our subjec tivity in objectivity; and objectivity works in us when we perceive.It is the same when we dive down to the inner word. It is not only an inner word; it is at the same time something objective. It is not our inner being that speaks: our being is merely the stage whereon speaks the world.It is similar for one who has insight to see behind the tapestry of the senses a spiritual world, a world wherein spiritual Beings of higher Hierarchies work and weave. To begin with, he perceivesthese Beings by means of Imagination; but for his vision they become permeated with inward life when he hears the \"word\", apparently sounding to him through himself, but in reality from out of the world. By means of love and devotion and surrender, accordingly, man presses his way through the tapestry of the senses and sees beyond; and the Beings who reveal themselves to him when he thus offers up his own being in full surrender\u2014^these Beings he comes to perceive with the help of what he recognises as \" inner word.\" The world without begins powerfully to resound when the inner word is awakened. * What I have been describing exists to-day in every human being. Only , he has no knowledge of it and so he gives no thought to it.He must grow into this knowledge; must learn to have it in thought and remembrance. When we learn to know the world with the ordinary consciousness that provides us with our intellectual con cepts, we really come to know only tile passing and the past. Whatour intellect gives us, if we are able to look at it in the right light, is really a survey of a world in process of passing away. But we know that with the intellect\u2014^as I have said\u2014^we can find the 17Father God. What sort of consciousness, then, relates us to the Father God? The consciousness that the Father God is at the foundation of a world which reveals itself to our intellectuality is in course of wearing away. Yes, it is indeed so\u2014since the middle of the 15th century man has developed through his intellect a special faculty for studying and observing all that is dying in the world. We analyse and test the world-corpse with our intellectual scientic knowledge. And theologians such as Adolph Harnack, who hold by the Father God alone, are really expounders of that part of the world which is going down and will pass away with the earth and disappear. They are backward-pointing men.How is it then, in the last resort, with a man who has completely absorbed the modern natural science way of thinking? How is it for him, when this way of thinking has been grafted on to him from early childhood? He learns that out there in the world are phenomena which arise and pass away , but that matter persists,matter is the indestructible thing. The earth may come to an end, but matter will never be destroyed. Certainly (he is told) a time will come when the earth will be one vast cemetery, but the cemetery will be composed of the very same atome as are already there to-day. A man thus trained in thought centres all his attention on what is passing away, and even when he studies that which is com ing into life, he really only studies how the dying plays into it. An Oriental could never do this; we can see this even in the East of Europe, in the subdued philosophical feeling of Solovieff. He does not bring it to expression as clearly as it will have to be ex pressed in the future, but he shows unmistakably that he has still enough of the Oriental in him to see everywhere, within what is passing away and crumbling into chaos, the springing up of the new , the birth of what shall be in the future. If we would understand how this really is, we must envisage it in the following way. All that we see of our fellow inen with our senses will one day no longer exist; whatever makes itself known to eye, ear, and so on, will at some time in the future cease to be. Heaven and earth will pass away . For what we see of the stars by means of our senses\u2014^that too belongs to the things that are trans ient. But the \" inner word \" that is formed in the inner chaos of man, in the centre of destruction\u2014that will live on after heaven andearth are no longer there; it will live on even as the seed of this year's plant will live on the plant of next year. Within man are theseeds of world-futures. And if into these seeds men receive the Christ, then heaven and earth may pass away, but the Logos, the Christ, cannot pass away. Man bears within him that which will one day be, when all he sees around him will have ceased to be. We must put it to ourselves in this way . I look up to the Father God. The Father God is at the foundation of the world I can see with my senses. The world of the senses is a revelation of Him; 18but it is none the less a dying, sinking world, and it will drag man down with it if he is completely absorbed in it, if he is able to develop only a consciousness of the Father God. Man would then go back to the Father God; he would not be able to evolve anyfurther. But there is also a new world arising, and it takes its beginning from man himself. When man ennobles his moral ideals through coming to a Christ-consciousness and receiving the Christ Impulse, when he forms and fashions them as they should be formedand fashioned through the fact that the Christ has come to earth, then something comes to life in the chaos within him, seed is sown for the future, a new world dawns within him. We need to develop a keen and sensitive perception for these two worlds\u2014the setting and the rising world. We must feel how there is in nature a perpetual dying. Nature wears, so to speak, a deathlike hue. But over against this there is also in nature a con tinual glow of new life, a continual coming to birA. This does not reveal itself in any hue visible to the senses; yet if we open our hearts to nature, it can be perceived. We look out into nature and see the colours, all the colours of the spectrum, from the red at one end to the violet at the other, with all the shades between. But if we were now to mix these colours in a certain way \u2014 make them \" colour \" one another \u2014 they wouldreceive life. They would together become the so-called flesh colour , InkarnaU the colour that speaks out of man. When we look at nature, we are looking in a certain sense at the spread-out colours of the rainbow, the sign and symbol of the Father God. But if we look at man, it is the Inkarmt that speaks out of the inner being of man, for in man all the colours interpenetrate, and in pch a way as to become alive. But when we turn to a corpse, this power to take on life is entirely absent. There, that which is man is thrown back again into the rainbow, into the creation of the Father God. But for the source of that which makes the rainbow into the Inkarnat, makes it into a living unity, we must look within our-J selves. * I have tried to lead you, by what may have been at times a rather difcult path, to an understanding of this inner centre of man in its true signicance. I have shown you how external matter is thrown back into nothingness, into chaos, so that the spirit may be able to create anew. Let us look at the whole process. The Father God works in matter, bringing it to completion. Matter confrontsus in the external world in a great variety of ways, manifesting itself visibly to our senses. But within ourselves this matter is thrownback into nothingness and then permeated with pure spiritual being, lled through and through with our moral or anti-moral ideals. There is the upspringing of new life. We have to see the world in this double aspect. We see rst the Father God, creating what is outwardly visible; we see how this 19outwardly visible comes to an end inside man, and is thrown back into chaos. We need to feel quite intensely how this world, the world of the Father God comes to its end; only then we shall be able to reach an inner understanding of the Mystery of Golgotha. It will become clear to us how the very thing that comes to an end, in the sense of the creation of the Fa^er God, is endowed with life once more by God the Son; a new beginning is made. Everywhere in the Western world we can see how since the 15th century there has been a tendency to study and investigate only the corpse-like part of nature, only what is \" setting \" and passing away. In truth, thiis is all that is accessible to the pure intellect on its own a c c o u n t . A l l o u r s o - c a l l e d e d u c a t i o n a n d c u l t u r e h a s b e e n developed under the influence of a science that concerns itself only with what is dead. This kind of culture is directly opposed to real Christianity. Real Christianity must have a perceptive feeling for what is living, and for the distinction between everything that is springing into life and everything that is on the way down. Hencethe idea most important for us to connect with the Mystery of Golgotha is the idea of the Risen Christ, the Christ who has van quished death. Much depends on this. Christianity is not merelya religion of salvation; the Oriental religions were also that. Christianity is a religion of resurrection, a religion that awakens again to life that which would otherwise be nothing but matter crumbling away into nothingness. Out in the cosmos we have the crumbling away of matter in the moon, and in the sun we have a perpetual coming into being, forever new and fresh. When we get beyond ordinary sense-percep tion and reach the point where Imagination is active, then we can see in the moon something that is for ever splitting up and scattering itself abroad. There, where the moon is situated, its matter splits up and disperses like dust into the world. The matter of the moon is perpetually being collected from its environment and then split up and scattered. If you look at the moon in the consciousness of Imagination, you have a perpetual convergence of matter to the place where the moon is; it collects there, and then it splits up and is scattered like dust into the cosmos. You see the moon like this: rst a circle, then a smaller, closer circle, until the circle becomes the moon itself. Then it falls to pieces; it is strewn out over the cosmos. In the moon, matter cannot endure a centre. It con centrates towards the centre of the moon, but cannot endure it; it stops short there and disperses like cosmic dust. It is only to ordinary sense-perception that the moon appears quiet. It is not quiet. It is for ever compressing matter together and scattering it. When we come to the sun, there we nd it is all quite different. Through Imagination we are able to see how matter does not collectin this way at all; true, it does approach the centre, but then it begins to receive life in the rays of the sun that stream out from the centre. It does not split up and disperse; it becomes living, andspreads out life from the centre in every direction. And togeAerwith this life it develops astrality . In the moon there is no astrality; there is nothing; the astrality is destroyed. But in the sun astrality unites itself with all that streams out. The sun is in reality per meated through and through with inner life. The centre-point is not tolerated, any more than in the moon, but it has a fructifying influence. In the centre of the sun lives the fructifying activity of our cosmos. Thus in the contrast between sun and moon we can see a cosmic manifestation of the two opposite processes: in the moon matter is thrown back into chaos, while in the sun it is per petually springing and welling up with life renewed.When we dive down into our selves, then we look &st into our own inner chaos, into our \" moon.\" That is the inner moon. Matter is destroyed there, as in the external world it is destroyed at one spot alone\u2014^where the moon is. But then comes the influence of the sun, entering through our senses; the sun pene trates into our inner \" moon.\" The matter which is dissolving there into dust is renewed by the sun. Here, within us, matter is con stantly falling under the moon influnce, and as constantly absorbingthe activity of the sun. Such is the relationship in which we stand to the cosmos. We must become aware of these two opposite activities in the cosmos: the moon-nature directed towards pulver ising and scattering, and die quickening, life-giving nature of the sun. In this way we come to behold in that which is dispersing and crumbling to dust the world of the Father God, which had to bethere until such times as die world changed into the world of God the Son. The world of God the Son has its physical source in the Sun-nature of the cosmos. Moon-nature and Sun-nature are related t o o n e a n o t h e r a s F a t h e r G o d h e a d i s t o S o n G o d h e a d . During the early Christian centuries these things were instinc tively perceived. Now they must be known again with full con sciousness and clarity of thought, if man wants to say of himself in all truth and honesty: I am a Christian. 2021\"The Battle for the Spirit\" THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE, 869 A.D. A. P. Shepherd I N h i s e x p o s i t i o n o f t h e e v o l u t i o n o f h u m a n c o n s c i o u s n e s s R u d o l fSteiner often spoke of the critical importance of the Council of Constantinople in 869, at which the Western Church ofcially renounced the ancient conception of man as a threefold being, of body, soul and spirit, by asserting that he is a duality of body andsoul only. This article is an attempt to set out the historical back ground and spiritual signicance of this Council. It will be seen tobe a closely woven pattern of events which led up to the spiritual crisis of the ninth century. It is impossible to understand this historical background unless we grasp clearly the ecclesiastical atmosphere of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. If Rome might be considered as the head of the Christian Church, and Antioch and Alexandria as its brain, Constantinople was its heart. Built in the rst enthusiasm of Imperial Christianity as a Christian city, in which no pagan worship was to be allowed, it presented a real organic unityof Church and State. The famous Code of Justinian, by which the Empire was governed for centuries, began with an invocation of the Blessed Trinity, and was declared to be enacted in order to estab lish more rmly the practice of the Christian Faith. The Patriarch ranked next to the Emperor. Another point to be borne in mind is the complete contrast between the Byzantine Empire and Western Europe, and, conse quently, between Eastern and Western Christianity. The Byzantine Empire was for nearly a thousand years one of the most civilised, cultured and effectively ordered States the world has seen, while Western Europe was a welter of struggling tribal settlements, and later of rising and falling semi-barbarian kingdoms, encircling and often overwhelming the ever-diminishing remnant, in the centre of Italy, of what had once been the glory of Rome. Moreover, theEastern Empire was in direct contact with the Persian and, from the seventh century, with the Arabian empires, in which the Aris totelian wisdom of Greece had taken root, and was manifesting i t s e l f i n t h e m o s t a d v a n c e d f o r m s o f s c i e n c e , m e d i c i n e a n d astronomy. It was, in consequence. Eastern Christendom that was,for the most part, the home of theological learning. It was in Alexandria, Antioch and Syria that nearly all the heresies arose, and it was in Councils held at Constantinople or its neighbouring cities, under the presidency of the Emperor, that they had been settled. In these Councils the Bishops of the West were a minority.We must have very clearly in mind one important result of the heresy disputes of the fourth to the seventh centuries, for it had a profound effect upon the life of the Byzantine Empire and on the subsequent spiritual evolution of Christendom. The main subjectof dispute in the Church in those centuries was the attempt to explain the two-fold nature of Christ, as both human and divine. The dispute was divided between three points of view, that of the Nestorians\u2014so-called after their founder, Nestorius\u2014who so empnasised the humanity of Christ as to accord Him two wholly separate natures; the Monophvsiies. wno so exalted cnrlst^s alvine nature as completely to absorb His human nature into Hk Hiviniiv. and the Orthodo_x point of view which Insisted on the presence of both natures in their fullness, united in Christ in one person. t he imperial demand for religious uniformity persecuted with varying rigour the two heretical Churches. The Nestorians were driven into Persia, where at Nisibis and Jundi-shapur they became a centre of Aristotelian philosophy and theological learning. The Monophysites of Antioch and Alexandria enjoyed occasional spellsof imperial toleration, but, for the most part, preserved a precarious existence in the deserts of Egypt and Syria. With the rise of the Saracen Empire, early in the seventh cen tury, both these Churches passed under Arab rule, where they enjoyed a freedom of thought and worship which the Church of Constantinople had never tolerated. Under this tolerant Islamicrule the Monophysite Church spread, and in its monasteries there developed a deeper and less secular wisdom than that of the Nes torians, which tended to ally itself with Arabism. This Mono physite wisdom was to be the counter to the spiritual rigidity, both of Byzantine imperialism and, later, of Roman papacy. These facts give the general background of the events of 869, but we must bring the picture into closer focus. The Council of Constantinople of 869 was the aftermath of a century of the domin ation of Constantinople by a new heresy, one less of belief than of practice. The seventh century had ended in a welter of politicalconfusion and intrigue. Moreover, it was not only the State which was corrupt but also the Church. While Constantinople was a city of intense religious observance, it was not itself a centre of religious learning. Its monastic orders did not give themselves to study, likethose of the Nestorian and Monophysite Churches. The spiritualand philosophical interpretation of Christianity of the rst three centuries, as it had found expression in Clement and Origen, hadbeen abdished by Justinian in the sixth century, and had been replaced by a cult of the Liturgy , intensied by pilgrimages to holy places, \u00ae\u00aeP^ially those of Palestine. But the Saracen conquest cff byria and Palestine had closed Jerusalem to Constantinople. In place ot tne sacred pilgrimages there had grown up a veneration of 22 23images and relics, and this developed into superstition and charla tanry among both monks and people. The better-educated classesand the leading hierarchy were opposed to these practices, but they made little headway against them. In 717 a distinguished general, Leo the Isaurian, seized the imperial throne. He came from the mountainous country ofIsauria in southern Asia Minor, a land of hardy warriors, that had known the spiritually intellectual impact of the Monophysite Church and, for a century the neighbourhood of Islam, both of them opposed to the use of images in worship. With his reform of the army and the civil administration, I^o also ordered the immediate removal of all images from the city and its churches. There was a popular outcry and violent opposition from the monks, but the Emperor retaliated with persecution and banishment, and the suppression of many monasteries. The situation was parallel to the Puritan and Catholic strife in England in the 16th and 17th centuries. Leo was supported by the better-educated classes and by many of the more learned hierarchy.Another result of the rise of the new dynasty, and one of the greatest consequence, was the gradual flow-^back from the East ot Aristotelian learning, and a revival in Constantinople itself of the Greek culture which Justinian had banished from the Empire two centuries before. This iconoclastic tyranny, with varying rigour or leniency, con tinued for 60 years till 779, when the Dowager Empress Irene, herseM an \" image-worshipper,\"* seized the power from her young son and reversed the Imperial policy. The violence of the icono clasts had outrun their rst reforming zeal, and amounted to opposi tion not only to the veneration ^ images, but to all external expressions of piety and even to monasticism itself. Moreover, intheir persecution they had ruthlessly destroyed works of art and had banished Byzantine artists. All this had provoked a reaction which allied itself with the recovery of Greek culture and created amongst the moderates of both parties a desire for \" economia,\" a policy of freedom <rf conscience. The Empress did not commit the city to monastic reaction. She restored the worship of images, butshe had appointed, as Patriarch, T arasius, a layman and a moderate, who was President of the Imperial Chancellery. There immediately followed an event of the greatest importance. A Synod of the whole Church was called at Nicaea in 787, at which iconoclasm was declared a heresy and, at the same time, the per missible use of images in worship was dened. This Synod is of \"Image-worshippers\" (\"iconodouloi\") was .the name given by theiconoclasts (image-destroyers) to those who used images in worship. The latter declared that the accusation was false, and that they only venerated images and relics because of their sacred associations. While this was for the most part true, the iconoclastic mind drew no distinction between veneration and worship. 24importance to our present study because reference to it occurs ire-quently in the conflict between Rome and Constantinople that ragedround the Council of 869. But it has an even greater importance for the spiritual understanding of the Council, yet one to which I have found no reference by any historian. The second canon of the Synod of Nicaea in 787 laid upon all bishops and clergy the essential duty of deep and constant study of the scriptmes, and con cluded with these words. \" For the essence of our hierarchy is the divinely transmitted oracles, that is, the true knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, as the great Dionysius has declared it; and should anyone doubt this and not nd his pleasure in thus acting and teaching, let him not be ordained.\" How did it come to pass that this oflBcial acknowledgment of the authority of Dionysius' teaching is found in a Council of the whole Church, to which the Pope of that time set his seal, only 80 years before the Council of Constantinople of 869 abolished the Dionysian belief in the threefold nature of man as body, soul and spirit? How had this teaching established itself at orthodox Con stantinople, where it had been rejected two centuries earlier, in the condenmation of Origen ? * Every student of Anthroposophy knows how often and withwhat emphasis Rudolf Steiner spoke of the mysterious gure, Dionysius the Areopagite, who retained and taught the ancient Mystery teaching about the spiritual being of man in the light of Christianity, which teaching, though banned by the Roman Church,continued in subterranean currents, bursting up again and again in the mystic life of European Christendom. The writings of Dionysius appeared in Greek in the last 20 years of the fth century in Egypt. They were deeply coloured with Neo-Plalonism, and were associated with a revival in Egypt at that time of the teaching of Origen. The fact that the claim that the author of the writings was the New Testament Dionysius the Areopagite has been rejected by scholars is of little importance. It was quite traditional to publish writings under a famous name of the past, and in any case occult teaching was preserved in secret oral tradition long before it was made public. The important fact is the great part which these writings played in the subsequent history of -the Church, in the west as wellas in the east. Evelyn Underbill considered that the influence of Augustine on the history of mysticism was as nothing comparedwith ^at of Dionysius the Areopagite. Nevertheless, how did this teaching win such authoritative approval at the Council of Nicaea m787?A clue to this problem is to be found in the fact that there >^s also a Syriac soiirce of this teaching, as early as and possibly earlier than the Greek text. This affords us a denite and most important link with its appearance at Constantinople in the eighth century . We have already spoken of the scholarly Monophysite monas- 25teries. One of the most famous of these was set up in the fth century at Edessa in northern Syria, from which the Nestorians had lately fled before the Catholic persecution. In the late part of the century a Monophysite monk of Edessa, Stephen bar Sudhaili, made a pilgrimage to Egypt, where, we are told, he met Mono physite monks who had secretly revived the teaching of Origen. Stephen returned to Edessa and produced a work in Syriac on these lines. Thus the writings appeared, both in Greek and Syriac, at the end of the fth century, through the activity of the Monophysite Church, and continued to be much used by the Monophysites. The next link in our research is the fact that the Monophysite monastery of Edessa, while not an academy, had become a centre of learning as distinguished as the Persian University at Jundi- shapur or that of the Nestorians at Nisibis, and was specially famous in the seventh century for the teaching of Greek. Here we have a direct connection with the influx of Greek culture into Constan tinople with the coming of the Isaurian dynasty in 717. With this Christian Greek culture would come the knowledge of the Dionysian teaching, acting as a counter to the merely wordly learn ing of the more violent iconoclasts, and to the superstition of the more fanatical image-worshippers. Meanwhile the leniency of the Synod of Nicaea towards the recanting iconoclastic bishops and priests aroused the resentment of the fanatical image-worshipping monks, and, relying on the support of the Empress, they gave way to violence and disorder. The result was that when Irene was supplanted by one of the State ofcials, she and her extremist party were so unpopular that imperial icono clastic persecution broke out afresh and continued, with the excep tion of two short periods, until 843. One of these periods adds another item to our knowledge of the Dionysian stream, and a most interesting one. In 820 Michael the Stammerer, a native of Phrygia,came to the throne, and he instantly ordered complete freedom of thought for all his subjects. During his short reign of nine years a Prankish Embassy came to Con stantinople, seeking the imperial approval of the Pope's appointment of Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, as Emperor of the West. T ogether with his consent, Michael sent to Louis a Greek copy of the works of Dionysius. It is signicant that a teacher inthe Schools of Paris at that time was the Irish monk, Scotus Erigena, whose subsequent translation of Dionysius into Latin deeply influenced the later mysticism of Western Christianity. At last, in 843, the Dowager Empress Theodora, like the former Empr\u00abs Irene, an \" image-worshipper,\" succeeded to the regency during the minority of her infant son, and immediately the images were restored. From this time the issue was no longer between iconoclasts and \"image-worshippers,\" but between the extremist party who desired the suppression of the former iconoclasts and themoderate party who sought for unity and peace. Theodora herself 26realised that the policy of \" economia\" was now a necessity, and she appointed to the patriarchate Methodius, a bishop of the moderate party, and to the imperial chancellery Photius,the nephew of Tarasius. Immediately the extremist monks, opposed alike to learning and to freedom of conscience, broke out into insurrection and violence. In 847 Methodius died, and Theodora, anxious to offend neither party, appointed as Patriarch a pious, but unfana- tical, monk named Ignatius. It was from this point that the events took place that led up to the Council of 869. In 856 the young Emperor, Michael III, came of age, a pleasure- loving, but able, ruler, who had little sympathy with monkish extremism. He moved away from his mother's control and asso ciated himself with his uncle Bardas, who had been co-regent with Theodora. A plot was laid against Bardas and Ignatius allowed himself to be involved in it. The insurrection was suppressed, Theodora was immured in a convent, and Ignatius was arrested and banished. To save deprivation, and almost certainly under some constraint, Ignatius resigned the patriarchate. In appointing his successor the young emperor determined to avoid the conflict between the moderates and the extremists by disregarding the bishops of both parties. He turned to a layman, Photius, the President of the Imperial Chancellery. Within a week Photius had been ordained deacon and priest, consecrated as bishop, and installed as Patriarch. There was precedent for this. It had happened to his uncle Tarasius and to Nicephorus, both of whom had also been President of the Imperial Chancellery. Now Photius is one of the two protagonists in this great conflict of the spirit, and we must pause to consider his personality. In the Western Church he has been constantly maligned as the author of the great schism between the East and the West. He was depicted as the bastard child of an escaped nun by a soldier of the Imperial Guard, and all kinds of defamatory legends were attached to him. In Eastern Christendom, on the other hand, he has always been lauded as a great saint and the champion of the Orthodox Church. A recent brilliant historical survey by Francis Dvornik justies the Eastern viewpoint. Photius belonged, in fact, to one of the great families of Con stantinople. He was a Greek and not an iconoclast. Both he andhis father had been persecuted as \" image worshippers.\" But above everything else he was one of the most famous scholars of theMiddle Ages, and was regarded by post-Renaissance philosophers and philologists as the one most responsible for making availableto Western Europe the knowledge of Greek and Hellenistic culture. He was spoken of by the Emperor Michael as \" a man of colossal industry and \" almost universal knowledge, which he had received from no masters.\" This reputation, together with his name Photius, the Enlightened One, would seem to point in him to the intuitive knowledge of the Initiate. In him the Dionysian teaching, which 27his uncle Tarasius had embodied in the canons of the Synod of Nicaea, had reached a still higher level of expression. A man of high moral rectitude and spiritual insight, his own letters reveal how deeply he felt the wrench of leaving the calm elds of university scholarship and mystical meditation for the notoriously turbulent arena of religious party strife, for which, he declared, he felt the utmost contempt. Having, however, once accepted the patriarchate, he became the indomitable champion of the domestic independence of the Patriarchate of Constantinople against the growing claims of papal primacy and its political plotting against the Byzantine Empire.This Roman policy was especially embodied in Pope Nicholas I, who was the counter-protagonist to Photius in this conflict, and before we resume the course of events we must consider also the personality of Nicholas. Although he was Pope for only nine years,from 858 to 867, he was the leading ^re in events which had a permanent effect on the history of Christendom, both in the west and in the east. Rudolf Steiner spoke of him as a great gure faced by difcult decisions at a critical moment. Since the division of the Empire in the fourth century, the influence of the Pope of Romehad gradually increased. Successive waves of barbarian conquest from the north had restricted the authority of the Byzantine Emperor in Italy almost to the exarchy of Ravenna. But most of die invaders were nominally Christian and venerated the person of the Pope, who, especially in the case of strong men like Gregory I, came to wield, not only spiritual, but also secular power, and felt themselves to be the focal point of the Western Empire. In 801 Leo III had consecrated Charlemagne as Emperor of the West, and when, after his death, the Prankish Kingdom began to break up, the Pope came to hold the position of king-maker. This, together with the traditional spiritual primacy of Rome, gave the Pope an independence erf the authority of the Byzantine Emperor such as no other Christian patriarch possessed, and also set up a rivalry with the patriarchate of Constantinople that sowed the seed of an inevit able split between Eastern and Western Christendom. This position had just matured when Nicholas, a man of great ability and spiritual perspicacity, came to the papal throne. Hewas inunediately confronted with two decisions. In the rst place the kingdom of Bulgaria, on the north side of the Adriatic, had recently been converted to Christianity by Prankish missionaries, and Nicholas saw it as an invaluable addition to the Roman Patriarchate, and a check to the western influence of Constantinople.On the other hand it was contiguous with the Byzantine frontier, and the Emperor regarded its possession and inclusion in the patriarchate erf Constantinople as an invaluable protection againstthe growing thrust of the invading north. This political issue played a great part in the conflict between East and West that centred on the Councfl of 869. 28But a deeper problem confronted Nicholas, a purely spiritual issue that was not manifest in surface events. It escapes the notice Of most historians, although it found central expression in the Council of Constantinople. Rudolf Steiner expounded it in detail.* Nicholas was concerned, not only with the political unity of the West, but with the spiritual unity of Western Christendom. He was aware of three spiritual streams that were spreading westward from the East, under the pressure of the Islamic conquest. The rst stream was the mystical interpretation of Christianity that had developed in the rst three centuries of Christendom among those who still possessed some of the occult perception that flowed from ancient Mystery knowledge, and which had ripened again in Neo- Platonism. It had found expression in Clement and Origen, and although, through Justinian, the Church had ofcially condemnedit in the sixth century, it still survived among the Monophysites and was already raising its head in the Eastern Church under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Nicholas could not but be aware of the signicance of the second canon of the Council of Nicaea m 787. The second stream was a cult of spiritual Imagination, originat ing in Persia, which had spread along North Africa and was pene trating the West through Spain. It was the cult centred round the Mystery of the Graal.The third stream was one which had developed in Constan tinople, after the ^adual disappearance of the stream of direct spiritual apprehension. It was a cult of the Liturgy, which provided worshippers with a direct experience of spiritual exaltation and aconsciousness of supersensible reality. These three streams were contrary to the spirit of Roman Christianity. Ever since the fourth century Rome had tended to express Christianity along the lines of traditional Roman thinking. The Roman conception of man as essentially a political unit in the Empire militated against the ancient conception of him as a spirit- being, which lay at the heart of the Greek ideal of liberty. The Papacy saw itself as the spiritual transformation of the Roman Empire, and conceived of Christendom as a spiritual empire held together by a legal system of dogma, in which the part of the individual was only that of unquestioning faith and absolute obedience. Any direct individual spirit-perception was suspect, and any organisation based on such a viewpoint must be suppressed asa heresy. Ever since the fourth century this spiritual policy had been organised in Italy and there stood behind Nicholas, and also behind his predecessor and successor , the gure of Anastasius the Librarian, a man of profound intellect and spiritual knowledge,who had made for himself a Latin translation of the works of Dionysius. *See Building Stones for the Understanding of the Mystery of Golgotha; and Supersensible Influences in the History of Mankind. 29For all this Nicholas is not to be blamed. He was a man of great ability and far-seeing insight into what he conceived as the spiritual needs of Western Christendom. Rudolf Steiner emphasisesthis and speaks of \" the necessity of Europeanised Christianity set ting aside, from the concept of man, the idea of the spirit.\" It was the path that would lead to the evolution of European ego-con sciousness, that has been the basis of western civilisation. But it must not be regarded as its ultimate goal. Thus through a series of political and ecclesiastical circum stances, the spiritual issue was joined between Nicholas, the Pope of Rome, and Photius, the Initiate Patriarch of Constantinople. * To resume the narrative of events, in 857 Ignatius fell and Photius was appointed Patriarch. A Synod was held in Constan tinople conrming this. In 859 Ignatius appealed to Pope Nicholas against his deposition and against Photius' uncanonical appoint ment. In 860 the Emperor Michael invited Nicholas to send legates to attend a General Council,* which he was summoning for a nal elucidation of the Catholic doctrine about images. Nicholas con sented on condition that his legates should at the same time examine the issue between Ignatius and Photius and report to him for his nal decision. When the legates presented their letters, the Emperor objected that the issue between Ignatius and Photius was a domestic concern of Constantinople which was already settled, but, as a concession, he consented to a re-trial of Ignatius by the .legates, provided that they came to an immediate decision, without further reference to Rome. This was agreed. Ignatius was condemned and Photius' appointment was ratied, and the legates returned to Rome to report their decision to the Pope. For a while Nicholas took no action, except to send letters to the Emperor and to Photius demanding the return of the ancient province of Illyricum, whichincluded Bulgaria. The dispute at Constantinople appeared to bean excellent opportunity for the exercise of power politics. But to h i s l e t t e r s h e r e c e i v e d n o r e p l y . . . Meanwhile, in 863, the representatives of the extremist party in Constantinople arrived in Rome, asking for a re-trial of Ignatiusand secretly promising their support in the matter of Bulgaria. Immediately Nicholas summoned a Synod at Rome, rejected thedecision of his legates, annulled Ignatius' deposition, and vilied and \u00bbA Synod was a gathering of bishops, summoned and presided over by a p a t r i a r c h . . , . j j j A General Council was a gathering of bishops, sumnioned and tpresidedover by the Emperor. In the West the decline of imperial authority transferred this power to the Pope. Although Nicholas claimed this power asof right, his successor called upon the Emperor to summon the General Council of 869. . r. j i Aji Oecumenical Council is a status given to a previous Synod or General Council by a subsequent General Council.

The Bulgarian king was baptized and applied to Photius for a patriarch of his own. Photius replied that at present that was impossible. In 865 the Emperorsent a scathing reply to Nicholas, denying his right to interfere in the domestic affairs of the patriarchy of Constantinople, for which, as the New Rome, he claimed equal status with Old Rome. He made no reference to Bulgaria, but demanded the immediate return of the extremist Byzantines under threat of military action. This letter found Nicholas seriously ill, and the reply was drafted by Anastasius, in no less strong terms than Michael's letter. It made, for the rst time, an explicit claim, not only to the primacy of Rome, but to its complete authority over the whole Church. It declared that the Pope alone had authority to summon a General Council\u2014a complete disregard of all historical precedent. It also refused to send back the dissident Byzantines. Suddenly an unexpected move by King Boris of Bulgaria gavea new turn to the crisis. In 866 he sent envoys to the Pope, making the same request which Photius had refused. Nicholas immediately dispatched two bishops to Bulgaria, with orders to expel the Greek priests. He also sent legates with further peremptory letters to Michael and Photius. When the legates arrived they were kept waiting six weeks at the port. Meanwhile, the expelled Greek priests arrived from Bulgaria and reported that the Romans were tolerating the heretical practices of the Frankisli missionaries, the eating of milk and cheese in Lent, the enforcement of clerical celi bacy, the restriction of the right to conrm to bishops only, and, nally, the inclusion of the word \" lioque \" in the Creed, contrary to the credal form authorised by the rst Oecumenical Council of Nicaea 500 years previously. Photius inunediately called a Synod and then, in 867, a Council, which was attended, not only by the Eastern bishops, but by a number of Western bishops who were opposed to Nicholas. The Council passed canons, condemning the Prankish heresies, con demning Pope Nicholas and demanding his deposition, declaring Louis II Emperor of the West\u2014a bid for lay support\u2014and finally declaring the Synod of Nicaea of 787 to be the Seventh Oecumenical Council, and so binding on the whole Church. This was the rst occasion on which the \"lioque\" dispute, which caused the nal split between the Eastern and Western Churches, had been made an ofcial issue, and for this reason Photius was always condemned by the West as the author of the schism. But Photius did not accuse Pope Nicholas of holding this heretical view, but only of tolerating its propagation by the Franks. The issue was not yet a theological one, but a question of credal orthodoxy. The Franks had claimed at the beginning of the eighth century that the \"lioque\" clause was part of the original Creed. 31 G.B,\u20143The East replied that it was not in the Creed adopted in the First Oecumenical Council of Nicaea in 325. Pope Leo III agreed with this view and had the Nicene Creed engraved on silver plates and stored at Rome. Also the \" libellus,\" or declaration of orthodoxy used at all Synods and Councils, contained the Creed in the Nicene form. It was not until the eleventh century that a German pope forced the Italians to insert into the Creed the \"lioque\" clause, and it was not discussed as a theological issue until the Council of Florence in 1439. The theological question about the nature of the Holy Spirit did not arise in this dispute, and is in any case a quitedifferent issue to the denial by the Western Church of the threefold nature of man. * The Emperor and Photius were deeply angered by the papal letters and by the Roman intrigue with Bulgaria, and felt them selves to be in a very strong position. But the public condemna tion of Nicholas was impetuous and illjudged. Unknown to Photius, Nicholas had already died, and his successor Hadrian, no admirer of Nicholas, was hesitating as to what line he should take. A more conciliatory action might have won him over. ,At that moment an unexpected act of political treachery wrecked Photius' position and entirely altered the course of events. Basil, a friend of Michael, having already secured, in the spring of 867, the assassination of Bardas, Michael's uncle, in the autumnmurdered the young Emperor himself and seized the throne, probably encouraged in this by Rome and the extremist party . T osecure his position, Basil immediately reversed the Imperial po'licy . He wrote to Pope Hadrian, accepting Nicholas' decision of 863, deposing Photius. Photius immediately resigned and Ignatius was restored. Basil's letter decided Hadrian and the arrival in Rome of the Acts of the Photian Council of 867 conrmed his resolution.He immediately summoned a Synod in Rome, and condemn^ Photius to deprivation and excommunication without hearing his defence. The canons of the Council of 867 were revoked and itsActs publicly burned. The primacy and supreme authority ot the Pope were conrmed.Immediately a demand was sent to Basil to summon a GeneralCouncil, which was to meet under the presidency of the p^al legates, in order to ratify and carry out the Pope s sentence. 1 he Emperor was in no position to refuse and the Council met m Con stantinople in 869. But Basil in his own capital was not in thesame mood as the suppliant to Rome. He insist^ on presidmg mthe person of his own representative, Baanes, and. to the indigna tion of the legates, he also insisted on their presenting their credentials and signing the usual declaration of orthodoxy . Moreover , he decreed that Photius must be heard in his own defence. The legates took a very arrogant line, that there was nothing tor the Council to debate. All that was to be done was to conrm theresolutions passed at Rome. The Byzantines were hun^iated, with the exception of Photius himself, who, with true Initiate under standing of the rigged situation, refused to utter a word in his own defence, except that, at one point, he urged the legates to do penance!. Finally, on the proposal of the legates, Photius was ex communicated. Among the canons of the Council was the one to which RudolfSteiner specically refers as banishing the spirit from the constitu tion of man. It must be remembered that the wording of this canon presented an entirely Roman point of view, for all the canons had been drawn up by Anastasius at Rome and passed at the Roman Synod, and were only mechanically conrmed by the Council at (Constantinople. This canon is hardly noticed by commentators.Dvornik does not mention it in his actual account of the Council, but only refers to it in another context as an instance of a fabricated charge against Photius. \" Photius,\" he declares, \" could not havebeen guilty of so crude a heretical utterance.\" It is clear that Dvornik does not relate the canon to the demand for the oecumenicity of the Council of 787, with its recognition of the authority of Dionysius the Areopagite. It is in this light, how ever, that the reference to \"two souls\" is comprehensible. In point of fact, the charges in the canon are set out at considerable length, and its erce denunciatory tone and detailed anathemasshow that Anastasius was aware here of the deep spiritual issue between Rome and Constantinople of which Rudolf Steiner speaks. The following is a literal translation of the canon. Although the Old and New Testaments both teach that man has one xational and intellectual soul, and all the divinely-inspired Fathers and teachers of the Church express the same opinion, certain men, given over to the pursuit of evil, have reached such a pitch of impiety as to enunciate the dogma that a man has two souls, and, bya certain irrational exploitation of a wisdom, which has already been made follyi, seek to establish this heresy. Therefore this holy and Catholic Synod, hastening to root out, like utterly evil tares, this worthless belief, holding in its right hand the winnowing fan of truth, that it may cast out this chaff to the unquenchable flame, and present the world as the eld of Christ, anathematizes with a loud voice the inventors and perpetrators of such an impiety, together with those who share their views, and decrees that no one shall pay any regard or obedience to the decrees of the author of this impiety.2And if anyone dares to act contrary to the decrees of this holy and great Synod, let him be anathema, and an outcast from the faith and fellowship of Christians.\" To those who are aware of the Dionysian background, the refer ence here to man as possessing two souls is clear . The Dionysian teaching was linked up with Origenism and Neo-Platonism, and,through that, with Neo-Pythagoreanism. Pythagoras (555 B.C.) hadhad direct access to Mystery knowledge and he taught that the 1 The denunciation of Origenism in 555. 2 A clear reference to Photius.being of man has three parts: \"Nous\" (Thinking), \"Thumos\" (Feeling and Desire), and \" Phrenes\" (Bodily Instinct). \" Nous \" is the sphere of the activity of spirit, \"Thumos\" that of the soul,\" Phrenes \" that of the body. Of these the rst only is sinless and immortal. By the ordinary man this is naturally understood as saying that \"man has two souls, one of which is sinless.\" Thiswould be anathema to the Roman conception of man as totally corrupt. In the thirteenth century the ISteholastics justied their holding of \" the double truth \" on the ground that man's thinkinghad shared in the consequence of the Fall. This Thomas Aquinas could not accept, although at that very time it was in process of becoming true!We must note carefully the words in the canon, \"man has one rational and intellectual soul.\" Steiner tells us that previously the phrase had been \" one imaginative and spiritual soul,\" thus avoid ing any separate mention of spirit. In the words of the canon thereis a deliberate denial that man's \" thinking and rational\" faculty is anything more than a soul quality , and there is a deliberate exclu sion of spirit. * The defeat of Photius did not last long. In 870 Hadrian died and was succeeded as Pope by T ohn VIII. In 873 Photius Was recalled from banishment and restored to conamunion, and in 876 was reconciled to Ignatius. In 877 Ignatius died and unmediately the clergy of Constantinople elected Photius as Patriarch, and this was nally accepted by the Pope as a fait accompli. In 879 Basil summoned a General Council to ratify the existing situation in Con stantinople and to rehabilitate Photius, and asked the Pope to sendlegates. The Emperor , owing to his own absence on account of thesudden death of his son, appointed Photius himself to preside. Allanti-Photian Synods were suppressed, the Acts of the Council of 869 were reversed, and, nally, the Council of Nicaea of 787 was declared once more to be the Seventh Oecumenical Council, under threat of excommunication of all who dissented. The resolutions embodying the Council's decisions were actually proposed by oneof the papal legates, and were carried unanimously. For the moment the conflict was at an end, but the seed had been sown which could only result in the ultimate division between Eastern and Western Christendom. From that time their paths diver&ed In the West the Council of Nicaea of 787 was not accepted as Oecumenical for some centuries. Meanwhile there was established under absolute papal authority a body of clearly dened dogma and ritual, to be accepted unquestionably by faith aloM. Moreove^ the Western Church adhered to the decision of the Council of 869 in regard to the twofold being of man, as soul and body. Aristo telian in origin, it tted into the Roman framework of Grammar and Rhetoric in which the clergy expressed their theological con- 34cepts, and also into the evolving individual self-consciousness of man, in which his thinking appeared to him to arise out of himself. Through its exposition by Scotus Erigena the teaching of Dionysius spread into monastic studies, but it centred almost entirely upon the understanding of the Being of God. It had no effect on the o\u00a3Scial western concept of the being of man. 'Meanwhile among the early Scholastics there awoke the query as to the real nature and the reliability of man-derived concepts, a doubt fanned by the invading pantheism of Arabism. It began to penetrate even into the sacred realm of dogma. For a while Thomas Aquinas stemmed the rising tide of doubt by drawing from sources of earlier wisdom an understanding of the deeper activities of thought within man himself. Thereby he reconciled philosophy and theology up to the point beyond which, he said, human reason hadno authority. But within a generation the doubt returned, to be gradually strengthened by scientic discovery into a sole reliance upon human sense-deriv^ thinking, which has to a great extent captured many elds of religious thought.But the deeper Dionysian teaching of the pathway to direct spirit knowledge by-passed the orthodox rigidity of Rome. Itreached the West through the now independent patriarchate of Bulgaria, and during the deepening doubt from the thirteenth to thesixteenth centuries, it inspired a succession of mystical thinkers in South Germany and England. For Eastern Christendom, on the other hand, the triumph of Photius was the beginning of an era of learning and spiritual cul ture in the Church of Constantinople, that lasted for over 500 years. The use of images in worship which had been restored was strictly controlled under ecclesiastical regulations. No three-dimensional image was allowed in any Orthodox church, but only the two-dimensional icon, or else mosaic. Strict rules also governed the painting of the icons, which were Imaginations, rather than the physical representations found in Western sacred art. They expressed and evoked the spirit behind the physical. They were the meeting in art of the \" two paths\" of Dionysius; the Greek repre sentation of the physical and the Monophysite apprehension of the spiritual. Perhaps the contrast between the Western and Eastern Churchesis most clearly seen in the comparison of their Eucharistic worship. The Western Mass became a doctrinally-deflned, hierarchical^ enacted, divine miracle, which the worshippers, convinced of theirmherent sinfulness, partook of or beheld in hope of forgiveness and mture immortality. The Eastern Liturgy was an undened rite of Initiation, in which each worshipper participated, and experienced anew each time the transformation and renewal of his being as spirit. The earthly man became the receptacle of the suprasensible reality and was transformed into the heavenly man. The Dionysianvision of the threefold being of man has always remained as the 35 .essence of the mystical thinking and teaching of the Orthodox Church. The long subjugation of the Orthodox Church to Turkish rule kept its outlook from being influenced by Western evolution. To-day the greatest need of mankind is the recovery of the knowledge of man's true eternal self as spirit, and that knowledgemust develop aboye all in the Christian Church itself. It was with surprise and delight that recently I heard an Oxford theologian sayin a Convocation debate, \" Theologians are beginning to turn away from the Western idea of twofold man, back to the Eastern idea of man as spirit, soul and body.\"Water's Forming Forces Olive Whicher A tribute to the originally underlies form is ofM. great value for the development, in particular, of the organic sciences. The nished forms produced by nature in such abun dance and variety\u2014even the rigid and crystalline forms of the mineral kingdom\u2014appear in a new light if they are contemplated from this point of view. It is one thing to study a form in all its completenws and per haps complication, to learn to know it in detail once it is there, but quite another to gain a true insight into the way it came into being. In apprehending something of the various formative processes which work together to create a form, it becomes evident that the resting state is hot the rst, but rather the last. Not the form is there rst, with life or movement resulting from it, but the other way round. First there is movement, and only afterwards do the forms arise, created\u2014crystallised out\u2014^from an ever-moving, flow ing ocean of possibilities. This is clearly revealed, for instance, in embryonic development; Spiritual Science teaches that even the Earth as we know it came into being in this way.^ The contemplation of flowing water leads directly to this kind of insight into the creation of organic and also of inorganic forms. It is indeed like a first class\u2014a preliminaiy mode of training\u2014 whereby the powers of observation and of thinking are schooled by the very processes inherent in the flowing medium itself. In time, a perception may be reached which, going beyond the mere con templation of a form from outside, sinks deeper into the mode ofits creation. (Just the same can be said for the form-creative pro cesses in Modern Projective Geometry). * * * * The book. Das Sensible Chaos? by Theodor Schwenk, publkhedin 1961 in with illus trations in the text by Walter Roggenkamp and 88 beautiful photo- 1 See for example references to the workings of the Spirits of Movement and of Form in Chapter IV (rf Rudolf Steiner's Occult Science.2 The title, Das Sensible Chaos, derives from a quotation from Novalis, where he calls water a \"sensitive chaos\", likening it in other words to a receptive matrix or womb. TTie subtitle, Strdmendes Formenschaffen in Wasser iind Luft, indicates that the book is a study of the flowing forms created by water and air. 3637graphs from nature, is a valuable and very original contribution tothe science of hydrodynamics. Further, it provides the interested layman with a wonderful introduction on the one hand to Imown and also as yet little or even unknown facts of hydrodynamics, and on the other to a whole variety of natural phenomena taken from the kingdoms of nature and of man. These, when set side by side in the competent and imaginative way in which the author presents his material, afford a unique approach to the study of water and air, and to the formative processes inherent in these media. As Schwenk himself says in his introduction, through the contemplation of the phenomena created by water and air, our thinking is itself transformed and becomes more suited to encom pass the creative laws whereby the nished forms of life have atone time come into being. The reader nds himself in a realm of great beauty. It is a world of potentialities, whose secrets are caught and held for a passing moment, like footsteps on a sandy shore, before the wavesreturn to wash them away again. In the transient world of coming into being and fading away, revealed by the flowing water or the streaming air, we learn to see the nished forms as secondary things. They are like the letters of an alphabet, but not yet the words; or footprints, but not the being who created them. Wisdomlies in the created forms; yet they are nal, thrust out momentarily , as it were, into the world of nite things; like eddies on the surface of moving water, they are carried by, to disappear again out of space and time. What underlies the created forms is the broad, deep stream of creation, the great tide of boundless possibilities, in whose depths are hidden the secrets of becoming. Trained in aero- and hydrodynamics, Schwenk, whose work as an experimentor has been fertilized by long years of acquaintance with the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, has with great skill found ways of showing, both in nature and in the laboratory, the close kinship between forms made by moving water and air and manyforms in other kingdoms of nature. The gestures of moving forms brought about in the flowing media speak to the imagination andreveal how intimate is their relationship with organic growth and development. That water, the very source of life itself, reveals inits own processes the gestures of living forms becomes self-evident. It is characteristic of this book that it is so ideally balanced between science and art; the thoughtful integrity of the trained scientic investigator is never absent from the artistic perception, presentation and interpretation of the phenomena. This is no doubt due in great measure to the fact that experience and understanding derived from the art of Eurythmy\u2014the art of the human form in movement\u2014is brought to bear upon the phenomena of hydro dynamics. For this work rests to a large extent upon years of co operation between Theodor Schwenk and his assistant, HelgaBrasch, whose great help he acknowledges in his preface and who is a trained eurythmist. Such an approach is certainly unique in the history of hydro dynamics, for the theories hitherto applied in this branch of science have been largely borrowed from mechanics, a science which derived its thought-forms originally from experiments with rigid bodies subject to the gravitational force. Thus it is that the aspect of water whereby it behaves like a heavy body, seeking to run earthward, downward to a lower level, gures predominandy in the science of hydrodynamics and also in the uses to which water is put nowadays. The tremendous force generated by water when givenover to gravity has become a main source of power in industry and technics. Water has come to be regarded largely as a useful com modity and source of physical power. That this way of thinkingabout water is one-sided and by no means exhaustive is revealed beyond doubt to the reader of this book. The book starts by describing the natural meander of a river or stream, which, when left to itself, flows in undulating curves, the volumes of water moving in circling paths and spiralling surfaces. Typically, water is continually being drawn downward, always seek ing a lower level. Equally typically, it tends towards the roundedform of the drop and is always striving to create a sphere, be it the spherical form of the separate drop or the vast sphere created by the waters of the whole Earth. A sphere is an organic whole, and water, when separated off into drops or seas or oceans, tends continually to unite and to create a whole. This it does through manifold rhythmical and circulatory processes; for example, it is constantly rising in mists and clouds, tobe caught into the great circulating currents of the atmosphere around the earth, thence to return to the earth again in dew, rain, snow or hail. In these rhythmical, circulating processes Schwenk sees the waters of the earth constantly striving to maintain a balance between the downward pull of gravity and this tendency of water to form organic spheres of its own. Water behaves essentially like a circulatory system within a whole, maintaining a balance similar to that maintained by the circulatory systems of living organisms. Water is indeed the life-blood of the Earth. When water flows in a river bed, it not only runs down the valley under the influence of the force of gravity, but also swingsfrom side to side, forming meanders. Each river or stream has its own meandering rhythm, according to the terrain through which it flows, and sometimes this rhythm can be a very denite one. If we study in detail the behaviour of the water as it moves along, welearn that the meandering stream is woven through with a play of inner movements. Within the body of moving water there are ner streamings, currents of water spiralling round one another, and, according to the direction of the spiralling movement, so creating 38 39the curves of the river. Rounded off into a flowing whole and creating its bed as it goes along, the river is an individuality, an organism with its own inner rhythms, as though living and moving within its own skin. The example of the Gulf Strearn shows that even currents of water flowing through water may retain their iden tity in this way. Indeed, we may regard any stream of flowing water as a totality, within which there is a complex system of inner streamings, with surfaces of water gliding and spiralling past one another in manifold and often very regular rhythms. With imaginative insight, Schwenk sees how the forms of many unicellular water animals, often hardly departing from the fluid state, picture in their more xed form the delicate inner spiralling movements of flowing water. But not only these; also animal organs through which water streams, often reveal the same kind of twisted spiralling surfaces. Once the eye is opened to these spiralling surfaces, they are to be seen everywhere in nature: in the forms of bones, in muscle bres, in animal horns, in shells, in plants. Forms which can be seen in flowing water\u2014sometimes made more clearly visible by ingen ious manipulations in the laboratory\u2014are seen again in the fixed and nished natural forms of the kingdoms of nature. The rst illustration reproduced here shows, for example, forms which may arise and flow away with the water when it passes a submerged stone. These forms are made visible when the current stirs up nely powdered clay which has been introduced into the water. The spiral form of the shell in the second illustration is very reminiscent of this transient water form. In a chapter devoted in detail to the formation of waves, a close comparison is drawn between the rhythmical action of waves andthe movements, for example, of shes' ns or of the whole body of a moving snake. A wonderful photograph of a swimming grass- snake reveals how the waves created in the water by the rhythmical movement of the animal's body merge with the moving form of the body itself as though into a single organism. With great ingenuity in the laboratory , Schwenk has been able to make visible and to photograph the delicate inner currents which appear as rhythmically moving, developing forms when, for example, a stream of water penetrates still water, or the like. Theresults are indeed astonishing. Hidden within the fluid element itself are to be found the same highly complicated rhythmical movements and processes which take place in the bodily development of a living organism. For instance, when waves of different lengths interpenetrate, structures appear which are simply the result of an interplay of different rhythmical streaming movements. This is an important principle in all embryological processes. An essential part of the book is the description of vortices and vortex rings. These often highly intricate forms arise when the 40Plate I Forms in flowing water as it passes a submerged stone.

Wherever these hollow spaces arise\u2014when one layer of water, moving faster, overtakes another slower layer\u2014the water is drawn into circling movements not of pressure, but of suction.^ Such a space, void of water and exerting suctional forces, is at the centre of the spiralling vortex.The Sun itself corresponds to the centre of the vortex. T o quote from Das Sensible Chaos: \"The vortex is a moving part within a moving whole. It has its own rhythms, forms its own surfaces and creates a connection with cosmic distances. These are qualities which belong to an organic formative process. The vortexis a separate entity in a flowing whole, much as an organ is an individualized part of the whole organism, while at the same time being closely integrated with it. The organ, too, receives its orient ation from the entire organism and is also related to the cosmic surroundings. It has its own rhythm and its own inner surfaces give it its distinct form.\" In considerable detail, yet with simple eloquence, Schwenk describes manipulations with flowing water, whereby forms created by these sensitive surfaces arise in the water . He calls them forms of balance, for they are created in the interplay of the streaming forces at work in the water and change their shapes sensitively not only in response to changes in these streaming movements, but also\u2014as experiment shows\u2014rto external stimuli even of a distant cosmic nature. Resting forms, capable of an inner individual movement of their own, they come about purely in the interplay of different rhythmical movements in the water. In so doing, they are reminiscent again and again of nished forms in the kingdoms of nature; furthermore, in revealing the formative processes whereby they come into being, they suggest the type of structural development which may well underlie such forms. A great part of the book is given over to descriptions concerning the reaction of these water surfaces to outer stimuli and to com parisons between these water forms and forms and formative processes in living nature. Among these gure largely organs, especially sense-organs, in animal and man; in p^ticular the eye,the ear, the digestive tract and the heart. The beautiful photo graphs and the illustrations to the text give an artistic ease of inter pretation to what would otherwise be a highly technical work. Though on the biological side many questions remain open and a 1 Reference has repeatedly been made to this arresting and from the purely physical point of view difcult concept put forward by RudolfStciner, always with insistence on the fact that it is indispensable for the understanding of the living kingdoms of nature and man. A note at the endof this article gives references to publications relating to this subject. 41great deal still remains to be discovered and taken beyond the stage of mere comparisons, yet these comparisons between the hid den worlds of water and of life are very stimulating and give the reader much food for thought. The behaviour of air in relation to water and in its own element, and also in relation to warmth or re, inspires in Schwenk a grand picture of atmospheric and meteorological phenomena, in which hesees again, on a gigantic scale, the creation of \" organs \" within the great breathing organism of the earth and her surrounding atmos phere, by means of which cosmic forces enter into the sphere of earth. Behind each leaf, each twig in the forest, the wind spirals in vortices; over the oceans and land masses are formed the meteoro logical zones of high and low pressure. The earth turns on its axis,and in rhythmic interplay with cosmic influences, between day and night, between wet and dry, warm and cold, between expansion and contraction, the meteorological events\u2014like changing moods\u2014take place about its surface and in its atmosphere. It is a vast breathing process. Here, too, the forms which arise do so as a result of the streaming movements, and what we have learned to see in water we see again here. With the air there comes sound, and from the relatively silent worlds of water we emerge into the singing, sounding element of air and contemplate the forms and movements of birds and insects which live in the worlds of light and colour around the earth. In the sensitive streaming of air, sounds are created, whether m the mighty sounding forth of the earth in wind and storm, in the sighingof the wind in the trees, or in the sounds emitted by ensouled beings. In this connection, Schwenk reproduces photographs taken by Paul Eugen Schiller when experimenting in the Goetheanum labor atories with sensitive flames\u2014a further development of Tyndalls famous work on \" singing flames It was at Rudolf Sterner s sug gestion that these experiments were made, and Schiller shows, among other things, the different rhythms and plastic forms engendered by the flame when responding to the vowel sounds of human speech or the notes produced by the violin and other musical instruments. In his last chapter, Schwenk returns once more to the theme of creative movements; he likens the formative movements to the tools or instruments whereby forms are created in the elements; or to the hands of a potter, with their inherent creative possibilities, mould ing the vessel from within and from without, and then, when it is nished, withdrawing into obscurity. He describes the humanlarynx, showing how, having been once created through movement,it is now itself capable of all possible variations of movement, and by means of these movements can form and mould the stream of air into the great variety of sounds and tones which we hear emerging from it. Unformed, the air streams from the lungs into the larynx, where it is nely structured into waves, vibrations, vortices, thence coming forth in ever-changing forms from the organs of speech.Rich indeed is the possibility of form-creation as the word emerges. Every time man speaks, says Rudolf Steiner,^ he reaches back to the time of the creation. Here we come to the inner connection of this world of moving forms with the new art of Eurythmy; for in Eurythiny the arche typal movements underlying all creation are made visible by the moving human form. Schwenk concludes with the words: \" Whether we speak of streaming water or moving air; of the formation of organs or the movements of the human form; of speech; of Eurythmy, or of the ordering movements of the stars, it is all the same. We speak ofthe archetypal gestures of the cosmic Alphabet\u2014the gestures of the Word of Worlds, which makes use of the element of movement in order to bring forth nature and man.\" In a short afterword, Schwenk shows how the knowledge of the secrets of the creative word, always hidden in the Mystery Temples and now forgotten, still remains like a memory reflected in a few ancient works of art\u2014stone carvings, for example, from ancient Greece or Celtic Ireland. As illustrations he has gathered some beautiful examples (among them the fourth illustration reproduced here\u2014a Greek tombstone), showing how again and again the forms revealed by the flowing media of water and air appear in them. The contemplation of flowing water leads not only to a deeper insight into the creation of forms; it will also lead to a fuller under standing of movement itself. We apprehend only one aspect of movement if we simply think of it as it takes place in the xed dimensions of three-dimensional physical space. Incarnated as we are into the space of the earth, we experience this physical aspect of movement in a very real way. To take an example from water itself: a moving column of water emitted at force from a hosepipe makes a powerful impact and can remove at speed obstacles with which it comes into contact. The moving stream embodies a physi cal force which engenders physical material movement. We have, however, also learned of gentler, even imperceptible movements in water and have related them to an aspect of the waterwhich is less physical and comes nearer to life. But to regard these 1 Lecture of June 24, 1924. 42simply as very rened physical movements, like those takmg placein rigid three-dimensional space, would still only lead to half-truths in our researches into the essential nature of water and of life. We must here make the great effort required in order to begin to understand what Rudolf Steiner really meant when (as mentioned above) he spoke so urgently about the true aspect of the Sun in relation to the Earth. For just as there is a fundamental polarity between the three-dimensional space of the earth and the space of the sun, so does a like polarity express itself in movement. Movement arises in the working together of the forces of earth substance, the interior of the sun is void of matter and exerts forces, resulting in the formation of vortices. This can happen not onlywhen the dividing surface is between air and water, but also, for instance, when it is between water and water, when two currentsflow together or when a single current is parted by an obstruction. (The same applies to currents of air.) The surfaces, movmg pastone another at differing speeds, roll in upon one another, creatmg circling, spiralling formations within the single medium, whereby awhole string of vortices may arise. The third illustration reproduced here shows one among the many ways in which a train of vortices has been made vismle m thelaboratory as it appears on the surface of the watw . Below the surface the vortices\u2014hollow conical forms created by the inward spiralling surfaces, here very shallow , though they may also be quitedeep\u2014reach down more or less vertically into the water . Here alsothe rhythmical element in flowing water is revealed m the rhythmi cal repetition of the vortices one beyond the other. 1 his type oi rhythmical repetition occurs again and again m natural forms, fori n s t a n c e , i n s h e l l s ( p l a t e I I ) , i n t h e t w i s t e d h o r n s o f a n i m a l s s u c h a sthe African Kudu-antelope, and in countless forms of the plant kingdom. Schwenk attaches great signicance to the surfaces which so nely and intimately interpenetrate flowing water . Invisible for tnemost part in clear running water, they occur example, where sticks or stones or the pillars of a bridg the smooth flow. . .

T o these Schwenk attributes an actual quality of sensitiveness; he considers them to be sensitive regions in the water. Water, he says, J\u00ae J , the inert mass we usually regard it to be; it is impressionable medium, traced through with mnumerable sensiti^m e m b r a n e s \u2014 o r g a n s w i t h w h i c h i t r e c e i v e s i n f l u e n c e s n o t o ^ y f r o mits nearby surroundings, but from the planetary spheres. ^ far-reaching statement; yet experiments already undertaken show it to be true.A vortex is an entity within the water which retains its own characteristics of form, rhythm and movement. Its properties are such that it is a microcosmic picture of the macrocosmic processes relating to Kepler's Second Law. The further the planets are from the sun, the more slowly they move; the nearer they are, the faster. The same applies to the way water moves in a vortex. But for the fact that it is a physical impossibility, water at the centre of a vortex would be moving innitely fast. In actual fact, it simply with draws from that region, leaving a hollow space within the water. Schwenk quotes from a lecture by Rudolf Steiner (June 24, .1921) in which he describes how the Sun is in all respects in entire con trast to the Earth. Instead of being densely lled with material in the sphere of gravity and forces of another character ^as yet un known to science\u2014related rather to the surrounding cosmos. Move m e n t s m a y b e i m b u e d m o r e w i t h o n e o r w i t h t h e o t h e r t y p e o f f o r c e .The quality and gestures of movements, and also of forms, clearly reveal, once the eye has been educated to perceive it, the interplaybetween gravitational forces and the anti-gravitational or \"levita- tional\" forces. In contrast to the centric, gravitational forces, the forces of levity are peripheral and planar, working in towards the living entities on earth from universal space. W e see the gestures ofthese forces most simply in the plant world, where the root belongs more to the earth, while the shoot reveals the planar gestures and movements of the ethereal spaces and forces of the sun.^ We see them too in the forms and movement of the human body, so won derfully poised between the two worlds.^ Particularly m the movements of Eurythmy we learn to experience the planar quality of t h i s o t h e r a s p e c t o f m o v e m e n t . . , , . Human movement is a manifestation of rhythmic man; it arisesin the interplay of the forces of gravity and those of levity . So, too, the movements of water. And when we learn to apprehend in water that aspect whereby it rises above and reaches beyond the physical world, we begin to look\u2014as we do when we look into the growing point of a plant or the heart of a flower\u2014into the sun spaces of theuniverse. For the spiralling vortex of water, caught into the cosmc movement, and the spiralling plane upon plane of the leavM in the q u i e t s p a c e o f a g r o w i n g s h o o t , a r e s i s t e r f o r m s ; b o t h s p e a k o f t h e working of cosmic powers into the living organs of the ^rth.Men have often expressed these truths m art.

Following Rudolf Steiner*s indications, in cultivating a new mathematics and deriving new scientic con cepts from it, thence applying these concepts to the phenomena of hydrodynamics, we look towards a future time when mankind, like Peter, seemingly surrounded by a sinking world, will experience the Being who walks upon the Waters. Then the science of hydro dynamics will once more accord to Water its high place in the life of the earth and of man and will learn to deal with it according to its true nature.

That there has been such a change is not just a general impression; it is revealed in the subjects chosen for adult education (by the students themselves), and in the predominant themes among paper-backed books. Against this view might be urged the high proportion of votersat Parliamentary elections, and the fairly extensive treatment of international affairs on television. The swing is by no means an absolute one. But it can be maintained that voting and viewing are much influenced by a deep desire to be allowed to get on, oneself, with the tasks and opportunities of personal living, without too much interference from above, and to nd out whether other people are being allowed to get on with their own affairs, too. This tendency is sometimes put down flatly to materialism and selshness; everyone, it is said, just wants to enjoy his own improved standard of living. But it could also be put down partly to a cer tain disillusionment about the results of this improved standard. A fervent interest in economics which existed in the twenties and thirties looked towards full employment and the overcoming of poverty as the great goals; they are now claimed as basic rights,and yet life is evidently incomplete. And for this reason interest turns, for example, towards psychology or art. It may be, too, that after a certain point the study of political and economic questions has been found particularly baffling and unsatisfying, because there seems to be no convincing wider frame work into which the details can be tted. Since the idea of general, automatic progress has been so thoroughly shaken there is no ready- made way of tting present-day events into the stream of time; and so we set off into the past for guidance; and perhaps may not return. We can easily become fascinated by some past civilisation, and yet nd that it does not provide us with any unambiguous lessons for the present. Passing events can only really make sense before a vision which penetrates into the fundamental purposes of human existence\u2014which must mean in the end Divine purposes for man. (Hence the great hopes with which a wide public turned towards the writingsof Teilhard de Chardin.) Yet it is not enough to conceive these purposes only in a universal, abstract way; we need insight into the heavenly purpose for this particular time.The work of Rudolf Steiner showed that such insight is possible. He showed in specic detail how the course of history is guided by 46 G.B.^47individuals who work out in their lives purposes which they have made their own in the spiritual world before their physical birth. He could give this comprehensive picture only because he possessed capacities for supersensory experience, trained and tested in themost exact, conscientious way. But others can examine the validity of his statements by using ordinary powers of observation and judgment.He spoke often, for example, of differences in consciousness at the flowering-time of Greek and Roman civilisation and in the present. He spoke of a turning point in this respect about thebeginning of the fteenth century . Many ways of thinking and feeling natural to the Greek and Roman were continued up to theend of the Middle Ages. And then, through slow stages, a radically new kind of consciousness developed, which has become pre dominant today. \u00bb It is a mark of this new consciousness that human relationshipsare in some ways much more difcult today than they wwe in the past. Once human beings found quickly and almost effortlesslyw h a t t h e y w e r e t o o n e a n o t h e r ; w h e t h e r a s a f e s o r o p p o n e n t ^ t h e y were condent of knowing how to deal with one another.

And as we come to know one another well, we begin to recognise the relationship as between spiritual entities not coinedbetween the limits of birth and death.

I t i s n fquestions of war and peace, to ask about the signMarxism for the development of human consciousness.The intellectual and emotional roots of Marxism can be traced back to the Greek philosophers and the Hebrew prophets. But the result is a closed system of extraordinary tightness. It has what Koestler has described as the special mark of such closed systems: the possession of built-in replies to all possible criticisms. It sees individuals essentially and only as representatives of social conflicts. Thus in Communist countries, at the present time, a kind of double world comes into being\u2014the description of people and events in terms of the ruling formulae, and the actual personal relationships. The ruling public opinion must appear to condemn the uniqueness of a personal relationship as a distracting irrelevance, a hindrance to the achievement of social goals. Is there anything within Marxism which could lead it further, into greater harmony with the needs of the individual ? Or can we only hope that Marxist countries will develop other interests side by side with this ideology, as the nations of Western Europe gradually paid less regard to theological controversy, though still giving their allegiance to Roman Catholicism or Protestantism, from the last years of the seventeenth century onwards ? The crucial unresolved question within Marxism is the problem of power. Marx looked forward on his level to a blessed com munity not dissimilar to that contemplated by the Hebrew prophets on theirs\u2014a brotherhood where no human being exercises power over another, but each serves in freedom the common purpose. The criticism directed by Djilas against Communist parties or individuals that have become too attached to their own power is in harmony with genuine Marxism. There are thus two conceivable ways out, as it were, of a tyrannical Communist system without disastrous war: through a diversion of interest to new problems and factors in the social situation, or through a rekindling of the prophetic re which is at the core of Marxism, however greatly misunderstood. On either way human individuality, and genuine personal relation ships, would begin to nd release. Marxism, though proclaiming itself the enemy of all religions, has many of the qualities of a dogmatic religion. And it is signi cant to observe its difcult contacts not only with Christianity, but with the other world religions as well. We see Islam putting up a particularly vigorous and effective resistance to Marxism; and yet,in spite of the obvious contrast between a religion which every where proclaims the omnipotence of God and an atheist philosophy of history , there are spiritual afnities as well. It is as if Islam and Marxism had divided between them impulses inherited from the Hebrew prophets, while rejecting everything that leads directly into Christianity . They have in common an intense preoccupation with man as an earthly being; and although Islam teaches an existence after death, it is in pictures which strongly reflect earthly conditions.The disciple of Islam is given a sense of his individual duty and responsibility , yet he is encompassed by a revelation which he is taught to regard as nished and complete. This revelation emphasises his origin in physical human seed; there is no doorway back through birth into the spiritual world. It is again in a sense aclosed system, utterly rejecting its opponents\u2014which are, in the Koran itself, Judaism and Christianity. And yet in this rejection there is a mysterious, unmistakable note of disappointed love. We need not look for expressions of this only in the past; only a few months ago Turkish students brought great gifts of flowers to Christian churches, after a mosquein Cyprus had been damaged by Christians, as their quiet and patient answer. And it looks as if Moslems in Algeria will provemore forgiving than many peoples have done who called them selves Christian. The Koran proclaims the greatness of Abraham, of Moses, and of Jesus. Nevertheless, in its words about Jesus the greatest barrier between Islam and Christianity is erected. For the Koran, as generally understood, denies Christ's death upon the Cross. Amongthe wrongdoings of the Jews, the Koran numbers Their saying, 'We slew the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God yet they did not slay him, neither crucied him. only a likeness of that was shown to them. Fifty years ago it might have seemed likely that Christians and Moslems could come nearer to one another in a common accep tance of Jesus as teacher of the one God. Today there is a strong re-assertion among Christians of Christ's Divinity and Resurrection. Is there then less hope than ever of mutual understanding between Moslem and Christian ? For countless human souls, in centuries to come, when the heritage of previous incarnations begins to stir within them, it willbe of the greatest signicance if they can form a steady inner picture of the Crucixion. For that part of us, which is trying toawaken, is not born of the generations; it is born of what stands on the other side of death, which shines through to us on this side from the Cross. Souls deeply influenced by Islam may be d^ply hindered in this experience, unless perhaps the Koran can be under stood in another way; that the error of the Jews lay in their belief that they had won a victory over Christ Jesus, at the moment of His eternal triumph. and they slew him not of a certainty . no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is All-mighty, All-wise. Liberation from what seems enclosed and nished in Islam can conceivably come from within\u2014through a willingness ^ learn mdetail and concretely about the relations to Islam of those other revelations, the reality of which it does acknowledge. More 50externally, and yet with far-reaching promise for the future, Islam is learning from the social needs of modern States, and the difcul ties of choice among methods of government which have all proved dangerous.In particular, we see Moslem countries struggling with the problems of the party system, which in the West has appeared as an inseparable adjunct of freedom and democracy. And yet even where it is long established, it is not everywhere looking entirely healthy. The party system appears to work best when it expresses deep-rooted but not irreconcilable differences among social groups and classes; it is by no means easy simply to invent a party system, as was attempted in Turkey. It is as if a genuinely democratic alternative to the party system should by this time have been devised by the West\u2014and the West has been unable to do this. * Countries with a Hindu or Buddhist tradition are perhaps rather more adaptable to present-day conditions. Hinduism and Buddhism have a better record of mutual tolerance among different theologi cal schools than either Islam or Christianity. And they are not in principle closed intellectual systems, but have long welcomed a great variety of thought, belief and practice.Are they then favourably placed, both for the political develop ment of the countries in which they flourish, and for that tranquil individual growth through which the consequences of earlier incarn ations can come to right consciousness ? The gulf between belief in reincarnation in general, and a right understanding of individual karma in the sense described by Rudolf Steiner, is a very great one. And the teaching of reincarnation, as it is usually cultivated in the Hindu or Buddhist tradition, generally emphasises overwhelmingly the tragic aspect of karma. What is individual\u2014^this tradition holds\u2014is what separates man from universal Reality . And yet individualism has ^own so strong that it ds inescapable; as the Dalai Lama has said, it is present even in our dreams. And thus some who stand in these traditions, par ticularly those who feel a strong call towards practical service in the present world, may come very close to Christianity\u2014as did, for example, Sri Aurobindo\u2014without losing contact with the greatness of the Hindu tradition. For it is the Christ Who makes of indivi dual characteristics uniting bonds, instead of barriers, between us and universal Reality. * Christianity itself was not originally a closed system. The NewTestament everywhere proclaims a growing spiritual life, and a rich variety among the early congregations. But immense intellectual and practical ability has been used with the purpose of transform ing Christianity into a closed theological and ecclesiastical system. It is not only those standing in the Roman tradition who have done 51this; it has happened to some degree almost everywhere. But the Roman Catholic Church can be taken as the most signicant example in the modern world; and in many, many of its methods and activities we see the shadow of ancient Rome projected into the modem world. The emphasis on the Latin language is not just an externality; it expresses an attachment to ways of feeling about the individual human being which belong to an earlier time, and a resistance against the struggling modem consciousness. And yet most impressive examples can be found of faithful Roman Catho lics, who contemplate the present world with all the agony and objectivity which it demands. The consequences of such an attitudeof mind can be studied in Professor Hans Kiing's The Council and Reunion. His theme is everywhere the responsibility of the indivi dual in the Christian community, wherever he may stand; Pope, Bishop, priest, layman\u2014^Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant. Professor Kiing speaks appreciatively of the work of the World Council of Churches, in which Roman Catholics have not hitherto taken part, though ofcial contacts now exist. It is here perhaps that we may particularly look for signs that Christian organisations are prepared to overcome their limitations and their rigidities. And we do indeed nd, for example, in the reports from New Delhi, the development of a language which is not simply an echo from the past, and which speaks in terms of Christ as a Being, and the particular needs of men, and hardly ever of conflicting doctrines. All the more clearly, however, certain basic weaknesses of Christianity in our time become evident. The report of the section on Service, for example, touches on nature, science and technology: The nature that scientists investigate is part of God's creation; the truth they discover is part of God's truth; the abilities they use are God-given. The Christian should welcome scientic discoveries as new steps in man's dominion over nature. We must recognize, however, that many, within and without the Christian Church, are puzzled about the relationships between God, man and nature. There is urgent need for the development of a theology of nature (as part of an inclusive theology) and its statement in language that can he understood by the men in the pew or laboratory. We should not fear scientic discovery, but we should be deeply concerned about its applications. Science and technology are instru ments in the hands of man. They can be used for good or evil purposes. The use of nuclear power for war or peace, the abuse or conservation of natural resources, the application of automation, are examples. But a decision about the use to be made of a par ticular scientic discovery is not a scientic decision; it is an ethical decision. It will be intelligent only if based on sound scienti^ and technological understanding; it will be good only if motivated by the will to serve man. Should it not be evident, by the nineteen-sixties, that this is very much too simple ? Ethical problems and scientic problems can not really be separated in this way. In the use of a new drug, or in the decision to develop the use of atomic energy at a particular 52moment, ethical and scientic problems are inextricably mixed. It is not enough to develop a theology of nature after the sciences and technology; for these depend at every step, though generally uncon sciously, on particular moral and spiritual attitudes to nature, ^e report itself seems to slip into one of the disastrous preconceptionsof technological practice in speaking of a decision as good \"if motivated by the will to serve man \". Has not modern man a grow ing, uneasy sense that the universe may have some interest in thefates of other creatures, and not exclusively in him ? This is indeed a crucial problem for many of those who are puzzled in the way the report describes; and an explicit answer can be found in St. Paul,when he speaks of nature in travail, waiting for man's help. If Christians really face this problem, and think it out to the end, two far-reaching consequences will follow. They will no longer be able to leave the idea of reincarnation as the hobby of a few within Christianity, a serious teaching only outside it. For the redemption of Nature is clearly a long-term task, not to be learned completely within a single life. And a flood of light will be thrown upon all the difculties that arise in connection with human work. * One of Rudolf Steiner's most puzzling statements was that a great obstacle to the recognition of reincarnation in its true form lay in the wage system. Perhaps the line of thought taken here can help a little with this. For an understanding of the innermost pur poses of an individual can grow up best where a group of peoplework together steadily at a common task. If they are held together only by money relationships and forced into relentless competition in order to achieve status or security, the atmosphere for a deeper mutual understanding will be continually poisoned. Such a statement may sound both banal and theoretical; and yet the conflict it attempts to describe is deep and pervasive inmodern life. That a rm or an industry should be concerned about redundancy , for example, and not simply pass on the responsibility to the State, springs from a moral feeling of the connection between men working on a shared task. \"We have sought one another to transform a life on earth in a particular way, and to learn a feeling of kinship to some of its creatures; blind monetary forces should not separate us again.\" So might part of an unconscious protest be e x p r e s s e d \u2014 w h i l e t h e c o n s c i o u s p r o t e s t i s p h r a s e d i n t e r m s o f w a g e s S f c e \" h e t i m e w h e n R u d o l f S t e i n e r w r o t e , v e r y m u c h h a s b e e n done to raise human livelihood into the sphere of Rights, and to protect it from the incalculable shifts of the market. But much more will be needed; we are still far from the kind of brotherly Associations of producers and consumers in particular branches of industry which Rudolf Steiner advocated. If the Common Market grows, to include Britain and other 53countries, it will become more and more plainly a giant in need of a soul. If the tasks of Christianity in the quality of scientic thinking and in the shaping of economic co-operation begin to be more effectively recognised, the soul will grow. Such efforts would be of evident value for the world as a whole; they would help to dispel the impression, which seems to be strong in Africa and in the East (and can we say that it is without foundation ?), that there is a certain amount of selshness and European pride about the whole plan. That pooling of capabilities, which the Treaty of Rome envisages, is really needed by the world as a whole. Those who can work as doctors, or teachers, or architects, for example, should be able to work wherever in the world they nd like-minded people with whom to co-operate. It is often in such encounters that the most signicant relationships of destiny in our time begin to come to light. Where the positive human relationships on which the future depends are frustrated, a spiritual void can come about, which gives an opportunity to the forces which bring about war. It is not enough to desire peace; this, after all, may mean little more than a desire to be left undisturbed. Genuine peace depends upon over coming the haibits of thought and life which prevent human beings from recognising and loving each other as they truly are, and can become.Goddess into Saint: The Foster-Mother of Christ Isabel Wyatt (Though both goddess and saint are kpown as BRIDGHE in Gaelic, and in English as BRIDE or BRIGIT, for the sake of clarity BRIDGHE is here used solely for the goddess, and BRIDE and BRIGIT for the saint.) 1 G a e l i c l e g e n d t e l l s h o w , w h e n S t . B r i d e w a s a c h i l d s o y o u n gthat she could neither speak nor walk, she was cast adrift with her foster-father in a frail coracle, which bore them from their native Ireland to Imiis nan Dnildhneach, the Isle of the Druids, that small Atlantic island now famous as lona, whose very rock goes back to the springtime of the Earth. And as they landed (in that same Cove of the Coracle where St. Columba was to land a century later). Bride suddenly walked and talked; and the words she spoke were these: \" I am but a little child. Yet my mantle shall be laid On the Lord of the World. The King of the Elements Himself Shall rest upon my heart. And I will give Him peace.\" The legend tells how the Druids of lona brought her up, prepar ing her for a high destiny , for they recognised in her the fullmentof a prophecy that to them would come a child in whom dwelt an Immortal. One day she was led by a white dove through a grove of rowans beside a mountain lake to a distant rain-parched land; and there, within a stable, she assisted as \" aid-woman \" (midwife) at the birth of the Holy Child, and upon his brow put the three drops of pure water which united him with the Earth. Because of the drought, there was no milk to give the new-born Babe; but Bride sang runes of Paradise to the cow which stood beside the manger , and the milk flowed miraculously. So it was wrapped in Bride's blue mantle and held against Bride's heart that the Child rst tasted earthly nourishment and was received into the community of men; therefore is Bride known as Muime Chriosda, the Foster-mother of Christ, and as Ban-chuideachaidh Moire, Aid-woman of Mary, and as Bana-ghoistidh Mhic De, Godmother of the Son of God. As the g-tree was the Jewish and the juniper the German, so was the rowan the Celtic tree of Initiation; and groves of it are even today frequently to be found mingling with the oak-groves near ancient Druid stone-circles. Through such a rowan-grove, the white dove, always a heavenly messenger, leads Bride out of earthly life into those super-earthly realms where cosmic memory still lives in 5455mighty pictures, there to participate retrospectively in that tremendous happening which ushered in the turning-point of time. So we can see this experience as an Initiation. In its personal aspect it can become transparent for a step in Bride's own spiritual development \u2014the birth of the spirit-child in her own soul. But with human beings of special stature or peculiar grace it may sometimes happen that an experience is at one and the same time fraught both with personal and with super-personal signicance. So we ask ourselves:Had Bride's Initiation such a super-personal signicance ? And if so, along what paths and in what spheres is this to be found ? II Bride's setting is the Ireland of the late fth and early sixth cen turies, an Ireland where for the most part Christianity and Druidism peaceably share one house, even the menhirs often bearing a Christian cross on one side, a pre-Christian symbol on the other. Strange and wonderful things are recorded of this saint. When', at the age of fourteen she took the veil, a column of re was seen above her head; and as she knelt and kissed the wooden feet of the altar, they burgeoned into leaf and flower. Pious maidens flocked to her in her cell under an oak tree at Kildare; and the church she built there\u2014on the site of an earlier temple, and, like the temple, enclosed by a brushwood fence within which no man might pass\u2014was known as the House of Fire; for here for seven centuries (until, in 1220, the Archbishop of London caused it to be extinguished), the re upon the altar, which was tended nightly by each of her nuns in turn and which might not be breathed upon by human breath, never went out. The story is told of a King and (3ueen who came to inquire of a Druid where their child should be bom, and the Druid made answer: \"Happy is the child who is bom neither in the house nor out of the house.\" Now at that moment Brotseach, the Dmid's bond-maid, who had been sold to him by the Prince of Ulster at his jealous wtfe's insistence, reached the doorway of the house with her pitcher of new milk, and, feeling her moment come, sank down on her right knee in labour, as the women of the Gael still do today. So Bride was bom on the threshold, and, Brotseach's pitcher overturning, was bathed in still-warm milk. And all her life, the Irish peasants still aver, \" all the food she used was the milk of a white, red-eared cow set apart for her by a Druid.\" They say that it was angels who baptised her and gave her her name of Brigit. At night, when they cover the glowing peat with ashes \" to save the seed of the re for the morning \", they think of her as they pronounce this blessing: \" I save this fire as Christ saved everyone\u2014 Brigit beneath it, the Son of Mary within it.\" And they say that \" it is on her day the rst of the birds beginto make their nests, for the death of the year is done with and the birthday of the year is come.\" Concerning her day the Gael of Scotland say also:\" Brigit put her nger in the river on the feast-day of Brigit, And away went the hatching-mother of the cold.\" And again :\" On the day of Bride of the white hills. The snake comes forth from the hollow.\" And they tell how \" when Mary went up to the T emple for purica tion, Bride walked before her with a lighted candle in each hand. The wind was strong on the T emple heights, but the candles did not flicker. So she is called Bride of brightness, and her day, the feast- day of Bride of the candles.\" For her day, February the rst, the rst day of the Celtic spring, is Candlemas Eve, when both candles and the re in the thurible used to be blessed by the Celtic Church in readiness forthe momow's Feast of Purication. (By Rome the blessing of the re was omitted.) From this re was also kindled the Candlemas Brand, a portion of which was preserved throughout the year with which to light the Christmas Yule-log. In this custom, as in the legend of Bride as Foster-mother, a mystery is delicately indicated\u2014^the mystery ofBride's connection with the descent of Christ into earthly incarnation.^^ T o the Gael \" all beauty beneath the sky and beneath the sea \" belongs to Bride. Healing belongs to Bride\u2014\" May she win for us battles over every disease \", says the old Gaelic hymn. And she who was the Aid-woman of Mary is heavenly aid-woman still to the Gaelic mother in child-birth. In the Scottish Isles the earthly aid-woman comes to the threshold when the labour-pains b^in, and, making a cross of her body with her arms outstretched to the jambs, calls softly: \" Bride! Bride! Come in! Thy welcome is truly made. Give thou relief to the woman, And give the conception to the Trinity.' And the mother-to-be herself, clasping a Kidney of Mary (an Atlan tic nut mounted in silver and grown into the form of a cross) calls also on Bride: \"As Christ was conceived of Mary Full perfect on every hand. Assist thou me. Foster-mother,The conception to bring from the bone. And as thou didst aid the Virgin of joy.Without gold, without com, wthout kine. Aid thou me\u2014^great is my sickness Aid me, O Bride!\" In those holy incantations with which the Gaelic Islander , right up to our own time, was wont to consecrate each action of his day ,a portrait of Bride emerges which is a very epitome of Celtic sainth o o d a s o p p o s e d t o R o m a n . T h u s , i n t h e B e d B l e s s i n g : 5657\" Who are they by my bed ? The lovely Bride and her Fosterling.\" Or in The Sleep Shielding: \" May Bride the fair, the tender, Watch and ward this house. Her hue like the cottongrass. Rich-tressed maiden with ringlets of gold.\" Or in the Reaping Blessing: \" God, bless Thou Thyself my reaping For the sake of Michael, head of hosts. And Bride, smooth-white with ringleted locks.\" In the Milking Blessing : \" T h e c a l m B r i d e o f t h e w h i t e c o m b s Will give to my loved heifer the lustre of the swan. The melodious Bride will give thee offspring and young.\" In the Herding Blessing: \" Bride of the fair palms, guard thou my flocks.\" In the Churn Charm: \" Come, thou beauteous Bride, And bless the substance of my kine.\" In the Figwort Charm : \" O Bride, of women benecent, Put fruitage in the kine.\" And in the Womanhood of twining hair, of the augury, Brigit of the white feet, Brigit of the white palms, Brigit of the kine\u2014 Brigit is my comrade-woman, my maker of song. My choicest of women, my woman of guidance; My companion beloved is Brigit!\"\" Calm Bride the generous; Bride, maiden of graces; Bride of the blessings; Bride of the fairy swan; Virgin of a thousand charms; the holy maiden Bride, radiant flame of gold; thou Bride, fair, charming, pleasant to me the breath of thy mouth; noble is Bride the gentle fair on her knee; great Bride, milkmaid of Christ; of gentleness; the quiet Brigit's guarding be shielding me, be aiding me \"\u2014the worshipping phrases flow together to reveal a Christian saint who is a being of enchantment. Something of the Graces has gone into her making; she wields the wholesome magic of a wise-woman; her beauty, her graciousness, her golden locks are those of a fairy princess. A more than human greatness breathes from her, as from beings in a myth. In her there does indeed dwell an Immortal. In the Celtica of the ancient world, which included most of Cen tral and Western Europe, a certain goddess was most widely wor shipped. As Brigantia she gave her name to the Spanish town ofBrigantia and to the Brigantes, the largest of the Celtic ttibes, whocarved out of England her largest county, Yorkshire, whom Ptolemy's map shows also inhabiting south-eastern Ireland, and whose occupation of the shores of Lake Constance gave to it its Latin name, Lacus Brigantinus, and to Brienz its Latin name, Brigantinum. In Gaul this goddess was known as Brigindo, and inscriptions to her under this name still exist in Eastern France. In other parts of the Continent she was known as Brigan and Brig. In Ireland she was known as Bridghe. Bridghe was the goddess of dan, knowledge, and of quickenmgin every sphere, both of ponderables and of imponderables. She was drawn through the elds in her chariot in spring, and was seen as a virgin bearing a child in her arms. Cattle were sacred to her, and a libation of milk was poured daily on her altars. She was\" protectress of women, keeper of dreams and prophecies, watcher of destinies, guardian of the future.\" The Celtic reflection of the Logos\u2014in Ireland Ogma, god of language and literature, in Gaul Ogmios, god of eloquence\u2014was her son. Hers was that originalHouse of Fire which had preceded St. Bride's at Kildare; there nobly born virgin priestesses known as Daughters of Fire, the predecessors of St. Bride's nuns, like them tended a perpetual flame. A perpetual fl a m e w a s B r i d g h e ' s s y m b o l . , The rowan, the quicken-tree, the tree of quickening, was sacred to Bridghe, together with the Celtic Rowan Month (mid-January to mid-February), the mid-point of which (February the rst) was helato mark the quickening of the year. Cormac, the tenth-centiny Christian King-Archbishop of Cashel, who with loving collected and preserved much pagan Celtic lore, tells us: inis B r i d g h e i s a p o e t e s s , a g o d d e s s w h o m p o e t s w o r s h i p p e d o n a c c ( ^ n iof the great and illustrious protection afforded them by h\u00aer- Irish Ollumh, the master-poet who had passed through the niglwsi bardic Initiation, carried a branch of chiming golden bells m ner honour. She was invoked as Bridghe of the Holy the Golden Hair, Bridghe of the White Feet, Bridghe of the Whi e Hills, Bridghe the White Swan, Mother of the Kmg of Gio y . Daughter of the Sun, Woman of Healing. . , .mjoiitIf we regard Bridghe merely as an abstraction such as mg spring from our intellectual consciousness today , we shall SO Va s t r a y . T h e C e l t i c w o r l d - c o n c e p t i o n fl o w e d o u t o f a Q j J J t econsciousness\u2014a consciousness based on vision \"^tothan those visible only to the purely /-oic seer aliving form to be met with in those worlds the CeUic seenmanifestation of one of those divine spitfl\"^, tanestrv ofcarnated in a fleshly body, exist and work behind t P y the sense-world which is of their own weavmg. onH RrJHpThe correspondences between Bridghe, Celtic Celtic saint, are inescapable. The one is ^ p o w e r s , a t t r i b u t e s a n d r i t e s ; t h e r e a r e e p i t h e t s h a n d e d d o w n f r o m 58goddess to saint completely unchanged. But merely to dismiss St. Bride, as current scholarship does, as \" a disguised Celtic deity\", or, in the phrasing of The Golden Bough, \"a pagan goddess in a threadbare Christian cloak\", is to miss the whole spiritual signi cance of the deep connection between them. For events of spiritual history, before they descend to earth to be lived out by men, are rstlived out by higher beings in a higher world. Thus, St. George comes to earth as earthly counterpart of the Archangel Michael, performing in the realm of matter those dragon-conquests already performed by Michael in the War in Heaven; and the slaying of Siegfried re-enacts on the physical plane the slaying of Baldur the Sun-god in aerial Asgard. So in Bridghe the goddess certain aspectsof Celtic destiny hover still in the heights which in Bride the saint are brought fully into incarnation. Bridghe yields place to Bride when a deed of the most solemn signicance for all future evolution has occurred\u2014^when the Christ-Being has united Himself with the Being of the Earth. Of the Celtic Mysteries the sixth-century Celtic Bard-Initiate, TaUesin, sings: \" Christ, the Word from the beginning, was from the beginning our Teacher, and we never lost His teaching. Christianity was in Asia a new thing; but there never was a time when the Druids of Britain held not its doctrines.\" Of what grounds have we knowledge today for so stupendous a claim? The faculty known as \"second-sight\", still found frequently among the Gael today, points back to a state of consciousness and method of cognition which characterised the Celts in earlier times. Theirs was a world most livingly and closely interpenetrated by the elements, whose interplay they saw not merely as wind-driven cloud and drifting sea-mist and sunlight uniting with spray flung against the cliffs, but also quite factually as an interweaving of activity of those spiritual beings whose garments the elements are. Less closely shuttered in the physical body than we are today, they were able to stream forth and mingle with the ensouled elements, Uving over into the sphere of the ether-forces which surround our planet, spreading their beings abroad and looking down, as it were, towards Earth from spaces nearer Heaven. The Druids in particular cultivated this gift, raising it into an enhanced and accurate perception of what took place behind the veils of matter; and among the Celtic saints were some who inherited it in a pure form if to a diminishing degree. \"Heaven has granted to some,\" said St. Columba, \"to see on occasion in their mind, clearly and surely, the whole of Earth and sea and sky.\" And thatSt. Columba himself was one who had this faculty is attested by Adamnan, his seventh-century biographer: \"St. Columba, as he himself did not deny, in some contemplations of divine grace beheldeven the whole world as if gathered together in one ray of the sun, gazing on it as manifested before him, while his inmost soul was enlarged in a wonderful manner.\" In the Hibernian Mysteries, the neophyte was prepared for Initiation by being plunged deep into the doubts and diflculties of knowledge. At the moment when tension reached the limits of endurance, it was resolved by the appearance, between the two immense statues round which the enigmas revolved, of an ineffably exalted Cosmic Being as Uniter, Answerer, Harmoniser. Of this Cosmic Being's centuries-long descent towards earthly incarnation the Druids, through their ability to flow out into spheres beyond the Earth, were aware: where other Mysteries were sadly cognisant only of His departure from that Sun of which He was the inforn^g Spirit, the Celtic seers, before He achieved physical incarnation, a ready saw Him quite concretely as King of the Elements on that last stage of His long journey which traversed the etheric mantlings of the Earth. An echo of this experience reverberates on even today in Gaelic carols. For example: \"A time ere came the Son of God, The earth was a black morass, Without star, without sun, without moon. Without body, without heart, without form. Illumined plains, illumined hills. Illumined the great green sea; Illumined the whole globe together. When His foot was come to JEarth.\" Or again:\" I behold mansions, I behold shores, I behold angels floating. I behold the shapely rounded column Coming landwards in friendship to us. Glowed to Him wood and tree. Glowed to Him mount and sea. Glowed to Him land and plain When the Son of God came to Earth.\" Such, indeed, was the sensitiveness of the Celtic seership th^at later , at that very moment when, in the East, the Crucixion on Oolgotna w a s t a k i n g p l a c e , t h e D r u i d s a w a y i n t h e W e s t w e r e a b l e t o p e r c e i v e it with direct spiritual vision, and to perceive it not ow ^ \"S p h y s i c a l m a n i f e s t a t i o n , b u t a l s o i n a l l t h e c h a n g e s w h i c h i t w r o u g h tin the kingdom of the elements. Memories of this Mystery-experience even today gleam here andthere through the stories of the Red Branch Q^le, that portion mthe Irish Mythological C^cle which deals ^dh the domgs of the heroes of Ulster at the time of the birth Christ. It tells, forexample, how the slain hero Cuchulain ^d Laeg\u00bb his ch^oteer , journeying through the air the Land of the Living pauseover Emain Macha. Ulster's royal city , and prophesy the cor^g world-reign of the King of the Elements. It tells how the RedBranch hero, Conaill of the Victories, is \"present\" at the Cruci xion. It tells how Conchubar mac Nessa, Ulster's king, saw \"unusual changes in the creation, the eclipse of the sun and the moon at the full,\" and, seeking a reason of his Chief Druid, was told of \" a hill in a distant land whereon stand three crosses, and on each cross a human form, and one thereof is like to the Immortals\"; and how Conchubar, driven into battle-frenzy in the Immortal's defence, attacks with his sword the oak-grove in which they are walking, bursts open an old strange head-wound, and so comes to his own death. Nor are these intimations conned to the heroes and Druids of Ulster. ^ At Tara, in Meath, also, soon to succeed Emain Macha as Ireland's paramount royal dun, a giant comes in immense splendour to the great council gathered there. He gives his name as Trefuilngid Tre-Eochair (the Triple Bearer of the Triple Key), and in his hand he bears a branch from the Lebanon from which hang three ripe fruits\u2014hazel nuts, acorns and apples. He is asked what ails the sun that day in the East, and he replies that in the land from which comes his fruiting bough the King of the Sun is that day being cruci- el. From the fruit which fell as he spoke, ve trees sprang up, and he left the council with the prophecy that these ve trees would remain until the King of the Sun should come into His own again. That the \" pagan \" Druids could perceive this divine Event half the round world away, and that they could perceive it not only in its outer physical manifestation but also in all its impact on Earth and Earth's ether-aura, lays the foundation for Celtic Christianity's experience of the Cosmic Nature of the Christ-Being. In those regions where the Celtic Mysteries had remained pure and had not degenerated into dark and magical practices, there was no need for \"conversion\"\u2014in Christianity these Mysteries found their own glorious and inevitable fullment. Celtic Christianity was uniquein that it was a kind of spontaneous birth, flowering out of and heir to all the supersensibly-perceived Christ-knowledge of the Druids. Druid and Bard of the old religion became quite naturally the &st priests of the new. V Bridghe, the historians tell us, was the culture-goddess of theCelts. Since all ancient cultures sprang and were shaped and nourished from one source\u2014the Mysteries\u2014we can see Bridghe as connected in a quite special way with the Celtic Mystery-Wisdom\u2014 that Mystery-Wisdom whose tree of Initiation was her tree; whose Initiation took place through the pangs of that knowledge which belonged to her domain; whose culture-heroes went forth far and wide, as far north as Iceland, as far south as Italy; and whose task it was to educate and civilise a pagan Europe. Their experiencing of the living interplay of the elements and of the weaving and eddying currents of the ether-forces of the Earth led the Druids to choose as the sites of their culture-temples regions where the veils between sensible and supersensible worlds were most transparent, and where the natural life-forces were so abundant that the images impressed from the cosmos upon the Earth's elemental mantle did not pass away but themselves became living. And it was precisely in these same centres (round Bridghe's Lake Constance, for example) that after the coming of Christianity, the Irish monks established their communities and built their wooden churches. With unerring steps, because guided by the same etheric knowledge, Celtic Christian missionary followed the same routes to the same journey's end as pre-Christian Celtic Druid, settling in what seemed often an out wardly inauspicious region, and by force of his own innocent holi ness taming its wild soul-life into gentleness. In the Celtic mythological hierarchy Bridghe belonged to the Tuatha De Danaan, those gracious and benecent Gods of Light who, the ancient manuscripts record, came to Ireland \"out of heaven, wafted on a magic cloud.\" And to this realm of heaven and magic cloud belongs each attribute and epithet by which we knowthis being. She is the shimmering guardian of those pure life-forces in which both Celtic soul and Celtic world were so radiantly abound ing, and which work in birth and growth and nourishment, so thatshe protects human motherhood and creaturely fruitfulness and bestows milk, that unfallen food which is barely yet of Earth. This is her sphere of holy re, radiating microcosmically within man's blood and macrocosmically in the mantle of warmth which embracesand interpenetrates the airy atmosphere of the Earth, and feeding that cloud of brightness which even outer eyes in earlier times saw permeating and surrounding the objects of sense-perception, so that the whole world seemed aflame. So she is Woman of Healing and Protectress of Poets, for it is out of this sphere of abundant life-forces that both healing and poetry flow . Dreams, destinies, prophecies were in her care, for thisis the sphere in which pictures of past and future live, giving knowledge of destiny to those who, from the earth's periphery , ^nread their script, and giving the gift of dreams to those who can nd their way into this sphere in sleep. T o this sphere belong the golden hair of spiritual wisdom; white feet still unsullied, for they have not yet trodden Earth; white hills whose uplifted peaks bwder on heavenly realms; the white swan that is the pure pre-natal being ofman. She is the Daughter of the Sun, for from the sun this realm receives its being, and it is into the place in cosmic space where the sun has been that Earth moves in spring and rejoices in its warmth. And she is Mother of the King of Glory, for this is the realm which received the Cosmic Image of the descending Christ, so that it was as King of the Elements that He was taken into the Celtic heart. Thus Bridghe did in sober fact enwrap the Christ in her mantle even before He had taken to Himself an earthly one. In Bridghe, even 63 G.B.\u20145before Christ reaches Earth, we can already see the divine and cos mic archetypal Foster-mother of the Christ. All these attributes of Bridghe has St. Bride, translated into terms of a saintly\u2014and, because Celtic, still half-heavenly\u2014earthly human incarnation. Well does she say, \" I am but a little child,\" for her forces, like those of the Celtic Church and of the Celtic race itself, are the bright, abounding life-forces of birth and childhood. Truly she is bom neither in the house nor out of the house, for she hovers on that threshold where Earth and Heaven meet. Bridghe's realm of holy re is Bride's realm, also; here she received from angelic hands the name and the mission both inherited from Bridghe. So her house also is a House of Fire and she herself is \"Bride, radiant flame of gold so she also is \" Bride, of women benecent, Brigit of the augury, Brigit of the kine. Bride of the white feet.Bride of the white hills. Bride of the fairy swan, rich-tressed maiden with ringlets of gold and the rowan-grove of her Initiation stands beside a mountain lake, for where there is tranquil fresh water, fed from heaven by rain, there the life-forces work especially strongly. She is \" melodious Bride, Bride my maker of song \", for she, like her divine prototype, has access to the well-springs of poetry in this sphere of holy re; and so lled with holy enchantment are her paradisal runes that she can charm celestial nourishment to flow even when Earth herself has grown dried-up and barren. In this celestial nourishment she herself is bathed at birth; such nourish ment sustains her all her earthly life, and has its source, as her child hood's shaping for her Christian destiny has its source, in a Druidic wisdom. All that is lovely in the sphere of the elements belongs to her\u2014\" aU beauty beneath the sky and beneath the sea.\" Healing belongs to her, for out of the wild surging of the elemental forces within she has brought about a serenely ordered and harmonious soul-life; so she is \" Bride of calmness \", and the \" peace, deep peace of Bride \" is invoked in many a healing rune. Because of this inner tranquil holiness, though the wind is strong on the Temple heights, her candles do not flicker as she bears them before Mary. In the Irish Hearth-Blessing, she enwraps and nurses the seed of earthly re asonce she enwrapped and nursed the heavenly; and in the lighting of Yule-log from Candlemas Brand that divine Life which came intoher sphere of the elements on her feast day is safely carried at Christ mas right down into earthly incarnation. When, on \"the birthday of the year\", she puts her nger in the river of life-forces, her warmth overcomes winter's coldness; and all the torpid creatures which have slept withdrawn through \"the death of the year\" come out againinto the blessing of the new-born sun. Indeed, so strong and pure in her are the forces of life and of springtime that at the touch of her lips the dead wood of the altar feet breaks into leaf and flower.A perpetual flame is her symbol, as it is Bridghe's\u2014flame, which also is born neither in the house nor out of the house, for it is that element in which substance passes over into the insubstantial, and its very nature unites sensible world with supersensible. Bridghe's mantle falls quite literally on Bride; Bride's mantle is even blue, as Bridghe's atmospheric mantle is when viewed from the Earth, withinits embrace. That Druidic prophecy spoke truth which foretold that in Bride should dwell one of the Immortals; for her being is over shadowed and permeated by her divine archetype, that heavenly being who, with the descent of Christ into her sphere of the elements,had ceased to ray forth her own light into the spiritual evolution of Man and of the Earth, but had made of herself a chalice which might be lled with and henceforth reflect the light of Christ Himself. In Bridghe is upgathered the task of pagan Celtdom. The task of Christian Celtdom is gathered up in Bride.

His imploring ngers swept the sullen strings. Seeking to pluck from them secreted melody; But still the strings were dumb. Till, between heart-beats, curving, a bright bird came And rested on the harp's dead wood as on a living tree. Whiter than snow on winter branches were his wings. And on his breast each feather was a flame; And such a song sang he\u2014 That blissful bird\u2014 As harper never played or harper heard. \" Bird! Bird!\" the harper cried, bowed head upflung. \" How came the constellations on your breath to float ? How came all heaven to issue from your lung ? The sun to bubble golden in each note ? How came the Milky Way to ripple from your tongue ? The moon to move so sweetly in your throat ? \" \" Thus is Earth blessed,\" the bird sang. \" See! See! See! See how my slender voice is yet so strong That on it all the rmament's lights. At my heart's pull fallen in honey-fUghts, In glad homegoing upthrong!See the Earth's need rise with them to God's gate! See how God meets it in this heavenly to-and-fro. Sending my singing streaming into the furthest blue That it, returning, may fall again with the dew To quicken, to re-create! Play, harper! Each created thing Thus to bless Earth its song must sing. Harvest would never ripen if there were no song.\" The harper touched his tongue-tied harp; and lo, From each mute string Celestial songs began to flow. Sank to embrace the Earth, and so. Bird-like, took Godward wing. # \u00bb * \u00bb This was a thousand years ago. * * \u00ab * Harps are grown small today. Mine is so small that it can creep Inside my heart, and hide away. And never stir from its slack sleep Save when some bird of re and snow Curves singing from the stars to rest One breath-beat on my breast. Then heart-strings, shaken awake, tremble and leap; All is bright swirling chaos and pregnant pain, Until that benecent bird's outpourings cease. The re-mists clear, and in a pent-up peace My small harp sings again. Into its faint heart-music is woven this prayer: Now may some eavesdropping angel, passing by. Hear my small song; as at a child's lilt smile; And midway of his high errand pause awhile. Upon his Paradise viol to play its airIn through the welcoming windows of the sky, That thence it may drop dewlike on the Earth And gently , in some dark and desolate place, Re-kindle, of that most courteous angel's grace.

The per cept-experience itself is given. With its coming into being we have no more to do than to confront the world with our naturally endowed senses, and let it act on us. The concept, however, is not given in this way. It arises as a result of Thinking; and this result does not occur simultaneously with the application of Thinking, but appews after a longer or shorter time. Indeed, it is just this delay which gives us the opportunity to observe our share in the coming into being of the concept. We are conscious of our own effort in its production. \" Think hard!\" said our teachers when they wanted usas children to identify an unfamiliar object, and they would wait patiently for the result; but in order to draw our attention to the abject itself they simply said, \"Look here!\" and expected an imme diate response. This is elementary and obvious; but what is not so obvious is that in saying this we have not necessarily got any nearer to the nature <rf knowledge as such. Only when we realize that in talking about the percept as a factor in knowledge we are not perceiving, but thinking about it, and when we talk about Thinking as the other factor we are not thinking in the ordinary way, but thinking about Thinking itself, do we begin to see what is involved. In short, all the foregoing has taken place entirely in the conceptual sphere; and in order to understand what knowledge itself is, it is only in this conceptual sphere that we can hope for any success. Whateverresearches we undertake, we must carry them out entirely within this eld. This takes us at once into an activity which, while it grows out of our ordinary consciousness, is also beyond it. It can be called Pure Thinking, where, if anything is to happen. Thinking must undertake the dual role of observing and thinking. In the world of concepts there is no other means of observation than this of Think ing; and if we want to study further what our Thinking there observes, then we must once again think about it. This dual role, however, can give us condence in the kind of Thinking required to understand knowledge; for while in the world of objects our thoughts about things may seem insufcient unless they are conrmed by sight, here, in the conceptual world where Thinking is also ' seeing the * objects * can be observed only by Thinking. It is this Pure Thinking which enables us to make the distinction between percept and concept referred to above, and from which we conclude that these two are, in the rst place, separate factors, which it is the task of knowledge to unite; but it must not be forgotten that this is a result of Thinking. We cannot perceive perception; nor can 67we make any kind of statement aboiit perception without passing over simultaneously to Thinking, which is not perception; and what ever kind of consciousness we may imagine the consciousness of pure perception to be, it cannot be our ordinary consciousness,because this is a consciousness that thinks. This begins only when we ask \" What ? \" of something; and both asking the question and comprehending the answer are again not perception, but Thinking. Therefore it is impossible to give an example of a pure percept so that we may study it for ourselves, and henceforth 'know' what a percept is. In the very act of studying it, its perceptual character vanishes. We cannot perceive and at the same time know what we are perceiving as percept. We cannot make statements about a par ticular percept, and keep within the perceptual sphere. We can explain a percept only in the conceptual sphere. Knowledge, therefore, is the cancellation, the utter obliterationof the pure percept; and though we sometimes refer to familiar objects as percepts from the way they enter the eld of observation, they are really Imown objects we are' perceiving', not pure percepts.The pure prcept is entirely wnknown, and remains so until Think ing has raised it to the status of the known, when its original (pure) perceptual character merges indistinguishably in the thing known. In every act of knowledge we rise by means of Thinking out of the undifferentiated consciousness of perception into the differen tiated (human) consciousness of knowing. In every act of know ledge we accomplish the re-creation of the world and ourselves in consciousness. Once we have grasped this, many things which may have seemed obscure become clearer. Notably the fact that the separation of percept and concept, which is cancelled in knowledge, is somethingnot existing in the object, but in us. The object, the world which we perceive, is\\ it exists as an entirely independent, undivided contentof being. It does not ask questions of us; we ask questions of it. We are the petitioners, the world is the respondent; and just as there is no limit to the number and variety of questions we may ask, so there is no indication in the nature of the world as such why we should be denied the answers. True, we may ask the wrong question and thereby be led into doubt and error, or our Thinking may be inadequate at the time to nd the answer; but these impediments are again not in the world, but in us, and must just as surely be overcome by us. The world does not hide itself from us. It is there, in and around us\u2014^indeed, in so far as we are perceiving beings, who take no part in the coming into being of perception, but only recognise it at a point where it becomes a question for us, the world is us. But when we ask a question, when we think, something else comes into play\u2014some thing entirely different from perception, something which originates in us and is identied with us.It is just because it is we ourselves who ask the questions, and not the world, that we can have that condence in Thinking already referred to. When we ask, \"What is that? \", the question arises in us, and is wholly contained in the activity of our Thinking. But we ask, none the less, about a perfectly denite some thing which per ception, not Thiiiing, has rst brought to our notice; but aboutwhich perception itself will tell us nothing further, but hands it oyer to Thinking. We do not ask questions in a vacuum. Perception has detected something; and it is this something ' outside' us which prompts the question ' within' us. Now, the products of Thinking are concepts and ideas. There fore, that 'something' which perception detects can be no other than the idea itself which our Questioning/Thinking activity tries to bring into focus. The idea, in other words, is already active in the question; and perception is none other than the very rst inti mation we receive that there is jan idea to be grasped. It is the idea- content of the world which announces itself in perception. Percep tion, in other words, is the world's way of thinking its ideas in us; Thinking is our way of nding the ideas in the world.When a stranger knocks at my door, his knock tells me nothing whatsoever at rst about him, nor has it any other effect upon me than that I hear it. But if I get up and open the door\u2014an act which is entirely mine\u2014a whole host of possibilities become avail able to me which the knock by itself could never have revealed. The implication of this is very far-reaching. It means that there are virtually no insoluble problems, no unanswerable questions, no riddles of existence as absolute realities. Ideas are not arbitrary, we do not invent them somewhere inside us (in our brain, for instance, as is commonly supposed) and then attach them to 'things' out there in space. The ideas are the things; they are what the world is made of; and our Thinking is the means whereby we appre hend them. The thoughts are * in' the object, not in us. We think the world-thoughts; and by thinking them in response to and in con junction with perception, we obtain that kind of relationship to the world which we call knowledge. The initial isolation is thereby cancelled; the world unity is re-established; we have answered the knock. * It is a fundamental requirement of Thinking to learn to put the right questions; that is, to learn to direct our Thinking to the precise origin of the perception. This can be done only by an attentivenessto all that the world has to offer, quite independently of any pre conceived notions of what we think it ought to offer, or what we would like it to offer. We must just quietly allow it to act upon us, carefully selecting out from the complexity of any single experienceall that which is part of our knowledge already, so that what is absolutely new in the experience may make the strongest possible impression on us. 6869If we can do this, we come eventuallly to understand why it is that percept and concept can unite in knowledge at all. A too-rigid concept of percept and concept could lead us to imagine that theyare irreconcilable opposites; and the problem for knowledge would have to be: How can two such fundamentally different things be made one? On closer consideration, however, this problem dis appears. They are already one and the same thing, only given in one way to perception, and in another to Thinking. Why, then, do they appear as separate at all ? Could not the Creator have saved Himself and us a lot of trouble by making us creatures in which both happened simultaneously\u2014like someone who comes into our room and makes himself known to us without the formality of knocking? Undoubtedly, He could; and according to Rudolf Steiner there was a time when this actually happened, when Thinking and perception were united in man, only to be separated later in order that consciousness\u2014modern consciousness \u2014might arise. To have remained in their undivided state would have inhibited the rise of that consciousness, which is a conscious ness of itself as thinker\u2014^modern self-consciousness. Man could not have become the man he is today if that separation had not taken place\u2014^for man becomes conscious of himself only by Thinking; and the first knowledge of self\u2014true self-consciousness\u2014is just this inner activity of Thinking, thinking about itself as percept. This is just the peculiar nature of Thinking\u2014^that we ourselves are wholly identied with it. In perception something happens to us; in Thinking, we act; and in thinking about Thinking\u2014^the Ur- Reexivum, as Carl Unger calls it in his essay on \" The Ego and the Nature of Man \"\u2014man determines himself as man. Were he only a perceiving being, he would be entirely unconscious of him self. The world process would take place in him and he would be entirely unaware of it\u2014a mere sentient apparatus in which the world \u2014not he\u2014would be the conscious agent. But by this separation into two of what was originally one, man becomes able to know not only the world but also himself. Knowledge then is primarily and wholly a concern of man.There is no knowledge pre-existing * out there' which man is under some cosmic mandate to acquire. The world leaves him free; and respects both his freedom and him, so much so that he may pile error upon error to his own destruction, without some deus ex machina ever once intervening to save him. What kind of 'out thereness' knowledge may seem to have, is only so in the sense in which we speak of the accumulation of human knowledge. But this is not knowledge in the sense in which we are speaking of it here, but only the results of knowledge: information; the dried fruits of the tree of knowledge which have been gathered in the course of human evolution. We mean by knowledge that conscious relation ship of the self-conscious human spirit with the surrounding cosmosas it is experienced in the act of knowing. It is something entirelynew in every single instance, no matter in how many human beings it takes place at different times. Man as knower becomes something different from what he was before; and because he is also part of the cosmos, and not outside it, it is a cosmic event, too. In knowing we become a co-creator with God; and that decision of the Elohim to make man in their own image can have meaning only as a deci sion to make a being who, though part of the created world, would also have the power to re-create it in knowledge. * Knowledge, therefore, is the coming into being of man; and, conversely, the coming into being of man must be the end and aimof all knowledge. Here knowledge nds its identity with educa tion, for education also can be nothing less than this coming into being of man. Whatever value knowledge as information may havein human affairs, it refers only to what has become, not to what is' becoming'; and it is this ' becoming' which should be the sole concern of education. In the fourth chapter of his \" Philosophy of Spiritual Activity Rudolf Steiner helps us to understand this 'coming into being of man' by inviting us to imagine \" that a being with fully developed human intelligence originated out of nothing and confronted the world. All that it there perceived, before its thinking began to act, would be the pure content of observation. The world so far would appear to this being as a mere chaotic aggregate of objects of sensation\u2014colours, sounds, sensations of pressure, of warmth, of taste, of smell, and, further feelings of pleasure and pain. This aggregation constitutes the world of pure unthinking observation. Over it stands thinking, ready to begin its activity as soon as it can nd a point of attack.\" Students of Steiner's \"Philosophy of Spiritual Activity\" have probably spent many hours\u2014a^nd, no doubt, in vain\u2014^trying to imagine just what kind of creature that could be. Once again, it would be so helpful to be able to point to an example\u2014a specimen, as it were, for demonstration purposes. Such a specimen is, of course, not forthcoming; and yet there come into the world every day\u2014indeed, every hour\u2014beings who, while they may not entirelyll the bill of what Steiner meant by \" fully developed human intelli gences\", are none the less such potentially, and are sufcientlyhuman in every other respect to pass. We refer to new-born babies. In every new-born baby we have potentially a \"fully developedhuman intelligence \" which, in being born, confronts the world forthe rst time. That being so, it can only do so entirely as perceiv ing being. The world will be for it a \"mere chaotic aggregate of objects of sensation\"; but because it is also human, and thereforea thinking being. Thinking soon begins its activity . . ^nt we must not be pedantic about Thinking. The baby cer tainly does not think in the sense that it immediately begins con- 7071structing syllogisms and drawing conclusions, for those are only the specialised forms of adult thought. Thinking is there in its primary character, and as such must be considered as already having got to work. Where then does it most obviously show itself ? Where and how does the little child begin to think ? It thinks rst in its will, in all that manifests as bodily activity. We have described knowledge as that by which man relates him self to the world, and Thinking as the instrument in that process. The little child, as soon as it is born, also begins to relate itself to the world; and it does so to begin with by handling it, tasting it, smell ing it, banging it, tearing it, throwing it about\u2014all those activitiesof infancy which, for us more reflective adults, are both our despair and delight. This is the way the little child * thinks'\u2014in its will; and if we want to ensure that the child who thinks thus in its will shall also think later 'in his head', we shall not give him at this time all kinds of intellectual exercises to bring this about. We shall just let him go on exercising his will\u2014directing and controlling it no more than is necessa^ to bring it gradually into harmony with what is the current practice in the world. For while the child plays, while it exercises its limbs, it is all the time building up its body\u2014 and, what is more important (at least for us as knowers)\u2014building up its brain, too; for brain is part of the body. * This brings us to the point where we can attempt an understand ing of the relation of Thinking to the brain in which it is supposed to take place. Everybody knows that there is a connection between the two; though most people simply imagine it as cause and effect: we think because we have a brain. But how if the other possibility should be more correct: Because we think we have a brain ? It cer tainly ts the facts. It is obvious that Nature did not evolve a light- sensing eye in her creatures, and then look round for a medium in which this organ could be used\u2014light. The light must have been there rst, and, acting upon the sensitive living creature, ^aduaUy evolved an organ reciprocal to itself. No less must Thinking, in its universal primary character, have evolved the human brain, so that it could subsequently reflect its own activity, and become conscious of itself in the reflection. \"Only\", says Rudolf Steiner (again in his \"Philosophy of Spiritual Activity\")\" if one wins through, by means of unprejudiced observation, to the recognition of this truth of the intuitive essence of thinking will one succeed in clearing the way for a conception of the psycho-physical organisation of man. One recognises that this organisation can produce no effect whatever on the essential nature of thinking \u2014 Once we perceive this, we can no longer misappre hend the signicance for thinking of this physical counterpart. When we walk over soft ground, our feet leave impressions in thesoil. We shall not be tempted to say that the forces of the ground from below have formed these footprints. We shall not attribute to these forces any share in the production of the footprints. Just so, if without prejudice we observe the essential nature of thinking, we shall not attribute any share in that nature to the traces in tl^ physical organisation which thinking produces in preparing its manifestation through the human body.** Thinking, then, is the activity of the creative spirit which lives inall things. As pure creative spirit it can, and no doubt does, exist in its own right and essence. As our human thinking, however, there must rst be created out of that same spirit a means, an organ, in which it can manifest. That organ is the whole human being, with its crown in the human brain; and in so far as the little human being, the child, in its early years is shaping and consolidating that organ in its bodily activity and play, we can say that the child' thinks' to begin with in its will. In just those bodily activities it is already preparing that subsequent' manifestation of thinking'. But the child grows; and this will-activity which plays such a large part in the early years in building up the body/brain, sinks deeper, as it were, into the total psycho-physical organisation. Itbecomes more inward, more conscious of itself. Feeling of self and feeling for the world begin to predominate more and more. Thechild begins to see himseff in other people, situations, activities. Helives their story in the fantasy of his self, and he identies himself with them inwardly. This feeling life is what must now be taken hold of if education is to assist in the coming into being of man. The child should now be gradually introduced to the whole wealth of human knowledge, in so far as it can be an experience for him on which he can exercise his imagination to the full. But the emphasis must be on this exer cise of the imagination. It must not matter a bit what the child retains. Retain something he will\u2014and invariably what he likes; and the important thing is just this matter of liking, enjoyment, for joy is the very essence of Thinking and knowledge. This joy can\u2014 and it alone can\u2014awaken him still further inwardly; and as he becomes more active within, this activity is not only the prerequisiteof all subsequent thought; it is Thinking itself on the path of its descent from the spirit in the universe to the spmt in man.But the child continues to grow; and this Iff^^ attams a certain climax when adolescence is reached. The child\u2014now no longer a child\u2014attains to a full inner life of his own. He has tothis extent fully related himself to the world. He has become a person.This is a major crisis in the coming into being of man. Just asthe will-activity in the little child does not cease when it has reached a certain climax about the age of seven, so this inner life of feeling does not cease when the child at last begins to call his soul his own about the age of fourteen But he has in the meantime matured a 72 73capacity which would lead this feeling into one channel only, if anew impulse, a new direction were not given to the young human being; for sexual maturity, with all it involves, has now set in, andif this feeling life is not to be left to exhaust itself in eroticism, it must be led into new channels of knowledge-experience. This can be provided only by the intensication of the joy of Thinking in as many spheres of human science and culture as a generous curriculum, and people with the capacity and inspiration to handle it, can allow. But not just with the aim of a competitive examination in view! We ignore\u2014solely for the purposes of this article\u2014what moral and practical issues may be argued in the use of competitive examina tions, and refer only to the concept of knowledge implicit in them, which is the direct opposite of what has been discussed here. Knowledge is not just the tool by which the powers of Nature maybe exploited for our animal and sentient needs; it is also the voice by which Nature herself calls to the human spirit, and with which she would fain draw him into intimate conununion with herself. Everything that denies the human spirit, that thrusts its bearerback to the animal, takes its start from the prostitution of the con cept of knowledge to merely materialistic ends. Even the greatest achievements of human science can, if knowing itself is not under stood, work back upon man, limiting him and degrading him; and while it may be true that \"Knowledge is power\", it is a terrible thing when knowledge becomes a power, tyrannising over man and binding him in dogmatic fetters. What 'power* knowledge possesses it takes entirely from the knower himself, not from the thing known; and if knowledge is seen as the creative activity of him who knows, and not the blind or enforced acceptance of what is known, it can have no power to restrict but only to liberate and ennoble. \"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'* * All knowledge is ultimately self-knowledge. Whenever a man makes a statement about himself, he invariably does so in terms of what is at rst not himself but part of the world in which he nds himself. The simplest, no less than the most exalted descriptions of the self, are all alike in this respect. \"I am a beggar\" is the same kind of statement as \" I am a king ** or \" I am a professor **. They link the' I * who makes them with events and facts in the world out side him; and while the siun of all such statements that a man could make about himself would certainly be a description of the man, it would also be a description of the kind of world in which he lived \u2014incorporating the sum of his knowledge of the world. Man and world condition each other at this level reciprocally. But embedded in this kind of self-knowledge is a more intimate and more subtle percept of self which calls out of the being of the knower himself; and whenever, to the kind of self-knowledge 74described above, is added the question, \" Who then is this ' I' that comes into every kind of statement I make about myself ? **, self- knowledge begins to be sought on a far, far deeper level than ever before. And when this happens, one cannot just begin all over again by saying, \"I am a...\" One must now exclude from one's sphere of observation all that which has no direct bearing on the enquiry, all that which is Not-I, which belongs to the world; for I. \" a m n o t o f t h i s w o r l d . \" O n e m u s t s a c r i c e o n e ' s o w n w o r l d - orientated personality, one's self in so far as it is' mine', belonging to me, but not me. But what is left when everything of self expressible in terms of the world has been discarded ? Nothing; nothing but the pure con cept of 'I' sustained by its own being, the \"I am that I am\";the 'no thing* which is the ultimate concept of man as knowing subject, and the pure percept of man as known object. * Is this, then, all our knowledge leads us to\u2014this isolation in apparent conceptual abstraction ? No; this is not the end, but the beginning. This is the point at which knowing accomplishes its own apotheosis, and transforms itself into being. This is where it carriesthat self-consciousness which it won in the activity of knowing, back to that sphere where the possibility of knowing &:st took its rise in the undifferentiated consciousness of perception. But this is not just a return to the starting point. We come back not to the pointfrom which we set out, but to one above it\u2014spiral-wise, not circular- wise. We have ascended in the process. Perception is an activity of being in which our own being is embedded. What happened in the beginning\u2014perception\u2014^without our volition, and was the starting point of our knowledge, did not, however, happen without any volition. Just as we have to be con sciously active, so that Thinking may grasp the concept in conscious ness, so other Beings had to be active so that the percept, from which all knowledge starts, might take place in us. But the nature of those Beings who bring about perception in us lies beyond the simple knowledge, the natural science, of the phenomena they sustain. The stranger who knocks at my door is not the knock; nor can a knowledge, however elaborate, which connes itself to the laws of the phenomenon as such tell me anything about him. Only when I also perceive in the knock the will of a Being who seeks my attention, do I really begin to know what is happening. We stand, then, on the threshold of a new' world', a world from which we ourselves originated and to which we still belong, a world of whose existence we should not have become aware but for the experience of knowing; but a world which, for all our knowledge,remains inaccessible to us until knowledge itself has found the organ of perception for it. Rudolf Steiner called this world the spiritual world, and 75knowledge of that world he called Spiritual Science, or Anthropo- sophy. Knowledge of the sense-world is what happens when our percept-experience is illuminated by the appropriate concepts; knowledge of that spiritual world is what happens when our concept- experience is illuminated by percepts\u2014^spiritual percepts. Conceptand percept are no less separated for spiritual science than they are for natural science; but in spiritual science the concept comes rst, the percept illuminates it later. The world of the senses makes itself accessible to us in the activity of those Beings who bring about per ception in us; we make ourselves accessible to the spiritual world inthe activity of the fully conscious act of Thinking. Knowledge of the one arises as a gift of nature; knowledge of the other is a gift of grace. But both are knowledge, and both are available to man; for man as knower is the ever-evolving image of all that may be known \u2014\".. .now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\" And just as earlier we have tried to show that knowledge and education are really one, so ultimately the act of knowledge must nd its identity with the highest spiritual striving of man. When Parsifal stood before the mystery of the Holy Grail, everything depended on his doing what we have to do every day if we would advance from a mere staring at the world to knowledge of it\u2014he had to ask a question. Likewise when the world makes contact with us in the act of perception, God Himself whispers to the heart and mind of each one of us: \" Behold, I stand at the door and l^nock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I toill come into him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\"Melancholy in our Modem Age Rudolf Treichler, M.D.* I I T q u i t e o f t e n h a p p e n s t h a t a n e x p e r i e n c e s o m e o n e u n d e r g o e sweighs so heavily on him that it literally \" depresses \" him. Hefeels that he is unable to cope with it properly. It sinks into his soul and is forgotten\u2014and yet it will rise up time and again from what might be called the \" deep-sea\" regions of the soul, still as strong and as menacing as ever.Once an experience has been properly dealt with, it will fade into a memory-picture that can be called up again at will, and we may develop certain thoughts, feelings and will impulses in relation to it. But the \" undigested \" experience has its own way of pushing itself up into our conscious life of soul, thereby drawing on our thoughts, feelings and will-impulses whether we want it or not.It is the Ego of man, as we shall see later, that seeks to \" digest\" every experience of the soul, somewhat as food is digested on the physical plane. It is through the Ego that every experience can become a kind of nourishment from which new forces will flow into and help the development of the soul. An experience that does not nourish the soul will tend to burden it. The soul-forces, becoming bound to the depressing experience, are themselves weighed down. They fall into gravity, in both senses of the word. And in this process the soul becomes more or less consciously tied up with the past. It is not only this particular experience that preoccupies the soul, but all the events that led upto it. Especially the forces of will, which shape the future, are no longer free and are now employed to delve into the past. That is why a depressed person may seem as if paralysed with regard to thefuture. The question. \" What shall I do ? \", begins to haunt him. If an otherwise fairly well-balanced person reacts to a prob lematic experience with this kind of depression, we can expect that after a matter of days or weeks he will have dealt with it suf ciently for him to emerge from his heavy mood. There is, however,another kind of sadness which, while resembling in its symptoms the \"reactive depression\" described so far, differs from it in the way it c o m e s a b o u t . Many people will be familiar with the following situation. Without any apparent reason you nd it difcult to wake up in the morning. Y our head is sore, your limbs feel heavy . The day with This abridged translation is published by permission of Dr. Treichler f M l c h a e l m a s ! \u00b0 1 9 5 7 ) N a c h r i c h t e n , w h e r e t h e a r t i c l e f i r s t a p p e a r e d 7677its demands stands before you like a mountain. Nothing you can think of gives you any pleasure. Once having made the effort to get up, your general condition may brighten gradually and give way to your usual frame of mind. But it can also happen that this morning \"shadow\" deepens, and extends in both directions of time. The phase of waking up may become a very long one by eventually starting as early as 3 a.m. and lasting more or less throughout the day. Such a person cannot sleep well after about 3 a.m., nor is he able to wake up properly during the day. Only in the evenings he may, at best, feel a little brighter. General heaviness and a slight feeling of sick ness may be added symptoms. T o ght against the inner lethargy seems hopeless. The patient cannot summon his energy for the smallest activity. His feet drag along; so do his thoughts. Every thing stagnates. The past alone, set and unalterable, looms over him and he feels fettered to it. Whatever might be done now is bound to be imperfect, while every thought of the past becomes a self-reproach. At last the whole of life seems one great sin. Thefuture offers no hope; the soul feels imprisoned in anxiety; extinc tion seems to threaten the Ego. This process of intensifying can lead to the power of will flaring up once more by turning against itself in a last and desperate attempt. The Ego-feeling as it dwindles is activated by a negativewill-force. The wish to die and lose the self becomes a powerful urge towards suicide. This is a brief sketch of the psychological situation in the case of so-called endogenous depression. The name indicates that this kind of depression originates from within, not from an experience connected with the outer world. What is this \"within\"? It is not our conscious soul-life, which is open to the world. Neither is it the subconscious regions, in so faras our outer experiences are \" digested \" there. They come into the picture here only through the influences that play into them from the physical body and its organs. We penetrate further if we seek out that soul-force which is least conscious to us\u2014the force of will. We become aware of a disturbance of the will as a kind of inner paralysis, and the perception of this leads back into the more conscious realm of feeling. Will-power itself leads us into the uncon scious depths, whence it springs as the actual force of our soul- centre or Ego. No proper soul-impulse is possible, no line of thought or trend of feeling, without this Ego-force. This is expressedwhenever we say \"I think\" and \"I feel\". The fundamental fact of endogenous depression is the experience that will-power is paralysed. The life of feeling then responds with a mood ofwretchedness, rather like it does to a problematic experience that comes from outside. 7811 The central organ of the human metabolic system is the liver, which is at the same time the physical foundation through which the will, as the central soul-force of the metabolism, can work. In the case of a disturbed life of will we must therefore expect that liver disorders will occur. This is indeed so in cases of endogenous depression. Very briefly, it can be said that the activity of the liveris hemmed in, which may lead to a thickening of the bile. The ancient designation \"melancholy\"\u2014i.e., \"black bile\"\u2014is a token of this fact. The anthroposophical knowledge of man attributes to the soul an independent realm of existence, although in the waking state this is closely interwoven with the physical realm. We can therefore arrive at the following conception. An illness can rst start on the level of the soul and then take effect fully on the physical level. On the other hand, it can work upon the soul from the physical realm\u2014 i.e., from the diseased organs\u2014and cause serious psychological dis turbance, while at the same time the physical symptoms recede both in extent and signicance. Thus we recognise two opposite poles in the diagnosis of depression. Of course, they act on each other all the time, so thatwe can never say of cases of depression, \" This is a purely psycho logical illness\" or, \"This is purely physical.\" If we learn to look upon our bodily organs as instruments of our life of soul, we realisethat with every experience that weighs us down in our will, it is our liver that, so to speak, vibrates in resonance. On the other hand, every liver disturbance affects the soul. But what about an innate disposition towards depression, present even before conscious experiences have occurred? It is at this point that a vista opens up through the teaching of the reincarnation of the human Ego. For the Ego's relationship to the world may have been disturbed already in an earlier earth-life. Also congenital physical complaints can thus be seen as resulting from an unfullled process in the realm of soul and spirit. Here we can only indicate these laws of destiny, which must be studied in detailin the relevant books by Rudolf Steiner (e.g.. An Outline of Occult Science). It is essential to note that in the depressed patient's feeling of guilt there is some reality. But the feeling derives not from whatever \" sins\" the patient reports, which are mostly imaginary, but from the failure of the Ego to cope with its experiences, which mean a failure to further the development of the soul. It is fundamentally this failure of the Ego which is experienced as paralysed will, and is then reflected from the body into the soul-life. But is it reasonable to speak here of \" guilt\" ? Are not the experiences very often such that they cannot, to begin with, be properly \" digested \" ? Are we not facing perhaps a problem of our time, a problem of humanity at large ? 79 G.B.\u20146Ill Melancholy as a complaint is on the increase, according to reports by the Viennese psychiatrist Professor H. Hoff. Statisticsshow that it has become an illness of our time. But there are surely not more people nowadays who take things deeply than there used to be. On the contrary, the reverse may be assumed. It is the world that makes life more difcult for man. In former times his environment was not only familiar to him but intimate and friendly; he could even feel devotion and reverence for it. T o-day, by con trast, he is confronted with a world that is foreign to his soul. Our technological civilisation, the product of one-sided materialistic thinking, leaves the soul no breathing-space.That is why people nowadays often seek to plunge into any kind of intoxicating pleasure where the soul can nd fullment of its hopes and wishes for a brief spell. But if this amounts to no more than letting loose the dammed-up inner life, then the alien nature of the world around us will afterwards seem all the more painful. Man to-day feels his Ego incarcerated in a world that is foreign to him. Anxiety arises, and this is the rst symptom of a depressive paralysis of will. So it happens that many people, though by nature they are not mclined to take things hard, fail nowadays to assimilate their impressions. It is the impressions which are hard and intractable,and thus sink like undigested food into the soul. And such a process can indeed have a depressing effect, right into the metabolism of the liver. Because of the one-sided burdening of the head with passive concepts, life in the lower man, in the metabolic system, grows slowand sluggish; the will-activity of the Ego becomes bogged down. If such a \"civilization-depression\" overtakes a person whose general constitution is dominated by the nervous system, then the depression will have neurasthenic characteristics. He is not merely depressed, but also irritable and easily tired. This can become asserious as any endogenous depression, the difference being, e.g., that the patient feels at his worst in the evening, when he is exhausted from the day . In such cases we are dealing not only with a cramp in the liver-organization, but also with exhaustion of its vital forces. (The fact that other organs can also play a part in cases of depression may be mentioned here in passing).With many people, fear of loneliness is predominant. This experience of isolation is particularly difcult to handle, for it springs from an inner emptiness of soul. Boredom takes hold of a person. In many cases of suicide, it is extreme boredom that leads up to the fatal act. People in this condition have already become incapable of feeling sadness.A genuine depression seems a more tolerable suffering by com parison, although the struggle may appear hopeless to begin with.And it is here that we have the best possibility of approaching what can be called the meaning, or even the mission, of depression.IV Every symptom of illness points to a healthy archetype. The person who takes everything seriously is deepening his soul in the process. A depression that leads to increased inner activity canwaken new forces in the soul. Many patients will speak of this after they have lived in the right way through a difcult phase of depression\u2014\" I feel as if newly born \", \" I feel a new person, withnew possibilities\", or \"Now I can experience certain thmgs much more deeply than I did before\". Statements of this kind throw light upon depression as a phenomenon of our time and are a guide also for those who have to treat it. If we do not want to cut off personal development and cause human development in general to regress, we shall certainly not try always to save people from difcult experiences liable to cause suffering, or teach them to flee from the harmful effects of civilisa tion, simply in order to avoid depression. The task will be to strengthen those soul-forces that partake in all the experiences, so that man, with enhanced Ego-activity, can deal with them properly. It will be found that just in grappling with the impressions con nected with our modern civilization, a new faculty may grow within: the power of wakefulness. Armed with this power, a person can take hold of the deeper problems of life and the world, although they are more difcult for him than they were in a less self-con scious age. With regard to the senses, there are many ways of observing nature, in the Goethean manner, which can have a prophylactic effect. If, for example, the characteristic leaf-forms of the various trees are again and again carefully observed during country walks, the perceptive faculty is made more active and will stand up better to the experiences encountered in modern towns. A similar effect can be achieved through all sorts of artistic activities, which help the soul to enter fully again into sense-perceptions. And as regards the various machines which tend to make us inactive, we can rouse our thinking by developing a keen interest in technical achieve ments; by making a point, e.g., of understanding (or inquiring) how a train works and how an electric current is produced. In Rudolf Steiner schools, practical and technical teaching is considered essen tial for this very reason. It is, however, important not only to establish an active contact with the world around us, but also to be able actively to disengage ourselves from it again. This is helped, for example, by the exer cise of the daily retrospect. T o let the day's events pass in mental reverie before going to sleep, but in reverse order (i.e., starting with the evening and ending with the morning), and thereby looking at oneself as in a picture\u2014this will increasingly help a person to keep at a better distance from his impressions during the day-time also. 8081V Civilization to-day has an autumnal character. There is evi dence on all sides of a weakening of creative powers. The whole of mankind lives in the shadow of a great depression, and in the individual human being this can become an illness. Fear of the future looms over humanity, threatened by the unrestrained power of technology with death in various forms. An image of this threat can be seen in the picture of the dragon lurking in its rocky cave. But there is more to it than that; the picture can become one of hope. Michael, the Archangel of theautumn season, battles with the dragon and frees the way for the experience of a new birth that springs from the death of winter.Rudolf Steiner described Michael as the spiritual Power who calls on us to overcome anxiety; to face the world with initiative and to make good use, with courage and wakeful thinking, of the help he offers. This is not a question of light-heartedness: the Archangel is shown wearing armour of iron. But no mood of heaviness is indicated, either: in the battle with the dragon the weight of the armour is lifted away. If we follow the voice that speaks to us through this picture, courage will grow in us: courage to seek the light of the spirit in the depths of our bodies and eouls. Translated hy Siet^'fried Rude!.The Work of Alice A. Bailey: 1880-1949 F r a n c e s B a n k s As we said last year in introducing Mrs. Katharine Trevelyan's article on Subud, we believe that students of Anthroposophy should know something of other esoteric movements which are concerned with the inner life of the spirit in the world to-day. For this issue, accordingly, we have asked Miss Frances Banks, whose autobiographical volume, Froniiers of Revelation, was pub lished by Max Parrish recently, to describe the life and work of the late Alice Bailey.\u2014The Editors. I N t h e f o l l o w i n g a c c o u n t o f t h e t e a c h i n g p u t o u t b y M r s . A l i c e A .Bailey 1 do not consider myself competent to draw close parallelswith the teaching of Rudolf Steiner, nor to dene possible diver gencies. My aim is simply to introduce her life-work and body of teaching, for which incidentally, and doubtless of intent, no com prehensive title is available. Mrs. Bailey (nee La Trobe-Bateman), daughter of a successful engineer-inventor, was brought up in England in an affluentChristian environment. A turning-point in her turbulent and orphaned girlhood came at the age of 15, when she received an admonitory visit from her Master, Koot Hoomi. From his tur- baned appearance she assumed that he must be Jesus Christ. For a period he revisited her at seven-year intervals, and later more frequently, by which time she had learnt his identity and had dis covered that she was a member of his ashram. Her inherent piety and Christian devotion led her in her early twenties to forsake society life to become an evangelist to the British Forces in India. A subsequently unhappy marriage took her to the United States. It was only after the dissolution of this marriage in 1915, when she was working in a sardine factory to support her three small girls, that she came upon Theosophy and sat at the feet of two elderly ladies who had been H. P. Blavatsky's personal pupils. Her rst direct contact with the Tibetan Teacher who was to write through her, the same who had already inspired Mme. Blavatsky, was made in November, 1919. Sitting outside her houseone morning, she heard a note of music followed by a voice saying, \"There are some books which it is desired should be written for the public. You can write them. Will you do so?\" Her immediate answer was; \"Certainly not. I'm not a darned psychic and I don't want to be drawn into anything like that.\" Given three weeks to think it over, she was eventually persuaded to try the work for a month, and began with the opening chapters of Initiation, Human and Solar. For 30 years she was to labour in this way, yet without loss of consciousness or independence. For many years she rose at 4 a.m. 82 83and wrote to a denite telepathic dictation, which later developed into a less restricted rapport. Her communicator, as was later inadvertently revealed to her readers, was himself a Master, while belonging to the ashram of Koot Hoomi; the last to attain to the status of Master, he had been endowed with the function of secre tary and teacher to the outer world. Thus, while living in a Tibetan monastery, he served the wider mission of the Christ.With exceptionally high intelligence, A.A.B. (as she has come to be known) spared herself no pains in the study of current occult literature, yet she frankly declares, \"I have no ^owledge such as that possessed by the Tibetan\". She persistently repudiated any claim to personal seership or initiate authority. \" I am \", she writes in her Unnished Autobiography, \"only a pen or pencil, a stenographer and a transmitter of teaching from one whom I revereand honomr and have been happy to serve.\" And again, \" I simply listen and take down the wordis that I hear and register the thoughts which are dropped one by one into my brain. I make no changes in what I give out to the public from that which has been given to me except that I smooth the English or replace an unusual word with one that is clearer, taking care to preserve the sense as given. I have never changed anything that the Tibetan has ever given me. If I once did so. He would never dictate to me again.\" Writing of a later stage, she testies, \"T o-day as the result of 26 years' work I can snap into telepathic relation with Him without the slightest trouble.... I am not a medium, but I have been a kind of ' middle man ' between the Hierarchy and the general public.\" Thus the books were written, nearly 20 of them, including six which had to be edited posthumously from her notes by her friend, Regina Keller, a work completed only in this decade. In additionMrs. Bailey wrote ve books in her own right, thus demonstrating her own compatible cultural level. A brief classication of the books may be of value. There are ttoee directly concerned with meditation: Letters on Occult Medita tion came direct from the Tibetan; From Intellect to Intuition was A.A.B.'s own composition; in The Light of the Soul the Tibetan translated the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and A.A.B., who knew no Sanscrit, wrote the commentary upon them. Two signicant books by the Tibetan, Discipleship in the New Age, Vols. I & II, giveboth general rules and individual direction to a group of 45 disciples engaged in the work of meditation.T wo of Mrs. Bailey's own books deal with the inner energies and techniques: The Consciousness of the Atom, and The Soul and its Mechanism. The Tibetan is responsible for T elepathy andthe Etheric V ehicle', and all except one of the remaining books. There is a large volume on astral training and control, entitled A Treatise on White Magic. Perhaps most difcult and esoterically advanced of all is A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, which A.A.B herself described as a psychological key to The Secret Doctrine. 84From another aspect, the application of inner understanding to world affairs has played an important part in the writings, as in The Destiny of the Nations and The Problems of Humanity. Further constructive hope for the future is given in The External- isation of the Hierarchy, a process regarded as preparatory to the Second Coming presaged in The Reappearance of the Christ (recently issued in a paper edition). Mrs. Bailey's own endeavour to reconcile a deeper esoteric interpretation of the Gospel with the Ageless Wisdom is expressed in From Bethlehem to Calvary, in which she traces the ve great initiations of Birth, Baptism, Transguration, Crucixion and Resurrection in their signicance for humanity. The largest work consists of ve volumes of The Treatise on the Seven Rays, beginning with two volumes of a new spiritual psychology based on the Seven Rays of Divine Energy in relation to Man. These are followed by volumes on Esoteric Astrology, Esoteric Healing, and the Initiations. Mrs. Bailey (who was content with four hours' sleep out of the 24, in spite of increasing tiredness) made relatively light of this gigantic task of amanuensis. A volume on Glamour: a World Problem must have been esiwcially dear to her heart. For she had a horror of all claim-malung, attitudinising or eccentricity, and never minimised housewifely and maternal duties, nor ceased to inveigh against escapist devotees and spiritual philanderers. There is certainly nothing glamorous about these sturdy navy- blue volumes, strongly bound to last, clear, categorical and shorn of all anecdotal illustration; hence stiff enough to furnish their own protection against frivolous application of once hidden doctrine.The Lucis Press which issues them ploughs back the prots, so that the translations are ever extending and reaching new territories. With the books, and beyond them, has spread one further New Age word. The Great Invocation, now in over 50 languages dis persed in a million or more copies. Translated into English by the Tibetan from an ancient form, and received by A.A.B. with great joy, it is an utterance which must powerfully affect the subjective life of our day in the passage from supplication to invocation, from personal petition to universal realisation, and from anthropmorphicto planetary and cosmic concepts of Divinity. It may already have a familiar ring to the reader, who may nevertheless have been ignorant of its origin: From the point of Light within the Mind of God Let light stream forth into the imnds of men. Let Light descend on Earth. From the point of Love within the Heart of God Let love stream forth into the minds of men. May Christ return to Earth. From the centre where the wll of God is known Let purpose guide the little wills of men\u2014 The purpose which the Master(s) know(s) and serve(s). 85From the centre which we call the race of men Let the Plan of Love and Light work out And may it seal the door where evil dwells. Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth. * A good deal more than these tasl\u00ab of publication was, how ever, to be laid upon Mrs. Bailey's shoulders. In 1921, she and Foster Bailey, her second husband and indomitable helper, began to sit in meditation with a group of ve others, and while on holi day in the following year A.A.B. kept in touch with the members by a weekly circular letter; this she presently found herself dupli cating for the benet of an increasing number who applied to her for meditation instruction on the strength of her books. Thus from small beginnings there arose a correspondence school of meditation which soon occupied her from morning till night, with the drawing up of graded courses from the Tibetan's teaching, the interviewingof enquirers, and the endless secretarial work (in one year, she declares, she dictated 10,000 letters). Tens of thousands have passed through her Arcane School and the subsequent School for Esoteric Studies, and past and present students are to be found absorbed into many branches of spiritual and practical work in the world, yet sounding the authentic note of the Tibetan's teaching to the ear attuned to hear it. By policy, no exclusive aflaiiation is demanded for students, nor is it possible. In her statement of principles, Mrs. Bailey declares: \" We have no lodges, centres or meetings which we expect them to attend; we leave them free to work in any group. Church, organisation or social and welfare activity which may appeal to them\". And again, in italics, \" Our students are free to work in other organisations and are not expected to owe allegiance to anyone in the Arcane School.\" An excellent speaker and lecturer herself, Mrs. Bailey deliber ately avoided all cultus, ceremonial, vestment, or initiation ritual, as no part of her accepted programme. She sought also to avoid personality cult, and preferred the mentally polarised to the devotee, without condenmation of the latter. She regarded her school as training for \"accepted discipleshiphence \"for those who couldbe trained to act directly and consciously under the Masters of the Wisdom \". Yet there was to be no talk of obedience to this or that Master, in recognition of \"the occult law that no Master ever gives a command or expects obedience.\" Thus nothing was to be taken on authority even from the Tibetan, but only what each student could assimilate for himself.No special beliefs were to be required on entry, no belief iii reincarnation, nor even in the Spiritual Hierarchy except as a working hypothesis. Incidentally no fees were to be charged, and nearly all the work was to be on a voluntary or subsistence basis,senior students servicing the work of those below in degreeMrs. Bailey regarded her school as occupying an intermediate level, with study and meditation as the keynotes. The student must be brought rst in contact with his own soul, and pass from an integrated personality to a soul-infused one. In the higher gradeshe should rise to further spiritual heights under the all-inclusive objective of \" the revelation of divinity in man and in the universe\", leading \" to the acknowledgment of God Transcendent, and of God Immanent\". At a later stage, so it was prophesied as far back as 1920, there would arise a different type of esoteric school, in a small way at rst. When the present schools would have sufciently coloured the sub jective life of politicians, scientists and educators, there might emerge \"the founding in exoteric fashion of the true esoteric school\". Some of these, near urban centres, would be of a pre paratory sort; a few, situated more remotely, would come to give advanced training. This development is envisaged as more or less coincident with the externalisation of the Hierarchy, or the visible manifestation of the Masters of the Wisdom on the human scene, which would pre cede the Second Coming of the Christ on earth. This reappearance of the Christ, as the Head of the Hierarchy, would draw people of all religions to a new recognition and synthesis within the higher consciousness of the Fifth Kingdom, the Kingdom of Heaven. It would come, not by an incarnate rebirth, but by as yet unpredict able methods of over-shadowment and revelation. * It is indeed possible that the vast postal phase of all this work, at any rate in this country and in the States, may have passed its peak: but that will not be because of its sterility. Much seed has been sown in the subjective life of mankind through this agency; but the time of fructication may well lie ahead. The knowledge has been set out in printed form and a halt has now been called to fresh issue. As Mr. Foster Bailey declared in 1950, after his wife's death: \" Both A.A.B. and the Tibetan have denitely stated that after she died he would not continue to function through any other channel as He did with her\". '*As he did with her\" seem to be signicant words. For the knowledge, inasmuch as it speaks truth to Twentieth Century man, has be^n released through this particu lar form and instrument. But it still has to win through to practical expression in the affairs of human life; and it seems unlikely that the Tibetan Teacher who sponsored the tuition will fail to aid his struggling servers in the Plan.Alice Bailey's life-work is nearly a quarter-of-a-century later than Rudolf Steiner's and like a wave of the sea it has followed his in extending revelation of the Higher worlds: but it has not yet had time to emerge so fully into practical expression. Nor will it ever do so under its own specic designation, for it has disclaimed that 86 87by xed intent. But these two expressions of the Ageless Wisdom brought up-to-date for western Christendom must by their own inherent freedoms inevitably reinforce one another, and the students of one be the fellow-students of the other. For myself, the rst impact upon my Anglo-Catholic \"ortho doxy \" was coloured by anthroposophical works, especially Christand the Human Soul and Rittelmeyer's Meditation (on the Great Afl5rmations of St. John's Gospel). But when it came to commitment to a meditation school, I chose Mrs. Bailey's, partly because it was non-compromising to one still in a religious habit. Still more cogently I was motivated by her pamphlet. The Next Three Y ears, which seemed to transport me from being an erring and lonely straggler to nding myself inwardly a member of an articulate group in a charted country. I believe the choice was justied. After a period \"in the wilderness \", it is a great joy to me to apply heart, mind and soulto aid in a deeper reconciliation between this extended interpreta tion of Christ's teaching and our institutional Christianity, so that the future may see a new creative union of Eastern mysticism and Western theology, to hasten the day when \"the earth shall be fullof the glory of God as the waters cover the sea For the overplus of a \"Nameless Faith\" need give no offence to orthodox brethrenwho are often searc^g no less arduously for ways of spiritual renewal for this atomic age. And I am happy to say that from time to time the platform of such a forward-looking movement as the Chmches Fellowship for Psychical Study can be shared with Anthroposophists, lay and even clerical, speaking unequivocally onthe same deep issues. No doubt we are all more closely knit than we know, and the day is approachmg when the following \"Mantram of Unication\" (given out by A.A.B.) wiU become as true for an objective majorityas It already is for a host of subjective minorities: The souls of men are one and I am one with them. I seek to love, not hate; I seek to serve and not exact due service; I seek to heal, not hurt. I^t pain bring due reward of light and love. Let the soul control the outer form And life and all events. And bring to light the Love That underlies the happenings of the time. Let vision come and insight. Let &e future stand revealed.Let inner union demonstrate and outer cleavages be gone Let love prevail. Let all men love. Perhaps the rst step towards such unication is to weave thestrands of trath discovered by the many responsible research unitswhich have been at work into an integrated whole, as indicating the pattern of the new age religion; praying also that in the Divine 88economy it may become grafted into the existing Christian institu tions. It may well be that the Avatar of Synthesis is nearer than we know. There is a rough and ready tendency to condemn all religious doctrine and \" dogma\" as sterile because to many it has become outdated. But no one can hold\u2014let alone teach\u2014any inner belief which is incapable of a measure of mental formulation, which in itself must constitute a \" doctrine however he may seek to avoid dogmatic pressures. In the light of the progressive revelations of our age, our respec tive Leaders have sought to nd a sense in which Christian creed, worship and sacraments can re-generate a vital experience formodern man, and align faith with actuality. It is a matter of breaking down vague generalities into manageable units of spiritual progress. This we should expect to be the way in which Divinity would lead mankind to spiritual maturity as he leaves behind him his preliterate childhood and emotional adolescence, and attains to new scientic understanding and control of natural forces. The Tibetan, through A.A.B., makes this clear in his b^y of teaching, as seen in the following passage from The Externalisation of the Hierarchy: In all the progressing developments, the old outlines can be seen \u2014enlarged, purified and more beautiful, yet recognisable as the oldform on a higher turn of the spiral. It is not the freak cults, nor the widely divergent sects, nor the bands of advanced religious revo lutionaries who can meet the crying need of the many enquirers today. What is required is the revivication of the old forms, andtheir infusion with fresh life; the old organisms must be awakened to the hour of opportunity and must change from static organisations to living organisms. The old rituals must be revived and brought up to date (in the esoteric sense of the word) and the religious studentsof the world must be graduated into a higher school, given the occult inteipretations, and taught that, after all, the truth has been present all the time, but hidden and misinterpreted. \" It is surely easier to swing the masses into step and give them the newer light of truth if that light is poured on to familiar ground. . . . ^e truth must be stepped down and adapted in such a way that the advanced minds, the enquiring minds, and the reactionarymasses may have opportunity proffered them, to the measure oftheir receptivity. Did not the greatest of all the Great Ones do this Himself in the synagogue and with His disciples in Judean days ? \" There is no reason why this teaching, given here in brief out line. should not provide a simple, coherent picture, somewhat as follows: , , ^ Essential Divinity is the groundwork of all Reahty, focussed for our solar system in the Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, from Whom we receive the Seven Rays which inuence our lives, known in Biblical terminology as \"The Seven Spirits before the Throne \", and now further dened as the Three Major Rays of Will or Power, Love-Wisdom, and Active Intelligence; and the Four 89Rays of Attribute, viz.. Harmony or Beauty , Concrete Knowledge, Devotion or Idealism, and Ceremonial Order. These come to us earth-dwellers, not only directly, but also as relayed through the Heaven and Hierarchy of our own planet, ruled by the Lord of the World, between Whom and our Humanity stand\"The Spirits of Just Men made Perfect\", the Elder Brothers of the Race. TTiese, in company with the Angelic Orders (who have not been encumbered with physical bodies and their emotional accom paniments) form what in Christian parlance is called \" The Whole Company of Heaven\". And yet the concept of Masters has adifferent ring for the esotericist from that generally attaching to Saints who \"rest in peace\". For these Masters are regarded as having enjoyed the multiple experience of many lives, in manyclimes, races, ranks and religions, and in both sexes, in very truth\" a post-graduate humanity \". No past life may have been \"perfect\" throughout, yet eachfl a w w i l l h a v e b e e n m a s t e r e d t o a p o i n t w h e n k a r m a h a s b e e n p a i d and further earth-experience has become unnecessary, so that such beings may either pass on to other spheres or choose to help mankind from the higher worlds. In some lives they will have accom plished great things of which the history-books tell us; in othersthey will have worked in obscurity . Incidentally , it seems probablethat most of them who have lived here in our era will have received Christian canonisation at some point of sanctity. But now all illusion of the physical, emotional, or lower mental worlds will have been left behind: \" The former things have passed away and death hath no more dominion over them \". How then can they work among the world of men ? A clergyman I ^ow preaches openly of \" the Heavenly Civil Service \"; and undoubtedly , like all civil servants, they must step down the workm a hierarchical organisation. As above, so below. It is said that they are able to lower their vibrations to soul level, and so work r personalities, who can accept their impressionsof the Plan of God. The Soul of each human being, so we are told, is a Master in ite own right, dwelling on the higher mental plane; but before it can be perfected and released to higher realms, it must have expressed Itself victoriously through all facets of human experience. The Soul V IS both inimanent and transcendent. It is immanent in that as the personality life develops in integration, it shines more clearlythrough each incarnation; yet each life has its own differing per- sonality , not the same one reborn. The Soul is also transcendent inthat its essence remains throughout, gathering to itself the \"per manent atoms\" of the successive earth-lives, and absorbing themmto the higher soul energy . Thence each successive personality candraw upon them, at rst unconsciously , and later with continuity of consciousness. Hence, as a man advances, he becomes a \"WorldServer\" through his rounded experience of all human life, and with 90growing power, love and tolerance he qualies to serve in group work. * Much is said in the A.A.B. literature of \"The New Group of World Servers\". Increasingly, as man progresses up the human school, he nds old links with men and women encountered in the long struggle up the spiral way back to the Father's House; thus strong groups are formed, with growing recognition on both sidesof the veil of earthly life. These teams now become capable of closer co-operation with the ashrams of the Masters responsible for special aspects of the Divine Plan. As these Severs rise, they are given further tools for extended service, and the insignia for swifter recognition of and by their fellow-workers. It is not, however, an insignia for general identication, since status claim-making wouldbe its own disqualication. In their turn, the World Servers work through an expanding body of \"Men of Goodwill\", disciples and probationers willing to carry the work into the next stage for physical manifestation, asarticers to the architects; just as the stage above had passed it down from the Planners to the architects. At this lower level the numbers are greater and ever-growing, as men learn to give dis interested and wholehearted service to their fellow-men in every race, religion and capacity. And so the process reaches down to the mass of men upon the ladder of ascent, disciple stretching out a hand to help disciple or probationer, so that none is ever alone or unaided even at thehuman level, did he but know it. , .. As a \" service activity \" an effort has been made to enhance this ideal of Goodwill\u2014the clarion note of Christ's Nativity\u2014by giving it formulated expression and tracing its growth in the conteniporary world by means of a Journal entitled World Goodwill, which has just united with an Eastern-edited paper to become WORLD Union-Goodwill. Another activity has been the promotion of a Triangle Move ment, which seeks to weave the present quadrilateral pattern of the ethers into a triangular one through a system whereby three people, whether members of an esoteric school or not, link daily to recite the Great Invocation in reciprocal recollection. Such practical techniques are considered as all part of the preparation for the externalisation of the Great Ones on earth tomake possible the Reappearance of the Christ. The above chart of human progress makes its more nely graded steps seem the more serially attainable. It lifts some of the old shroudings of moral and mystical theologies from \"the hid battlements of Eternity \", and stretches the imagination along new vistas of hope for the human race in this most crucial age of its history . Its note of optimism is well summarised in this prophecy (from the Treatise on White Magic) of a human brotherhood based on inner 91unication of mankmd*s higher mental energies within the Divine intent:\" The plan as at present sensed .... might be dened as follows : It is the production of a subjective synthesis in humanity and of a telepathic interplay which will eventuallyannihilate time. It will make available to every man all past achievements and knowledges, it will reveal to man the true signicance of his mind and brain and make him the master ofthat equipment and will make him therefore omnipresent and eventually open the door to omniscience. This next development of the plan will produce in man an understanding\u2014 intelligent and co-operative\u2014of the divine purpose for whichthe One in TOom we live and move and have our being has deemed it wise to submit to incarnation.\" Questions and Answers So few questions were sent in that we have had to omit this feature,but we are ready to revive it next year if more questions come.

A n y o n e t a k i n g u p t h i s b o o k a n d e x p e c t i n g a b i o g r a p h i c a l s t u d ywill nd something different. The essays here gathered together assume an acquaintance with the main outline of Rudolf Steiner's life and the development of his life-work. The \" naeetings \" of the title are both narrower and wider than a description of personal encounters with their subject: narrower in that comparatively few meetings are recorded, wider because they register the impact in its broadest sense of the spiritual river to which Rudolf Steiner gave the name of Anthroposophy on an individual disposed to drink deeply of its waters. Albert Steffen, writer and poet, is well suitedto transform these encounters with Rudolf Steiner's life and work into a form which is artistically valid.With how open a heart he meets this new experience is quickly apparent from the long opening essay which centres on his life as astudent in pre-1914 Betlin. From his notebooks of the time the author sets the mood, the inner scene; impressions of a restless metropolis and the inner restlessness of its inhabitants, the questions of individual destiny they raise, of good and evil, crowd these early pages. Where to turn for the inner resourcefulness to preserve the living quality of the word by which the writer must live, when it is in such palpable decline? Goethe brings refreshment but no longer sufcient nourishment. At a lecture by Rudolf Steiner to which an acquaintance directs him he nds his answer. We follow the freelance writer to Munich to niingle in the rich cultural life of the time, the theatre, the exhibitions of the experi mental artists who congregated there. Fittingly the rst per formances of the Mystery Plays announce the birth of a new drama where individual destinies stand in the light of spiritual reality. The innite variety of the path of spiritual development here takes on its most concrete form in a drama where the limits of the senses exist no more. Next comes the powerful impression the Goetheanum makes on the autW as rst he walks up Dornach Hill, a few weeks before the outbreak of war. Before long he is drawn into the varied teams from many nations working, often at unfamiliar occupations, on the internal fabric. With characteristic directness the author tells us what it was like to take up mallet and chisel for the rst time; the joyful acquisition of the skill to cut the wood sharp and clear, fashioning the living forms under the guidance of the master architect. Fatigue is balanced by the refreshment flowing from the forms as they are released from the material to reveal the living forces of nature, not imitating her outer cast but welling direct from her life-giving powers. The following sentences sum up the essen tial mood:1 discovered that Rudotf Stelner, in erecting this building, had performed a model educational deed. He turned us from impractical, dreamy eccentrics who often ran away from life into workmen who used their bodies in the service of the spirit. Here the goal was attained\u2014if only for a few years\u2014of serving the earth in freedom and brotherhood without being faithless to the gods. As it must ever be for the artist, the immediate material dictates the theme; the theoretician may be left to pick his text abstractly from the hat and dilate upon it. War brings death crowding every household; many feel the presence of the dead in such grievous times. Rudolf Steiner calmly reveals the spiritual reality of their relationship to the living. In several essays the mood of the timesis caught, illumined, transformed through the fruits of Steiner's research. Thus does one proceed through the book; circumstance and event recast and illumined. The appointment of the author as editor of the weekly Das Goetheanum reveals Steiner's attitude to the freedom and responsi bility of the individual. We sense the currents that stirred in artisticcircles before and at the end of the war, and learn how many artists rejected the more conscious but yet not theoretic path to artistic creation which Rudolf Stedner put before them. Many passages reflect the writer's care for his craft, the struggle to sustain the liv ing word in place of the dead letter, which is as alien to art as it is to a true spiritual understanding. The immediacy of this method, in which the subject itself is reflected in and fructies the writer, is artistically the most satisfying, particularly where the style is bare yet resilient, concise but suffusedwith feeling which leaves the reader free from manipulation. It bears within it, however, certain pitfalls which the author's skill does not always preserve him from. Passages from his notebooks enhance the sense of immediacy but become sometimes a row of aphorisms which check the march of thought and theme. Some essays are themselves aggregations of shorter pieces, with but tenuous connections. This is more particularly evident in the Jong rst section recalling early meetings and the student's eye view of Berlin. Kept within the stricter bounds of a prologue, it would, one feels, have served its essential artistic purpose without disturbing the balance of the whole. The style, otherwise so admirably com pressed, seems here to emphasise the looseness of structure characteristic of such collections. The slightly self-conscious gathering of experience by the young writer weights the more aphoristic passages.The writer and his mission stand momentarily between the reader and the word: the artist's mission is most fruitful when it dies com pletely into the work itself. This is the particular achievement of the later essays, with their gravely luminous style. We read here of the Goetheanum's terribledestruction in the flames of New Y ear's Eve 1922/23, of the mount ing crescendo of activities which Rudolf Stelner sustained in thelast months of his lecturing activity, the author's revealing tribute delivered on the tenth anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's death. These in turn mount to the nal heights of the concluding essays, such as those on Steiner's Christology and Art in the Sign of Michael, which alone would be justication enough, if justication be needed, for this volume issued in translation for the recent Rudolf Steiner Centenary. One thing the reader gratefully notes is the absence of jargon. Even in translation (and the author appears to have been well served by no less than three translators) each word and sen tence resounds tly to the sense. To have lived in the thick of signicant events (even though the world be slow as yet to register them) is to be in debt to those whose paths lay elsewhere. These essays nobly discharge Albert Steffen's debt; In many passages we relive the experience of the time. To those who never knew it, the destruction of the rst Goetheanum may be as great a loss as to those who saw their work rise in the flames. Nothing can repair the sense of deprlval save the inward reconstruction of those forms of wonder, majesty and heart-warming strength. Whoever can assist In this gains a ready ear and Albert Steffen does not fail his readers in bringing the essential experience closer. To reconstruct inwardly what lived between the great Michael window in the west and the forms of the Being of Christ in the east is to enter the realm of the creative spirit whence the building was drawn by the master architect. The House of the Word\u2014wherein the word may be truly spoken\u2014cannot be destroyed. All who will, however different their points of view, may meet there in community, as all are reconciled in Christ into whose living presence the forms and movements of the whole converge. The book is well printed and bound, but the price may deter many from purchasing a volume to which one will want to turn for one essay or another, rather than to absorb at a sitting or two. It illumines themes and incidents in far greater variety than this brief account can suggest. John Salter. 9495Christianity in the Catacombs The Catacombs. Edited by Alfred Heidenreich. (Christian Community Press. 35/-.) 'THIS new edition of Dr. Heidenreich*s earlier work on the C^ta- combs (1931) is virtually a new book and a very welcome one. The earlier work was based on Die Katakomben, by Lie. Emil Bock and Lie. Robert Goebel; an enlarged new edition of this was connnissioned recently, and prepared, after the lamented death of Emi Bock, by Robert Goebel. Dr. Heidenreich took the oppor tunity to revise and enlarge his own book in the light of the new material now available; the letterpress, he tells us, has been almost entirely re\\witten, and the illustrations (including 14 colour plates)have been increased in number and improved in quality . The Catacombs, Dr . Heidenreich reminds us, were not hiding- places but pbterranean cemeteries, but as such they could offer sanctuary, since under Roman law no-one could be arrested there: Only during the last systematic attempts, under Decius andDiocletian in the second half of the third century, to stamp out Christianity wholesale, was the sanctity of these cemeteries violatedBut the contrast between the world above ground and the world below ground was absolute. Above ground the sphere of Caesar, subjugating the world; below ground the sphere of Christ, trans forming the world. Above ground the travesty of Man proclaimedGod, with proud pomp and circumstance; below ground the reality of God become Man, in humility and love. It was in the Catacombs, Dr. Heidenreich says, that reminis cences of ancient wisdom and initiation practices were &st trans formed into Christian wisdom and Christian practice: In the communal meals commemorating the dead, the love feasts (agape) and the early eucharistic ceremonies, Christ Himself was present. Communion with the living Christ took the place of the ancient Initiation. Among the rst Christians no-one questioned life after death. Inthe meetings which were held among the tombs, the souls of thosewhose bodies were buried there were also present. Among the thousands of inscriptions found in the Catacombs, not one preservesthe customary Roman *Vale', meaning 'Farewell'. Its place is token by ' Live in God,' ' Rest in Christ'.... Where Christ is. Death is not\u2014^this is one of the fundamental convictions of early Christian ity. Inasmuch as the Catacombs were burial places of devout and faithful Christians, they were also centres of resurrection. For the rst Christians the \"resurrection of the body\" was no mere article of faith which referred to a promise at the end of time. A &st indication of a resurrection body, woven of light, disclosed itself when in the act of worship in the Catacombs the eye of the soul was opened for spiritual reality. It is very doubtful. Dr. Heidenreich considers, whether these early Christians would recognise in the organised Churches of to-day a true development of the faith they knew and loved: Their difculty would not lie only in facing the different outward appearance and changed position of the Church in the world. They 96Would have even greater inward difculties; for these rst Christian communities possessed a spiritual secret which was lost in later times, and the loss of which changed the character of Christianity. Theyunited personal mysticism with sacramental community. This, above everything, is the most important message of the Catacombs. If thisbook does no more than illustrate this truth, it will have fullled its purpose. The Catacombs were freely adorned with mural and ceiling paintings; the sarcophagi often carry elaborate carved reliefs. There are scenes from the Old and New T estaments, portraits of departed Christians, emblematic representations of sh and bread (the sacra mental meal). As Dr. Heidenreich says, the art of the Catacombs has been variously interpreted by scholars: according to one school,the pictures are symbolic; according to another , they are simple illustrations of biblical and other stories. But there is, he suggests, a third possibility: The early Christian communities possessed and shared a direct, rst-hand experience of the world of the spirit, touching on tneconstant presence of the living Christ, on life after death, and on tne transformation of the soul for the reception of higher spintuai knowledge. It was these rst-hand spiritual experiences whicn tneChristians of the Catacombs wanted to express, and for this pilosea special type of biblical and pagan stories offered the best medium, stories in which their own experience was implicit. Anyone coming to these pictures with only a conventionalknowledge of early Christianity would probably not nd th^ very revealing, but under the guidance of this volume they can becomean impressive and fruitful study. The red-bronze colouring cu tne paintings is striking and comes out strongly in the reproductions.Most of the paintings are crude, but several from the T omb orLucina have a graphic artistic quality. The volume mcludes besides Dr. Heidenreich's long and illuminating mtrodurtory chap ters, a detailed list of the plates and their subjects; a chronology;a short bibliography; and a sketch-map showing the locations or the Catacombs in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome. Any student of Anthroposophy who has an opportunity to visit the Catacombs would nd it immensely rewarding to read this book rst, and to take it with him. Pilgrimage Fool in Love. By Katharine T revelyan. (Gollancz, 25/-.) Born into a distinguished, gifted and good-looking family,Katharine Trevelyan, daughter of Sir Charles Trevelyan, would seem to have started life with the scales of happiness and success heavily weighted on her side. Y et this is a story of many struggles, searing personal diflBculties, and much inner conflict. 97 G.B.\u20147Her family were conrmed atheists, but she herself early developed a strong awareness of the existence of God. and this inevitably set her on a private, often lonely, path where\u2014in spite ofher affectionate relationship with them\u2014her family and its activities were of little support to her. She went abroad to study music, and married the German director of the music academy. This produced the painful situation of maintaining a half-English home and children under the Hitler regime. She went through nervous break downs and abysses of dark experience after the birth of each of her two elder daughters, and eventually fled with them to England. Great courage and resilience, a gift for happiness, and the dis covery of the teachings of Rudolf Steiner\u2014particularly through Dr.Heidenreich and the Christian Community\u2014Whelped her towards stability. Later, without losing contact with Anthroposophy, shebecame associated with the Subud movement, in which the mystical side of her make-up, as distinguished from the severer occult approach, found great release and refreshment. Readers of this journal will recall her account of this in the last issue. . Students of spiritual biographies will see in some of her experi ences a close parallel to the records of the Christian mystics: I came back from sleep into such a peace as I have rarely knownI saw a golden light falling down from Heaven through the branches of the,oak tree and felt it enter my heart ... As this golden rainentered me, my heart responded with a rhythmical beat as thoughIt were drinking in what was sent to it. It was not a single shaft of light; rather it was like moving golden waves lling the air aboveme and centring down on my heart. While it happened, I wasneither interested nor surprised. I was just IN it, enveloped in it, experiencing it. The strange \"shot from the zenith\" recorded near the end of the book stirs similar echoes: At once and instantaneously a blinding flash came from the very highest zenith of Heaven, beyond and beyond what one can imagine.It was not only light; it was also white-hot heat. It took no time. It shot down into my heart (only, curiously, my spiritual heart . seemed to be slightly on the right side compared with my physical heart); it was a moment of intense pain and intense ecstasy. I haveknown no ecstasy bordering on this. If it had taken any time, as we understand it, I would have been burned to a cinder. As it was, it felt to me as though my heart were burnt clear of all dross or impurities in white-hot rays. The struggles and victories of any human soul in its search for eiflightenment are bound to be of interest to all those who are con sciously striving towards some kind of spiritual awareness. Thisaccount of one pilgrimage will be read with sympathy and rwpect by such seekers, including those who may nd it sharply differentfrom their own path. D. E. E.The Way Through Death Though Y ou Die. By Stanley Drake. (Christian Community Press. 12/6.) T i l S s h o r t b o o k i s w r i t t e n p r i m a r i l y f o r r e a d e r s w h o a r e n o tfamiliar, or only slightly familiar, with Anthroposophy, but it will be helpful also to those already acquainted with Rudolf Steiner's treatment of the subject, particularly if they have occasion to answer questions about this. Mr. Drake shows that various people have had experiences, .quite unconnected with y^thro- posophy , which have convinced them that death is not extmction but a passage into a new mode of consciousness. He goes on to give a clear, concise account of the life between death and rebirth,as Dr. Steiner describes it, followed by chapters on the care of the dying, with particular reference to the sacraments of the Christian Community; some aspects of reincarnation and karma; and the sig nicance for human dying of the death and resurrection of C3irist. In this concluding chapter there is a passage (p. 99) which could be misleading. Mr. Drake speaks of the \" kingdom of the shades, in which all souls before (Christ had to dwell in a lonely and shadowy state\", and adds that \"from this condition, which was nota punishment for the wicked but an unavoidable experience for pre- Christian souls, Christ rescued mankind.\" This seems to imply that throughout pre-Christian times the realm immediately beyond deathwas without the possibility of light, even for the most saintly souls, or for those who had gone far along a pre-Christian path of initiation.This may not be what Mr . Drake means to say , but p the passage stands it seems to me not to do justice to Dr. Steiner's treatment of pre-Christian religious wisdom and the Mystery schools. Apart from this uncertainty, the book is valuable not only forthe iifformation and counsel it offers, but for its discerning human approach, neither cold nor sentimental, to a subject which concerns everyone but nowadays is seldom freely discussed. C\u00bb W9 * Mr, Drake {asked by the reviewer if he would care to com' ment) writes: \"I can understand your feeling that the contrast I have drawn between the condition of the souls before and after Cairist is too crass. I have stressed it sharply in order to emphasise what I believe is important for the Christian religious life today, namely a sense of wonder and awe at the tremendous ef fect of the death and resurrection of Chnst on the lives of men and women, both this side of and beyond the gate of death, in regard to their spiritual and bodily state of being.\" I do not believe that the experience of utter darkness without the possibility of light' was universal in pre-Christian times, any more than I believe that every soul today experiences only universal light. The matter is far more conaplex than that. So I plead forthe reader's tolerance for my over-simplication.\" 99Religion in the Early Years Growing Up In Religion. By Evelyn Derry. (Christian Community Press. 18/-.) E v e n f o r t h e p a r e n t w h o i s c o m p l e t e l y c o m m i t t e d t o a n d f u l l y a tease in one or another religious denomination, a child's approach to religious practice and belief\u2014not to mention his often formid able metaphysical questions\u2014can present many diGBculties. Beginning with the child's true being, and with the relationshipbetween child and adult, Mrs. Derry clears away many of the mis conceptions, tensions and barriers that befog the religious education of children, and too often make it something entirely separate from the pattern of their daily lives. There is an admirable chapter on Moral Training which almost any parent could read with prot. The importance of the seasonal festivals in a child's life; prayer in the different stages of growth from infancy to adolescence; conceptions of good and evil as they affect the child; the development of conscience\u2014^these and many other aspects of religious growth are examined with insight and good sense.While the book is of necessity one for Christian\u2014and particu larly for anthroposophical\u2014parents, it is also of great interest to alladults concerned in any way with the care of children. D. E. E. Eleanor Merry Art: its Occult Basis and Healing Value. By Eleanor C. Merry. (New Knowledge Books, East Grinstead, Sussex. 35/-.) E l e a n o r M e r r y w a s a w o m a n o f w i d e i n t e r e s t s a n d i m a g i n ative insight. In this book we are offered the fruits of her life as an artist. The core of the book is the section on Painting and Imagin ation which formed her contribution to Pure Colour (a handbook on colour and painting written jointly with Maria Schindler, now long out of print). These chapters distil her experience as a painter and are at the same time a ne example of her lively, imaginative style of writing which renders even the commonplace fresh and immediate. For Eleanor Merry, the soul of art is wonder; its language, imagination. For painting, this language is the everchanging tones of colour and the way in which these are woven into picture by the elemental powers of nature. This section is prefaced by essays on The Origins of the Arts, which broadly trace the development of various arts from their birth in the ancient mystery centres, and by a short but neverthe less rewarding study of The Portrayal of Christ.The latter part of the book contains an article on Rudolf Steiner and Art, where the author roundly, and rightly, dismisses the term \"anthroposophical art\", and a brief note on the painter Nicholas Roerich, for whom Eleanor Merry had a warm apprecia tion. The book concludes with a long discussion, under the title of Culture in Transition, of art in relation to science and religion, and its place in the sadly unbalanced civilization of today. A notable feature of the book is the inclusion of nine reproduc tions in colour of paintings by the author. Each is the vivid ren dering of an imaginative experience which is characteristic of her Dainting. The examples chosen range from the more delicatelyuminous Christmas imaginations of The Kings and The Shepherds to the striking colour of Vision and Ancient Wisdom, the last a picture based on a prismatic scale of almost cruel intensity.In some ways one feels Eleanor Merry's painting as an art in transition\u2014plunging deeply on one hand into the life-giving, imaginative ocean of colour, retaining on the other a strong con nection with Renaissance tradition in the realisation of form. Per haps the most successful, certainly the most \" modern\" in feeling, is her Orestes and the Furies, where colour and form are woven into a taut and interdependent composition. One nishes the book with gratitude to the editor for rescuing its various parts from the obscurity of out-of-print books and journals. It is at once aremembrance of the work of a gifted artist and a source of fresh encouragement to a later generation. John Salter. T h e C e l t i c P a s t The Flaming Door. By Eleanor C. Merry.

It has a helpful new Introduction by Adam Bittleston; he pays tribute to the intuitive sympathy that Mrs. Merry brought to her studies of the Celtic past and mentions the relation of the Hibernian Mysteries, with their emphasis on the polarity between knowledge and artistic creation, as described by Rudolf Steiner , tothe controversy about the \"two cultures\" in our midst to-day. The book itself covers a wide variety of Celtic lore and legend, relating them to the evolution of human consciousness and the incisive effect of the coming of Christ. A great deal of not readily accessible material is brought together and discussed by a writer who did not claim to be a scholar but had a strong sense of kinship with the old Celtic ways of life and feeling.

In spirithe crosses the bridge of death, passes through regions of purgatory , and is at last led by Michael to the judgment of Christ. The coloured illustrations show Mrs. Merry's art at its best, working in a visionary realm particularly congenial to her. An interesting note on the modal music of the song, with music-type examples, is contributed by Benedict Wood. C. W. Colour and Its Powers The Mystery-Wisdom of Colour.

Miss Mayer and her collaborators have assembled (though in a not very clearly arranged form) a wealth of ideas and information which will be most useful to anyone who wishes either to under stand the theory of this approach to painting, or to experience the method by practising it. C.W.spontaneous appreciation into each vividly painted fairy-tale scene as it follows another. Those who know something of Rudolf Steiner's work must nevertheless realise very soon that nothing has been inserted at random. From the picturing of the central charac ter of the story , the half-man, Krestianin, who is given a rose-briar cross to bear in place of a whole man's cross of bone, that he may stand upright, down to the smallest details such as the naming of the different trees which grow on the opposite sides of the valley separating the land of Death-which-is-Birth from the land of Birth- which-is-Death\u2014everything has conscious meaning. So, too, in themanner of telling: each word and phrase is wrought with the greatest care. Those who already know and admire Mrs. Wyatt's stories will be sure to nd much to satisfy them in The Cross Bearer , and little children may well enjoy having it read to them. Y et naturally this style of writing will not be to everybody's taste. In spite of the strong, dramatic mood, some may nd these brightly painted scenestoo formal and remotely beautiful, rather in the manner of Burne Jones or Rossetti; they may feel that a more unorthodox treatment would have been better suited to a 'new' myth. They may feel, too, that although the description of the effects of evil is poignantly done, that of evil itself is scarcely attempted. The booklet has a sturdy cardboard cover and is printed on good quality paper in large, clear type. Both the cover design (UobelSmith) and the coloured illustration (Collot D'Herbois) suffer a little from not being sufciently adapted to the medium of a small booklet and give a rather cramped impression. The cover looks too much like a religious tract... a simpler design might have achieved a more modern effect! The founders of the Michael Press are to be congratulated on their new venture. It is assured of a warm welcome from all vwiters and artists who are attempting to work out Rudolf Steiner s impulse. loy Manseld. A N e w V e n t u r e The Cross Bearer. By Isabel Wyatt.

(Michael Press, 7/6; postage 6d.) these gentle, melodious verses are written out of the mood of1 an' anthroposophical' Christmas\u2014a Christmas, that is, in which both the accepted Biblical themes and the traditional accompani ments, the holly and the candles, the robins and the snow, have been given new meaning and signicance. And out of the reality of her content and her sensitive approach to it, kindled by the charming sights and scents of Christmastide, Mrs. Wyatt is able to achieve a quality which is both fresh and 103sweet, a new theme springing from the old. At times, however, the poems seem too derivative. Old, well-loved carols are frequentlytaken as models and it would need a ne hand indeed to surpass these. But one is also powerfully aware in many cases that a lecture by Rudolf Steiner lies behind, sometimes appearing to replace the harsh birth-pang of personal sensation and experience.Here is certainly a problem which confronts many anthroposophi- cal writers and artists: how to achieve the stamp of real artistic individuality while basing their work on an inspiration derived from Rudolf Steiner. The collection is dedicated to 'Children of All Ages', and although most of the poems are more suitable for those of a certain maturity, there are others, such as 'Christmas Morning' whicheven the very youngest should enjoy: \" H e i s b o r n ! \" The cock crows,\" Wihen, when?\" C l u c k s t h e H e n . \"At Dawn \" T h e O x l o w s .\" W h e r e ?

Francis Edmunds What is Rudolf Steiner education ? To answer this question, so frequently asked, the Rudolf Steiner Press is preparing a series of books. The rst, by L. Francis Edmunds, is entitled Rudolf Steiner Education\u2014the Waldorf Impulse. It is an enlarged and revised edition of his 65 page booklet published in 1955 and he has brought it completely up to date. L. Francis Edmunds was for many years a teacher at Michael Hall, the oldest English Rudolf Steiner school, has lectured on education throughout the world, and is now the principal of Emerson College near Birmingham. Having been a leading gure in Rudolf Steiner education almost since it began, he is uniquely qualied to describe it. The publishers are condent that in its new form the book will help many people who want to know what Rudolf Steiner education is. As well as giving a lucid and factual account of all aspects of the education, the author relates the schools for normal children to the perhaps better known Rudolf Steiner homes for backward and handicapped children and discusses teacher training and adult education. He also lists all the Rudolf Steiner schools in the world in which the medium of teaching is English. There is a greatly extended section in which Mr. Edmunds answers questions that have often been asked of him by parents. The author asks himself in his introduction : \" Can you give me in a nutshell what distinguishes this type of education from others?\" We hope you will read his book and agree that he can.

How has the modern scicntihc mentality, detached and analytic, developed from earlier modes of thought, and how is it likely to influence human life in the future?Certain religious ideas, especially those of the Fall and Christian redemption, are brought into relation with the evolution of con sciousness. The author believes that this is a concept which we need if we are to make sense of the human situation, its hopes and hazards, in the twentieth century. jg/_ M a n o r M a t t e r e r n s t L e h r s SECOND EDITION.
