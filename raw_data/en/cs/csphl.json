I ended up choosing this clinic and they did for me what my health care covered by insurance could not. Every one of their health care professionals are excellent. Now, members of my family go there.\" -James \"These guys deserve a 5-star rating! They are amazing. They really care about your whole health & dig to get to the root cause, not just put a band-aid on the symptoms. I have never had a doctor spend so much time with me and go over my test results line by line, then develop a plan to go after the root cause. Very professional! I have recommended them to everyone I come across.\" -Cari B. \"I have had Hashimoto's Hypothyroid for over 25 years. Finally, I have a health center who understands my needs, has improved not only my everyday life but is continuously working hard to give me the lifestyle I want which is riding endurance with my horses.\" -Lori M. \"Wonderful visit. The whole office is very sensitive to patient's needs. Calm, professional, caring. They LISTEN to the patient. Could not ask for more.\" -P.Z. \"I have worked with one of Dr. C's associates, as well as had a one on one consultation that he offers, with regard to Hashimotos. I am very pleased with everything they have recommended and of the care that I was given. My blood tests, which are now better than they have ever been in years, speak for that. I use several of his supplements in my everyday life, as well as his reset shake and resistant starch, and I truly believe this has turned everything around for me. Not to mention, on the one on one call he will give you a summary of his notes/recommendations so that you can share it with your healthcare practitioner in your own hometown. I will definitely be checking back in with him on a regular basis.\" -Loryetta J. "}
