Acupuncture is one of the modalities of Oriental Medicine (O.M.). This treatment consists of fine needles placed into the body at points shown to be effective in the treatment of specific health concerns. These points have been mapped out by the Chinese for over two thousand years. There are more than one-thousand actual points which stimulate yuor body's natural Qi or vital energy. Some treatments may include herbal treatment, Guasha, and cupping. Acupuncturists can treat a vast majority of ailments including these common conditions: - Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders - Respiratory Disorders - Gastrointestinal Disorders - Circulatory Disorders - Urogenital Disorders - Gynecological Disorders - Musculoskeletal Disorders - Psychoemotional and Neurological Disorders Is Acupuncture Safe? Yes! Your provider has been through extensive amounts of schooling and training in the art of Acupuncture. All licensed acupuncturists today use individually packed, sterile, and disposable needles. Your chance of infection or contagion is almost none. Does it hurt? The needles used in Acupuncture are usually not much thicker than a hair, making the insertion of the needle practically painless. Many people do not even know the needles are in place. The vast majority of patients find acupuncture very relaxing and may even fall asleep during treatment. What can I expect after treatment? Oftentimes, patients will experience results on the first treatment. Remember, however, the longer you have been in the pain, the longer relief may take! Some will experience an immediate, total, or partial relief of their pain or other symptoms. The relief may last, or some of the pain may return. Rarely, there is no immediate relief, only to notice the pain decrease in the following days. Overall, expect to feel better!
