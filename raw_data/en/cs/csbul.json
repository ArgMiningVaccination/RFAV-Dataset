CSR/RPED was reported in 25% of patients treated with BALVERSA, with a median time to first onset of 50 days. Grade 3 CSR/RPED, involving central field of vision, was reported in 3% of patients. CSR/RPED resolved in 13% of patients and was ongoing in 13% of patients at the study cutoff. CSR/RPED led to dose interruptions and reductions in 9% and 14% of patients, respectively and 3% of patients discontinued BALVERSA. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 28% of patients during treatment with BALVERSA and were Grade 3 in 6% of patients. All patients should receive dry eye prophylaxis with ocular demulcents as needed. Perform monthly ophthalmological examinations during the first 4 months of treatment and every 3 months afterwards, and urgently at any time for visual symptoms. Ophthalmological examination should include assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp examin ation, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography. Withh old BALVERSA when CSR occurs and permanently discontinue if it does not resolve within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 in severity. For ocular adverse reactions, follow the dose modification guidelines [see D osage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.2 Hyperphosphatemia Increases in phosphate effect of BALVERSA [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. Hyperphosphatemia was reported as adverse reaction in 76% of patients treated with BALVERSA . The median onset time for any grade event of hyperphosphatemia was 20 days (range: 8 - 116) after initiating BALVERSA. Thirty -two percent of patients received phosphate binders during treatment with BALVERSA. Reference ID: 4418725 Monitor for hyperphosphatemia and follow the dose modification guidelines when required [see Dosage and Administration 2.2, 2.3] . 5.3 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an embryo -fetal toxicity study, oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations and embryo -fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum human recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are also described elsewhere in the labeling: Ocular Disorders [see Warning and Warning and Precautions (5.2)] . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BA LVERSA was evaluated in the BLC2001 study that included 87 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma which had susceptible FGFR 3 or FGFR 2 genetic alterations, and which progressed during or following at least one line of prior chemotherapy including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients were treated with BALVERSA at 8 mg orally once daily; with a dose increase to 9 mg in patients with phosphate levels <5.5 mg/dL on Day 14 of Cycle 1 . Median duration of treatment was 5.3 months (range: 0 to 17 months). The most common adverse reactions ( ARs) including laboratory abnormalities ( 20%) were phosphate increased , stomatitis, increased, phosphatase increased, sodium decreased, albumin decreased, dysgeusia, hemoglobin decreased, dry skin, aspartate aminotransferase increased, decreased, dry eye, alopecia, pa lmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, constipatio n, phosphate decreased , abdominal pain, calcium increased, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain. The most common G rade 3 or greater (>1% hyperphosphatemia. An a dverse reaction with a fatal outcome in 1% of patients was acute myocardial infarction . Reference ID: 4418725 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients inclu ding eye disorders (10%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent reasons for permanent discontinuation included eye disorders (6%). Dosage interruptions occurred in 68% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption included hyperphosphatemia (24%), reductions occurred in 53% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions for dose reductions included eye Table 3 presents ARs reported in 10% of patients treated with BALVERSA at 8 mg once daily.

Table 5: Drug Interactions that Affect BALVERSA Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to increased drug -related toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Clinical Management Consider alternative therapies that are not strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 during treatment with BALVERS A. If co-administration of a strong inhibitor of CYP2 C9 or CYP3A4 is unavoidable, monitor closely for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2. 3)]. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the BALVERSA dose may be increased in the absence of drug -related toxicity . Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 Inducers inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 decrease plasma concentrations significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management Avoid co -administration of strong inducers of CYP2C9 or inducers CYP2C9 or plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management If a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co -administered at the start of BALVERSA treatment, administer BALVERSA dose as recommended (8 mg once daily with potential to increase to 9 mg once daily based on serum phosphate levels on Days 14 to 21 and to lerability ). If a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co -administered after the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels and tolerability , increase BALVERSA dose up to 9 mg. When a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 is disconti nued, continue BALVERSA at the same dose, in the absence of drug -related toxicity. Serum Phosphate Level -Altering Agents Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with other serum phosphate level -altering agents may increase or decrease serum phosphate levels [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. Changes in serum phosphate levels due to serum phosphate level -altering agents (other than erdafit inib) may interfere with serum phosphate levels needed for the determination of initial dose increased based on serum phosphate levels [see Dosage and Administration (2. 3)]. Clinical Management Avoid co -administration of serum phosphate level -altering agents with BALVERSA before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21) [see Dosage and Administration (2. 3)]. 7.2 Effect of BALVERSA on Other Drugs Table 6 summarizes the effect of BALVERSA on other drugs and their clinical management. Table 6: BALVERSA Drug Interactions that Affect Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with CYP3A4 of CYP3A4 substrates Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Altered plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates may lead to loss of activity or increased toxicity of the CYP3A4 substrates. Clinical Management Avoid co -administration of BALVERSA with sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with narrow indices Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with of OCT2 substrates Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased plasma concentrations of OCT2 substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the OCT2 substrates. Clinical Management Consider alternative therapies that are not OCT2 substrates or consider reducing the dose of OCT2 metformin) based on of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates increase the of P -gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased plasma concentrations of -gp substrates may lead to increased Reference ID: 4418725 toxicity of the P -gp substrates. Clinical Management If co-administration of BALVERSA with P -gp substrates is unavoidable, separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P -gp substrates with narrow therapeutic index. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available data on BALVERSA use in pregnant women to inform a dr ug-associated risk . Oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused malformations and embryo - fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC (see Data). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 -4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo -fetal toxicity study, erdafitinib was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. Doses 4mg/kg/day (at total maternal exposures <0.1% of total human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC) produced embryo -fetal death, major blood vessel malformations and other vascular anomalies, limb malformations (ectrodactyly, absent or misshapen long bones), an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies in multiple bones (vertebrae, sternebrae, ribs), and decreased fetal weight . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of erdafitinib in human milk, or the effects of erdafitinib on the breastfed child , or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from erdafitinib in a breastfed child , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month following the last dose. Reference ID: 4418725 8.3 Females and Males of R eproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with BALVERSA. Contraception Females BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise f emale s of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Population (8.1)] . Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use ef fective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Infertility Females Based on findings from animal studies, BALVERSA may impair fertility in females of reproductive potentia l [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BALVERSA in pediatric patients have not been established . In 4 and 13 -week repeat -dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs, toxicities in bone and teeth were observed at an exposure less than the human exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Chondroid dysplasia/metaplasia were reported in multiple bones in both species, and tooth abnormalities included abnormal/irregular denting in rats and dogs and discoloration and degeneration of odontoblasts in rats. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 416 patients treated with BALVERSA in clinical studies, 45% were 65 years of age or older, and 12% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were obser ved between these patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 8.6 CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers CYP2C9*3/*3 Genotype: Erdafitinib plasma concentrations were predicted to be higher in patients with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. Monitor for increased adverse reactions in patients who are known or suspected to have CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype [see Pharmacogenomics (12.5 )]. Reference ID: 4418725 11 the active ingredient in BALVERSA, is a kinase inhibitor. It is practically insoluble, or insoluble to freely soluble in organic solvents, and slightly soluble to practically insoluble, or insoluble in aqueous m edia over a wide range of pH values. The molecular formula is C 25H30N6O2 and molecular weight is 446.56. Chemical structure of erdafitinib is as follows: N N N MeO OMe N N Me NH BALVERSA (erdafitinib) is supplied as 3 mg, 4 mg or 5 mg film -coated tablets for oral administration and contains the following inactive ingredients: Tablet Core: Croscarmellose (Opadry I, Polyvinyl alcohol -partially hydrolyzed, Sodium lauryl sulfate, Talc, Titanium dioxide, Iron oxide yellow, Iron oxide red (for the orange and brown tablets only), Ferrosoferric oxide/iron oxide black (for the brown tablets only). 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Erdafitinib is a kinase inhibitor that binds to and inhibits enzymatic activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 based on in vitro also binds to RET, CSF1R, VEGFR2. Erdafitinib inhibited FGFR phosphorylation and signaling and decreased cell viability in cell lines expressing FGFR genetic altera tions, including point mutations, activity in FGFR -expressing cell lines and xenograft models derived from tumor types, including bladder cancer. Reference ID: 4418725 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Based on evaluation of QTc interval in an open- label, dose escalation and dose expansion study in 187 patients with cancer, erdafitinib had no large effect (i.e., > 20 ms) on the QTc interval . Serum Phosphate Erdafitinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. BALVERSA should be increased to the maximum recommended dose to achieve target serum phosphate levels of 5.5- 7.0 mg/dL in early cycles with continuous daily dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. In erdafitinib clinic al trials, the use of drugs which can increase serum phosphate levels, such as potassium phosphate supplements, vitamin D supplements, antacids, phosphate -containing enemas or laxatives, and medications known to have phosphate as an excipient were prohibited unless no alternatives exist. To manage phosphate elevation, phosphate binders were permitted. Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of 8 mg once daily, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) erdafitinib steady -state maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), area under the curve (AUC tau), and minimum observed plasma concentration (C min) were 1 ,399 ng/mL (51%), 29,268 ng\u00b7h/mL (60%), and 936 ng/mL single and repeat once daily dosing, erdafitinib exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration [C max] and area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC]) increased proportionally across the dose range of 0.5 to 12 mg (0.06 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dose) . Steady state was achieved after 2 weeks with once daily dosing and the mean accumulation ratio was 4 -fold. Absorption Median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (t max) was 2.5 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours). Effect of Food No clinically meaningful differences with erdafitinib pharmacokinetics were observed following administration of a high -fat and high- calorie meal (800 calories to 1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in healthy subjects . Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of erdafitinib was 29 L in patients . Erdafitinib protein binding was 99.8% in patients, primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Reference ID: 4418725 Elimination The mean total apparent clearance (CL/F) of erdafitinib was 0.362 L/h in patients. The mean effective half -life of erdafitinib was 59 hours in patients . Metabolism Erdafitinib is primarily me tabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in the total clearance of erdafitinib is estimated to be 39% and 20% respectively . Unchanged erdafitinib was the major drug -related moiety in plasma, there were no circulating metabolite s. Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled erdafitinib, approximately 69% of the dose was recovered in feces ( 19% as unchanged) and 19% in urine (13% as unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically meaningful trends in the pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib were observed based on age (21\u00ad 88 years), sex, race, body weight (36 -132 kg), mild (eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate, using modification of diet in renal disease equation] 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) or modera te -59 or hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0-1.5 x ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in patients with severe renal impairment, renal impairme nt requiring dialysis, moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model- Based Approaches Strong CYP2C9 Inhibitor s: Erdafitinib mean ratios CI) for C and AUC inf were 121% (99.9, 147) and 148% (120, 182), respectively, when co -administered with fluconazole, a strong CYP2C9 inhibitor and 105% (86.7, and 164) when co -administered with strong and CYP3A4/2C9 Simulations suggested that rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4/2C9 inducer) may significantly decrease erdafitinib C max and Vitro Studies CYP Substrates: Reference ID: 4418725 a time and inducer of CYP3A4. The effect of erdafitinib on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate is unknown. Erdafitinib is not an inhibitor of other major CYP isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations . Transporters: Erdafitinib is a substrate and inhibitor of P -gp. P -gp inhibitors are not expected to affect erdafitinib exposure to a clinically relevant extent. Erdafitinib is an inhibitor of concentrations. Acid-Lowering Agents: Erdafitinib has adequate solubility across the pH range of 1 to 7.4. Acid- lowering agents (e.g., ant acids, H2-antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are not expected to affect the bioavailability of erdafitinib. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic variants, such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Erdafitinib exposure was similar in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 genotypes relative to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (wild type). No data are available in subjects characterized by other genotypes (e.g., *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3). Simulation suggested no clinical ly meaningful differences in erdafitinib exposure in subjects with CYP2C9*2/*2 and *2/*3 genotypes. The exposure of erdafitinib is predicted to be 50% higher in subjects with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype, estimated to be present in 0.4% to 3% of the population among various ethnic groups. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with erdafitinib. Erdafitinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in an in vitro micronucleus or an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with erdafitinib. In the 3-month repeat -dose toxicity study , erdafitinib showed effects on female reproductive organs (necrosis of the ovarian corpora lutea) in rats at an exposure less than the human exposure (AUC) at maximum recommended human dose. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Urothelial Carcinoma with Susceptible FGFR Genetic Alterations Study BLC2001 (NCT02365597) was a multicenter, open- label , single -arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BALVERSA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Fibroblast growth factor recep tor ( FGFR ) mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trial assay (CTA). The efficacy population consists of a cohort of eighty -seven patients who were enrolled in this study with disease that had progressed on or after at least one prior chemotherapy and that had at least 1 of the following genetic alterations: FGFR3 gene CTA performed at a central Reference ID: 4418725 laboratory. Tumor samples from 69 patients were tested retrospectively by the QIAGEN therascreen\u00ae FGFR RGQ RT -PCR Kit, which is the FDA -approved test for selection of patients with mUC for BALVERSA . Patients received a starting dose of BALVERSA at 8 mg once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg once daily in patients whose serum phosphate levels were below the target of 5.5 mg/dL between days 14 and 17; a dose increase occurred in 41% of patients. BALVERSA was administered until diseas e progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as determined by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1. The median age was 6 7 years (range: 36 to 87 years), 79% were male, and 7 4% were Caucasian. Most patients (9 2%) had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Sixty -six percent of patients had visceral metastases . Eighty -four (97%) patients r eceived of cisplatin or carboplatin previously. Fifty -six percen t of patients only received prior cisplatin -based regimens, 29% received only prior carboplatin- based both cisplatin and carboplatin -based regimens. Three (3%) patients had disease progression following prior platinum - containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy only. Twenty -four percent of patients had been treated with prior anti PD-L1/PD -1 therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 and Table 8 . Overall response rate was 32.2%. Responders included patients who had previously not responded to anti PD-L1/PD -1 therapy.
