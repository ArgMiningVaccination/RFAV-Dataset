According to [US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-09-12/2017-a-record-year-of-unhappiness-around-the-world-survey-shows), 2017 was a record year for unhappiness. Emotional cleansing helps us to release old feelings and traumas that hold us back, so we can live fully and with joy--in other words, emotional cleansing helps balance Vata, Pitta and Kapha in the body and mind. \"Ayurvedic emotional detox helps clients live happier, more fulfilling, healthier lives,\" says Veena of Saumya Ayurveda. \"And that - is positively contagious.\" What is Emotional Cleansing? Emotional cleansing is the process of releasing accumulated mental \"yuck.\" Pranayama, yog-asana, and other Ayurvedic lifestyle tools help instill a sense of balance, wellbeing, and vitality in its place. \"Many clients who benefit from emotional cleansing have anxiety as a chief concern - and almost everyone feels stressed and tired\" says Veena. Emotional imbalances manifest differently in every person. Pitta-type emotions may manifest as impatience, irritability, explosiveness and burning digestion. Vata, on the other hand, may present as sleep troubles, depression, intense stress, exhaustion and constipation. \"After losing three family members in eight months, I was out of balance physically, mentally, and spiritually. All self-care went by the wayside then fatigue, anxiety, and grief sent me into survival mode. After just three weeks of Veena's recommendations, I am back to feeling joy again, and anxiety is gone.\" -Mary B., Minneapolis, Minnesota Benefits of Emotional Cleansing with Ayurveda Set the foundation for physical healing and wellbeing Relieve chronic anxiety, stress, trauma or PTSD Enjoy more balanced physical and mental health Reduce and soften non-productive emotions Access higher states of consciousness Develops a stronger immune system Feel younger and like yourself again Enjoy your whole being balanced Enjoy life more Stress less How Do We Begin an Ayurveda Emotional Detox? We start by simply observing. Through ongoing awareness and practice, we become the witness to how the doshas manifest in the present moment. (\"Oh, that's just Pitta talking.\") By being the witness and observing the dosha manifesting, we create a healthy space between the rising emotion and that reduces reactivity and overwhelm. \"Creating awareness softens the experience, and creates distance,\" says Veena. \"Then, we introduce practices that alleviate the pressure building inside us.\" We don't do laundry once, we wash our clothes when they need it. At Saumya Ayurveda, we approach emotional cleansing as a lifestyle practice - not something you do once or twice a year. Can You Benefit from Detoxing Emotionally? Let's Find Out! When the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) are imbalanced, we feel it physically and mentally.

I highly recommend Saumya Ayurveda if you want to feel better and have more vitality.\" -Molly Rossini, Minnesota Peruse our client [stories.](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/testimonials) 10 Ayurvedic Lifestyle Practices for Emotional Cleansing 1. Pranayama (or Breath Work) In today's world, we consider stress a part of life. But stress creates physical and mental disease. Our breath connects our body and our busy mind - and when we change our breath, we change our lives. In Ayurveda, Prana is the animating force. Today, pranayama is widely taught as exercises of the physical breath, often used as preparation for meditation. But far beyond the modern yoga studio understanding - pranayama is a vast exploration of depth and subtleties. Pranayama for Emotional Cleansing Many want to jump to fancy \"advanced\" pranayama - but it's risky to attempt powerful techniques before establishing the habit of diaphragmatic breathing. First, establish a daily practice of [diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/prayanama-breathing-techniques-for-beginners) over six to twelve months. 1. Read our popular how to article: [Learn Diaphragmatic Breathing and Change Your Life.](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life) 2. Use our free [guided practices](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices) each day to help you develop this breath and to relax and rejuvenate your nervous system, mind and whole being. 3. In time, diaphragmatic breathing becomes res-established as the healthy way to breath. Nadi Shodhana, or [alternate nostril breathing](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/prayanama-breathing-techniques-for-beginners), can be introduced in tandem. \"When we learn diaphragmatic breathing, we remain relaxed, focused and less stressed and overwhelmed,\" says Veena. \"That is every beginners. ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/prayanama-breathing-techniques-for-beginners) Once you've established a steady core practice, other techniques can be considered. Two beneficial pranayama for emotional cleansing are [Kapalbhati](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/prayanama-breathing-techniques-for-beginners) (Skull Shining breath) and [Bhramari ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/prayanama-breathing-techniques-for-beginners)(Humming Bee breath). Performing these pranayama correctly, in the proper sequence and duration, requires experienced guidance. \"Loving the daily practices, a routine that feels EMBODYING.\" Mark F., USA 2. Yog-asana. Gentle postures, done regularly, increase vitality and balance of body and mind. Yoga-asana for emotional cleansing In our busy, stressful world - most people need to rejuvenate, relax, and ground. Practice Savasana and Viparita Karani once or twice daily for emotional cleansing on all levels. Corpse Pose/Savasana: Lie on a firm, flat surface with the spine, neck, and head in alignment. Arms flat, palm-up beside your body. Activate your relaxation response with this [11-minute systemic relaxation meditation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices). Viparita Karani/Legs-up-the-Wall: Begin seated beside an open wall. Gently lower your torso to the ground while lifting your legs up the wall, forming an \"L\" shape with your body. Dip into a state of grounded calm with this [2-minute relaxation meditation.](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices) \"The Saumya Ayurveda way is to focus on quality, not quantity,\" says Veena. \"People are already overwhelmed - a few minutes of the right practice, performed correctly, is all and everything we need.\" 3. Abhyanga Self-Massage (aka Ayurveda massage) Abhyanga helps eliminate toxins (ama) physically and mentally by bringing a sense of calm, rejuvenating the mind and body, and balancing the doshas. Learn how to cleanse emotionally with this [guide to Abhyanga self-massage](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/abhyanga-massage). Saumya Ayurveda can help you discover which herbalized oil is best for your current situation. 4. Nasya Oil In Ayurveda, the nostrils are a gateway not only to the sinuses - but to the mind and consciousness itself. [Nasya](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/https-www-saumya-ayurveda-com-post-nasya-oil-benefits-how-to-use-nasya-oil-for-greater-wellbeing) oil treatment cleanses and supports this natural gateway. Applying herbalized nasya oil balances the qualities, experiences, and symptoms of the mind and emotions. The correct oil will ground, soothe, and help focus aggravated Vata, while another blend will cool Pitta's hot head. Here's how to get started with daily [nasya practice](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/nasya-oil). \"Ayurvedic practices work together,\" Veena says. \"And just a few minutes of these tools pays huge dividends.\" Imagine you've had a draining day at work, and commute home in heavy traffic. If you pause to do nasya, legs-up-the-wall, or a guided meditation - how will that affect the rest of your evening? Now, imagine you simply barrel through. How will you feel at dinner or a late meeting, and how will your sleep be affected? Choose an evening routine that establishes calm and vitality for the next day and an enjoyable evening. Remember, today started yesterday. 5. Self-Reflection Our inner-dialog is a tool for self-reflection. Working with this dialogue helps you befriend your mind. You learn to become comfortable with who you are and be softer with yourself. In this state, you can make choices from awareness and love - rather than your subconscious. \"Think of a pressure cooker,\" says Veena. \"The steam needs to be released. When we take a dip into relaxation and meditation, that pressure is released. This prevents it from building up past the boiling point, as with Pitta, or unhealthy overwhelm, as with Vata.\" Inner-dialog is a path to understanding your true nature without judgment. When you come to appreciate how your mind works, you may even experience a spiritual \"aha!\" - accompanied by relief and deep healing. \"I was working with a client int their 60's who was concerned with her mind. In the minute it took for me to explain that it is simply the nature of a Vata mind to enjoy moving like a butterfly in flower garden, sipping the nectar from the variety of plants--she teared up and was released from decades of judgement and feelings of inadequacy. 'You mean, this is my nature and there's nothing wrong with me?' There's nothing wrong with it and everything beautiful about it.\" The pain in her heart was removed and this was a transformational spiritual \"aha!\" -Veena [Book a consultation](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/service-page/free-phone-consultation?referral=service_list_widget) with Saumya Ayurveda to discover the best self-reflection practices for your unique mind. 6. Healthy Sleep Hygiene Have you ever had a nightmare about work or a vulnerable moment from your childhood? Dreaming is how our minds cleanse mental toxins (ama) and work through challenging experiences - whether they're from yesterday or long ago. There's a saying in Ayurveda, \"today started yesterday.\" What we did yesterday, and how we did it, influences our present state. Our hectic society places little emphasis on the importance of sleep, but it's the bedrock of our physical and mental wellbeing. Sleep Hygiene for Emotional Cleansing Quality sleep rejuvenates the body and mind, while poor sleep leaves us feeling drained and lousy. When it comes to healthy sleep hygiene - a consistent wake-up schedule is key. On average, Vata types should wake by 6:00 am, Pitta by 5:30 am, and Kapha by 4:30 am. If your schedule isn't ideal, adjust it gently by waking up 15 minutes earlier each week. \"The best sleep schedule isn't one-size-fits-all,\" says Veena. \"It depends on your doshic picture, location, stage of life, and the season. Personalized guidance helps you surf the energy waves.\" Our sleep position matters too. Sleeping on the left side allows gravity to move food waste more easily from the small to large intestine. This encourages: better heart function, blood flow, and digestion; neck and back pain relief; greater immunity; and even lighter snoring. 7. Vastu Shastra What is Vastu Shastra? It is the traditional ancient Indian science and system of architecture. Vastu is based on the sacred, ancient texts concerned with design, layout, measurements, and special arrangements. [Vastu shastra](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/meet-panditji) balances the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) that comprise the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas. According to this ancient science, it's best to sleep with the head to the east or south, and never to the north. According to Harvard Health, \"Self-awareness\u2014being in tune with your emotions\u2014may sound fairly straightforward and simple. But people tend to overestimate their level of self-awareness.\" Click [here](https://www.health.harvard.edu/promotions/harvard-health-publications/emotional-intelligence?utm_source=delivra&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HB20220728-EmoIntel&utm_id=3924817&dlv-emuid=d58fbac7-98a8-43ac-8d5a-4aa5aacf4403&dlv-mlid=3924817) to learn more. 8. Journal Get it out. Let it go. Journaling is an effective way to start an Ayurveda emotional detox. Find a notebook, or choose a special bound journal. (Avoid journaling on a device.) Feel the pen in your hand, it's movement across the paper, let everythings slow down. Benefits of Journaling: Reduces stress and anxiety Improves communication skills (which tends to also reduces stress and anxiety} Provides perspective by showing your progress and transformation Strengthens memory Stimulates creativity Boosts health and sense of wellbeing Provides a vehicle for proessesing emotions Helps to clarify next steps and long term direction, as well as wants and needs Boosts emotional intelligence 9. Rest, Restore, Relax, and Release Once we begin to [relax,](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices) it's natural to let go. \"Create and connect with the present moment, releasing fear, and creating supportive boundaries that maximize your yourness.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda 10. Acknowledge What Is \"As spiritual beings having a human experience, each of us is gifted with an internal compass that guides us through life so we can effectively digest, assimilate, and eliminate (let go) of our emotions. It is the same process with our physical digestion. If we don't digest food, our digestive system feels unwell. When we don't digest and let go of our emotions, we feel sick and often all over-mentally and physically.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda It feels overwhelming and where do we start untied the knotted ball of yarn inside us? We start by acknowledging [what is.](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices) How do we do that? We may ask ourselves, What are the causes of stress and unease in your life? Perhaps make a list and really go for it. No need to edit or limit, get it all out. Now pause, take check in with the breath, re-establish [diaphgratmic breathin](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/learn-diaphragmatic-breathing-and-change-your-life)g, Look at the list again and add anything else that floats to the surface. Step away from the list, go for a walk, maybe even wait a day, and then revisit the list and continue to add to it. Acknowledging what is --is the best way to address, at the root cause, and allows us to clear the path to healing. This is a key tool in Ayurveda's approach to emotional detoxing as it cleanses the mind of ama. Ama is a Sanskrit word that may translate as toxins. \"I explain ama to Saumya clients as the gunk that makes us feel old, stuck, and not like our vibrant selves. Physically, when the doshas are imbalanced, ama circulates in the body and creates symptoms and left unaddressed, syndromes, conditions, and diseases. Mental and emotional ama pulls us down and under. and then also negatively impacts our physical health.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda Peform your yog-asana, follow our [ guided practices,](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/guided-practices) then perform nadi shodhana and now, you're prepared for meditation.

I'm also learning how I got out of balance in the first place. With obvious knowledge and ease of experience, my plan is thoughtfully laid out in supportive steps that actually takes less time and are far less stressful than if I was trying to it on my own.
