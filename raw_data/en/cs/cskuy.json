Here are few of the signs that your immune system could use a boost: - You get sick a lot and your colds tend to linger - You're always tired even after adequate rest - Eczema and other dry skin problems - Chronic digestion issues - You have a lot of allergies What causes a weakened immune system? There's no cut and dry answer for why one person's immune system is better than another person's. While genetics may be a component, research shows that the [immune system is shaped more by the environment](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-system-shaped-environment-more-genes) (i.e. lifestyle factors) than genes. \"Risk factors\" that lead to a compromised immune system include: Lack of sleep When it comes to warding off a virus, getting enough sleep is key. Studies show those who don't get an adequate night's sleep are more likely to become ill when exposed to a virus. Why? When we sleep, our T cells function better than when we're sleep deprived. T cells are some of the white blood cells that help us fight off infection. What can you do: Get enough sleep! Typically, [adults require 7-8 hours of sleep](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html) for a healthy immune system. High stress levels When we're stressed out, our bodies produce the stress hormone cortisol. While stress is a healthy response in certain situations and cortisol is even helpful in warding off inflammation when necessary, it's when we're chronically stressed that cortisol becomes an issue. Our body gets used to the high levels of cortisol from chronic stress which then leads to too much inflammation. Too much stress also decreases those T cells we talked about above, which means your body might struggle to fight off infection. What you can do: relax! Go for a walk, take a bath, practice 10 minutes of yoga in the morning. Try to incorporate one stress-relieving Sedentary lifestyle Exercise is great for all sorts of things -- keeping your heart healthy, boosting your mood, improving your quality of sleep -- and no surprise, it can also help to keep your immune system up. What you can do: start small! [Even just 20 minutes of movement in your day](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116305645) can help boost your immune system. Try adding a daily walk to your day. If you want more intensity, look for something you actually enjoy doing -- exercise doesn't have to be a chore! Standard American Diet Eating a diet high in inflammatory foods (like the animal fats and refined sugars found in a Standard American Diet) can hurt your [gut health](https://www.mamasezz.com/blogs/news/how-to-improve-gut-health-with-whole-food-plant-based-diet) and overall wellbeing, not to mention a poor diet is linked with health issues across the board, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, even cancer. What can you do? Eat more fruits and vegetables, to start! Keep reading to find out which plant-based foods can help boost your immune system naturally. 7 best plant-based foods for a healthy immune system (plus our favorite immune-boosting recipes) 1. Ginger Did you grow up sipping on a ginger ale whenever you were home sick? The intention was good, the execution just needs a little help. Skip the soda, which has a ton of inflammatory refined sugar, and go straight to the whole food source instead: ginger! Ginger is great for the immune system thanks to its high [antioxidant](https://www.mamasezz.com/blogs/news/antioxidants-and-inflammation) content. Favorite immune boosting recipes with ginger: 2. Beets [Beets have some amazing health benefits](https://www.mamasezz.com/blogs/news/health-benefits-of-beets) -- one of which is improving gut health.
