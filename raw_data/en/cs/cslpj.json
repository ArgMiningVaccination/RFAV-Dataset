The faith and spiritual traditions represented in our community include Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Native American spiritualities, Mormon, Atheist, Unitarian, and Sikhism, among others. Students develop different Recognized Student Organizations to support these traditions. Some of these groups gather regularly to share their faith traditions and learn from their fellow Chargers.

The facility includes a multipurpose room for services; quiet meditation and reflection areas for all faith traditions and men's and women's Muslim prayer spaces. Use of the Meditation and Spirituality Space The spaces available in the Meditation and Spirituality Center are meant to serve and support all students and the holistic wellness of the University community.

However, it is a helpful tool to enable you to begin to understand interfaith language at the University of New Haven. - [Interfaith](#) This term is best understood by defining each term separately, \"inter\" and \"faith.\" \"Inter\" refers to the relationships between people who orient around religion differently. \"Faith\" is defined as the relationship between an individual and what we commonly understand as a religious or philosophical tradition. Put together, \"interfaith\" is about how our interactions with diverse groups impact the way we relate to our religious and ethical traditions and how our relationships with our traditions impact our interactions with those who are different from us. - [Religious Pluralism](#) According to Diana Eck, pluralism is: - Pluralism is not diversity alone, but the energetic engagement with diversity. - Pluralism is not just tolerance, but the active seeking of understanding across lines of difference. - Pluralism is not a given, but an achievement. - Pluralism does not require us to leave our identities and our commitments behind, it is the encounter of commitments. - Pluralism is based on dialogue and encounter. - [Worldview](#) One's worldview is a guiding life philosophy, which may be based on a religious tradition, spiritual orientation, nonreligious perspective, or some combination of these. (Mayhew et al., 2016). It is the foundational outlook one has on life that helps in making sense of the world. - [Anti-Semitism](#) A certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of Anti-Semitism can be directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property or toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. - [Abrahamic Religion](#) Religions whose people draw their origins to the Hebrew patriarch Abraham. The best known Abrahamic religions are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - [Eastern Religion](#) Religious traditions that originated in the Eastern hemisphere (East, South, and Southeast Asia). Major Eastern Religions include Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Shintoism, Taoism, and Confucianism. It is important to note that members of these communities now live in countries across the globe. - [Islamophobia](#) Closed-minded prejudice against or hatred of Muslims. An Islamophobe is an individual who holds a closed-minded view of Islam and promotes prejudice against or hatred of Muslims. - [Religious Literacy](#) Religious literacy entails the ability to discern and analyze the fundamental intersections of religion and social/political/cultural life through multiple lenses. Specifically, a religiously literate person will possess 1) a basic understanding of the history, central texts (where applicable), beliefs, practices and contemporary manifestations of several of the world's religious traditions as they arose out of and continue to be shaped by particular social, historical, and cultural contexts; and 2) the ability to discern and explore the religious dimensions of political, social, and cultural expressions across time and place.
