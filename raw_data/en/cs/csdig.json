A better understanding of the relationship between cellular and humoral responses to egg and clinical sensitivity may lead to a more accurate understanding of the pathogenesis of egg allergy and the mechanisms underlying natur al resolution. Objective The aim of this project was to follow immune responses to the egg allergen ovalbumin (OVA) as children progress to resolution or persistence of their egg allergy. The longitudinal changes in allergen -specific T cell proliferation and intracellular cytokine expression (IL -4 and IFN) were measured as as specific serum immunoglobulins (IgE, IgG, IgG1 and IgG4) in individuals whose egg allergic status had been confirmed by open oral challenge. In addition, the project aimed to c haracterise the rate at which the childrens allergies resolved to well - cooked and uncooked egg. Method Egg-allergic subjects underwent repeated annual open oral egg challenges with well cooked egg (sponge cake) and if negative, uncooked (pasteurized) egg over time to confirm resolution or persistence of allergy. Non -allergic controls were recruited from hospital patients. S kin prick tests were performed and blood samples taken at each challenge occasion for immunological assays. cells (PBMC) were cultured in vitro for 8 days with OVA (200g/ml or 1mg/ml) or Tetanus toxoid (8.21Lfu/ml) culture medium containing 10% autologous plasma. Using multi - colour flow cytome try, the proportion of allergen -specific T cells (CD3+/CFSElo) expressing intracellular IL -4 was measured. and -specific IgG1 and IgG4 12 antibody subclasses were assayed by ELISA and egg white IgE antibodies were measured by Immun oCAP. Results T cell proliferation : PBMCs from egg -allergic individuals proliferated more rapidly in the presence of egg allergen (ovalbumin) compared to those from non -allergic controls. There was no significant difference when PBMCs were stimulated by n on-allergic antigen (tetanus toxoid). Unstimulated PBMCs from more Intracellular Cytokine secretion : Stimulation of separated PBMC cells with the allergens tested gave rise to no significant differences in the proportion of interleukin -4 (IL-4) producing allergen -specific T cells (%IL - 4+/CD3+/CFSElo cells) between EA and ER subjects. Higher proportions of IFN+ secreting cells were observed in response to stimulation with OVAhi in previously egg -allergic su bjects whose allergy had resolved (p=0.0092**). The percentage of IFN producing cells in response to stimulation with OVAhi was higher in ER subjects than in partially allergic (p=0.0149*) and partially resolved subjects (p=0.0062**). The ratio of IFN/I L-4 producing cells and log of the same ratio confirmed a T -helper 1 cell skew (Th1 skew) with IFN as the dominant cytokine in ER compared with EA subjects (p=0.0113* and p=0.0172* respectively) In EA subjects TET (p<0.0001***), OVAhi (p <0.0001***) and OVAlo (p<0.0001***) gave rise to a higher proportion of IL -4+ producing cells than incub ation with culture medium alone . In the longitudinal analysis, no significant changes in IL -4+ or IFN+ producing egg specific T cells were observed fo r EA or ER over time, by Wilcoxons matched paired test. 13 However, Fishers exact, two -tailed test showed that the persistently EA subjects (p=0.0133*) had higher levels of IL -4 than egg resolved subjects on their final egg challenge, whereas ER subjects (p =0.0214*) had higher levels of IFN+ than EA subjects on their final challenge. Humoral analysis Egg-specific immunoglobulin E levels decreased between first and last oral challenge in children who had resolved egg allergy compared with children who had persistent active egg allergy p=0.0003***. Immunoglobulin G4 levels in children with resolv ing egg allergy increase overtime (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test p=0.0119*; Mann -Whitney U -test: not significant ; p=0.057) Paired data show a trend towards a decrease in IgE/IgG4 ratio in active allergy, but this ratio significantly decreases in patients whose allergy resolves (p=0.0081**) Clinical analyses 181 hens egg challenges were performed during the course of the study in children whose median a ge of onset was 12 months . Pre-enrolment reactions occurred to baked egg in 5 (5%), lightly cooked egg in 58 (61%) and uncooked egg in 9 (9%) subjects . The worst symptoms in pre -study reactions were : cutaneous only in 57 (60%), gastrointestinal in 20 (21%), respiratory in 11 (1 2%) and 7 (7%) had anaphylaxis. Adrenaline was used during five reactions. There were 77 well cooked and 104 uncooked egg challenges conducted during the study . Of these 28/77 (37%) were positive challenges to well cooked egg of which , 65% had cutaneous symptoms, 68% gastrointestinal and 39% other respiratory reactions. the 61/104 (59%) positive uncooked egg 56% gastrointestinal and 15% respiratory. Adrenaline was not required. 14 Oral Tolerance was gained twice as rapidly to well -cooked than uncooked egg (median 5.6yr v 10.3yr; p<0.0001) and continued to 13yrs; hazard ratio 2.23 (95%CI 1.6 -3.9). Over 1/4 had resolved allergy to well -cooked egg at 3 years and 2/3 at 6 years. Of 28/77 (37%) positive well -cooked egg 68% gastrointestinal and 39% rhinitis, with no other respiratory reactions. Adrenaline was not required. Conclusion s It is already known that production of the cytokine IFN antagonizes the production of IgE antibody and provides a balance to IL -4, a potential promoter of IgE responses. We have provided evidence which indicates that the resolution of egg allergy is associated with a change in the cytokine producing phenotype of OVA -specific T cells from T -helper 2 (Th2) to T-helper 1 (Th1), which is accompanied by an increase in the production of OVA -specific IgG4 and reduction in the production of egg -specific IgE. The study has also shown that r esolution of egg allergy takes place over ma ny years, with children outgrowing allergy to well -cooked egg approximately twice as quickly as they outgrow allergy to uncooked egg. There were no severe reactions to well-cooked egg challenge during the study period , and adrenaline was not required. Our data support initiation of home reintroduction of well -cooked egg from 2 -3yr of age in children with previous mild reactions and no asthma. Resolution continues to occur in older children, so that despite an earlier positive challenge, attempts at reintrod uction should be continued. 15 1 INTRODUCTION Over recent years the prevalence of food allergy in early childhood has steadily increased and it now affects 7 -8% of children [1,2]. One of the most common childhood food allergies is to hens egg (referred to a s egg hereafter) [3, 4] with a childhood population prevalence estimated at 1 -2% [5, 6] . Current treatment of egg allergy involves complete dietary avoidance of egg -containi ng foods [10, 11] which can be difficult to achieve as egg products are often pr esent in baked goods or processed foods [12]. Egg allergy is considered to resolve relatively quickly during early childhood [5] in comparison to other food allergies such as to peanuts or nuts [6]. One longitudinal study estimated that 50% of children lo se reactivity to uncooked egg by 35 months [7]. However, there is a wide variation in the speed of resolution between individuals. Allergy to cooked egg resolves earlier than allergy to uncooked egg in individuals [8, 9]. Families find it useful to defin e when well cooked egg allergy resolves as this can result in considerable relaxation of avoidance measures. The recently published British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunologys guidelines on the management of egg [74] allergy made recommendations a bout reintroduction of egg: children who have had only mild symptoms (only cutaneous symptoms) on significant exposure (e.g. a mouthful of scrambled eggs) with no ongoing asthma may have well -cooked egg (e.g. sponge cake) introduced from the age of about 2 -3 years at home. If this is tolerated then reintroduction of lightly cooked egg (e.g. scrambled) may be attempted from about 3 -4 years [10]. These recommendations were based on limited data, clinical experience and expert opinion. Data are lacking to guid e clinicians when to advise reintroduction of well cooked egg. The outcome variable in most 16 studies has been the resolution of allergy to uncooked egg where factors predictive of resolution (such as egg white IgE, age at diagnosis, skin prick test wheal si ze, including end - point titration and severity of reactions) have been identified [7, 11, 12, 13]. This study was designed to follow egg allergic children prospectively and perform serial challenges to both well-cooked and uncooked egg to define the stag es of resolution and aid clinical decision making as well as to inform advice to those affected by egg allergy . This longitudinal prospective study was also designed to examine changes in cellular and humoral responses to food allergens and clinical patt erns of resolution in young children with egg allergy . This might reveal important mechanistic clues which would shed light on this poorly understood disease. Patients with any type of allergy generally have a period of pre - sensitisation (where they make IgE against the allergen), before the development of clinical allergy. This is followed by the emergence of clinical allergy. Finally as the clinical allergy resolves the patients become less clinically reactive but they still make IgE in response to the allergen. Understanding the mechanism by which clinical allergy develops and then subsides, in the presence of continuing IgE production is clearly important and involves investigation of other cellular and humoral facets of the immune system. Early life events appear to shape the maturation and development of the acquired immune response [13]. Egg allergy usually develops in children with a history of atopic eczema or other food allergy (e.g. to cows milk), but is also important as a marker of progressio n of the allergic march with affected chi ldren being at greater risk of peanut allergy and/or sensitization to aeroallergens and asthma later in life [ 14]. Dysfunctional immunity in early development in allergic children appears to result in inappropriat e T cell responses to allergens. Functionally distinct T cell subsets (CD4+) can be 17 characterized by differentiated expression of cytokines [15]. Type 1 (Th1) T cells secrete predominantly interleukin (IL) -2 and interferon gamma (IFN) while type 2 (Th2) T cells secrete predominantly IL -4, IL -5, IL -6 and IL -10. Additionally, Th0 cells thought to be progenitors of Th1 and Th2 cells have been described to produce I L-2, IFN, IL -4 and IL -5 simultaneously. Th2 cells play an essential role in the promotion of allergen -specific IgE synthesis by B cells [16, 17, 18]. The cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes can influence the type of immune response to food aller gens that results . Type 2 Th cell responses are thought to predominate in subjects with food allergy while Th1 cells can induce tolerance [19]. Increased IFN (secreted by Th1 cells) in the circulation during and after oral egg immunotherapy in egg allergi c subjects is thought to induce clinical tolerance to egg protein . However, the effect of egg immunotherapy on allergen specific T cell cytokine production is currently unknown. Oral tolerance implies a specific suppression of cellular and/or humoral immu ne reactivity to a food antigen taken through the oral route. Failure of oral tolerance is attributed to the development and pathogenesis of several immunologically based diseases including food hypersensitivity. Although in most cases IgE-mediated egg all ergy resolv es spontaneously with age the contributing factors and underlying immune mechanisms are largely unknown. Studies with animal models have been used to help understand and identify some potential mechanisms . The mechanisms being proposed include t he induction of T regulatory (Treg) cells including the CD4+/CD25hi subset [39, 40] associated antigen dose [41], and either clonal anergy (unresponsiveness) or deletion, of memory and effector T cells associated with high dose tolerance [42, 43] . Immediate type -1 food hypersensitivity is mediated by allergen -specific Ig E antibody directed against allergenic proteins . These antibodies bind to high -affinity IgE antibody receptors on 18 circulating basophils and tissue mast cells present throughout t he body, including the skin, gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract . Subsequent allergen exposure binds and cross links IgE antibodies on the mast cell surface, resulting in receptor activation and intracellular signalling that initiates the release of inflammatory mediators (e. g. histamine, serine proteases, proteoglycans) and synthesis of additional factors (e.g. cytokines and chemokines) that promote allergic inflammation. The effect of these mediators on surrounding tissue is what gives rise to th e range of local (e.g. itching, swelling, nausea) and systemic symptoms (e.g. airway obstruction, hives, low blood pressure) observed during al lergic reactions to food [20,21]. Egg white protein contains 23 different glycoproteins . Many of these egg prot eins have been well characterized and ovomucoid (Gal d1), (Gal d2), ovotransferrin (Gal d3) and lysozyme (Gal d4) have been identified as the main egg allergens [22, 23, 24] . Of these ovomucoid has been shown to be the dominant allergen [25] desp ite comprising less than 10% of total egg protein compared to 50% for ovalbumin. However, in our patient cohort, during set up experiments Ovalbumin was found to be recognised much more frequently by immune cells than ovomucoid, and for this reason we stud ied ovalbumin responses. Egg allergic individuals generate specific IgE antibodies against egg proteins with both conformational (e.g. ovalbumin) and/ or sequen tial epitopes (e.g. findings protein alle rgenicity by destroying conformational epitopes [26]. This is supported by the suggestion that some children with egg allergy can tolerate cooked egg, but are still sensitive to uncooked egg [27, 28]. Similarly, studies on children who had outgrown cows m ilk allergy had milk specific IgE antibodies primarily directed at conformational epitopes (tertiary structure), whereas children with persistent milk allergy had a significant proportion of their IgE antibodies directed at sequential (linear) epitopes [29, 30, 31, 32]. 19 Recently , Wang et al, [33] used peptide micro array studies to evaluate the correlation of IgE/IgG4 milk epitopes and affinity of milk -specific IgE antibodies with different phenotypes of clinical milk allergy. The group showed that subject s with severe milk allergy had greater IgE epitope diversity and higher affinity compared with those who outgrew their allergy. In sublingual grass pollen immunotherapy low dose allergen exposure is thought to be responsible for IgE mediated symptoms. Wher eas, repeated high dose allergen exposure seems to redirect the allergic response to one dominated by T cells that favo ur the production of IgG and IgA antibodies [34, 35, 36]. Increases in production of non -IgE (IgG) competitive antibodies during resolut ion of allergy may suppress the allergic response by competitively counter -acting the pathological effects of IgE antibody [37]. This study was designed to follow egg allergic children prospectively for several years and perform serial well cooked and un cooked egg challenges annually to define the stages of acquisition of tolerance, as well as identifying risk factors for persistence or early resolution of egg allergy. 20 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 STUDY POPULATION 2. 1.1 Egg -allergic participants This was a longitudinal study performed at the Clinical Research Fac ility at the Cambridge Biomedical Research Campus between 2004 and 2010. Permission was granted by the Local Research Ethics Committee. Children were recruited to the study from the Addenbrooke s Hospital Allergy clinic and by advertisement in a national patient support group newsletter (the Anaphylaxis Campaign). Children (2-15 years old) with a history of a typical type -1 hypersensitivity reaction to egg and/or skin prick test (SPT) weal diam eter >/=3mm to egg extract (ALK -Abello, specific IgE 0.35kU/l (ImmunoCap FEIA, Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) at the time of diagnosis were invited to participate. Subjects who had never eaten egg were enrolled if they had a positive oral challenge to egg and a positive SPT and/or positive serum specific egg IgE. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had a history of major immunodeficiency or were on medication that could affect their immune system . Children with a history of severe allergy were not excluded. Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with ethics guidelines for research in children. A detailed allergic history and physical examination was performed on the day of consent and oral challenge. Blood samples were collected on the same day as SPT performed; 12-15ml was collected by venipuncture into heparinised tubes for transport at room temperature. 21 2.1.2 Clinical History Data on sex, age of first reaction, symptoms, other food allergies, as thma, eczema and hay fever were recorded for each subject. 2.2 Oral Food Challenge (OFC) Protocol Supervised one day open oral food challenges were performed in the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility to determine the subjects clinical reactivity t o egg. Subjects were asked to stop taking anti -histamines 72h before the challenge. Briefly, the oral egg challenges were conducted by administering in a titrated manner up to a maximum of 12g (equivalent to \u00bc of whole egg) of well cooked egg (baked at 1800C for 20 min) in the form of well cooked cake or 21.5g of uncooked egg (equivalent of \u00bd whole egg) of pasteurised whole egg pellet (Noble Foods Ltd, UK) in ~50ml of flavo ured milk as liquid vehicle. Following an initial lip rub, the first dose was either ~0.4g of well cooked egg or 0.5g of uncooked egg and the dose was increased sequentially at 10 min intervals (0.8g, 1.5g 3g, 6g of cooked 6g, 12g of uncooked egg) . Subjects were monitored throughout , and for 2 hours after the compl etion of the oral challenge . The challenge was stopped when all doses were tolerated or an objective reaction occurred i.e. development of two or more symptoms distant to mouth e.g. skin reddening, hives, swelling, runny nose, wheezing, abdominal pain or vomiting).Treatment was initiated immediately, mild reactions were treated with oral antihistamines, mild airway symptoms were treated with nebulised salbutamol and adrenaline was available in case of severe reactions. The type of egg challenge (whether co oked or uncooked) was dependent upon whether each subject had previously tolerated well cooked egg. If this was the case, then an uncooked egg challenge (with whole pasteurized uncooked egg) was undertaken. All other subjects underwent a well cooked egg ch allenge initially, and if they passed went on to an uncooked egg challenge on another day . Subjects were then classified according to table 1 and figure 2. 22 Table 1: Classification of O utcome of egg c hallenge Clinical Status at time point Outcome of ch allenge to well cooked or uncooked egg Well cooked egg Uncooked egg Fully allergic Positive Positive /ND* Partially allergic Negative Positive Partially resolved ** Negative **Challenge pending Resolved Negative Negative *ND= not done, usually unnece ssary because of positive challenge to well cooked egg at that time point. **Challenge pending= in these subjects there was a time gap between the negative well cooked egg challenge and the uncooked egg challenge being undertaken. T herefore they may have been allergic or tolerant to uncooked egg at the time of their well cooked egg challenge, but it was unknown. They are therefore considered separately , as partially resolved . The subjects were re -challenged annually until they either reach ed complete res olution or were persistently allergic to egg at the end of the 6 year study (Figure 1 and 2) [44]. Longitudinal follow up Participants were followed up longitudinally and underwent annual egg challenges, skin prick tests and serum egg specific IgE measu rements. Subjects who reacted to the well cooked or uncooked challenges had repeat challenges every 12 months to the same form of egg. Either 23 full or partial resolution was recorded if subjects had no reaction to uncooked or well cooked egg challenge respe ctively (Figure 2) . Cooked egg -tolerant subjects were instructed to introduce cooked egg products into their diet until they returned for re -challenge with uncooked egg. Subjects who were tolerant to uncooked egg were advised to introduce any form of egg into their diet . Figure 1: Overview of longitudinal study. Children were invited back for oral challenge and to take blood for completion of assays on an annual basis.

Histamine and saline served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The largest and perpendicular diameter was measured. A 3mm or larger weal was regarded as positive. All SPTs were performed and interpreted by one of two trained operators. Flow diagram: Study design and characterisation of clinical egg reactivityClinical History Tolerate Cooked Egg?

Clinical group was based on the egg challenge outcomes. 2.2.3 In vitro IgE tests Serum samples were collected at the time of each challenge visit. Total Ig E and e gg-white specific IgE levels were simultaneously measured by ImmunoCAP system (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). Egg white IgE levels of 0.35kU/l were considered positive. The lower limit of the latter assay is 0.35 kU/l, and the upper limit for reporting results was 100kU/l; for calculation purposes, values of 0.34 and 100.1 kU/l were used if concentration results were beyond t hese limits. Negative Positive Positive 25 2.2.4 Blood Sample Blood samples were also obtained for serum and plasma which were stored at -20oC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Serum was isolated from a small volume of non -heparinis ed blood, allowed to clot in glass vials, then transferred to a centrifuge tube and spun for 10 min at 4000 rpm (3130 x g) at room temperature with the brake on. The upper serum layer was aliquoted into 2ml tubes and stored at -20oC. (Please see section 2 .5 for an explanation of PBMC and plasma isolation and sections 2.5.1 to 2.5.3 for an explanation of cryopreservation and thawing). 2.3 Immunologic Laboratory data on the study of IgG subclass antibodies in patients allergic to wasp or bee venom [75] which was based on an earlier publication by Rieben and Blaser [76] on the quantification of IgG and IgG4 antibodies to bee venom phospholipase A2 by competitive inhibition in ELISA. More recently,,Mr J. Deighton published cross -sectional data on the patterns of immunoglobulin G responses to egg and peanut allergens (45). Longitudinal assays of total IgG, OVA -specific IgG1 and OVA -specific IgG4 (\u00b5g/m l) were measured in individual serum samples by in -house ELISA (see section 2.3.2). All ELISAs were developed and performed by Mr J. Deighton. Appropriate controls were included for all assays performed. 26 2.3.2 Quantification of specific antibody titr es in reference anti -sera Sera from 23 egg -allergic subjects with high specific IgE titre against egg (egg -specific IgE>5.0kU/l) was used to create a reference pool. Total IgG and egg -specific subclasses IgG1 and IgG4 titres in the reference pool were qua ntified by a modified competitive ELISA method, as follows [45]. Multibind microtitre plates (Greiner Bio -one, Gloucester, UK) were coated for 2hr at room temperature (RT) with Ovalbumin (OVA) (5\u00b5g/ml) in 100\u00b5l carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Plates were washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) - containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) blocked with 5% (v/v) -inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma) in PBST for 1h at RT. One dilution of reference anti -sera was added to all wells and incub ated overnight at 4oC. Serial two or HP6011/RJ4, respectively) antibodies were added in triplicate overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed three times in PBST, and the bound monoclonal antibodies were detected by alkaline - -mouse IgG for 3hr at RT. After two PBST washes and a final wash in distilled water, 100\u00b5l of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1mg/ ml (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8) was added. Optical densities at 405nm were read using BioRad Model 550 (BioRad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). An optimal concentration of the monoclonal antibody was selected based on the titration curve, and the assay w as repeated in the presence of pre -titrated amounts on inhibiting purified human IgG (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), IgG1 (Sigma) or IgG4 (Sigma). The OVA -specific IgG titres in the reference sera pool was calculated from the derived inhibition curve. Five independent measurements were made. The antibody titres (mean \u00b1 standard deviation in \u00b5g/ml) of 4.0 (IgG4). Inter (IgG1) in patient sera Serial dilutions of reference anti -sera and at least three dilutions of patien t sera (1:20 to 1:1600) were incubated with OVA -coated plates in duplicate overnight at 4oC. Each subclass of bound anti -sera was (NL16) or previously selected concentrations, overnight at 4oC. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected with alkaline anti -mouse IgG (1:1000; Sigma) for 3hr at RT, followed by p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate addition and reading of optical densities at 405nm. Washes an d incubation conditions were performed as for quantification of reference anti -sera pools. Specific antibody titres in \u00b5g/ml were extrapolated from the standard curve of reference anti -sera. All samples from an individual subject were run on the same plate on the same day. All dilutions were performed in duplicate. 2.4 Preparation of allergen extracts and endotoxin decontamination Lyophilised ovalbumin (OVA) and ovomucoid (OM) of grade V purity (Sigma, Dorset, UK) was reconstituted in PBS at 10mg/ml and st ored at -80oC. Protein concentrations of OVA and OM were measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Pierce Biotechnology). Bacterial endotoxins are able to stimulate the immune system and frequently contaminate commercially available reagents and may m ask the true effect of the protein antigen/allergen. Endotoxin was depleted from OVA and OM using EndoTrap Red affinity columns (Profos International, Regtensburg, Germany) following the manufacturers instructions. Tetanus Toxoid (TET) (821 Lfu/ml ; 2105Lf/m g) was purchased from the Statens Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). All protein preparations, cell culture media and a human plasma pool were tested independently for endotoxin (Limulus amebocyte assay; Cambrex BioScience, endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide. Endotoxin levels were 0.263 EU/mg OVA, 0.364 EU/mg OM and not detected in TET, cell culture media or plasma. Therefore endotoxin levels were always <0.364 EU/ml (<3.6pg/ml 28 per culture), i.e. at concentrations below those known to stimulate PBMC (<1EU). Polymyxin B is an antibiotic which binds and inactivates endotoxins and their ability to activate T cells. If addition of Polymyxin B reduces T cell proliferation it is an indicator that en dotoxin contamination is high enough to affect the assay. We found OVA -stimulated T cell responses were not inhibited by polymyxin B (2ug/ml ) in randomly tested culture assays indicating that endotoxin levels are too low to affect the T cell response [44]. 2.4.1 Optimization of allergen dose for stimulation of PBMC samples Optimization of allergen doses for stimulation of allergen/or antigen specific T cells in PBMC samples was originally assessed by Tay et al [44] using small scale fresh peripheral bloo d mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures (1x105/well) in RPMI -1640 human AB serum (96U plates, Falcon; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After 6 days, 3H-thymidine (1.0Ci/well, Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) was add ed for 16hr. Radioactivity retained (cpm/well) was quantified by scintillation counting. Optimal concentrations for PBMC culture were selected based on T cell proliferation index (PI) and number of responders . PI is the ratio of T cell proliferation in res ponse to allergen divided by T cell proliferation in control medium lacking allergen. TET was used as a positive control at 8.21Lfu/ml based on PI of 16.6\u00b13.5 at 12Lfu/ml, 11.9\u00b10.6 at 6Lfu/ml and 11.7\u00b10.6 at 3Lfu/ml TET and 3/3 responders at all three dose s. OVA - and OM -stimulated PI and number of OVA and OM were required to reveal all positive responders [44]. For the longitudinal study OVA, OM and TET concentrations were re -tested on cryopreserved PBMC. This ensured that all PBMC samples from a single individual were simultaneously assayed under the same tissue culture and monoclonal antibody labelling conditions and the 29 only variable was the length of time each PBMC sample had been cryopreserved. Pilot experiments were performed to compare T cell responses between fresh and frozen PBMCs from the same donor and no differ ences in proliferation or cytokine production were detected. PBMC from egg allergy subjects were isolated and cryopreserved between 2005 and 2009. T cell assays were performed on the cryopreserved PBMC samples between 2008 and 2010. Potentially PBMC sample s may have been cryopreserved for up to 5 years in liquid nitrogen. Thawed CFSE labelled PBMC (1 x106/ml) were cultured in 24 -well plates (Falcon, UK) for 8 days with varying doses of OVA (0.1 to 1mg/ml) in complete medium (RPMI -1640 medium streptomycin (Sigma, UK) and 10% autologous plasma (data not shown). Cells permitting, two doses of OVA were used, OVAhi (1mg/ml) and OVAlo (200ug/ml), OM (1mg/ml) and TET stock). 2.5 Peripheral blood mononuclear cell separation PBMC were purified from heparinised whole blood after spinning for plasma at 1819 rpm (640 x g) for 15 min at room temperature with the brake on . Blood was diluted with equal volume of Hanks Balanced Salt Solu tion (HBSS) (Sigma, UK) into 50ml conical tubes (BD Falcon, UK). The blood solution was gently mixed before overlaying onto 15ml of Lymphoprep (Axis - Shield, Oslo, Norway). The tubes were centrifuged at 2022 rpm (800 x g) for 22 min at room temperature with no brake on. The buffy coat PBMC layer at the interface was aspirated and transferred into a fresh 50ml conical tube. The PBMC were washed t wice with HBSS, pooled, and counted using 0.4% Trypan Blue solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Using established techniques [13, 46] which have been shown not to alter cell function, isolated PBMC were cryopreserved in 7.5% dimethyl sulph oxide (DMSO) K) supplemented with 43.5% human male AB serum (Sigma, UK) and stored in liquid nitrogen. 30 2.5.1 Media used for cryopreservation To generate the media containing 43.5% human AB serum, human AB serum (Sigma, UK ) was inactivated at 56oC water bath for 30 min. DMSO was added to a final concentration of 7.5% (v/v). 2.5.2 Cryopreservation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lymphoprep isolated PBMC were resuspended at concentrations of 12 -15 million PBMC per ml of 4oC cooled freezing mix media. Once aliquoted, cryovials were placed on ice and then transferred into a freezing container (Nalgene, Rochester, NY), and store d at -80oC for 24h , cryovials were then transferred into liquid nitrogen for long term storage. 2.5.3 Thawing of cryopreserved cells Nine m l of cell culture media (serum free RPMI -1640 supplemented with HEPES 37oC, was aliquoted into 30ml centrifuge tube (Sterilin, UK). No more than 2 cryovials were thawed at the same time. The cryovi als w ere thawed rapidly in a 37oC water bath until the cell suspension was almost completely melted. One ml of cell culture media was slowly added to the thawed cells and then transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube and the remaining eight ml of media was slowly added drop wise. This is a standard method used in tissue culture i.e. to avoid diluting cells when cold. Cells need to be diluted at room temperature or above with serum containing medium however, long periods at or above room temperature should also be avoided to minimise DMSO toxicity, hence rapid thawing and gentle dilution was used. The tubes were centrifuged at 1819 rpm ( 640 x g ) for 10 min at RT and then the cells were resuspended in 3ml of media. Cell v iability was assessed using 0.4%Trypan blue dye (Sigma, UK ), the viability was over 80% at the time of seeding i.e. when adding cell to TC culture, if the viability was less than 70% the cells were not used. 31 2.6 Preparation and stimulation of PBMCs PBMCs were thawed, washed and viable cells coun ted using 0.4% Trypan Blue exclusion endotoxin free allergens and 10% autologous plasma for 8 days at 37oC in a the proliferating PBMC with the fluorescent proliferation dye, according to Turcanu et al (2003) [47] with some modifications. Titration of CFSE to determine the optimal concentration for using 0.5\u00b5M, 1\u00b5M PBMC with or without tetanus toxoid (8.21Lfu/ml) for 7 days, collected and stained with anti -CD4-PE. The cell division index (CDI) was used to compare effectiveness of staining [48].Maximum CD4+T cell proliferation among PBMC samples was seen with 2.5\u00b5M CFSE. T he cell division index was calculated, based on a fixed number (usually 30000 events) of CD3+/CFSEhi T cells with the following formula: Number of CD3+/CFSElo T cells with antigen (allergen) A CDI ratio of >2 was considered to represent a doubling or mo re above background proliferation (in the absence of allergen) and therefore a positive proliferative response.. For staining with CFSE, briefly, thawed PBMC (1 x 107/ml) were washed, labelled with 2.5\u00b5M CFSE in the dark for 15min with gentle shaking in a 37oC water bath. Labelling was stopped with 1ml autologous plasma and excess dye was washed away. CFSE labelled cells were recounted using a haemacytometer with 0.4% Trypan blue and added to 24 -well flat bottomed plate (BD falcon, UK) at a density of 1x1 06/ml/well with or without endotoxin free 32 allergens (OVA and/or 1mg/ml) and 100\u00b5g/mL streptomycin). C ells were cultured for 8 days at 37oC in 5%CO 2 humidified atmosphere to expand the allergen specific T cells . 2.7 Flow Cytometry detection of intracellular c ytokines After 8 days of culture in the presence of allergens, PBMC were re-stimulated to induce intracellular cytokine the presence BD Pharmingen, UK) which contains mone nsin blocking protein transport through th e Golgi apparatus. The cells were fixed and permeabilised in 200\u00b5l Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Pharmingen) for 20 min at 4OC. Cells were washed twice and stained with fluorescent Pharmingen). of each fluorescent monoclonal antibody in the cock tail mix was separately titrated to maximize effective surface and intracellular staining. After two washes in Perm/Wash buffer the samples were run for 4 - colour detection in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, UK) on the same day or within 24 h r. An autofluorescent control (unstained PBMC) and compensation controls (single antibody stained PBMC) were included in all experiments to set the optimal instrument settings for voltage gain and compensation respectively. A threshold of 110 on FSC (forwar d scatter) was set to exclude cell debris and FSC PMT Amp gain on 1.04 to visualize all lymphocytes and proliferating lymphoblasts on the FSC vs. SSC (side scatter) dot plot. At least 100,000 events were acquired for each sample and stored as list mode dat a using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences), and data analysed using W inMDI 2.9 software. 33 Cytokine production was determined for all the subjects in whom we could collect sufficient cells. 2.7.1 Flow cytometric data analysis The proliferation dye, CFSE , was used to differentiate between the non -proliferating parental resting T cells (CD3+/CFSEhi) and the proliferating allergen -specific activated daughter T cells (CD3+/CFSElo). The gating strategy we used to as sess the intracellular cytokine expression by the allergen specific T cells involves 1) gating on viable PBMC (R1) on forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (S SC) plot (Figure 3); 2) then identify two T cell s ubsets on the CFSE vs. CD3 plot, the proliferating CD3+/CFSElo cells (R3), represents the all ergen specific T cells, and the non -proliferating CD3+/ CFSEhi parental cells (R2); 3) each T cell subset are then analysed on a IL -4 vs. IFN plot to show the percentage of single positives for Th1 IFN+ and Th2 IL -4+ cytokines using quadrant markers. T c ell responses were considered to be positive if >400 CD3+/CFSElo cells (R3) were collected. Detection strategy cells intracellular cytokine analysis . Allergen/ antigen stimulated PBMC were gated ba sed on their size and granularity on the Forward -Side scatter plot (R1: red dots). These cells were separated based on their expression of the T cell receptor (CD3) and the fluorescent dye, CFSE. Two T cell subsets are identified, the parental non -prolife rating CD3+/CFSEhi T cell subset (R2: green dots ) and the proliferating daughter CD3+/CFSElo T cell subset (R3: blue dots). The allergen -specific T cells (R3) are further separated based on their expression of the T helper cytokines IL -4 and 34 IFN using qu adrant markers to identify the single positive and double positive cells. The upper left (UL) quadrant shows IFN single positive cells and the lower right (LR) quadrant shows IL -4 single positive cells only. The upper right (UR) quadrant shows the double positive cells producing both IFN and IL -4 cytokine. The CFSEnet was calculated by subtracting the percentage of CFSElo cells in the CD3+ subset (%CD3+/CFSElo) found in unstimulated cultures from %CD3+/CFSElo found in allergen stimulated cultures, e.g. in OVA -stimulated CFSEnet OVA= [(%CD3+/CFSElo )OVA - (%CD3+/CFSElo) UNSTIMULATED ]. CFSEnet is an absolute % value of the final (total) net % proliferation of allergen specific T cells after subtracting the % of background non -specific proliferati on (negative control) . Cell division index (CDI) is a ratio of proliferation in response to antigen (allergen) divided by proliferation of the unstimulated medium control ( PBMC, RPMI and 10% OVA -stimulated cultures/ %CD3+/CFSElo of unstimulated cultures after normalizing for the same number of cells in the non-proliferating parental CD3+/CFSEhi population (R2) gate for each condition. A CDI > 2 is considered a significant positive response to allergen (s ee section 2.6.1) . CD3+ T cells were analysed as CD4 expression was down -regulated by PMA described previously [49]. To define T cell subsets in cultures on day 8, some cultures were not re - stimulated with PMA and stained with CD4 CD3+/CFSElo and CD3+/CFSEhi revealed that CD8+ cells do not make a significant contribution (4.1\u00b10.5%) to the CD3+/CFSElo subset; and a significant number binding specificities of IL -4-PE and IFN -APC antibodies were tested by pre -incubating antibodies with excess IL -4 or IFN (1\u00b5g each, R&D Systems, UK) [50]. Cytokines completely inhibited antibody binding to TET specific T cells expressing both cytokin es (data not shown) . 2.8 Measurement of Interleukin -10 For cytokine production 1 x 106 PBMC/ml were cultured with or without endotoxin free allergens in 24 well culture plates and were maintained as indicated above (see section 2.6.1 ). Culture supernatan ts were collected on day 8 and kept frozen at -20oC until quantitative cytokine determination. Interleukin -10 levels in culture supernatants were analysed in duplicate by an in -house ELISA in a subgroup (fully EA; partially EA and fully ER) of subjects . Briefly, wells of a 96 -well microtitre plate were coated 2h r at RT with 2ug/ml IL -10 anti -human cytokine monoclonal antibody (R&D systems, Europe) in 100\u00b5l carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, washed three times with phosphate -buffered saline (PBS )-containi ng 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked for 1 h r at RT with PBST containing 5% heat -inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Each well was washed three times with PBST. Culture supernatants were used undiluted in duplicate and incubated overnight at 4oC. After wash ing each well three times with PBST; biotinylated anti -human IL -10 antibody at 1 in 400 dilution (1.25ug/ml) (Sigma) was added for 2h r 37oC. After another incubation for 2 h r at RT with ExtraAvidin -Alkaline Phosphatase (1/400 dil; Sigma), substrate solution (p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1mg/ml (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8) was added and optical density was measured at 405nm in a microtitre plate reader (B iorad). Results were related to a standard curve obtained with recombinant human IL -10 standard (B D Pharmingen, Europe) at different concentrations . The ovalbumin -stimulated d8 PBMC cultures were -10-PE (Clone JES3 -9D7; BD place of IL -4-PE to detect intracellular IL -10 in the OVA -specific T cells subset (CD3+/CFSElo). Detection of intracellular IL -10 at present has been unsuccessful using IL -10-PE (Clone JES3 -9D7) 36 2.9 Excel d atabase s Two databases in Excel were produced recording 1) clinical measurements (e.g. Age, Sex, symptoms, SPT resu lts, IgE results, onset of allergy and duration); 2) In vitro longitudinal assay results for each subject, each challenge and each allergen (e.g. T cell proliferation (% CD3+/CFSElo; CFSEnet, CDI); cytokine expression (%IL o supernatant IL -10 levels (pg/ml) 2.10 Statistical analyses Most data were not no rmally distributed; therefore, differences in memory T cell proliferation and intracellular cytoki ne production between unpaired groups were compared by the Mann - Whitney U test. Two-tailed unpaired Students t test was used to analyze the mean differences between groups. One-way ANOVA was initially performed to determine whether an overall statistically significant change existed in the parameter being assessed between data sets before using the two -tailed paired or unpaired Students t test. Differences within individuals over time in each egg group were compared with Wilcoxon matched pairs test. A probability level of less than 5% (p< 0.05) was considered statistically significant . Fishers exact test (two tailed) was used to assess the significance of c ytokine data in terms of predominance of one cytokine (IFN or IL -4) over the other in samples from persistently egg allergic subjects compared with fully resolved subjects on their last challenge visit. All tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 5, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, UK) . Grap hs were generated in GraphPad Prism and Excel. 37 3.0 RESULTS: 3.1 Clinical data There were 181 hens egg challenges (77 to well cooked egg in 58 children, and 104 to uncooked egg in 74 children) over a six year period. Ninety five children were studied o verall as several had more than one challenge during this time. 3.1.1 Clinical characteristics of participants The age of onset of egg allergy (defined as first clinical reaction to egg) was median 12m (25th -75thcentiles 8 -13m) . There was no significant difference in the age of onset of allergy between subjects undergoing well cooked or uncooked egg challenge. Median age at enrolment was 55m (25th -75thcentiles 32 -87m). Male: female ratio was 1.56. The type of egg causing the original historical reactio n was well cooked (typically cake or biscuit) in 5 (5%), lightly cooked (typically scrambled eggs) in 58 (61%) and uncooked (e.g. mayonnaise) in 9 (9%). Five subjects (5%) reacted to only skin contact to raw egg and 15 (16%) had never knowingly eaten or re acted to egg, but the diagnosis had been suggested by allergy testing. The symptoms reported during each subjects worst pre-study reaction were cutaneous only in 57 (60%), gastrointestinal in 20 (21%), respiratory in 11 (12%) and 7 (7%) had anaphylaxis. Of subjects who had anaphylaxis before being enrolled in the study , 5 reacted to lightly cooked egg, one to ingestion of uncooked egg and one was unknown. Adrenaline had been used to treat reactions in five subjects, antihistamines alone were used in 16 su bjects, and there was no information about treatment for 56 subjects. 38 Challenges were performed at median age of 55m (16 -288m) for well-cooked egg and median 66m (17 -184m) for uncooked egg (p=0.009 for difference between medians; Mann -Whitney U - test). Overall, 28/77 (37%) of well cooked egg and 61/104 (59%) of uncooked egg challenges were positive. 3.1.2 Symptoms elicited during positive challenges The symptoms experienced during challenges are shown in table 2a and b. For well cooked egg challenges, 3/2 8 (11%) reacted to the first oral dose (~0.4g, all oral itching). In 23/61 (38%) of uncooked egg challenges the subject reacted to the first oral dose (oral itching in 10, nausea in 1 and cutaneous rash in 12). 39 Table 2 a Symptoms experienced during positive egg challenges (numbers of subjects are shown with percentages in parentheses) .

Tolerance was gained more rapidly to well -cooked rather than to uncooked egg (logrank test p<0.0001). The median age at which tolerance occurred was 67m for well -cooked and 127m for uncooked egg The hazard ratio was 2.23 (95%CI 1.6 -3.9), indicating the rate of resolution of allergy to well -cooked egg was approximat ely twice that of uncooked egg. The curves show a rapid early acquisition of tolerance to both well -cooked and uncooked egg in the majority followed by a slower rate of resolution in the remaining minority. There was an early separation in the curves. In t he older and slower resolvers there was a bigger difference in the slope of the curves such that the rate of resolution to uncooked egg was even slower. Nonetheless, resolution still continued to occur to cooked egg up to the age of 158m (13.2yr) and for u ncooked egg up to 182m (15.2y). 41 Figure 4 Cumulative persistence (survival) of allergy to well cooked and uncooked egg. 012 24 36 48 60 72 84 96108 120 132 144 156 168 180 1920.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 Well cooked eggUncooked egg Age (months)Proportion with allergy to egg 3.2 Experimental data 3.2.1 Characteristics Over the total time period of the study, w e inves tigated the relationship between the frequency of cellular (allergen specific T cell proliferation and intracellular cytokine IgG4) and the phenotype of egg allergy in a group of 109 subjects char acterized with respect to their clinical reactivity to cooked (baked sponge cake) or uncooked (pasteurized raw) egg. Subjects were defined as fully allergic (reactive to well cooked egg; Sponge POS), partially resolved ( well cooked egg tolerant), partially allergic (reactive to uncooked egg; Liquid POS) and fully resolved (egg tolerant) (Figure 6 ) 42 Fully Allergic 15% Partially Resolved 24%Fully Resolved 29% Partially Allergic 32%Fully Allergic Partially Resolved Partially allergic Fully Resolved30 47 6356 Figure 6 : Pie chart showing cross -sectional data for the number and proportion of subjects in each challenge group 15% were fully allergic ( Well cooked POS); 2 4% had partially resolved (cooked tolerant); ( uncooked POS; 29% had fully resolved (egg tolera nt). Immunologic responses to oral egg challenge at baseline initial challenge Of 55 subjects who unde rwent an initial egg OFC at baseline (i.e. as part of their initial assessment and diagnosis), and also provided a blood sample for analysis, 9 were fully allergic, 23 had partially resolved egg allergy, 11 were partially allergic to egg and 12 had fully resolved their egg allergy (Table 3 ). Table 3 : Distribution of male and female subjects on initial oral egg challenge Clinical Group Male Female Fully Allergic 4 5 Partially Resolved 14 9 Partially Allergic 7 4 Fully Resolved 8 4 43 Immunologic response s to egg on final oral egg challenge For egg allergic subjects there was an average of 24.54m (2.12yr) between first and last challenge. For the egg -resolved subjects the average difference was 23.45m (1.95yrs). Of the 39 subjects whose blood was available for processing and analysis (only s ubjects with two samples included ), upon their final oral egg challenge of the study 3 were found to be fully allergic, 3 had partially resolved, 18 were partially allergic and 15 had fully resolved ( Table 4 ). Table 4: The distribution of boys and girls between the four clinical sub -groups at study completion . Clinical Group Male Female Fully Allergic 1 2 Partially Resolved 1 2 Partially Allergic 15 3 Fully Resolved 10 5 3.2.2 OFC attendance, recall and withdrawal s Twenty -two subjects did not return for annual oral egg challenges. Twelve subjects stopped returning after their second visit. Attempts to contact parents of 25 subjects resulted in 6 out of 11 ER subjects successfully being recalled to provide a blood s ample and 7 out of 14 EA subjects recalled for an egg challenge. 44 Cross -sectional c omparison of fully allergic (well cooked POS) and partially resolved (well cooked NEG) subjects CFSE staining allowed us to detect allergen specific T cells in blood sam ples collected from these subjects and compare the frequency of these cells between fully allergic ( well cooked POS; cooked egg reactive) and partially resolved ( well cooked NEG; cooked egg tolerant) subjects. No difference in age of subjects (data not sho wn) or proportion of ovalbumin -specific T cell (%CD3+/CFSElo) proliferation (Figure 7 ) was observed between the fully allergic and partially resolved subjects. However, there was a significant difference in age between partially resolved subjects compared with partially allergic (uncooked POS; uncooked egg reactive) and fully resolved ( egg ) subjects (p=0.0074** and p=0.0226*) respectively (Figure 8 ). It appears that the natural steps to resolution are cooked egg allergic (FA) cooked egg tolerant (PR) uncooked egg allergic (PA) egg tolerant (ER). Cryopreservation maintains functional status of PBMC We performed on cryopreserved PBMCs in with autologous plasma. Viability after thawing (measured by Trypan blue dye exclusion) was consistently above 70% at the time of seeding [51]. PBMCs were label led with 2.5uM CFSE and treated with monensin for 4h rs after 8 day culture period. For lymphocyte cu ltures 70% viability was considered a sufficient number of memory cells as antigen presenting cells we re also present in the culture and would also proliferate in the presence of the allergen over the 8 day in vitro expansion period . 45 Fully EA Partially EA Partially RES RESOLVED0.010.1110100% Ovahi specific T cells NS, p>0.05 between all egg groups%CD3+/CFSElo Figure 7 : The proportio n of proliferating OVAhi -specific T cells (CD3+/CFSElo) in each clinical sub-group . No statistically significant differences in the proportion of proliferating high dose ovalbumin specific T cells are seen between the clinical sub - groups. 3.2.3 T cell pr oliferation OVA -specific proliferation does not change significantly as egg allergy resolves Each time a CFSE -labelled T cell divides (proliferates) the staining intensity is decreased by half. Cells that have proliferated can therefore be detected and co unted by flow cytometry. In the CFSE assay, the number of cells that have proliferated per a fixed number (e.g. 30,000 events) of undivided cells (CD3+/CFSEhi), is determined for cultures with or without allergen. The magnitude of the response is expressed as the number of cells that have proliferated in response to allergen divided by the number of cells that have proliferated in the absence of allergen (Figure 8 ). This ratio is called the cell division index (CDI) and is a measure of the rate of prolifera tion. 46 UNT TET OVAhi OVAlo Figure 8 : Differenc es in proportion of CD3+/CFSElo in response to allergen .

The proportions of these cells normalized to a fixed number of CD3+/CFSEhi (R2) for each allergen and untreated control is used to calculate the CDI. T cell proliferative responses to culture medium alone (n egative control), tetanus toxoid (TET; 8.2lLfU/ml (positive control)), dose ovalbumin (OVAhi; 1mg/ml) from egg allergic (EA) and egg resolved (ER) subjects show quantitative and qualitative differences between the allergens/ antigen in each egg group (Figure 9). 47 UNT TET OVAhi OVAlo0204060% Allergen-specific T cells in ER subjects%CD3+/CFSElo % Allergen-specific T cells in EA subjects UNT TET OVAhi OVAlo020406080%CD3+/CFSEloN 25 25 25 19 p=0.0045** p=0.0393* N 64 61 59 49 NR in EA Figure 9 : Comparison of the percentage of allergen -specific T cells (CD3+/CFSElo) in EA and ER subjects .

NR is the number of non -responders who failed to proliferate and expand their allergen T cell population to >400 events in the CD3+/CFSElo T cell subset sufficient enough to detect intracellular cytokines. The percentage of non -responders (%NR) and % of responders (%R) is also shown. Median values=horizontal line (Mann -Whitney U test p<0.05 is considered significant). Differences in T cell proliferation were detected in PBMCs stimulated by different antigen/ allergens. The levels of proliferation by TET (positive control) and OVAhi in both EA and ER subjects were significantly above untreated background negative controls (EA: median TET 6.17 ( range 0.03-75.86) p=0.0045** ) (Figure 9). However, OVAlo did not stimulate T cell proliferation above untreated background negative controls in the EA or ER group ( Figure 9 ). Comparison of T cell proliferative responses measured as %CD3+/CFSELo to TET, OVAlo and OVAhi showed no significant difference between EA and ER subjects (Figure 10 ). Surprisingly, we observed a significantly higher level of non -specific proliferation in untreated 48 negative control cultures from EA (n=64: medi an 1.54 (0.05 -44.30) p=0.0382*) compared with ER (n=25: median 1.14 (0.06 -5.59)) subjects (Figure 1 1A)).

In addition, analysis of proliferation measured as either CFSEnet (i.e. final net proliferation) or cell divison index (i.e. the rate of proliferati on), showed the same significant differences between the antigen/ allergens in both egg allergic (EA) and egg resolved (ER) subjects. The CFSEnet for tetanus toxoid (positive control) and high dose ovalbumin (1mg/ml) were significantly higher than for low dose ovalbumin (200g/ml). In EA subjects (median TET 3.5 (range p=0.0035**; median OVA 1.19 (range -39.70 -45.02) p=0.0035**) and in egg resolved subjects (median TET 2.43 (range -3.43-52.28) p=0.0107*); median OVA 1.02 (range -3.26-25.19) p= 0.0236*) (Figure 12). Similarly, CDI for TET and OVAhi was significantly higher than for OVAlo (EA median TET 6.63 (range 0.07 -95) p=0.035 **; median OVA 3.18 (range 0.03 - 147) p=0.0060**) and (ER: median TET 4.07 (range 0.29 -387) p=0.0060*; median OVA 3.03 (range 0.14 -92.34) p=0.0120*) respectively (Figure 13). This indicates that the memory T cell population in PBMC cultures from EA or ER subjects respond more rapidly to tetanus toxoid and high dose ovalbumin than to low dose ovalbumin. No statistical differenc es in CFSEnet or CDI were observed between TET and OVAhi ( Figure 12 and 1 3). 50 CFSEnet in EA subjects TET Unpaired t test TET vs OVAhi p=0.0452*CFSEnet Figure 1 2: Cross -sectional comparison of specific T cell p roliferation of allergens /antigen measured as CFSEnet (final net proliferation) in EA and ER subjects .

W e analysed the data using paired (Wilcoxon matched pairs test) and unpaired (Mann -Whitney U test) non -parametric tests to detect any significant changes in OVAhi T cell proliferation measured as %CD3+/CFSElo, CFSEnet or CDI between the same individuals fi rst challenge and their final challenge. No significant longitudinal changes were observed in %CD3+/CFSElo T cells or CFSEnet in response to high dose ovalbumin in both EA and ER groups ( Figure 14 and 15 ). However, a significant increase in CDI OVA was seen in persistent EA subjects in paired (p=0.0283*) and unpaired (p=0.0064*) data , but not in either analysis for ER subjects (Figure 1 6). The data suggested that the memory T cell response to high dose ovalbumin is more rapid in EA subjects than in ER s ubjects.

The spread in the proportion of IFN+ OVAhi specific T cells in EA and ER subjects is similar. Howe ver, we did detect a significant increase in the proportion of IFN+ OVA -specific T cells in ER subjects compared with EA subjects (median EA OVA 6.37 (range 0 -56.04) and median ER OVA 16.09 (range 17 comparison of the proportion of IL -4+ and IFN+ producing OVA hi- specific T cells between egg allergic (EA) and egg resolved (ER) subjects . No significant difference in the proportion of IL -4 positive cells was observed between EA and ER subjects. The proportion of IFN positive cells was increased in ER subjects (Mann - Whitney U test p=0.0155*) . Separating the egg allergic subjects into smaller clinical sub -groups based on their reactivity to well cooked egg (n=20) or uncooked egg (n=44) allowed a more detailed analysis of any differences in intracellular cytokine expression. We observed no difference in the proportion of IL-4+/CD3+/CFSElo in response to high dose ovalbumin between the clinical sub -groups. However, we did observe significant differe nces in the proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo 54 between subjects reactive to uncooked egg (liquid POS) or tolerant of cooked egg (UNK) compared to subjects who had fully resolved their egg allergy. The proportion of IFN producing OVAhi specific T cells were found to be lower in liquid POS subjects (uncooked egg reactive; median OVA 6.815 (range 0 -56.04) p=0.0149*) and UNK (partially resolved) subjects (UNK; cooked egg tolerant): n=21 median OVA 2.390 (range 0 subjects (NEG; gg tolerant): median OVA Cross -sectional comparison of the proportion of IFN+ or IL -4+ OVAhi -specific T cells in clinical sub -groups defined by their reactivity to well cooked egg (sponge cake) or to uncooked egg (pasteurised raw egg).

A significantly higher proportion of IFN producing OVAhi specific T cells were found in fully resolved subjects compared with subjects that reacted to uncooked egg (p=0.0149*) or tolerated cooked egg (p=0.0062*). No differences in the proporti on of IL -4 producing OVAhi specific T cells were found between the clinical sub -groups ( Mann - Whitney U test p<0.05 is considered significant) 55 Quantitative and qualitative differences in cytokine expression were found in allergen - specific T cells In subje cts with active egg allergy our results showed that the proportion of IL - 4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells in antigen/allergen (TET (positive control), OVAhi and OVAlo) treated PBMC cultures was greater than untreated PBMC (negative control). (TET (positive control) (median TET10.51 (range 0 (median UNT 1.04 (range 0 -30.43)). PBMC cultures treated with TET antigen had similar proportions of IL -4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells as those treated with OVAhi allergen. Tetanus toxoid and OVAhi treated cultures had higher proportions of IL -4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells than OVAlo treated cultures (TET MEDIAN 8.70 (range 0 -48.95); p=0.0166*, OVAhi MEDIAN 8.35 (range 0 -35.35); p=0.0084** OVAlo MEDIAN 5.465 (range 0 -38.17)) (Figure 19). In subjects with resolved egg allergy we also found significantly higher proportions of IL -4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells in a ntigen/allergen treated PBMC (TET ; OVAhi; p=0.0001*** MEDIAN 1.11(range 0 -28.57) .. In ER subjects the proportion of IL -4+ /CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells between high and low dose ovalbumin di d not differ , however in EA subjects the proportion of IL -4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells is lower in PBMC cultures treated with low dose ovalbumin (Figure 19 ). 19 : Cross -sectional c omparison of the proportion of IL-4+ specific T cells bet ween antigen/ allergens (i.e. Tetanus toxoid, high and low dose ovalbumin) in egg allergic (POS) (n=63) and egg resolved (RES) (n=26) subjects . We observed significant quantitative differences in the proportion of IL -4+ expressing cells in both egg groups. Significant higher proportion of IL - 4+/CD3+/CFSElo cells were seen for tetanus toxoid (positive control), high and low dose ovalbumin treated PBMC compared with untreated PBMC ( negative control) in both egg groups. In EA subjects we observed a significa nt decrease in the proportion of IL -4+/CD3+/CFSElo cells in PBMC treated with low dose ovalbumin (200ug/ml) compared with high dose ovalbumin (1mg/ml). Median values =horizontal line; Mann -Whitney U test p<0.05 considered significant. The proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells in PBMC cultures treated with TET(positive control) (median TET 6.53 (range 0 -58.91); p<0.0001***), signif icantly higher than in untreated PBMC cultures (negative control) (median UNT 0.26 (range 0-28.57) in egg allergic (POS_) subjects (Figure 20 ). In egg resolved (RES) subjects TET (median TET 15.32 (range 0 -55.03); p<0.0001***) and 68.23); p<0.0001***) treated PBMC cultures also showed significantly higher proportions of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells than untreated PBMC cultures (median UNT 0.71 (range 0-20.38). In ER subjects comparing median values, OVAlo treated cult ures (median OVAlo 4.56 (range 0 -41.06 ) showed no difference in proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells (Mann -Whitney U p=0.0571) compared with untreated cultures. However, in ER subjects a 57 significant difference in the proportion of IFN/CD3+/C FSElo cells between OVAlo and untreated PBMC (no allergen) cultures was seen when comparing mean values (Unpaired t test; p=0.0173*) suggesting a higher proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells in allergen treated cells. No differences were observe d between high and low dose ovalbumin in EA subjects. In ER subjects, no differences were observed between TET and OVAhi treated cultures but both these antigen/ allergens gave rise to significantly higher proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cells t han cultures treated with OVAlo (p=0.0195* and p=0.0085**) respectively (Figure 20 20 : Cross -sectional c omparison of the proportion of IFN+ specific T cells between antigen/ allergens (TET, OVAhi in EA (n=63) (n=26) subjects . Significantly higher proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo cells is seen in TET, OVAhi and OVAlo treated PBMC in EA subjects compared with untreated (no allergen) control PBMC. Similarly, in ER subjects TET and OVAhi both had significantly higher proportion of IFN expressing cells than untreated controls but OVAlo did not. Comparison of high (1mg/ml) and low (200\u00b5g/ml) dose ovalbumin showed significant differences in ER subjects only. In both egg groups the range of %IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo cells for TET and OVAhi wa s similar but for OVAlo the range was reduced in ER subjects. 58 The ratio of IFN+/IL -4+ expression by T cells is altered by culture with different antigen/ allergens. Data analysis of the r atio of IFN+/IL -4+ expressing T cells in EA compared with ER subj ects showed that for cultures treated with TET (EA MEDIAN 0.94 (range 0.01 -64.34 vs. ER MEDIAN 1.96 (range 0.15 (EA MEDIAN 0.96 ER MEDIAN 1.5 (range 0.15 -27.96); p=0.0113*) there wa s a statistical inc rease in the ratio but a decrease was seen in cultures treated with OVAlo ( EA MEDIAN 1.935 21 ). In OVAhi stimulated PBMC, the difference observed was due to the uncooked egg POS (partially aller gic; p=0.0187*) clinical sub-group of and OVAlo in EA and ER subjects Figure 21: Cross -sectional comparison of the r atio of IFN/IL -4 for TET, OVAhi and and ER subjects . The IFN/IL -4 ratio was found to be higher in ER subjects for TET (p=0.0319*) and OVAhi (p=0.0113*) but lower for OVAlo (p=0.0360*) using Mann Whitney U test p<0.05 is considered significance. The change in cytokine skew for the systemic antigen, tetanus toxoid, from a T helper Th2 response to a T helper Th1 response and for low dose ovalbumin from Th1 to Th2 skew were both unexpected and difficult to explain. A possible explanation is that a ratio cannot be calculated if one of the cytokines has a zero value. In the literature tetanus toxoid is often used as a positive c ontrol for T helper type 2 responses seen in cell culture supernatants. In our T cell assay both Th1 and Th2 59 cytokines are assessed simultaneously intracellularly and therefore able to detect the more subtle cytokine skew. Sponge POS Liquid POS Partially -4 ratio in OVAhi treated PBMC from subjects in different clinical sub -groups. Median ratio values above >1 indicate that the OVAhi -specific T cells have a T-helper type 1 skew with IFN as the dominant cytokine. This data shows in egg res olved subjects the median IFN/IL -4 ratio is greater than one (>1) and significantly higher than partially allergic subjects reactive to uncooked egg (p=0.0187*) Comparison of the log of ratio of IFN/IL -4 expressing T cells between EA and ER subjects showed statistical differences for cultures treated with TET (p=0.0373*), OVAhi (p=0.0172*) and OVAlo (p=0.0333*). For TET and OVAhi the log of ratio showed a change from a Th2 cytokine skew in EA subjects to Th1 cytokine skew in ER subjects but unexpectedly the opposite was observed for OVAlo i.e. a switch from Th1 in EA subjects to cytokine : Bar chart shows cross -sectional c omparison of the log of ratio (IFN/IL -4) of allergens between EA and ER subjects . The results show TET (p=0.0373*) OVAhi to Th2 in EA versus ER subjects. No significant change was found in the proportion of IL -4 producing T cells with resolution of egg allergy but there is up -regulation of IFN producing T cells Paired and unpaired analysis showed no statistically significant changes in the proportion of IL-4+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cell s between first and last challenge within individuals with persistent (EA: n=33; 20 pairs) or resolved (ER: n=28; 11 pairs) egg allergy (Figure 2 4). 61 Changes in % IL-4 in subjects with ACTIVE Egg Allergy (n=34; 20 pairs) First challenge Last challenge010203040% IL-4/CD3+/CFSElo Changes %IL-4+ cells in subjects with RESOLVED Egg Allergy First challenge Last challenge0204060 ACTIVE RESOLVED%IL-4+/CD3+/CFSEloChanges in the proportion of IL -4 producing cells in subjects with active or resolved egg allergy NSNS EGG ALLERGIC n=20 pairs EGG RESOLVED n=11 pairs Changes in the proportion of IFN producing cells in OVA -specific T cell subset 20/26 + than IL -4+ Changes in % IFN in EA subjects First challenge Last challenge0204060%IFN +/CD3+/CFSElo Changes in %IFNg in subjects with RESOLVED Egg Allergy (n=28;11 pairs) First challenge Last challenge020406080 ACTIVE RESOLVED%IFN +/CD3+/CFSElop=0.0481* NS; p>0.05 Paired t test in %IL -4+ and %IFN+ OVAhi -specific T cells in EA and ER subjects.

Open symbols represents subjects that resolved on their first challen ge (equivalent to last challenge). However, 12/23 (53%) EA subjects on their final challenge expressed more IL -4 than IFN producing T cells while only 4/26 (15%) ER subjects did (Fishers exact test, 2 -tailed p=0.0133 *) (Figure 27). Surprisingly, no sign ificant changes in the proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing T cells in paired data were observed for EA (p=0.0559) or ER subjects. However, analysis of unpaired data showed a significant increase in the proportion of IFN+/CD3+/CFSElo expressing cell s in EA subjects (p=0.0316*). Further analysis based on comparison of the mean values demonstrated a significant increase 62 between first and final challenges in paired (n=20; p=0.0481*) and unpaired (n=33; p=0.0463*) data in EA subjects only (Figure 24). C omparing t he number of ER subjects where OVAhi - specific T cells express more IFN than IL-4 occurs (20 out of 26 )(77%) ) is significantly higher than in EA subjects (10 out of 23 ( 43%) using Fishers exact test (2 -tailed ) (p=0.0214*). This suggests that on their final challenge the dominant cytokine in ER subjects is IFN. This is not the case for persistently EA subjects (Figure 25).

Resolved subjects were those who 69 on the final egg challenge showed they were clinically tolerant of uncooked egg whereas the subjects with active egg allergy were clinically still reactive to egg whether cooked or uncooked at the time of their last challenge.

IgG4 is thought to be an IgE blocking antibody preventing cross -linking with allergen and involved in the development of tolerance. In persistent EA, a trend towards a decrease i n IgE/Ig4 ratio between first and last challenge (p=0.0503) suggests a tendency for IgE levels to decrease while simultaneously IgG4 levels increase. This is more pronounced in resolved subjects where the decrease in IgE/IgG4 between first and last challen ge is significant p=0.0081** (Figure 37 ).

Detailed analysis of the egg allergic clinical sub -groups on initial oral food challenge showed untreated periphera l blood mononuclear cells from partially allergic (uncooked egg reactive; p=0.0152*) and partially resolved (cooked egg tolerant; p=0.0233*) subjects had higher percentages of allergen/antigen specific T cells than egg resolved subjects but not fully aller gic (well cooked egg reactive) subjects. No differences in the proliferation of allergen/antigen specific T cells were detected between egg allergic or egg resolved subjects for the systemic allergen tetanus toxoid (8.21Lfu/ml) or oral egg allergen oval bumin (low dose (200 micrograms per millilitre and high dose (1milligram per millilitre). Detailed analysis of egg allergic clinical sub -groups showed no differences in proliferation compared with egg resolved subjects for high dose ovalbumin. Carboxyflu orescein succinimydyl ester net value and cell division index also showed no differences in proliferation or rate of proliferation respectively between egg allergic and egg resolved subjects. Quantitative differences in T cell responses were observed betw een the allergens (tetanus toxoid versus egg allergen at high or low dose) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from egg allergic and egg resolved subjects. Stimulation with tetanus toxoid and high dose ovalbumin showed similar levels of T cell pr oliferation in egg allergic and egg 75 resolved subjects. Both these allergens had higher proliferative capacity than low dose ovalbumin in egg allergic subjects (p=0.0001*** and p=0.0024**)..In egg resolved subjects only tetanus toxoid had a higher prolifera tive capacity than low dose ovalbumin (p=0.0393*). Analysis of carboxyfluorescein succinimydyl ester net value and cell division index confirmed the statistical differences in proliferation between allergens in egg allergic and egg resolved subjects. Intra-cellular cytokine expression of T cells Proportion of interleukin -4 expressing cells was not significantly different among peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures treated with the different allergens (tetanus toxoid,, high and low dose ovalbumin) betw een egg allergic and egg resolved subjects Proportion of interferon -gamma expressing cells was higher in egg resolved subjects stimulated with high dose ovalbumin (p=0.0092**). The ratio of interferon -gamma to interleukin -4 positive cells was higher in egg resolved compared with egg allergic subjects for tetanus toxoid and high dose ovalbumin but lower for low dose ovalbumin.. The logarithmic value of the ratio of interferon -gamma to interleukin -4 displayed a similar pattern with tetanus toxoid and high d ose ovalbumin having a predominantly T helper type 1 skew and low dose ovalbumin having a T helper type 2 skew in egg resolved subjects. In egg allergic and egg resolved subjects stimulation with all the allergens produced more intracellular cytokine produ ction than untreated controls. Differences in the proportion of interleukin -4 expresing cells and interferon -gamma expressing cells exist between the allergens in egg allergic and egg resolved subjects. Longitudinal analysis of paired egg allergic (n=33; 2 0 pairs) and egg resolved (n=28; 11 pairs) data showed no differences in the percentage of ovalbumin -specific T cells or carboxyfluorescein succinimydyl ester net value. Cell division index was increased in subjects with persistent egg allergy. 76 Cytokine analysis broadly correlate s with egg allergy status with just over half (12/23) with active egg allergy (p=0.013*) showing a T helper 2 (interleukin -4) cytokine skew compared with the majority with resolved egg allergy ( 20/26) (p=0.0214*) displaying a T he lper 1 cytokine skew. Increased proportion of the ovalbumin -specific T cells producing interferon -gamma in children with resolved compared to active egg allergy (p=0.0115* ) Extra -cellular cytokine data Simultaneous analysis of day 8 p eripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants collected from high dose ovalbumin treated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from fully allergic, partially allergic and fully resolved subjects showed no significant differences in the levels of extracellular cytokines interleukin -10, interleukin -4 or interferon - gamma. Immunoglobulin data Our results showed egg -specific immunoglobulin E levels decreased between first and last oral challenge in children who had resolved their egg allergy compa red with children who had persistent active egg allergy p=0.0003***. Paired analysis of egg resolved subjects showed an unexpected increase in total immunoglobulin E (p=0.0327*) between the first and final challenge No differences in total immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin G1 was observed between egg allergic and egg resolved subjects. Longitudinal analysis of matched pairs of persistently active or resolved subjects showed no changes in total immunoglobulin G or egg -specific immunoglobulin G1, althoug h a trend towards increasing immunoglobulin G1 may occur in resolving subjects ( not significant ; p=0.06). 77 In contrast, immunoglobulin G4 levels in children with resolved egg allergy appear to increase within individuals overtime (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs tes t p=0.0119*; Mann - Whitney U -test: not significant ; p=0.057) Ratio of immunoglobulin G1 to immunoglobulin G4 was shown to significantly decline in egg resolved subjects (p=0.0076**) and a trend towards decreasing in egg allergic subjects ( not significant ; p=0.05) Ratio of immunoglobulin E to immunoglobulin G4 significantly decreases in egg resolved (p=0.0081**) and a trend towards decreasing in egg allergic subjects ( not significant ; p=0.0507) This is the first study defining both the clinical and immu nological longitudinal changes which occur during resolution of clinical egg allergy. Additionally, this study identified and examined the responses of allergen -specific T cells as opposed to the non -specific pool of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, usi ng a novel technique of intracellular staining. This avoids confounding influences from other cell types. Our experimental work has shown that during resolution of egg allergy there is a switching to an interferon gamma dominant response by allergen specif ic T cells; although interleukin -4 secreting cells are not reduced in number they are less dominant in the resolved state. The ratio of interferon gamma to interleukin -4 therefore tends to increase longitudinally during resolution. These changes are associ ated with a reduction in levels of serum specific immunoglobulin E and increase in specific immunoglobulin G4 as clinical tolerance is attained. 78 4 DISCUSSION 4.1 Experimental Data The immunological changes which take place during resolution of food al lergy are poorly characterized. The aim of our prospective study was to define the changes in T cell responses longitudinally (proliferation and cytokine secretion) during either resolution or persistence of one of the commonest food allergies, egg allergy . The development of methods for fluorescent cell division tracking by Lyons and Parish (1994) [52] allowed researchers to examine for the first time the proliferation of lymphocyte subsets within complex mixtures of cells, e.g. peripheral blood mononucl ear cells (PBMC), which could be easily quantified by using appropriate cell surface markers to identify the lymphocyte subpopulation. Significant progress in understanding the important role of T cell derived cytokines in the induction and maintenance of the allergic status has been made [16, 17, 18]. Previous studies have presented evidence that immunotherapy with house dust mite or grass pollen may act by induction of an altered pattern of cytokine synthesis by T cells [53, 54]. Induction of tolerance is considered to involve a complex array of interacting mechanisms. Hence, an alteration of the Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance in egg allergic subjects is regarded as just one approach. Thus, one aim of our study was to investigate whether resolution of hen egg allergy is partly a consequence of changes in cytokine secretion from a predominantly T helper type 2 (IL -4) cyt okine response to a predominantly T helper type 1 (IFN) by allergen specific T cells One hundred and nine egg allergic (EA) subjects were recruited with a known clinical history of type I mediated hypersensitivity responses, positive skin prick test and egg-specific serum IgE antibodies. The subjects were challenged annually over a 6 year period with either well 79 cooked egg or uncooked egg. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from subjects at each challenge visit were stimulated in vitro with ovalb umin (OVA), one of the major hen egg allergens, or with a control antigen Tetanus toxoid (TET). Previously, our group demonstrated stronger proliferative T cell responses to OVA than to ovomucoid (OM) [44]). This may reflect differences in individual react ivity to these egg allergens. Cytokine secretion was measured 4 hours after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin after 8 days of culture. An unexpected finding was a higher level of non -specific background proliferation observed in PBMC cultures from EA subjects but not in resolved subjects. The explanation is not clear, but one possibility may be stimulation by very small levels of egg protein in the autologous plasma used in cultures. However, against this hypothesis there was no difference between allergic and resolved subjects in proliferation when OVA (up to 1mg/ml) was to added cultures. Another point is that the observed proliferation was non -specific as these cells were not producing the intracellular cytokines of interest . The oral allergen ovalbumin (OVA) and positive control antigen tetanus toxoid (TET) used to stimulate PBMCs showed no differences in the T cell proliferative responses they gave rise to i.e. generation of allergen -specific T cells (CD3+/CFSElo) between subject groups. Previous studies with [3H]-thymidine assessed proliferation as DNA synthesis of whole PBMC cultures [77, 44] whereas the CFSE assay is more sensitive and well suited to quantifying proliferation of specific T cells directly in response to allergen. In combination with flow cytometry we were able to analyse the phenotype and function of the allergen responsive T cells. In OVA -stimulated cultures, egg resolved (ER) subjects showed an increase in the proportion of IFN secreting cells compared with egg allergic (EA) subjects. In TET stimulated cultures we observed similar levels of cytokines in EA and ER subjects. We concl ude that resolution of 80 hen egg allergy involve changes in allergen -specific T cell responsiveness resulting in IFN up-regulation but no change in lymphoproliferation to OVA. In fact, in this study, we demonstrated that resolution of hen egg allergy is as sociated with a significant increase in IFN secretion by allergen -specific T cells in vitro . However, as seen in previous studies with bee venom [55] we did not observe a simultaneous decrease in allergen -specific IL -4 secretion. Our data suggest that IL -4 production levels may be equally maintained regardless of egg allergic status. A higher frequency of IFN positive cells and therefore a switch to IFN dominance is associated with development of resolution and tolerance. This finding does suggest a shif t towards a more Th1 -like cell response resulting in down -regulation of clinical reactivity in subjects with egg allergy. This pattern has also been observed in studies on skin biopsy samples during grass pollen immunotherapy [56, 57, 36] which indicated e nhanced mRNA expression of Th1 type cytokines, but on Th2 type cytokine secretion pattern.[17, 18]. Suppression of the all ergic response by several humoral and basic immunological mechanisms has been proposed. One of these mechanisms is a n increase in the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) G competitive antibodies, which reduces the pathological effects of IgE via several different mechanisms [34]. The different immunological effects relate to clinical outcome as reduction in symptoms and t he need for treatment, and reduced inflammatory response. The size of induction of IgG following egg immunotherapy may be related to the cumulative dose used for challenge treatment and the clinical effects of the oral challenge. Our data suggest that the rise of IgE blocking antibodies, particularly IgG4 during resolution of egg allergy, is the main reason for protection [58, 59]. Evidence from previous studies suggest production of IgE antibodies, which are considered to be critical as an indicator of imm ediate hypersensitivity, is mainly dependent on the ratio between IL -4 and IFN cytokines, which are secreted by activated T cells [60, 61, 62, 63] . Human B cell clones can be induced to 81 proliferate in vitro and switch to IgE and IgG4 synthesis by IL -4 and a co-stimulatory signal provided by activated CD4+T cell clones. Our data shows that egg -specific IgE production is reduced in ER subjects, perhaps suppressed by increasing IFN [64]. Our paired longitudinal data suggest a protective effect of IgG4 antibo dies in some egg allergic subjects as they progress towards tolerance induction. The IgE/IgG4 ratio declined significantly in ER subjects and a similar trend is seen in some subjects with persistent egg allergy who may go on to resolve later. 82 4.2 Clinical data We have described the clinical features, outcomes and natural history of resolution of egg allergy in a large representative sample of young children in the UK. This will aid clinical decision making. We have demonstrated that during resolution of hen egg allergy, tolerance to well cooked egg is achieved before uncooked egg; and that well cooked egg challenges are well tolerated with no severe reactions. We have identified a serum IgE level that confers a high probability of pr edicting tolerance to egg and propose (below) an algorithm for reintroduction of well cooked and lightly cooked egg based on serum IgE levels . The natural history of egg allergy is for the majority to undergo spontaneous resolution over time [7]. A recent prospective challenge study showed the median time to raw egg tolerance was 35 months and 66% had resolved after 5 years of follow -up [9]. In contrast we found that \u00be had not resolved by five years of age and the median age at complete resolution of egg allergy was 125 months. This discrepancy may be partly explained by methodological differences, as the population we studied was older. Nonetheless, both studies underestimate the true rate of resolution because subjects were likely to have achieve d tolerance to egg in advance of the egg challenge. In our study, tolerance to well cooked egg was achieved well before tolerance to uncooked egg, in the same population. There is a considerable difference, with median age at tolerance of 67m and 125m for well cooked and uncooked egg respectively. A recent study of egg - allergic patients aged between 0.5 and 25 years showed that 70% were able to tolerate challenges with well -cooked egg [65]. Therefore during resolution of allergy, gradual and stepwise reint roduction should be attempted with well cooked egg first [74]. In the present study, nearly 1/4 had resolved allergy to well cooked egg at 3 years and 2/3 at 6 years. It is 83 important to note that resolution can occur in older children, so that despite an e arlier positive challenge, attempts at reintroduction should be continued. Families find it helpful to establish when their children have achieved tolerance to well cooked egg, so that they no longer worry about well cooked egg as a hidden ingredient in f oods, and allergen avoidance becomes less onerous. Additionally, after a negative challenge, well cooked egg should be introduced into the diet on a regular basis: this is shown to be well tolerated with no adverse effect on growth, allergy or intestinal p ermeability [65]. In a previous study the food allergy related quality of life score improved for children who underwent food challenge in a clinic setting [67]. The improvement in quality of life occurred after both positive and negative challenges, imply ing that all families found the challenge process helpful regardless of the outcome. Data advising on the timing of reintroduction are scarce, recently published BSACI guidelines [74] recommend that children who have had only mild symptoms (cutaneous) on significant exposure (e.g. a mouthful of scrambled eggs) with no ongoing asthma could have well -cooked egg (e.g. sponge cake) reintroduced from the age of about 2 -3 years at home [74]. In our study, tolerance to well -cooked egg was achieved approximatel y twice as quickly as tolerance to uncooked egg, in the same population. There is a considerable difference, with median age at tolerance of 5 years and 10 years for well -cooked and uncooked egg respectively. Our data therefore support this guideline: at t hree years 27% had no reaction to a cooked egg challenge and reactions were universally mild. Furthermore, nearly 2/3 had resolved allergy to well-cooked egg at 6 years. It is important to note that resolution can occur in older children, so that despite a n earlier positive challenge, attempts at reintroduction should be continued. Our data support undertaking a well -cooked egg challenge as this is usually tolerated even when the skin test is positive (e.g. 3 -5mm wheal diameter; table 2). 84 There are a numbe r of safety factors built into this approach. The proportion of egg in the food is very small for well -cooked egg reintroduction. The age when resolution is demonstrated by challenge is likely to be greater than the age at which resolution actually occurs therefore a higher proportion would have resolved than is apparent. Our data are based on full dose challenges of egg given over 2 hours, whereas the home reintroduction recommendation is over days or weeks. Thus the dose of allergen is significantly less and the rate of reintroduction significantly lower. Lastly, for lightly cooked reintroduction, children would have already introduced well -cooked egg into their diet; therefore the process of resolution has begun. The safety of performing home reintroduc tion of well cooked egg can be considered by examining previous challenge studies, although there are important methodological differences between home reintroduction and egg challenge protocols. There have been no studies of egg reactions after home reint roduction. In studies employing hospital based egg challenges the onset of reactions is rapid, with most symptoms occurring in the first 30 minutes of ingestion [68]. Urticaria and/or angio -oedema occur in up to 90% of subjects (within minutes) and gastroi ntestinal symptoms are described in 10 -44% (within 2 hours) [6, 68, 69]. The majority of reactions however are mild. Reporting of more severe reactions with significant respiratory symptoms varies widely from 2 -34% in challenge studies [68 -73]. One study which reported a 7% rate of severe reactions including 21% with respiratory reactions , but this involved administration of a whole raw egg at once [73]. A retrospective chart review of clinical practice challenges reported a severe reaction rate of 17%, however the type of egg used in challenges was not reported [18]. Most of these studies employed raw or lightly cooked egg challenges and/or large single doses and/or short dose intervals. A cautious regime using sequential well cooked then lightly cooked egg with stepwise reintroduction as we suggest is better tolerated. We emphasize that the BSACI algorithm involves slow stepwise reintroduction over several days instead of challenge over a few hours [74]. 85 In the present study, r eactions to well cooked eg g were mild to moderate with no serious respiratory features, the majority having only cutaneous or gastrointestinal reactions. This should provide reassurance for clinicians planning to reintroduce well cooked egg back into the diet of children with mild egg allergy, at home. A recent publication cautioned against any home introduction of well cooked egg, after reporting that injectable adrenaline was administered to a number of children during hospital - based challenges to cooked egg [65]. H owever the cha llenge involved a large dose of egg given over a few hours. Whereas our first days dose is about 120 fold less . In addition the cohort challenged contained significant numbers of children with severe egg allergy and asthma , two factors which would lead on e to consider a hospital supervised challenge . We recommend that c hildren who have had only mild symptoms (cutaneous) on significant exposure (e.g. a mouthful of scrambled eggs) with no ongoing asthma could have well cooked egg (e.g. sponge cake) introduc ed from the ag e of about 2 -3 years at home in accordance with the recently published BSACI egg allergy guidelines [74]. Data from our group and others [28] show that c hildren who tolerate well cooked egg may still react to uncooked egg . In case series se vere reactions have been reported [27]. The speed with which allergy to uncooked egg resolves varies greatly between individuals; therefore the timing and appropriateness of reintroduction should be individually assessed. Biomarkers could be helpful in thi s respect. Recent studies have suggested that the absolute level [10] and the rate of fall [38] of egg white IgE may help to identify patients in whom the egg allergy has resolved. Children with a peak level of egg IgE <2kU/l had the fastest rate of resolu tion [10], and a reduction in serum egg -specific IgE level of 50% over 12 months was associated with a 0.52 probability of tolerance [38] . 86 5 CONCLUSIONS This longitudinal study of a topic children with egg allergy has shown up -regulation of Th1 responsive ness (shown by increased egg specific interferon gamma) and IgG4 levels and decreased egg-specifi c IgE with acquisition of clinical tolerance . This is the first longitudinal clinical study which defines the ages at resolution of egg allergy, for both well -cooked and uncooked egg. The findings support the recently published BSACI guidelines on egg reintroduction.
