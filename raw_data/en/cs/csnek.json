The higher a gem's quality, the more therapeutically powerful it is. As a gem rises in quality, its therapeutic potency often increases far more than its price. Going up even one level of quality can deliver many times more therapeutic power. Gemstone Size Next to quality, the most important factor in determining a gemstone's therapeutic power is mass. Quality being equal, larger gems are more potent than smaller ones. If your neck is sensitive to weight, consider wearing somewhat smaller gems. Children usually require shorter necklaces and smaller gems. Necklace Length Quality and gem size being equal, longer necklaces are more therapeutically potent than shorter ones because they contain more gemstone mass. Consider your comfort when choosing; for example, shorter people may prefer wearing shorter necklaces. If you wish to wear more than one necklace simultaneously, ideally they should be of different lengths. All necklaces 23 inches or shorter contain a 14K gold clasp; longer necklaces have no clasp.

White Flash Moonstone gemstones display a shimmery white flash, or adularescence, and [Blue Flash Moonstone](https://gemisphere.com/products/blue-flash-moonstone) displays blue adularescence. The missions and indications for wearing the two varieties are essentially the same, but Blue Flash Moonstone offers some additional benefits. Moonstone energy nourishes and develops the supraphysical aura. Supporting your supraphysical aura may be the single most important thing you can do for your health. This aura is a layer of energy that immediately surrounds every cell and organ, as well as your physical body as a whole, and it performs many essential functions. Because of the vital role the supraphysical aura plays in maintaining good health, if you had but one therapeutic gemstone necklace to work with, Moonstone would be an excellent choice. A healthy and substantial supraphysical aura offers many benefits. It contains an energetic counterpart of every cell and organ in your body and helps ensure that the body has sufficient energy during daily living and in times of special need. The supraphysical aura is also a crucial part of your immune defenses. It protects you from abnormal growths, such as tumors, by encouraging accurate DNA replication. It maintains your overall health by aiding communication and energy-sharing among organ systems. It supports all functions of your lymphatic system, including detoxification and lymphocyte production. And it protects your body's essential moisture. Without adequate supraphysical support, the body breaks down sooner, aging occurs more rapidly, and younger people can experience maladies usually reserved for the elderly. Few adults today have a substantial, healthy, and well-defined supraphysical aura. In addition to the physical body's continual demands for supraphysical support, this aura becomes depleted by unhealthy habits, environmental stress, and the process of aging. The regular onslaught of environmental toxins, allergens, electromagnetic radiation, and negative energies also creates indentations, holes, and weaknesses in the supraphysical fabric. Moonstone energy repairs damage to the supraphysical aura and replenishes it. When you wear a Moonstone necklace, its energy fills the supraphysical counterparts of your physical organs and improves every function of the supraphysical aura. Indeed, wearing Moonstone can help your supraphysical aura become the ultimate shield, mirror, and energy storehouse it is meant to be. Development of the Supraphysical Aura Your supraphysical aura is a collection of the life energy emitted during cell division. Each time a cell divides, a burst of electrical charge is released. This electrical charge vitalizes the young cells so they begin their life cycle with youthful vigor. Some of this electrical charge lingers outside the dividing cells. As cells continue to divide, this energy collects to form your supraphysical aura. When enough supraphysical fabric has accrued, it begins to exhibit specialized functions. The most rapid cell division occurs during infancy, when the supraphysical aura is first forming. Over time, the rate of cell division slows, so that by adulthood it is sufficient only to sustain the supraphysical fabric. In older adults the substance of the supraphysical aura diminishes. Support for Restoring Youthfulness Reversing Supraphysical Decline One of the key factors in the decline we experience with age is the deterioration of the supraphysical aura. Aging cells do not emit enough electrical charge to replenish the supraphysical fabric, and so it deteriorates. The supraphysical aura begins to lose substance and shrink. Illness, injury, and the onslaught of negative energies further accelerate the decrease in electrical output and supraphysical degeneration. Wearing Moonstone can stop and reverse this deterioration. By boosting the electrical charge emitted during cell division and rebuilding the supraphysical fabric, Moonstone can serve as a powerful tool to help correct many of the undesirable effects of aging. After wearing Moonstone for a while, you may find stiffness easing, joints becoming more mobile, and overall organ function improving. Support for Replenishing Moisture The supraphysical aura not only contains energetic counterparts of organs and cells, but also of the body's water molecules. With age and injury, both the physical body and supraphysical aura lose moisture. Many ills are associated with this dehydration. Aging dries out the supraphysical aura as a whole, making it less efficient. In addition, injuries cause dryness in the area of the supraphysical aura that corresponds to the damaged physical area. As the supraphysical aura dries out, all its functions suffer, and the physical body loses crucial support. Imagine a rough, dried out sponge rubbing against your skin. As your skin moves against the dry sponge, it's easy to see how it would get irritated and break down. This is similar to what happens as the supraphysical aura dries out and interacts with the physical body. Moonstone energetically moistens the supraphysical aura. As your supraphysical fabric accepts Moonstone energy, this aura will expand and normalize, like water filling a dry sponge. All supraphysical functions will improve, as will the ability of your physical cells to accept moisture. With replenished moisture, many of the ill effects that the body experiences with aging will be reversed. Ailing or injured areas will be soothed and might even heal on their own. Other therapies applied to these areas will now be more effective. As a result, chronic conditions or stubborn recurrences of an acute ailment may also finally resolve. Support for Nourishing the Skin Because your supraphysical aura immediately surrounds your body, it is in direct contact with your skin. When the supraphysical aura is imbued with Moonstone energy, it can convert oxygen from the atmosphere into a form that the skin can absorb and use directly. This additional oxygen will denature free radicals in your skin, rendering them less harmful and more easily expelled. As a result, wearing Moonstone can significantly improve the health of your skin. For optimal health, your supraphysical aura and physical body must glide against each other smoothly and easily. When the body and its supraphysical aura press or rub against each other, energy doesn't flow between them properly. This irritates the affected area and can cause skin eruptions. Indeed, nearly every skin disease can be linked to a physical-supraphysical disturbance at the place where the skin has erupted. Unless the disturbance is cleared, any treatments applied to the skin are unlikely to make lasting changes. Moonstone energy is like an emollient for the skin. Moonstone is especially helpful when the skin condition is associated with dryness. It also lifts supraphysical pressure from the afflicted area, freeing the skin to improve its health. Lubricating the Physical-Supraphysical Connection The ability of your supraphysical aura and physical body to glide against each other is necessary not only for the health of your skin but of your entire body. The more easily they glide against each other, the more effectively they work together. As Moonstone energy lubricates the connection between the supraphysical aura and physical body, energy and information are better able to pass between them. Managing Precious Resources Any time you ask something special of your body, your supraphysical aura helps make sure that energy moves to the parts of your body being challenged. Your organs need extra energy when they are stressed or sick, but energy is also apportioned in the natural course of living. If you lift a heavy object, energy is directed to your muscles; if you are solving a complex problem, it goes to your brain, and so on. Your supraphysical aura is the vehicle through which energy is moved from organs that have it to those that need it. The supraphysical aura also acts as an energy storehouse for the physical body and shares its own energy with physical organs. If a physical organ becomes ill, its supraphysical counterpart supplies energy to promote the organ's healing. Yet, if this energy borrowing continues too long, it can deplete the supraphysical aura. As a result, your body will not have a ready supply of energy when it's needed. You may also experience chronic malaise or tissue that is slow to heal. Wearing Moonstone builds up the fabric of the supraphysical counterpart of every organ, so your supraphysical aura can supply you with extra energy whenever you need it. Because Moonstone helps resolve supraphysical deficiencies, all your organs are less likely to become depleted, and your entire system can rise to the challenges it faces both in daily living and in times of illness. Supporting Organ Communication Another role of a healthy supraphysical aura is to help your organ systems communicate with each other and coordinate their activities. Accurate communication and coordination among organ systems is essential for the activities of daily living. For example, your muscles must work with your heart and lungs, your nervous system must continually interact with all parts of your body, and so on. The supraphysical aura consists of many layers of overlapping folds of supraphysical fabric. Communication both between organ systems and among organs within the same system is enhanced along these folds. This communication is instantaneous and does not require hormones or neurochemicals. In the course of living, these supraphysical folds naturally accumulate energy blockages, which hinder or shut down communication. The body is then forced to rely on hormones and neurochemicals instead, adding to the work of the endocrine and nervous systems. Moonstone energy clears blockages from the supraphysical folds. As a result, it helps clarify and speed up communication among organ systems, corrects communication breakdowns, and relieves stress from the endocrine and nervous systems. In this way, Moonstone helps your entire body run more smoothly and harmoniously. Supporting Detoxification and the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is part of the body's internal cleansing mechanism and an important player in the immune system. Lymph clears bacteria, metabolic byproducts, and other waste from the tissues and filters them in the lymph nodes. The lymphatic system also produces lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that acts upon infections. The folds in the supraphysical aura have a special correlation to lymphatic tissue. When the folds accumulate energy blockages, they become less smooth, and the flow of lymph in the physical body is restricted. Moonstone stimulates the flow of lymph by eliminating the supraphysical blockages, smoothing the folds, and making the lymph a better lubricant and conductor. As a result, the lymphatic system works many times more efficiently. By supporting the lymphatic system, Moonstone can boost your body's ability to fight infection. It can also ease the effects of lymphatic diseases, swollen glands, and any kind of lymphatic congestion that results in soreness, pain, or general malaise. Building Muscle Strength Moonstone increases your capacity to build strength. In fact, one of the first things you may notice when you wear Moonstone is that you feel stronger. There are several reasons for this. Moonstone's enhancement of communication among organ systems will allow your heart and lungs to work together more harmoniously during exercise. Also, Moonstone's support of detoxification via the lymph will allow your muscles to work longer without fatigue. Once your supraphysical aura becomes saturated with Moonstone energy, this energy will remain behind for some time after you remove the necklace. It will continue to support you even when you aren't wearing the necklace, allowing you to temporarily remove the necklace during athletic activity, when it might otherwise get in your way. The Benefits of Active Reflection One of the most important functions of the supraphysical aura is active reflection. During active reflection, information is passed back and forth between the physical body and supraphysical aura. When the supraphysical aura is healthy, this reflection serves several functions: it helps keep the body attuned to what is happening within itself, and it strengthens the electrical charge of the dividing cells. Ideally, it also alerts the body to mistakes made during cell division, so that it can correct them before they escalate into major health problems. Moonstone energy enhances active reflection. In this way, wearing Moonstone can build up your immune defenses and help prevent abnormal growths. Help for Energetically Fortifying Your Immune Defenses A healthy supraphysical aura is a critical part of the immune system. It serves as an outer-perimeter line of defense by filtering and deflecting not only the energies of physical pathogens, but also those of negative emotions, thoughts, and psychic energies. To defend effectively, the supraphysical aura must consist of uniform, well-developed supraphysical fabric. When Moonstone energy enhances active reflection, the supraphysical aura mirrors back to the cells their inherent electrical charge, however strong or weak it may be. As this reflection bounces back and forth, the cells' electrical charge is strengthened. When these cells divide, the charge they emit is naturally stronger. This strengthened charge fortifies and rebuilds your supraphysical substance. This is especially helpful if your supraphysical aura is depleted or damaged. By building up your supraphysical aura, Moonstone can help prevent illness, combat infection and disease, and give you added protection against negative energies. Moonstone also helps your immune system correct its mistakes, such as those that occur in autoimmune conditions. Moonstone's enhancement of active reflection heightens your body's awareness of what's happening inside it. In the case of autoimmune disease, this reflection helps the body's intelligence identify healthy cells and understand how its immune cells are attacking them. The body is then in a much better position to correct the problem. Preventing Abnormal Growths Before a cell can divide, it must replicate its DNA so that each daughter cell contains genetic material identical to that of its parent cell. Before replication begins, the cell's double strand of DNA separates into two single strands. The nucleotides on each single strand then draw to themselves complementary nucleotides to form new double strands. Then the cell is ready to divide. Mistakes occur when nucleotides are unable to pair with their proper partners. Too many mistakes in this process cause mutations that can lead to the development of abnormal growths, such as tumors. Correcting these mistakes is a natural function of a healthy supraphysical aura. When you wear Moonstone, this self-correction process is greatly enhanced. Moonstone energy collects around the nucleotides, aligning free nucleotides and heightening the reflective quality of those in the single strands. This helps the nucleotides more clearly identify and attract their proper partners. Then, each time a cell divides, the arrangement of its nucleotides is further corrected, until the DNA reaches a stable and healthy state. Thus, you can wear Moonstone to help prevent the unwanted mutations that lead to aberrant growths, including benign tumors, fibroids, skin tags, and cancer, especially if you are genetically predisposed to them. Enhancing Your Perception of Energies The shimmer characteristic of Moonstone's appearance is responsible for its ability to help the supraphysical aura and physical bodies reflect information to and from each other. The shimmer raises the vibration of the physical body just enough to make it more compatible with supraphysical vibrations. This also means that, by wearing Moonstone, you may be able to perceive the supraphysical vibratory field more easily. This includes the effects of gemstone energies on the aura and physical fabric. Moonstone's Effects on the Emotional Body Two types of emotions originate in the emotional body: consciously experienced feelings and subconscious impulses. These impulses operate in the background, like the autonomic nervous system, to keep your body in balance. They sedate you when you need to rest; they stimulate you to wake up; and they urge you to eat certain foods or take part in certain activities. With long-term use of Moonstone, its energy will seep from your supraphysical aura into your emotional body, where its effects on these two types of emotions will grow over time. Wearing Moonstone will improve the quality of the subconscious impulses so they are more effective at guiding you to healthier, more productive actions. It will also have a lubricating effect on the flow of your emotions, so you are less likely to bottle them up. Supraphysical Evolution and Moonstone's Unlimited Potential Today we are subject to many forms of pollution that were unknown to our ancestors, such as heavy-metal toxins and electromagnetic radiation. Escalating toxicity in our environment is one factor driving the evolution of the physical body and supraphysical aura. The body has started to develop new ways to discharge the pollutants' energies into the supraphysical aura. The supraphysical aura is also evolving to meet these environmental challenges by growing in size and substance. Moonstone not only repairs and nourishes the supraphysical aura, it also helps this aura evolve into the more advanced form it can ultimately become. Indeed, generations from now, the supraphysical aura will likely resemble the Moonstone-developed aura of today. If you wear Moonstone over time, its effects will increase as your supraphysical aura develops. For example, your supraphysical fabric may eventually become strong enough to deflect harmful electromagnetic radiation. We are only beginning to see the potential of this gemstone's healing capacity. Our Exquisite Plus-Plus-Plus White Flash Moonstone is unique and extremely rare. In this translucent Moonstone, the size, intensity, brilliance, and visual movement of the flash are several times greater than that of the Moonstone in the other categories. The more surface area the flash occupies, the more potent the gem is; thus, the effects of this Moonstone are exceptionally strong. The beads' translucency carries the Moonstone's energy into the subtle bodies, where it enhances Moonstone's effects on the supraphysical aura. A hint of blue flash in some beads offers some benefits of Blue Flash Moonstone. Therapeutic quality Moonstone is milky-white and can vary in its degree of translucency. Therapeutic Moonstone displays an optical quality called adularescence\u2014that is, a shimmery flash of white or, in very rare cases, blue. Almost every bead in a therapeutic Moonstone necklace should have a distinct flash. The more surface area the flash covers, the more potent the gem is. For the best view of its flash, hold your Moonstone in sunlight. Cracks and inclusions hinder Moonstone's effectiveness and should be either absent or very minimal. Black or other colored opaque spots void Moonstone's energy in an area many times the size of the spot itself. A necklace with many spots might even be harmful to the wearer's supraphysical fabric. Our Moonstone Necklaces Our therapeutic Moonstone necklaces are made with Moonstone rondels that have been cut from high quality crystals. To ensure our Moonstone's superior therapeutic value, we obtain the gemstones in rough form and then have them cut to our unique specifications. Each Moonstone necklace is unique, and all are individually priced based on their total carat weight and quality. For most gemstones, the therapeutic quality categories defined as Very Fine, Exquisite, Exquisite Plus, etc. suffice to describe the quality of the gems in a particular necklace. However, for a handful of gemstones, gradients of quality exist within each therapeutic quality category. Moonstone is one of these gemstones. This means that a particular Moonstone necklace may be somewhat higher or lower in quality than the other necklaces in the same category. These variations are reflected in the price per carat of each necklace. As a chiropractor, I believe that Moonstone is an important gemstone for anyone who wants to create a strong foundation of physical health. The first time I put Moonstone around my neck, I began to notice its profound benefits. The week before, I hadn't gotten much sleep. Within an hour of wearing Moonstone for the first time, I started to feel such increased vibrancy and alertness that I searched my mind for what I could have done to feel so good on so little sleep. Then I remembered the Moonstone was around my neck! That evening, my workout was greatly enhanced, as I was able to do more work in less time. Now that I have this profound tool, I know I will accomplish what I choose. I can feel my own system getting a significant upgrade that enables me to function at a higher level than I thought possible. I recommend Moonstone for any healthcare practitioner who wishes to set a shining example of what is truly possible in the realm of physical health. Michael Croutch, D.C. Oyster Bay, New York Within several days of wearing Moonstone, I started to feel stronger and have more vitality. I find myself laughing more and feeling more youthful in mind and body. I see humor everywhere. My skin looks younger and less blemished. I feel an excitement that I remember experiencing when I was younger. I seem to be able to focus more clearly. I've worked with many Gemisphere gems, but Moonstone has been one of the most fun. C.F., Washington I recently bought White Flash Moonstone and find that it's helping me eliminate unwanted \"skin tags\" and moles from my body. For the last three weeks, I have started actually losing the skin tags. First they become a little swollen and pink, and then they start to itch. Next, they turn black and, after about seven days, when I scratch them, they peel off like little black buttons. I have had the Moonstone for a month and have lost 24 skin tags and moles from my neck and chest area, where I have had severe sun damage. S.S., Bloomington, Indiana I am normally a person whose thoughts are very concise and clear. However, for a period of six to ten months before using Moonstone, I found it extremely difficult to avoid ambiguity in almost all areas. It was difficult to concentrate, difficult to meditate, difficult to feel lucid. If you'll excuse the metaphor, I felt as though I was going through my life looking through a pair of dirty, foggy glasses. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to identify a specific cause for this problem, other than the ridiculous amount of stress I was undergoing. At any rate, when I first received my Moonstone necklace, within a few hours of beginning to wear it, almost like magic I found clarity in almost everything I thought about\u2014instantly, without considerable concentration, meditation, etc. It was just there! Using my metaphor, it was as though someone had not only cleaned my glasses but updated and strengthened my prescription. That result has remained consistent since I began wearing the Moonstone some two months ago. About a week or so into this experience, I obtained a second necklace and now wear and sleep next to two Moonstone necklaces at the same time. The results have remained astonishing and consistent. My stress level has remained the same, so I can only attribute the improvement to the new variable\u2014the Moonstone. All else in my life has remained pretty constant. Another interesting point is that there have been several days in which I've had such a busy morning, I've forgotten to take the necklaces from my bed and put them around my neck. Each time, by mid-day, I felt mentally and emotionally cloudy, just \"off.\" Each time that realization hit me, and I stopped to think about why I didn't feel right, I noticed that I had forgotten to put on my Moonstones. As soon as I remedied that situation, within hours, my clarity was back. Moonstone is truly amazing! What a blessing! Thank you, Gemisphere. W.C., Henderson, Nevada Wear It Around Your Neck One of the most powerful and convenient ways to use a White Flash Moonstone necklace is to wear it around your neck. Moonstone is most effective when worn as a necklace continually. The gems will silently work for you as you go about your day. At night while you are sleeping, you can wear the necklace or keep it within three feet of your body to maintain your connection with the gems. Focused Treatments In addition to wearing a White Flash Moonstone necklace around your neck, you can use it for more focused treatments. The simplest treatment is to place it on a specific area of your body to focus its healing energies there. For example, you can curl up the necklace and place it on an ailing, injured, or painful area to accelerate the area's recovery. Here is another focused treatment you can perform with this necklace: [Moonstone Diagnostic Technique and Therapy](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1544/6601/files/Moonstone_-_White__Diagnostic_Tech_Therapy.pdf?11305806778971927576) This therapy demonstrates Moonstone's versatility as a therapeutic tool. It can be used as both a diagnostic technique and a treatment for a broad range of ailments and issues. More Tips If you remove the Moonstone during exercise, return it to your neck immediately afterward. Wear the Moonstone regularly between exercise sessions. Begin by wearing a Moonstone necklace next to your skin. After you've worn it for a few weeks, your supraphysical aura will be accustomed to receiving Moonstone energy. Then the gemstone's effects will be about the same whether you wear it against your skin or on top of your clothing. Rondel Size and Necklace Length Select a Moonstone necklace that is light enough to wear all the time and thus give your supraphysical aura ongoing support. Necklaces made of four- to six-millimeter rondels can be worn most of the time by most people. A Moonstone necklace should not contain a metal clasp, since metal interferes with Moonstone's energy. Wearing Moonstone with Other Necklaces Moonstone can be worn with other gemstone necklaces, but doing so will dilute its effects. The Moonstone's energy will support the other gemstone rather than focus exclusively on the unique benefits it offers to the supraphysical aura. Therefore, if you wish to focus your work primarily on Moonstone's many benefits, wear it alone. Children CAUTION: To prevent choking, do not allow babies or very young children to wear a necklace. For the first six weeks of life, when the supraphysical aura is forming, a baby relies on the supraphysical aura of his or her primary caregivers. These first six weeks are critical for laying a child's supraphysical foundation. If you are the parent or primary caregiver of an infant, wearing Moonstone while you are in close proximity to your baby will speed the development of the baby's supraphysical aura. The Moonstone energy from your aura will enhance and organize the electrical charges emitted during cell division in the baby's body. This will ensure an optimal foundation for your child's growing supraphysical aura. Your toddler will also benefit from the Moonstone around your neck. As long as you remain physically close, the Moonstone energy in your aura will be picked up by your child and work equally well in his or her supraphysical aura. (Note that this effect occurs with very few gems; Yellow Sapphire is another. Usually, a gemstone necklace works only for the person wearing it.) As a child matures, Moonstone energy can help orchestrate proper growth by filling in any holes or weak spots in his or her supraphysical aura. A well-developed supraphysical aura is essential to protect a child from harmful influences and to optimize health potential later in life. Children with well-developed supraphysical auras will be more self-confident and less affected by peer pressure. They will also be less susceptible to colds, flu, and other illnesses. In addition, their bodies will grow more evenly and with greater coordination, thus avoiding ailments such as Osgood-Schlatter condition, in which bones grow faster than tendons. If a child is old enough to wear a necklace but not mature enough be left unattended with it, you may wish to place the Moonstone under his clothing once a day for 10 to 30 minutes while he or she participates in a supervised physical activity. During that time, the child can use gross and then fine motor movements to stimulate the supraphysical aura's uptake of Moonstone energy and maximize its effectiveness. The necklace should be removed after the exercise. If your child is old enough to wear a necklace safely without supervision, he or she can simply wear the Moonstone necklace. Couples and Moonstone Moonstone's unusual ability to affect a child who is in close contact with a parent wearing it also applies to couples. If one partner wears the necklace, the other will pick up the Moonstone energy, as long the two are in close proximity, such as when they are sitting or sleeping next to each other. Time Guidelines Moonstone can be worn continuously. However, it is always wise to be sensitive to your body's responses. If you start to feel a headache or significant discomfort, take the necklace off for a while. Then allow your body time to adjust to the changes initiated by the gems by wearing them for only an hour or two a day. Gradually increase this time until you can comfortably wear the gems for as long and often as you wish. Care and Cleansing of Moonstone To maintain their effectiveness, therapeutic gemstones need regular care. As the gems help us release energetic impurities, some of these energies cling to the gems' surface and inhibit their ability to work at their peak capacity. A simple energetic cleansing will clear these energies and restore the gems to their naturally vibrant state. Cleanse Moonstone daily with some mild soap under running water. Use a clay bath two or three times a week. Note that the clay bath method is not appropriate for cleansing all gemstones. Moonstone's shimmer is best seen in sunlight, and holding it outside in the sunshine for a short time to enjoy its beauty will do it no harm. Nor will wearing Moonstone in the sun harm it, since your aura will naturally protect the gems from the sun's radiation. However, cleansing Moonstone in sunlight is not recommended, because the sun's dehydrating energy would essentially evaporate the energy that Moonstone emits and that collects around the gems. More significantly, unprotected Moonstone tends to absorb the sun's radiation, which would then be released into your body and aura if you wore the gems afterward. Your supraphysical aura cannot protect your body from this phenomenon, as it does from direct sunlight. To avoid this, if your Moonstone has been exposed to sunlight for a few minutes, use a clay bath to cleanse it before wearing it again. If it has been exposed for a longer time and feels depleted, give it a clay bath and then regenerate it by placing it outside on the ground under dense foliage or an overhang of rocks, and cover it with a cloth to protect it further from the sunshine. You can also use the following methods to cleanse your Moonstone necklace. Learn more about these methods here. Plant Rejuvenation: 2 - 3 times a week, wrap the necklace around the base of a healthy houseplant or lay the necklace in its branches. Salt Bed: 2 - 3 times a week, lay the gems in a half-inch of salt for at least an hour or overnight. Place a thin natural-fiber cloth between the salt and the gems. When Your Necklace First Arrives When you put on a new necklace or one you haven't worn for a while, bring it into your aura with consciousness and a clear intent. We call this \"practicing presence.\" By opening yourself to the gems' energies and consciously cooperating with the process of change, you can greatly enhance the gemstones' benefits.
