Chiropractic is the study of how the spine and nervous system are related to health and disease. It includes the study of anatomy, physiology, pathology, neurology, biomechanics, kinesiology and clinical skills. The first thing to know about chiropractic care is that it's a form of healthcare that uses spinal adjustments to correct the alignment of the spine, which has an effect on other parts of the body. Problems in the spine can affect other areas of the body and cause pain and discomfort. This is why we focus on treating your spine, which affects your nervous system. With chiropractic care, it is possible to address headaches, neck pain, back pain, joint or muscle aches or pains and numbness in the extremities, sciatica, insomnia, and many other conditions without medication or surgery. If you suffer from any kind of pain or discomfort, schedule an appointment today. "}
