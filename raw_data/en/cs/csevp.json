You have been a driving force in the state of Maine as you have been involved and overseen the Calais and Jackman Border Patrol Stations as wellas the upcoming Border Patrol Station in Van Buren. I have recently toured theCalais station and saw some of the construction challenges such as ruggedterrain and subzero temperatures that you encountered for that facility. It is atestament to your ingenuity. Your work ethic since you came to the USACE has been duly noted as \"above exceptional.\" On behalf of the people of the state of Maine, thank youfor your expertise and willingness to go the extra mile to keep the projects onbudget, completed on time and satisfying your customers.

The In Lieu Fee (ILF) program was implemented by aMemorandum of Under-standing (MOU) be-tween the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers,Mass., signed on June 4. In-Lieu Fee mitiga- tion will occur in circum-stances where a permit-tee is required to com-pensate for the functionsand values of EssentialFish Habitat lost as a re-sult of the Corps authori-zation to conduct work inwaters of the UnitedStates after all efforts aremade to avoid and mini-mize impacts. Recipients of permits orauthorizations for projects in the Com-monwealth of Massachusetts may beeligible to use the ILF program to sat-isfy mitigation requirements of theCorps' Massachusetts ProgrammaticGeneral Permit (MA PGP). \"The In-Lieu Fee is an option avail- able to the applicant where projectspecific mitigation is not available or isnot expected to be successful,\" saidCol. Curtis Thalken, the Corps' NewEngland District Commander. \"Use program for specific projects iscontingent on Corps approval.\" \"We greatly appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineersto work with us on this memorandum ofunderstanding and look forward toworking with the Army Corps to imple-ment this program for the benefit of ourmarine resources,\" said Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game Com-missioner Mary Griffin. \"We feel thatthe in-lieu fee program will greatlybenefit marine habitat as well as sim-plify the permitting process for projectproponents in many instances.\" \"This agreement is a very impor- tant way to improve coordination ofocean activity and will help enhance the marine environment,\" said Massa- chusetts Division of Marine FisheriesDirector Paul Diodati. \"While avoidingand minimizing changes to the environ-ment remain major objectives of envi-ronmental organizations, the ILF pro-gram will contribute to restoration ofproductive habitats when less-produc-tive areas are altered.\" The ILF program will collect fees which will be deposited in DMF's Ex-pendable Trust and which will be usedfor the restoration, creation, enhance-ment, and preservation of EFH re-sources within the waters of Massa-chusetts. The program will provide compen- sation for lost EFH functions and val-ues that result from activities autho-rized under the MA PGP. The DMF isan experienced administrator of com-pensatory mitigation projects. Most re- cently, the Division implemented a num-ber of these projects with mitigationfunds associated with the constructionof the 29-mile \"Hubline\" natural gaspipeline in Massachusetts Bay. Funds deposited into DMF Expend- able Trust could be used for effortssuch as eelgrass restoration to provideimportant shallow water habitat to venile and in-habit beds wouldserve partial for anadromous fish such as American shad, alewife,blue-black herring and rainbow smelt. Under the ILF, appropriate mitiga- tion projects will be recommended tothe Corps for approval by a SteeringCommittee chaired by DMF. T h efee in-lieu of project-specific mitigationwill be determined by the Corps ofEngineers in consultation with the Steer-ing Committee and appropriate Federaland state agencies. The permit willstate the amount of the fee to be paidbefore the permit is valid. Oversight ofthe ILF program will be the responsibil-ity of the Corps of Engineers and DMF.The MOU can be reviewed online atthe Corps website http://www.nae.usace.army.mil.

Curtis Thalken, New England District Commander.\"The Corps has partnered with federal, state, and localagencies and non-governmental organizations to help restore23 acres of salt pond and salt marsh habitat in the wildlifesanctuary at Town Pond.\" Town Pond is located between Mount Hope Bay and Route 24, less than two miles south of the highway'sSakonnet River crossing in the town of Portsmouth. Theproject site is located at the northern end of AquidneckIsland. The purpose of the project was to restore estuarine habitat, salt marsh and associated values to fish and wildlife. Town Pond was a tidally influenced salt pond and salt marsh prior to a Corps navigation improvement projectplacing dredged material. Filling the pond with dredgedmaterial increased its elevation above that of regular tidalflooding converting it to a lower value, non-tidal habitat. Theproject partners recognized the potential value of the site and joined in an effort to restore the marsh using a Corps programto modify projects to improve the environment. \"The Town Pond Environmental Restoration project has been a true collaborative effort, with DEM and the ArmyCorps of Engineers working together with many partners toassure its success,\" noted Department of EnvironmentalManagement Director W. Michael Sullivan, Ph.D. \"Therestored salt pond supplements and enhances the productiv-ity and ecological value of the area by providing habitat forcoastal fish and wildlife such as shellfish, flounder and otherfinfish, herons, egrets, and waterfowl. With this project, wehave been able to restore a significant part of AquidneckIsland's natural heritage.\" Project partners also include the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Roger Williams University, the AquidneckLand Trust, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation,the Corporate Wetlands Restoration Partnership, DucksUnlimited, the town of Portsmouth and the Narragansett BayEstuary Program. Site work began in September 2005. To accomplish the restoration, the dredged material placed in the 1950's had tobe excavated to elevations that would support about half salt Federal, state and local officials marked the completion of the Town Pond Environmental Restoration Project in a ceremony on June 16 in the town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island.Federal, state officials mark completion of Town PondEnvironmental Restoration Project in Portsmouth by Timothy Dugan, Public Affairs Contractors work to get water flowing at the Town Pond Restoration Project in 2007.Photo by Dave LarsenYANKEE ENGINEER July 200811 marsh and half mudflat and salt pond.There will be about 2.5 acres of perma-nent open water. A weir with a topelevation of -0.2 feet NGVD will main-tain permanent open water depths be-tween 1.8 and 2.9 feet. An estimated 125,000 cubic yards of existing dredged material has beenexcavated to restore tidal connectionbetween Town Pond and Mount HopeBay. Over time, the interior marsh willbe transformed from a lower valuebrackish habitat to a high value salt pondand salt marsh habitat. A berm was constructed to sepa- rate Founder's Brook which runs alongthe west side of the site from the re-stored salt pond. A new 42-inch diam-eter culvert with a flap gate has replacedthe antiquated culvert at the end of thebrook located southwest of the railroadbridge. A concrete weir 36 feet long was installed to regulate a permanent poolwhere the entrance channel meets theinterior marsh. The channel connectingTown Pond to Mount Hope Bay hasbeen partially relocated. Elevated material not used to con- struct the berm was placed on site on theeast side of the marsh extending fromthe edge of the access road across theedge of the Montaup Country Club.This area is being planted with coastalgrasses. Salt water was returned to the pond on Sept. 21, 2007 for the first time in 50years when the final cut was made toconnect the pond to Mount Hope Bay.Tidal flows are now being restored tothis important salt pond for the first timein over 50 years, thereby improving thewater quality, providing habitat, publicaccess, and eliminating nuisance mos-quito breeding areas. The work was accomplished by Northern Construction Service, LLC ,of Palmer, Mass., at a cost of $4.6million. The restored salt pond is nowproviding habitat for coastal fish andwildlife, such as shellfish, flounder andother finfish, herons, egrets, and water-fowl, and restoring the productivity andecological value of the area. Buffumville Lake was closed for a little over two weeks. Cyanobacteria Bloom temporarily closesBuffumville Lake Park On June 3, a water sample col- lected from the beach early in the dayat Buffumville Lake was examinedand the presence of cyanobacteriawas verified. This is the same bacte-ria that closed the lake at the end oflast summer. The park was closedand no water contact was advised toinclude pets. The boat ramp remainedopen and fishing was permitted. Thelake was reopened on June 17. Toxic Algal Bloom. Cyanobacteria, formerly known as\"blue-green algae,\" cyanobacterianaturally occur England wa-ters. Some species, includingMicrocystis and Anabaena, producetoxins in their cells, and these toxinscan be released after the cells die. Cyanobacteria become a public- health concern when they reachbloom conditions, but toxin levels maybe low even during a clearly visiblebloom. Health effects fromcyanobacteria toxins are mainly fromskin irritation and rashes. More seri-ous health effects can come fromswallowing the water, but accidentalswallowing of water during swim-ming is usually very limited, and con-firmed deaths from cyanobacteriatoxins are mostly limited to dogs,which will actually drink the water. Cyanobacteria toxins can be le-thal to fish; however, the blooms can also kill fish by depleting dissolvedoxygen (DO) levels and causing largediurnal fluctuations in pH. Conse-quently, the finding of dead fish duringbloom conditions is a cause for con-cern, but not proof of the presence oftoxins at levels harmful to humans. The widespread occurrence of blooms in 2007 indicates a widespreadcause, most likely the spring stormsthat washed nutrients into the lakesfollowed by the unusually dry summerthat resulted in warm water with mini-mal flushing. While it is hoped that thedry conditions seen in 2007 will notreoccur soon, the aging of our reser-voirs is likely making them more sus-ceptible to future blooms. Natural aging in lakes causes them to fill in and become marshes, mead-ows, and ultimately forests, but reser-voirs tend to age more quickly due tothe higher ratio of drainage area tolake surface. Development in the wa-tershed accelerates this process byadding more sediment to the streamsand more nutrients in these sediments. The early presence of a bloom may indicate some left over bacteriafrom last summer and coupled withthe high waters again this spring maylead to more bloom throughout thesummer.

Theevent to observe the AsianAmerican/Pacific IslanderMonth took place in the ConcordPark Theatre on June 4. Christina Noonan, Lic.Ac., M.Ac, the Outreach Coordina-tor for the New England Schoolof Acupuncture, served as theevent's keynote speaker. Col. Curtis Thalken, New England District Commander,welcomed the audience andtalked about the history of Chi-nese immigrants coming toAmerica, the contributions theyhave made to the country thathave transcended time and arestill significant today, and theirfight for equality. \"Chinese Americans fought for not only their rights, but also for theirdignity and self respect,\" he said. Peter Hugh, the Asian American/ Pacific Islander Program Manager,noted the theme this year will focus ona very interesting alternative health carepractice - Acupuncture. Using an Acupuncture model to illustrate points, a PowerPoint presenta-tion, and Col. Thalken as a volunteer todemonstrate cupping and diagnostics,Noonan gave a detailed lecture on Acu-puncture and Eastern Medicine. Top-ics included history and background,theory and philosophy, diagnosis andtreatment goals, herbal medicine, medi-cal conditions that could benefit fromacupuncture/herbal medicine treatment,medication, exercise, and nutrition. After her presentation, Col. Thalken presented Noonan with a Bunker Hillplaque for her participation in the event.A reception followed at the end of theevent. Acupuncture is an ancient practice that originated in the Chinese ShangEmpire in 1,000 B.C. It is one of theoldest and most commonly used formsof medicine in the world. The practice includes the superficial insertion andmanipulation of disposableand sterile fine stainlesssteel needles into the skinto relieve ailments.
