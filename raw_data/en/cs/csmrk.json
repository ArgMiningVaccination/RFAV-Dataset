Because it was found that pharmacists are rarely involved, majority of the responses came from nurses. It was also found that many hospitals have integrative health departments involved in overseeing the use of essential oils. 4.Future studies are needed to better understand the use of essential oils, including why essential oil programs were discontinued and non-formulary regulation. CONCLUSION We would like to thank Rite Aid for their continuous support of the CAPSLead program and to the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists (CSHP) for the opportunity to present our poster at this year's seminar. We would also like to express our gratitude to our professors, Dr. Nancy Kawahara, Dr. Farnoosh Zough, and Dr. Paul Gavaza, for their encouragement and guidance throughout our project. We would also like to thank Loma Linda University for sponsoring us to represent our school at the 2019 CAPSLead Conference. Essential oils are not FDA regulated, but have transitioned into being used in clinical settings. Limited guidelines include the American Herbal Products Association and International Standards Organization to regulate labeling, content, and purity.6 Primary issues with essential oils are their undefined safety and efficacy. Previous studies have shown that essential oils may lead to adverse effects including but not limited to the risk of developing seizures.5 Other studies have shown conflicting results such as whether or not essential oils can alleviate pain or are suited better for certain conditions.3,7 Despite these issues, many hospitals are integrating essential oil programs into their normal regimen. Possible reasons include: Widespread therapeutic use Including lowering anxiety before procedures, during pain management, for osteoporosis prevention, and treatment of bacterial infections.1,2,3,4,8 Less side effects, decreased drug interactions, and increased cost efficiency In comparison to narcotic analgesics, essential oils have less side effects and issues with dependence.3,7 By investigating hospitals' use of essential oils, we can contribute to the knowledge base of healthcare professionals in understanding different approaches to patient care.

METHODOLOGY A 25-question Web-based survey using Qualtrics\u00ae was developed to query hospital directors, pharmacists-in-charge, charge nurses, and nurses in 5 primary areas: 1)Participant information such as job title, hospital name, and location. 2)Implementation of essential oils in the hospitals: reasons for implementation, most common indications, and kinds of essential oils. 3)Policies/procedures and challenges regarding the use of essential oils 4)The roles of the pharmacy in the use of essential oils in the hospital. 5)Personal perspectives on the use of essential oils in patient care in the hospital. The survey was distributed electronically to over 100 hospitals, founded through online lists from wellness organizations and word of mouth. The survey was opened in June 2019 and data collection is currently ongoing. LIMITATIONS 1.Sample Collection: Our data does not represent the opinions of all hospitals that use essential oils because of the lack of hospitals publicizing its use, thus resulting in a small sample size. 2.Supporting Data: There is a lack of previous studies on essential oils because it is a novel subject in the healthcare community and not approved by the FDA. 3.Survey Design: Phrasing of the survey questions may have misled respondents to infer that our study was focused on supporting the use of essential oils rather than understanding the implementation of them. Figure 3: Opinions on the challenges associated with the use of essential oils at hospitals. 1) Making sure the person in charge of dispensing the essential oils is properly trained 2) Lack of education of the health care provider on the proper usage because there are no formal guidelines on the correct usage/indication 3) Bias against use 4) Having the time to implement the usage of essential oils with patient care 5) There are no challenges associated with the use of essential oils. Figure 4: Opinions on the benefits associated with the use of essential oils at hospitals. 1) Easy for the patients to use with delivery methods ex) pre-made sniffers 2) Easily accessible and an alternative to medications 3) Supporting and provides patients with comfort 4) Patches are for individual use. Since the patch is placed on the patient's gown, only the patient can smell the essential oils. Figure 1: Hospital staff responses of the indications for essential use in various hospital settings. Out of the 7 hospitals surveyed, 100% use essential oils to help patients suffering from anxiety/stress. The second most common indications were pain and nausea/vomiting (approximately 85% of the hospitals surveyed). Other indications for essential oil usage were urinary retention, headache, agitation, and insomnia.

Peppermint and Lavender oil were the most common oils reported by hospital staff of 7 hospitals (N=7), approximately 20% of the hospitals surveyed used these oils most frequently. Lemon, eucalyptus, spearmint, lemongrass, and sandalwood were the least utilized with 3% of the hospitals surveyed administering these oils. Mandarin and ginger oil were used by 10% of the hospitals, and frankincense and tea tree oil were used by 7% of the hospitals.

This displays that the use of essential oils is not uniform, possibly due to lack of regulation such as not being on the hospital formulary. 3.Hospitals that reported using essential oils for more than 10 years continue using them because it is a positively improving patient care. 4.Nurses are the main medical personnel that implement essential oils during patient therapy. This could be due to having the highest interaction with the patients. 5.Pharmacists were reported as not being actively involved in essential oil use in the hospitals. A reason for this could be is that essential oils are not classified as drugs. 6.Twelve different essential oils were reported being used by the various hospitals, with peppermint and lavender being the most common. 7.The most common indications to use essential oils were found to be combating anxiety/stress, nausea/vomiting, and pain. 8.The most common route of administration was inhalation, while the most common frequency of use was once weekly or as needed. 9.Hospital staff that do administer essential oils found it easy to use and comforting. 10. Hospital staff that do administer essential oils believe there is a lack of education about essential oil therapy and more training is necessary. 11. Many of the hospitals that were excluded in this study did report previous integration of essential oils. Common reasons for this included protocols being changed or the hospital itself was bought out. Future studies could be implemented to understand why essential oil programs were discontinued. 12. While a number of hospitals did not formally implement essential oils, they reported allowing the use of it on the premise by the patient's request. A future study could be done to understand the regulations on patient's own essential oil use in the hospital.
