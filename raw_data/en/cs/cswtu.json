The objective of this study was to conduct a latent class analysis characterizing pediatric practitioner HPV recommendation patterns. Methods : Pediatric practitioners of the American Academy of Pediatrics '(AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) national network completed an online survey where they were presented with 5 hypothetical vignettes of well child visits and responded to questions. Questions asked about their use of communication strategies, assessments about the adolescent patient becoming sexually active in the next 2 years for decision-making about HPV vaccine recommendation, and peer norms. Latent class analysis characterized practitioner subgroups based on their response patterns to 10 survey questions. Multinomial logistic regression examined practitioner characteristics associated with each profile. Results : Among 470 respondents, we identified three distinct practitioner HPV vaccine recommendation profiles: (1) Engagers (52%) followed national age-based guidelines, strongly recommended HPV vacci- nation, and perceived peers as strongly recommending; (2) Protocol Followers (20%) also strongly recommended HPV vaccination, but were less likely to engage families in a discussion about benefits; and (3) Ambivalent HPV Vaccine Recommenders (28%) delayed or did not recommend HPV vaccination and were more likely to use judgment about whether adolescents will become sexually active in the next two years. Practicing in a suburban setting was associated with twice the odds of being an Ambivalent Recommender relative to being an Engager (OR = 2.2; 95% CI:1.1 -4.1). Conclusions : Findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to bolster practitioner adoption of evidence-based approaches to HPV vaccine recommendation especially among Ambivalent Recommenders.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 September 2018 Revised 28 November 2018 Accepted 11 December 2018 KEYWORDS HPV vaccine; latent class analysis; vaccine hesitancy; clinician communication Background Despite the widespread availability and known benefits of the HPV vaccine, rates of vaccination remain suboptimal at 50.4% -65.9%, depending upon geographical area.1These rates lag significantly relative to those for other adolescent vaccines, including tetanus, diphtheria, acellular including not only pediatricians, but also pediatric nurses, physician assistants, and medical assistants are optimally positioned to discuss the benefits of timely HPV vaccination with parents of youth. However, how pediatric practitioners engage families in dis- cussions of HPV vaccine initiation varies considerably.25 A practitioner 's recommendation is one of the most con- sistent predictors of HPV vaccination.6-9Public health leaders and the 2012 -2013 President 's cancer panel prioritized improving healthcare practitioners 'communication as a keystrategy for increasing HPV vaccine rates.10In a national survey of parent perceptions of HPV vaccination, the most commonly cited reason for not vaccinating was the practi- tioner not having recommended the HPV vaccine (56% of parents cited this reason).11Parent reports suggest that one third of adolescent girls (36%) and more than half of adoles- cent boys (58%) do not receive a recommendation from their provider.11,12Parents expect vaccine recommendations to come from their child 's health care provider; if the HPV vaccine is not recommended explicitly, is recommended pas- sively, is recommended as different from other adolescent vaccines, or is recommended in the same conversation as questions about sexual debut,4,13any or all of these approaches can lead parents to interpret HPV vaccination as unnecessary or as stigmatizing.2,4Thus, how practitioners recommend HPV vaccination can uniquely influence parental acceptance of vaccination.14 CONTACT Suellen Hopfer shopfer@uci.edu The Department of Population Health and Disease Prevention, Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences, University of California, 653 E.

Using a methodol ogical technique called latent class analysis15(LCA), this approach categorizes distinct pediatric practitioner subgroups based on their survey responses regarding how they recommend the HPV vaccine, perceived peer norms, and judgments about when adole scents will become sexually active. This latent class or person -oriented approach, unlike tradi- tional multivariate models, involves studying individuals as a whole on the basis of their response patterns across a number of individual characteristics relev ant for a particular phenomenon (e.g., practitioner recommendation patterns). Results Respondent characteristics Respondents (n = 470) ranged in age from 29 to 79 years (mean = 53 years), and the majority were female and Caucasian (see Table 1 ). Respondents practiced in nearly all US States (N = 47). The respondent characteristics are con- sistent with those of participants from recent surveys of pri- mary care pediatricians from the general AAP membership.16 PROS members are predominantly primary care pediatricians. We do not know the composition of the analytic sample with regards to practitioner type (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant), since this question was not included in the anonymous survey. Pediatric practitioner HPV vaccine recommendation profiles Latent class analysis yielded three distinct practitioner vaccine recommendation patterns based on responses to use of various communication strategies, judgement about whether adolescent patients will become sexually active in the next two years, and peer norms after reading hypothetical medical case scenarios (seeTable 2 ). We classified more than half of the respondents (52%) as \"Engagers \"because they reported being highly engaged with families around HPV vaccination. Engagers had highresponse probabilities for strongly recommending HPV vaccine initiation to parents of youth ( = .88), recommending vaccination at today 's visit ( = .97), and recommending HPV vaccination at the same time as other adolescent vaccines ( = .93). This subgroup of practitioners, more than any other, was inclined to describe the following benefits when talking to parents about HPV vaccination: cancer protection ( = .99), genital wart protection ( = .76), and a stronger antibody response when vaccinating at a younger age (= .78), and were more likely to do so using a positive tone (= .89). Engagers perceived peer practitioners as also strongly recommending HPV vaccination to parents of youth ( =. 6 1 ) ,a n d were less likely to use a risk-based approach (e.g., assessing whether the patient will become sexually active in the next two y e a r st od e c i d ew h e nt or e c o m m e n dH P Vv a c c i n a t i o n )( =. 4 9 ) . We classified a second group of practitioners as \"Protocol Followers \", representing the 20% of respondents who reported being highly likely to strongly recommend HPV vaccine initiation to parents of youth ( = .93), at today 's visit ( = .99), and recommending HPV vaccination at the same time as other ado- lescent vaccines ( = .72). However, practitioners of this subgroup were less likely to discuss the benefits of vaccination with parents such as cancer protection ( = .48), genital wart protection (= .10), or emphasizing a stronger antibody response ( = .09). Protocol Followers perceived peers as strongly recommending HPV vaccination to parents of youth ( = .67), and were much less likely to use a sexual maturity judgment of the adolescent patient to determine when to recommend HPV vaccination (= .45). Overall, Protocol Fo llowers showed adherence to national age-based vaccine recommendation guidelines for prac- titioners, but were less likely to engage families in conversations about HPV vaccine benefits. We describe a third practitioner subgroup, which included over one fourth of respondents (28%) as \"Ambivalent Recommenders. \" This subgroup reported a very low probability of strongly recom- mending HPV vaccine initiation or recommend at all to parents of youth ( = .02). In contrast to Engagers and Protocol Followers, Ambivalent Recommenders were likely to report using judgment about whether the adolescent patie nt will become sexually active in the next two years to decide when to recommend HPV vaccinationTable 1.

Ambivalent recommenders were less likely to recom- mend all 3 adolescent vaccines at the same time and in the same way ( = .61 as compared to .93 and .72 for Engagers and Protocol Followers, respectively) and were also less likely to emphasize the importance of vaccinating against HPV the same day they recom- mended it ( = .63 as compared to .99 and .97 for Engagers and Protocol Followers, respectively). Ambivalent Vaccine Recommenders did not perceive peer practitioners as prioritizing HPV vaccination ( = .16) and did not perceive their peers as strongly recommending HPV vaccine initiation to parents of youth ( = .15). Practitioner recommendation profile characteristics Table 3 d escribes the demographics, practice characteristics, and vaccine attitudes of each the three practitioner subgroups. Four characteristics significantly differed across groups -ranking of the 3 adolescent vaccines, recommending HPV vaccination at mild, non-febrile sick visits, and two practice characteristics. Ambivalent Recommenders were significantly less likely to rank HPV vaccination as the most important relative to the other two adolescent vaccines, and, ambivalent recommenders were less likely to recommend HPV vaccination during mild, non-febrile sick child visits in comparison with the other practi- tioner subgroups. With respect to practice characteristic differ- ences, Ambivalent Recommenders were significantly less likely to report seeing many (>25%) Medicaid patients, and were more likely to practice in suburban locations. Predictors of practitioner recommendation class membership To further describe the 3-class model of HPV recommenda- tion profiles, we entered practitioner demographics and prac- tice level characteristics into a multinomial logistic regression model. As reported in Table 4 , relative to the Engager profile(the reference group), Protocol Followers had less than half the odds of being Caucasian and more than three times the odds of seeing >25% Medicaid patients. Ambivalent Vaccine Recommenders had twice the odds of practicing in a suburban setting relative to Engagers. Discussion Systematic reviews4,18and qualitative studies5,19,20have pointed to the uniquely influential role that pediatric practitioners play in recommending HPV vaccination to parents of youth. Given the growing number of parents hesitan t to vaccinate their children who likely turn to practitioners for reassurance,21,22it is important to characterize practitioners 'communication about HPV vaccina- tion. Previous research characterizing the quality of practitioner communication about vaccination has primarily been conducted using a variable centered approach with the implicit assumption of an underlying \"average \"practitioner.15,23-25By contrast, the latent class approach used in this study highlights the uniqueness of practitioner communication pa tterns, uncovering unique simi- larities within subgroups and unique differences between them, reflecting a person- rather than a variable-centered approach.15,26 We found that both Engagers and Protocol Followers -com- prising a majority of respondents in our sample (72%) -recom- mended the HPV vaccine in ways that were consistent with age-based national guidelines.27However, Protocol Followers were less likely to discuss the specific benefits of timely HPV vaccination with parents compared to Engagers. Although announcing vaccines that are due w ithout extensive conversation may be effective in promoting vaccination with some parents,14,28,29this subgroup of practitioners employed fewer stra- tegies to address parental vaccine hesitancy. This speaks to what Dempsey and colleagues report in a recent review that practi- tioners 'brief strong endorsements may work better with parents already on board while for reluctant parents motivationalTable 3.

HOPFER ET AL.interviewing may more effectively address parent concerns and questions.29 Ambivalent HPV Vaccine Recommenders (28% of our sample) reported approaches to HPV vaccination that contradict national guidelines.27,30Two prior studies identified 27% and 65% of pediatricians respectively who did not strongly recommend HPV vaccine initiation to parents of youth.3,28Our results fall in the lower end of this range. Extending the work of prior studies, our findings characterize the approa ches of Ambivalent HPV Vaccine Recommenders. Notably, Ambivalent Recommenders incorpo- rated judgements about when youth will become sexually active and, correspondingly, the youth 's perceived risk of acquiring HPV into their decision regarding va ccine recommendation. This strat- egy ignores evidence that sexual debut is difficult to predict.31 Furthermore, it ignores calls to end the era of HPV exceptionalism and to adopt the practice of recommending all adolescent vaccines the same way and at the same time.32 Additional characteristics that distinguished Ambivalent Recommenders is they perceived peer practitioners as not follow- ing national age-based recommendations and not viewing the importance of HPV vaccine as equivalent to other adolescent vaccines. Peer norms play an underappreciated role in bringing about changes in recommended practice guidelines especially in today 's predominantly group practice structures. The bee-in-the- bonnet metaphor (agitated; to kee p talking about something again and again because you think it 's important) describes how practice behavior is most likely to change when a physician, nurse, or practice manager with a special interest in a particular issue, procedure, or disease cha mpions practice change.33Physician champions have been discussed in the literature as assuming key roles in nationwide quality improvement initiatives including HPV vaccination.34Our results support the importance of target- ing peer practice norms as part of communication training. The overall recommendation patterns of Ambivalent Recommenders present a potential barrier to improving HPV vaccination rates, and also highlight behaviors that might be targeted in future studies. In this study, we identified not only practitioner but practice level characteristics that could be targeted for practitioner train- ings. Practicing in a suburban office predicted a two-fold higher odds of Ambivalent Recommender p ractice patterns. This finding is striking in light of data showing differences in HPV vaccine uptake by urbanicity. An Ohio study35and the NIS Teen 2016 report1have shown that suburban practitioners are less likely to routinely and strongly recommend HPV vaccine initiation to parents of youth. Although we were not able to correlatepractitioner practice profiles wi th vaccine receipt in this study, NIS Teen 2016 reports have indicated HPV vaccination disparities by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status.1Adolescent vaccine c o v e r a g ea m o n gt h o s ew h ol i v eo u t s i d eo fM S Ac e n t r a lc i t i e si s 16 percentage points lower than those who live in MSA central cities, with 5 -8% point vaccination decreases observed in MSA non-central city areas that reflect suburban practice settings. Access to vaccination has not been able to account for these MSA status discrepancies. Future studies may want to investigate whether hesitant parents are more prevalent in areas frequenting suburban practices. Consistent with previous research,18,36Ambivalent Recommenders were less likely to recommend HPV vaccine initiation at mild, non-febrile sick visits relative to Engagers and Protocol Followers. Given that adolescents sometimes forgo preventive care and that vaccination at all visits is asso- ciated with much higher rates,4this approach also decreases the likelihood that adolescents will be vaccinated prior to HPV exposure. Limitations Our study had several limitations. First, our latent class analysis was based on responses to hypothetical scenarios requiring respondents to make judgements about common practice scenar- ios, rather than observed medical encounters. However, the approach of using hypothetical case scenarios was used as a strategy to overcome the potential for social desirability bias (a tendency for practitioners to underreport how they actually prac- tice or to change their practice when observed in real medical setting encounters). A second limitation was that the survey was conducted among pediatric practitioners belonging to a research network and had a modest response rate. We compared the characteristics of our PROS survey respondents to those reported in a recent publication of US American Academy of Pediatrics members 'attitudes regarding sun protection counseling16and the practitioner characteristics were similar. Although the practitioner characteristics were similar, it is possible that the prevalence of the identified recommendation pro files might be different among a general population of pediatric practitioners. Nevertheless, the PROS practice-based research net work represents practitioners from virtually all US states, and the groups of practitioners identi- fied are likely to broadly reflect pediatric health care providers. Finally, practitioner HPV vaccine recommendation profiles were not linked with vaccination rates, which is a focus for future work.Table 4.

Practitioner vaccine recommendation ambivalence together with risk-based approaches may in part contribute to parental hesitancy. Equally, strong, consistent vaccine recommendation (Engagers and Protocol Followers) may in part contribute to HPV vaccine acceptance.29While moving toward having all pediatric practi- tioners make HPV vaccine recommendations routinely and con- sistently, simply making a recommendation is not sufficient.29The specific language the provider uses, the tone, the timeliness and whether they treat HPV vaccination in the same way as other adolescent vaccines to communicate recommendations can have major effects on parents 'vaccine attitudes and whether they will have their children vaccinated. Ou r study demonstrated that while a majority of practitioners follow age-based vaccine recommenda- tion guidelines, a sizable minority of practitioners, over 25%, did not routinely and strongly recommend HPV vaccination to par- ents of youth (11 -12 year olds). The recommendation pattern among this subgroup of pediatricians was characterized by using judgement about when the patient was becoming sexually active to decide when to recommend HPV va ccination. To bolster vaccina- tion rates, our results indicate that future studies should test i n t e r v e n t i o n st oa d d r e s su s eo fe f f e c t i v eH P Vv a c c i n er e c o m m e n - dation strategies among clinicians who may be Ambivalent R e c o m m e n d e r sa si d e n t i f i e di nt h i s study. Furthermore, our find- ings suggest that suburban pediatric offices in particular may benefit from practitioner traini ng in optimal HPV vaccine recom- mendation practices. Materials and methods Participants & survey design Members of the American Academy of Pediatrics '(AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) national prac- tice-based research network were asked to complete an online, anonymous survey in the Spring of 2016. The survey was designed to better understand how pediatric practitioners communicate with parents of adolescents about HPV vacci- nation. Survey respondents read 5 hypothetical vignettes describing well-child visits with varying parent interactions. Participants responded to each vignette answering 10 questions.1The author team of pediatricians and communica- tion experts drafted the clinical vignette case scenarios based on clinical experience and pilot tested the vignettes with 10 pediatricians asking for qualitative feedback. An example vignette describing parental hesitancy reads as follows: \"Amother brings in her 11-year-old son for a health mainte- nance visit. He has a normal exam. You discuss preventive health measures, including the recommended vaccines for his age group: Tdap, MCV4, and HPV. The mother is hesitant for her son to get vaccinated against HPV. \"Of these vignettes, the first was specifically focused on how practitioners respond to vaccine hesitant parents. Others described scenarios that var- ied by child age, child gender, child ethnicity, and the number of shots that were due. Measures Practitioners responded to ten questions after reading each vignette. The ten questions asked about 3 domains theorized to be relevant for practitioner communication about HPV vaccination: 7 communication strategies, 2 peer practice norm questions, and 1 question about the use of whether the practitioner makes judgments about a patient 's sexual maturity in the next two years when discussing HPV vaccine recommendation (see Table 5 for measures). Inclusion of these survey questions in the study were guided by a practitioner HPV vaccine communication model developed by the team of authors whose expertise is grounded in pedia- tric practice and communication theory. The model empha- sizes the importance of (a) practitioner communication style,3,14,39(b) peer norms,13,40,41and (c) whether practi- tioners base vaccine recommendation in part on judgement of a patient 's sexual maturity in the next two years (a risk- based approach).42The survey was sent to 1,586 PROS mem- bers, of which 488 responded (31%). Of these, 7 declined to participate and 11 did not provide well child care to 11-12 year olds, leaving a total of 470 respondents with analyzable data. The human subjects review board at the University of California, Irvine and the American Academy of Pediatrics approved the study. Statistical analysis IBM SPSS (version 24, Armonk, NY) was used to conduct descriptive analyses of pediatric practitioner demographics. Latent class analyses (LCA) were used to identify subgroups (or \"classes \") of practitioners characterized by similar approaches to HPV vaccine recommendation. PROC LCA SAS 9.415,17,43software (Cary, NC) was used to conduct the analyses. Ten measures from the survey were used to conduct LCA analyses (see Table 5 ). To identify the number of vaccine recom- mendation profiles that fit the structure of the data best, we ran two, three, four, five, and six-class models.2Optimal number of vaccine recommendation classes were determined by examining (1) goodness of fit indices, where lower values reflect a more optimal model fit, and, (2) patterns of rho ( )e s t i m a t e s or item response probabilities that yielded clinically meaningful profiles.15The item response probabilities ranged between 0 and 1 and represent the probability of a yes response to each of the survey items. The three-class model was identified as having the best fit based on goodness of fit indices as well as interpretability, meaningfulness of the resulting practitioner profiles. Practitioner and practice characteristics were subsequently included into the latent class model to investigate predictors of1780 S. HOPFER ET AL.latent class membership. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess whether practitioner an d practice characteristics pre- dicted latent class membership.44Four practitioner characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, number of years in practice) and four practice characteristics (seeing >25% of Medicaid patients, practi- cing in a Centers of Disease Control (CDC) designated disparity state, reporting financial barriers to stocking the HPV vaccine, primary practice setting) were entered individually first, and sub- sequently, sequentially added to the model. P-values <.05 were considered significant. Notes 1.Vignette descriptions are available upon request to corresponding author. 2.Goodness of fit indices are available upon request.
