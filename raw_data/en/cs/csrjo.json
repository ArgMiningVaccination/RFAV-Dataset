INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL NEWS GROUPSkin & Allergy News\u00ae2MCosp3_4_7Rev.qxd 1/19/2006 5:06 PM Page 34 Roundup on Cosmetic Dermatology Winter 2006he field of cosmetic dermatology con- tinues to explore, expand, and definethe clinical utility of many commonlyused tools, including light-emitting diode (LED) therapy, fillers, and botulinum toxin. In the United States, LED therapy traditionally has consisted entirely of yellow light. The light hasbeen used as an adjunct to laser therapy and lighttherapy for treatment of a variety of conditions. Re-cently, other colors of LED therapy have becomeavailable, including blue, red, andnear-infrared. \"The impact of LED therapy on the skin is related to its effect on basic cel-lular structures,\" said David J. Gold-berg, M.D., J.D., Clinical Professor ofDermatology and Director of LaserResearch and Mohs Surgery at MountSinai School of Medicine in New YorkCity. \"Each color of LED light pene-trates to a different depth in the skinand has a potentially different effect ondifferent portions of the cell structure.Thus, it should come as no surprise that differentLED therapies are optimally used for different ap-plications. Sometimes, the best approach is to usemore than one LED therapy for the same patient.\" The role of LED therapy has yet to be fully de- fined, Dr. Goldberg added, but the modality'spopularity results from its ease of use, the abilityto use it on people with all ethnic skin colors, andthe lack of pain resulting from treatment. Recently Dr. Goldberg spearheaded a multicen- ter United States/United Kingdom study that ex-plored the roles of combining 633-nm and 830-nmLED therapy for the treatment of early photoagedskin: \"The combined treatment led to overall im-provement in the quality of skin, with electron mi-croscopic ultrastructural changes suggesting the for-mation of new collagen after treatment.\"Traditionally, collagen fillers have been the treat-ment of choice, but over the past few years newerfillers have entered the market to expand treatmentoptions. The newer fillers consist of hyaluronic acid,poly (L-lactic acids), and calcium hydroxyapatite. Each of the fillers has advantages and disadvantages,and the scope of application for individual productshas yet to be defined. In some cases, different typesof fillers are used together to achieve desired results. \"The era of fillers is just beginning in the United States,\" said Dr. Goldberg. \"If you look at Europe,many more short-acting, intermediate-acting, andlong-acting fillers are available than in the UnitedStates.\" Over the next several years, the United States can expect to see a variety of hyaluron-ic fillers. Some will be shorter-actingand others will last longer than cur-rently available agents. Development of new fillers contin- ues, and clinical options in the UnitedStates should continue to evolve in thefuture, added Dr. Goldberg. The role of botulinum toxin in cos- metic dermatology in the United Statescontinues to expand. At present, thematerial is used to soften wrinklesaround the forehead, eyes (crow's feet), lower eyelids, lip, chin, and neck. Both botulinumtoxin A and botulinum toxin B have been used inthe United States, but botulinum toxin B is nolonger readily available for cosmetic purposes, leav-ing cosmetic dermatologists with the Botox brandof botulinum toxin type A (Allergan Inc.). Thatcould change in the future. \"Currently, US Food and Drug Administration sponsored studies are ongoing, involving the use oftwo newer types of botulinum toxin A,\" said Dr.Goldberg. \"These studies will lead to newer and po-tentially different botulinum toxins that can be of-fered to our patients.\" I Dr. Goldberg has received funding for clinical grants from Photo Therapeutics, Cynosure, Inc., NeocutisSwiss Technology, Inamed Corporation, Thermage,Inc., and Cutera Inc.

BEFORE USING PRODUCT, READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMA- TION THOROUGHLY. DEVICE DESCRIPTION SCULPTRA is an injectable implant that contains microparti- cles of poly-L-lactic acid, a biodegradable, from the alpha-hydroxy-acid family. SCULPTRA is reconstituted prior to use by the addition of Sterile Waterfor Injection, USP (SWFI) to form a sterile non-pyrogenicsuspension. INTENDED USE / INDICATIONS SCULPTRA is intended for restoration and/or correction of the signs of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy) in people with humanimmunodeficiency virus. CONTRAINDICATIONS SCULPTRA should not be used in any person who has hyper- sensitivity to any of the components of the product. WARNINGS Use of SCULPTRA in any person with active skin inflammation or infection in or near the treatment area should be deferreduntil the inflammatory or infectious process has been con-trolled. Do not overcorrect (overfill) a contour deficiency because the depression should gradually improve within several weeks as the treatment effect of SCULPTRA occurs (see IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ). Injection procedure reactions to SCULPTRA have been observed consisting mainly of hematoma, bruising, edema,discomfort, inflammation, and erythema. The most commondevice related adverse effect was the delayed occurrence ofsubcutaneous papules, which were confined to the injectionsite and were typically palpable, asymptomatic and non-visible. Refer to ADVERSE EVENTS for details. Special care should be taken to avoid injection into the blood vessels. An introduction into the vasculature may occlude thevessels and could cause infarction or embolism. PRECAUTIONS SCULPTRA should only be used by health care providers with expertise in the correction of volume deficiencies in patients with human immunodeficiency virus after fully familiarizingthemselves with the product, the product educational materi-als, and the entire package insert. SCULPTRA vials are for single patient use only. Do not reuse or resterilize the vial. Do not use if package or vial is opened ordamaged. Long-term safety and effectiveness of SCULPTRA beyond two years have not been investigated. Dermik \u00aeis conducting a post approval study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness ofSCULPTRA beyond two years. SCULPTRA should be used in the deep dermis or subcuta- neous layer. Avoid superficial injections. Special care must betaken when using SCULPTRA in areas of thin skin. Refer to PATIENT TREATMENT for instructions regarding injection tech- niques. Safety and effectiveness of treatment in the periorbital area have not been established. As with all transcutaneous procedures, SCULPTRA injection carries a risk of infection. Standard precautions associated with injectable materials should be followed. As with all injections, patients treated with anti-coagulants may run the risk of a hematoma or localized bleeding at the injec- tion site. Universal precautions must be observed when there is a potential for contact with patient body fluids. The injection ses-sion must be conducted with aseptic technique. After use, treatment syringes and needles may be potential biohazards. Handle accordingly and dispose of in accordancewith accepted medical practice and applicable local, state andfederal requirements. The safety of SCULPTRA for use during pregnancy, in breast- feeding females or in patients under 18 years has not beenestablished. No studies of interactions of SCULPTRA with drugs or other substances or implants have been made. The safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials of SCULPTRA in non-Caucasians and women with human immunodeficiency virus are limited. Dermik \u00aewill conduct a post approval study in non-Caucasians and women withhuman immunodeficiency virus. The safety of using SCULPTRA in patients with increased sus- ceptibility to hypertrophic scarring hasnot been studied. Dermik \u00aewill conduct a post approval study to determine the likelihood of keloid formation and hyper-trophic scars in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving SCULPTRA injections. The patient should be informed that he or she should minimize exposure of the treatment area to excessive sun and UV lampexposure until any initial swelling and redness has resolved. ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse event data from four clinical studies that included 277 patients are summarized in Tables 1 & 2 below. TABLE 1: NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED IN CLINICAL STUDIES WITH TWO-YEAR FOLLOW-UP *Subcutaneous papules refer to lesions of 5 mm or less, typically palpable, asymptomatic and non-visible. **Onset data available from VEGA study only. Duration not noted for subcutaneous papules because most were ongoing at study completion. *** Safety data were collected post hoc for 27 of the patients at approximately two years from study start. TABLE 2: NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED IN CLINICAL STUDIES WITH ONE-YEAR FOLLOW-UP The duration of the adverse events in Table 2 was not collected. The most common device related adverse effect was the delayed occurrence of subcutaneous papules, which were confined tothe injection site and were typically palpable, asymptomatic, andnon-visible. The study protocols did not include evaluation of treatment for subcutaneous papules, therefore, no information is available on how the papules were treated. In the VEGA study,the average onset of subcutaneous papules was 7 months afterinitial injection (range 0.3 - 25 months). Subcutaneous papules resolved spontaneously in 6/26 patients (24%) during the study. No information of onset and duration of papules is availablefrom the Chelsea & Westminster study. Treatment related adverse events, not included in Table 1 & 2, observed in clinical studies with a frequency of less than 5%were: injection site tenderness, injection site lesion, injection site bleeding, injection site induration, injection site infection and fever.The following adverse events, which were not observed in the clinical studies, were detected from post-marketing surveillanceoutside of the US and literature reports: visible nodules with or without inflammation or dyspigmentation, malaise, injection site abscess, allergic reaction, injection site atrophy, Quincke'sedema, injection site fat atrophy, photosensitive reaction,fatigue, injection site granuloma, hypersensitivity reaction, skin rash, skin roughness, lack of effectiveness, injection site reac-tion, hypertrophy of skin, hair breakage, colitis not otherwise specified, brittle nails, application site discharge, angioedema,aching joints, ectropion, and telangiectasias. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS Post-treatment care. Immediately following an injection session with SCULPTRA , redness, swelling, and/or bruising may be noted in the treatment area. Refer to ADVERSE EVENTS for details. After the injection session, an ice pack (avoiding any direct contact of the ice with the skin) should be applied to thetreatment area in order to reduce swelling. It is important tothoroughly massage the treatment area to evenly distribute the product. The patient should periodically massage the treatmentarea for several days after the injection session to promote a natural-looking correction. T reat, W ait, Assess. During the first injection session with SCULPTRA , only a limited correction should be made. Do not overcorrect (overfill). The patient should be evaluated no sooner than two weeks after the injection session to determine if addi- tional correction is needed. The original skin depression may ini-tially reappear, but the depression should gradually improvewithin several weeks as the treatment effect of SCULPTRA occurs. The patient should be advised of the potential need for additional injection sessions at the first consultation. STORAGE SCULPTRA can be stored at room temperature, up to 30\u00baC (86\u00baF). DO NOT FREEZE.Refrigeration is not required. STERILITY Each vial of SCULPTRA is packaged for single-use only. Do not resterilize.

Zachary, M.D., Chair of Der-matology at the University of Califor-nia, Irvine. \"We should not forgetabout the real benefits of chemicalpeels, nor the significant benefits peo-ple might derive from dermabrasion.We should certainly not forget the ex-citement created about 10 years agowith the high-energy, short-pulsedCO 2laser, typified by the UltraPulse (Lumenis Ltd.).\" Older technologies can still provide good cosmetic results, and Dr. Zachary continuesto rely on some of the older technologies on a reg-ular basis. However, he notes that \"anything thatcauses dramatic improvement also has the poten-tial to cause dramatic side effects, such as prolongedhealing, persistent redness, delayed onset permanenthypopigmentation, and scarring.\" Typical cosmet-ic dermatology patients today are unwilling to taketime off from work or otherwise alter their normalroutines and schedules to accommodate potentialside effects of rejuvenation procedures. Many of the newer devices that have become available in recent years combine modest cosmeticimprovement with minimal downtime related to af-ter-effects of treatment. That trend will likely con-tinue in the future. \"I don't know where we will be in 5 years, but I can guarantee that things will look very different,\"said Dr. Zachary. \"We are living in very excitingtimes. While the perfect device for facial rejuvena-tion does not exist at this point in time, there willindeed be new devices available to us in the nearfuture.\"Current technology has much to offer in the way of nonablative rejuvenation. Devices such as theSmoothBeam (Candela Corp.), CoolTouch (CoolTouchInc.), and ThermaCool (Thermage, Inc.) can tightenand rejuvenate the skin with considerably less down-time compared to older technologies, said Dr. Zachary. Fractionated therapy with the Fraxel device (Re- liant Technologies, Inc.) also has made inroads by providing the ability to rejuvenateskin with minimal surface damage.The 1550-nm device creates a myriadof three-dimensional areas of cylindri-cal affecting 5% to 10% of theskin surface. The cylinders of damagepenetrate the skin to a depth of 200 to400 microns, creating microthermalzones that rejuvenate the epidermalcomponent of photodamaged the dermis, and induce signif-icant improvement in acne scarringwith a minimal amount of erythema and swelling and no exudate. \"We're still in the early days with fractionated therapy, but I believe that fractionated therapy(treating only part of the surface of the skin withmultiple microthermal zones), is as important tolaser surgery as was the development of the selec-tive photothermolysis and dynamic cooling, the lat-ter protecting the skin during laser surgery,\" saidDr. Zachary. The intense pulsed light also has brought sub- stantive benefits to cosmetic dermatology. The de-vice selectively filters out light with a wavelengthbelow that specified. The end result is the deliveryof light that is well absorbed by pigment and bloodvessels, leading to improved color, vascularity, andgeneral tone of the skin. The reduced skin damage associated with newer technologies does not mean that rejuvenation proce-dures have become trouble-free, Dr. Zachary cautions. \"It would be a mistake to think that these pro- cedures can be performed without discomfort,without swelling, without redness,\" he said. \"Pret-Combining New and Traditional Techniques Provide Maximal Benefits to Patients Christopher B.

Besides the ultimate effects on patienthealth and quality of life, he points out that this\"leads to millions of dollars in treatment costs an-nually for skin cancers and other conditions directly related to excessive sun exposure. It is imperativethat our children get adequate protection. Duringchildhood, we receive about 50% of our entire life-time sun exposure.\" Continuing with the theme of responsibility, Dr. Zachary urged laser manufacturers to develop anddistribute product information that is both accu-rate and well considered. Unsupported claims re-garding technologic capabilities should be avoid-ed in every case. When those claims get widespreaddistribution, physicians in general, and dermatol-ogists in particular, are left with the responsibili-ty for responding to unrealistic patient expectationscreated by misleading or inaccurate information. \"We can do very good work these days, and we can do it in a safe manner,\" said Dr. Zachary. \"Butour expectations need to be carefully controlled, andthat includes the expectations of physicians, of man-ufacturers, and particularly of the public.\" I Dr. Zachary has nothing to disclose. aser lipolysis without fat suction appears safe and effective for the removal of small volumes of fo-cal fat, according to data presented at the annu-al meeting of the American Society for Laser Med- icine and Surgery. Based on MRI, patients who underwent laser lipolysis alone showed an average of 17% reduction in fat, said Karen H.Kim, M.D., a dermatologist in New York. Those treated un-der the chin showed the greatest average loss (25%); other ar-eas averaged a 13% reduction. In this study, 10 patients were treated with laser lipolysis us- ing a Nd-YAG laser (Cynosure Inc.), and 12 were treated withlaser lipolysis and the Tri-Active therapeutic laser massage de-vice (12 treatments). There were also 10 control volunteers. Thepatients had unwanted fat less than 120 cc in volume. Cyno-sure provided equipment and funding for the study. Treatment involves the use of a 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser with a 100-mm optic fiber and 1-mm microcannula. The low-power laser produces a photothermal effect when in contactwith fat, Dr. Kim said. Treated fat was allowed to drain nat-urally in the patients. The Tri-Active device was used on 10patients to facilitate drainage.Of the 30 patients enrolled, 29 completed treatment. The area under the chin was the most commonly treated area.Total energy ranged from 758 J to more than 7,000 J.Greater energy was used at larger treatment sites, Dr. Kimsaid. At 3 months, patients who received treatment considered the treated area to have improved 37% on average, based onobservation. For those treated with the Tri-Active device andfor the laser lipolysis only group, the figures were 47% and33%, respectively. The most common side effects were bruis-ing, swelling, and tenderness. The technique seems to be wellsuited for the treatment of focal areas of excess fat, Dr. Kimsaid. She and her colleagues are planning a larger multicen-ter trial using the technique. This technique has been used in South America, Europe, and Japan. Previous studies have shown that it destroys moreadipocytes than cannulation alone. I By Kerri W achter, IMNG News Service.

Bock, M.D., said at theAmerican Academy of Dermatology's Academy 2005 meeting. An elective procedures practice offers the gratification of learning new procedures, recognition as having specific ex-pertise, and less stress as a result of upfront payments and few-er insurance hassles. Staff can be used toamplify income, and fewer patients cangenerate the same or greater income, hesaid. \"We're in the golden age of minimally invasive procedures,\" reported Dr. Bock. That being said, a cosmetic practice is not for everyone. \"If you don't enjoy working with these patients, who can sometimes be more de-manding, don't do it,\" he said. \"If your solemotivation is financial gain, don't do it.This will lead you to make bad decisions.And if you just don't have the flexibility orwant to learn new things or take risks, thisis not for you.\" Dr. Bock acknowledged that his views are colored by the fact that he established a private elective procedures practicein the unlikely Central Valley location of Stockton, Calif., aconservative agricultural community far from the aestheticallyobsessed hills of Hollywood. He offered the following tipsfrom his experiences: Set realistic expectations. It's best to underpromise and overdeliver on your services. Have a humble attitude andoffer great service. \"You really want to be Wal-Mart withNordstrom practices,\" Dr. Bock said. Put everything in writ-ing to avoid misunderstandings. Explain that retreatment maybe necessary and failures can occur. Consent forms should listthe worst-case scenario for each procedure. Dr. Bock's Botoxdisclosures note that death can occur. \u007f Follow-up and photographs are essential. New patients should be seen 2-3 weeks after their first treat-ment to make sure they're satisfied or to offer them addi-tional treatments if the result is less than satisfactory. Pho-tograph all patients, every time. Photographs improvepatient satisfaction and can resolve issues that may arise lat-er. One patient complained of eyelid ptosis from her Botoxinjections until she was shown pretreatment photographsthat helped her to realize the ptosis was there beforehand. \u007f Proper positioning is key. Pricing your services be- low what people expect is one way to exceed their expecta-tions. Start out with very reasonable pricing. You can alwaysraise your prices later. At lower prices, patients will want morefrequent and extensive treatments, leading to better resultsand earlier retreatment. You'll get bigger and better faster,and this may intimidate potential competitors. \"Just because you're better doesn't mean people willpay more for your services,\" he explained.\"I've had patients in the past who've hadtheir Botox done by the plastic surgeon'snurse, even though they know I was do-ing a better job.\" \u007f Little details are important. Dr. Bock strongly recommends using Air-TiteSteriJect 31-gauge needles for Botox in-jections. \"Everybody tells us that our Botoxinjections are significantly less painful thaninjections they get elsewhere, and that's be-cause of these needles,\" he said. Considerusing vibration anesthesia, a technique de-veloped by dermatologist Kevin Smith(Dermatol. Online J. Oct 15, 2004;10:1) to reduce discomfort during dermatologic procedures, particularlyfor needle-phobic patients. \u007f Consider used equipment. There are a lot of good machines available if you're willing to do the research. Onesource is the Aesthetic Buyers Guide (www.miinews.com),which offers direct product comparisons and product round-tables. One exception may be microdermabrasion machines;Dr. Bock recommends buying a new, nonparticle system.These machines get a fair amount of wear and tear, but \"onceyou've got a noncrystal machine, nobody will go back to us-ing a crystal machine; that's been our experience,\" he said. \u007f Keep up your training. Botox, microdermabrasion, and hair removal generate the greatest revenue in Dr. Bock'spractice. But patients will demand what they can't get else-where. Dr. Bock gained an edge, albeit temporary, by be-coming the only practice in his area to offer soft tissue aug-mentation with Sculptra. I By Patrice Wendling , IMNG News Service.

Pharm. 2000;199:39-47). phospholipid membranes are lipid peroxidative chain Antineoplastic Action In a study of the less so than ellagic acid\u2014against lung car-cinogenesis, but were ineffective against skin tumor formation(Carcinogenesis 1983;4:1651-3). Since that study, the literature has added strong evidence of ferulic acid's oral and topical ben-efits, particularly its protective effects against cancer. The inhibitory effects of the topical application and oral ad- ministration of Ixora javanica flower extract on the growth and delayed onset of various kinds of tumors in mice were attrib-uted, in a study nearly 15 years ago, to the active compoundin the extract, namely ferulic acid ( Cancer Lett. 1991;60:253- 8). The phenolic nucleus and extended side chain conjugationof ferulic acid account for the compound's facility in forminga resonance-stabilized phenoxy radical, to which is attributed ( Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992;13:435-48). Previously, the topical application of ferulic acid was found to inhibit by 46% the induction of ornithine decarboxylaseactivity by 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in fe- male CD-1 mice. Similar treatment of mice with ferulic acidtogether with TPA also inhibited the number of TPA-induced tumors per mouse in a dose-dependent manner(Cancer Res. 1988;48:5941-6). And in a study a decade ago, the topical application of a de-hydrogenation polymer of ferulic acid inhibit-ed TPA-induced tumor promotion, although amonomeric ferulic acid mice(Carcinogenesis acid, fed significantly lowered theincidence of tongue neoplasms (hyperplasia The researchersconcluded these compounds show promise as chemopreventive agents in the tongue, skin, and other organs(Carcinogenesis 1993;14:1321-5). In a study evaluating the potential of dietary polyphenols as anticarcinogenic agents, ellagic acid, tannic acid, caffeic acid, andferulic acid were combined with phorbol-12-myristate-13-ac-etate or mezerein and were topically applied to mice. The re-sults showed significant protection against skin tumors inducedby 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene under in vivo and in vitro conditions ( Nutr. Cancer 1998;32:81-5). Sun Protection The vitamin E/ferulic acid compound alpha-tocopheryl feru- late (alpha-TF) has the capacity to absorb UV radiation, there-by maintaining tocopherol in a stable state. Thus, researchersinvestigated whether alpha-TF can act as a depigmentingagent and antioxidant to improve and prevent UV-inducedfacial hyperpigmentation. The researchers studied the effects of alpha-TF on cultured human melanoma cells and normal human melanocytes in vit-ro, and found that alpha-TF inhibited melanization signifi-cantly better than arbutin, kojic acid, ascorbic acid, andtranexamic acid. The investigators suggested that alpha-TFhas potential as a whitening agent, and hypothesized that itacted by indirectly inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase activity(Anticancer Res. 1999;19:3769-74). In related studies, most of the same researchers deter- mined alpha-TF inhibits the biologic responses promptedby reactive oxygen species ( Br. J. Dermatol. 1999;141:20- 9) and may mitigate damage induced by active oxygenspecies, thus helping to suppress or decelerate skin car-cinogenesis ( Anticancer Res. 1999;19:3769-74). Based on in vitro tests of the capacity of ferulic and caffeic acids to permeate excised human skin, researchers evaluatedthe capacity of the same organic acids to reduce UVB-inducedFerulic Acid F Continued on page 14 Leslie S.

Dissolved in saturat- ed aqueous solution (pH 7.2), both compounds conferred sig-nificant cutaneous protection. Ferulic acid\u2014which is morelipophilic and thus better able to penetrate the stratumcorneum\u2014and caffeic acid were assessed as worthy photopro-tective agents in topical formulations and judged to be unaf-fected by the pH of the product into which they might be in-corporated ( Int. J. Pharm. 2000;199:39-47). In a recent study of the free-radical scavenging abilities of ferulic acid and eugenolthat may summarize current thinking on this potent phenoliccompound, ferulic acid was deemed an effective antioxidant ( An- ticancer Res. 2002;22:2711-7). The investigators concluded it may be useful in preventing cell damage by free radicals. Buttressing such claims is a just-published study showing the addition of 0.5% ferulic acid to a solution of 15% l-ascor-bic acid (vitamin C) and 1% alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E)stabilized the formulation and, more significantly, renderedthe topically applied formulation a much better skin-pro-tective agent, doubling photoprotection to skin from four-fold to eightfold ( J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005;125:826-33). The authors of this study found the addition of ferulic acid conferred a synergistic effect, greatly enhancing the existingsynergistic effects seen in the combination of vitamins C and E, and further supporting research published by other inves-tigators last year, which highlighted synergistic relationshipsbetween ferulic acid, vitamins C and E, and b-carotene ( J. Agric. Food Chem. 2004;52:2411-20). Authors of the more recent study speculate that a topical an- tioxidant formulation combining vitamins C and E with fer-ulic acid in a broad-spectrum sunscreen would be an optimalway to protect skin from sun damage via a topically appliedproduct ( J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005;125:826-33). Ferulic acid is found in SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic and in small amounts in Murad Raspberry Face Wash. Conclusion Significant antioxidant, photoprotective, and anticarcinogenicproperties have been seen with ferulic acid. The cutaneous ben-efits associated with this phenolic compound continue to beborne out by research. Given advances in combining antioxi-dant ingredients for optimal effects, I am optimistic ferulic acidwill be a significant component in the armamentarium againstphotoaging and skin cancer.

Silkiss, M.D., in hertracks after she greets a cosmetic surgery patientby asking, \"What can I do for you?\" Those wordsare the response: \"I don't know, you're the doc- tor.\" Within this seemingly innocuous exchange lies a warn-ing that the balance of power between doctor and patient isalready skewed, setting the scene for an unhappy outcome.In cosmetic procedures, the doctor-patient relationship mustbe bilateral, with each person coming to the table with a de-fined role and measurable expectations, Dr. Silkiss said at afacial cosmetic surgery symposium. Don't bite when a patient says, \"Take a look at me and tell me what you can do,\" Dr. Silkiss advised. The patient is nottaking responsibility for the initial objectives of his or her cos-metic surgery, she explained. \"The environment is wide openand ill defined. As a result, it is impossible for the surgeonto meet the patient's expectations\" because they have not beenclearly established, she said. Maintaining a balance of power was just one of a series of tips offered by Dr. Silkiss, chief of the division of ophthalmicplastic, reconstructive, and orbital surgery at California Pa-cific Medical Center in Oakland. Another patient to watch out for is one who presents at a young age with a very minor problem, saying she has read ar-ticles advocating early cosmetic surgery. \"This is what I callsurgery in search of a problem,\" Dr. Silkiss said at the meeting,which was sponsored by the Multi-Specialty Foundation for Fa-cial Aesthetic Surgical Excellence. Such a patient may be giv- ing in to media pressure fueled by fashion magazines and real-ity TV shows such as \"Nip and Tuck\" and \"Extreme Makeover.\"Reassuring such a patient that she does not need surgery ex-emplifies surgical integrity that will be rewarded later, she said. Patients who arrive in the traumatic aftermath of a divorce or job loss might be well advised to come back in a fewmonths, when life has stabilized for them. \"The patient is ata stressful juncture in his or her life. What you do not wantto do is give the patient the opportunity to transfer his or herunhappiness to the recent surgery and surgeon,\" she said. Dr. Silkiss described a scenario in which a 50-year-old man, recently divorced, came to her because his new girlfriend toldhim he needed blepharoplasty. \"Actually, he didn't notice hehad a problem.\" This patient, she said, had insufficient moti-vation to undergo an elective surgical procedure. \"The patientis not personally committed to the surgery. This is his body andhe has to want the surgery himself.\" Such patients often cometo a consultation hoping that the surgeon will agree that sur-gical correction for such an issue is purely optional. \"They aretrying to reestablish their self-esteem. Reassurance alone maybe the best medicine,\" she said. I By Betsy Bates, IMNG News Service. Reprinted from SKIN& ALLERGY NEWS, September 2005.

Examine Patient Motivation For Cosmetic Surgery S2MCosD_1_5_06.qxd 1/16/2006 2:35 PM Page on Cosmetic Dermatology 2006any speakers include a slide on \"the Ideal Filler\" in their talks at cosmetic dermatology seminars. I don't have such a slide for my presentations, because there is no ideal filler. There is not now; there never will be. Every time you consider using a filler, youare in a unique clinical situation. The face is going to be dif-ferent, and the person attached to that face isgoing to be different. Let's say a woman who is concerned about her aging appearance comes to see you. Are you go-ing to use the same filler in areas that need a lit-tle stiffening as you would use to fill out deeplines around her mouth? What if she doesn't wantto come back every 3-6 months for a retouch? What we have today\u2014and what I predict will increasingly become the norm\u2014is an ar-ray of fillers, each with its own advantages,drawbacks, and, once in a while, a special nichein the cosmetic armamentarium. In Canada andcertainly in the United States, a host of newfillers will soon be available. Some that currently sit on yourshelf may not survive in this competitive market. In my personal view, cadaveric facial fillers are as dead as the donors. Furthermore, I would not invest money in Isola-gen, which uses a patient's own cultured fibroblasts to pro-duce a filler substance. I'm unconvinced that something thatinvolves this much of a procedure, this much expense, and thismuch time is something that my patients will buy into. On the other hand, I didn't see the rationale for Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid), and yet Sculptra clearly works. I waswrong about that and I could be wrong about Isolagen, too. Artecoll, which may be approved by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration by the end of the year, will offer less potentialfor allergenicity than do collagen products we use now, as wellas permanence. This and other future permanent fillers thatare injected subdermally work by fibroblast proliferation.There are definite risks associated with this. Lumps are com-mon and are technique related. Granulomas can and do oc-cur, and they may be very difficult to treat effectively (S KIN & A LLERGY NEWS, August 2005, p.1). I expect to see remarkably similar problems in other per- manent-type fillers that are on the horizon, including Der-malive and probably Silskin as well. In addition, I am con- cerned that we do not yet know the true complicationpotential in normal individuals of fillers that are tested on andapproved for HIV-associated lipoatrophy . My suspicion is thatHIV patients, because of their altered immune systems, maybe protected from many problems, such as infection. My impression is, you can throw anything at patients with HIV-associated lipoatrophy; I have yet to see a significant com-plication. I would be very cautious about applying findings inthese patients to patients in the general population seeking cos-metic improvement through the use of fillers. This is especiallytrue for permanent fillers. I think most cosmetic dermatology patients are satisfiedwith long-term temporary correction. People accept the con- cept of maintenance. They know they have to keep going tothe gym, maintaining a healthy diet, and returning to the hair-dresser. They will accept maintenance visits for filler touch-ups as long as the correction is \"long-term.\" So how long is long-term? We're pushing the envelope here. Certainly the longer-term the correction, thelonger the risk of complications will last. For ex-ample, with Restylane, the complications arereduced because the product is immunologi-cally simple. The duration of action is at leastas long as that of Zyplast and CosmoPlast, butthis like volume replacers. They're easy to in-ject and tolerant of mistakes. Can these be made safer and longer lasting by changing the particle size? I am unimpressedthat there is a difference in duration. Will therebe fewer adverse events with smaller or largerparticles? We have no evidence of that yet. Sculptra seems destined to have a place in the future of fillers. I'm convinced it works. Designed for the subcutaneousspace, it's all about volume. Obviously , the injection tech-nique is crucial to avoid nodules. There is a problem with thenumber of injection sessions required, and also with its in-consistency in terms of longevity . In some people, the cor-rection lasts years; others lose the volume in 1-2 years. I likethings that are very predictable, but I must say I am impressedwith the results achieved with Sculptra. It's not approved yetin Canada, but I look forward to the day when it will be. Radiesse also works, but it is also unpredictable, albeit to a lesser extent. Some people get long-lasting correction, but theresults can be more variable in others. Another problem withRadiesse is the cost. I am currently involved in a study ofRadiesse for HIV-associated lipoatrophy , and the volumes Iam using would be extremely expensive. So what is my concept of an ideal filler? I look for long- term temporary correction, which I define as something thatachieves good filling of the lips for 6-12 months. Somethingthat induces fibroplasia is okay , but not if it produces indi-vidual results so varied that the filler becomes unpredictable.I think an acceptable filler is one that can be used with a 30-gauge needle. Beyond these basic criteria, I think we need an array of fillers, to be mastered one at a time for the many varied types of vol-ume correction sought by many different types of patients.

A \"wealth of anecdotal data\" indicates that liquid injectable silicone is safe and effective, but the following critical rulesare key to its safe usage, he said: Use only pure, Food and Drug Administration-approved, injectable-grade liquid silicone; in the United States thatmeans only Silikon-1000, made by Alcon Laboratories. Theproduct has FDA approval for intraocular injection to treatretinal detachment, but it may be legally used off label, un-der the 1997 FDA modernization act that allowed medicaldevices to be used off label. It's important to note, however, that the law prohibits ad- vertisement of off-label uses, and malpractice insurance car-riers have different policies regarding such uses. \u007f Adhere to a strict serial puncture microdroplet technique, defined as 0.01 cc injected into the immediate subdermalplane or deeper at 2- to 4-mm intervals, with no double passin the same plane. Intradermal injection should be stronglyavoided except among the most skilled practitioners. The technique is necessary to allow a fibroproliferative re- sponse that develops around each microdroplet between treat-ments, not only causing each droplet to become anchored andless likely to drift but contributing to further augmentation,Dr. Jones said.\"This is an oil, and if you inject a lot all at once, it's like throwing olive oil on the floor\u2014it's going to spread out andtrack tissue planes along the path of least resistance,\" hesaid. \"But the microdroplet technique addresses this prob-lem.\" only small volumes\u20142 cc or less for lipoatrophy, or 0.5 cc or less for other indications. \"Avoid the temptation touse larger volumes,\" Dr. Jones said, adding that injectionsshould be spread out at intervals of at least 4 weeks. In addition to these three critical rules, important consid- erations for silicone use include informing patients that liq-uid injectable silicone is permanent, and that its use is stillinvestigational and likely to remain so for years. And, whilepatients can resume a normal routine immediately, they areadvised to avoid activities that could predispose them to blunttrauma. Dr. Jones demonstrated the injection technique on a patient with HIV-related facial lipoatrophy at the conference and saidthat most patients are highly pleased with the results. Liquid silicone injections \"really give an extraordinarily nat- ural-appearing correction,\" he said. \"When you touch thecheeks of these individuals, they feel nice, soft, and supple,and the injections really can restore subtle and refined facialcontours.\" The SDEF and this newspaper are wholly owned subsidiaries of Elsevier.

If you hurt them, they won't come back,\" said Kevin C. Smith, M.D., a der-matologist practicing in Niagara Falls, Ont. The discussion focused on patients undergoing cosmetic procedures, but the techniques, listed here, can be used onmedical dermatology patients as well: Ice. It's effective and about as cheap as pain relief gets. \"We use it a lot,\" said Alas-tair inpractice in Vancouver, B.C.\u007f Vibrators. Snickers aside, the Hitachi Magic Wand with a Wonder Wand at-tachment provides excellent pain reliefwhen applied under a patient's chin dur-ing facial procedures by blocking pain signals to the brain,said Dr. Smith. The devices can be found at the Web sitewww.drugstore.com.\u007f Talk therapy. \"It's not enough to put some cream on a patient,\" Dr. Smith said. From the time a patient first callsthe office, the staff and the physician should convey calm re-assurance. Patients will have less pain if they feel \"confidentof your skill and your care.\"He said he always uses \"talk-es-thesia\" to talk patients through procedures, even when oth-er forms of pain relief are used.\u007f Analgesics. Some procedures call for up-front pain re- lief. Dr. Smith sometimes advises patients to take an NSAIDin combination with acetaminophen for an additive effect. Pa-tients who do not have asthma may be prescribed propranolol,which provides analgesia but does not interfere with a patient'sability to drive.\u007f L.M.X. 4. This 4% lidocaine cream (formerly ELA-Max 4%) is sold over the counter, does not require occlusion, andprovides anesthesia 30 minutes after application, Dr. Car-ruthers explained. He tested it against a vehicle cream in 24patients receiving Botox (botulinum toxin type A) injectionsfor crow's feet. \"I like to think this is not a very painful procedure, so in order to reduce the discomfort, this stuff has to work verywell,\" he said.The study showed a significant difference in patient vi- sual analogue scale scores and observer ratings of discom-fort when L.M.X. 4 was used, with Pvalues in the range of .005.\u007f L.M.X. 5. This anorectal anesthetic cream is more ap- propriate for use in the mouth than alcohol-containing top-ical gels, which can cause sloughing of mucous membranesand irritation and stinging if they get in the eyes, Dr. Smithsaid. For lip procedures, optimal anesthesia can be obtained by numbing the mucosal surface of the lips, including the ante- rior mucosae of the anterior labioalveolarsulci down to wellas the vermilion and a 1-cm margin vermilion border. To achieve this without getting anes- thetic all over the inside of the patient'smouth, he cuts a Telfa pad to mimic a plas-tic laser shield designed to protect theteeth from laser work performed around the mouth. He cuts a 3-by-4-inch Telfa pad in half, length-wise, then folds it over and cuts a slit in the middle (to al-low the patient to breathe) and slits at the top and bottomto accommodate the frenula. He inserts the pad into the patient's mouth, against the teeth. He then uses a tongue depressor to apply L.M.X. 5thickly over the lips and gums and attends to other patientsfor 30-45 minutes, until his watch alarm sounds to remindhim to return to perform the procedure. At that time, he can inject lidocaine painlessly or, for sim- ple filler procedures, move directly to injections of Restylane(nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid gel). Dr. Smith noted that previous research has determined that the anesthetic mixture in L.M.X. 5 does not produce toxicblood levels, even when applied to mucous membranes. Dr. Carruthers disclosed that he has financial ties to Aller- gan Inc., which distributes Botox. Dr. Smith received L.M.X.5 samples from Ferndale Laboratories Inc. for his research.
