Q1 (green) comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values, Q2 (yellow) the second highest values, Q3 (orange) the third highest values and Q4 (red) the lowest values. |Category||Year||Quartile| |Complementary and Alternative and prestige indicator that ranks journals by their 'average prestige per article'. It is based on the idea that 'all citations are not created equal'. SJR is a measure of scientific influence of journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from It measures the scientific influence of the average article in a journal, it expresses how central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the journal is. |Year||SJR| |2019||1.095| |2020||1.156| |2021||0.917| |2022||0.797| Evolution of the number of published documents. All types of documents are considered, including citable and the number of citations received by documents from a journal and divides them by the total number of documents published in that journal. The chart shows the evolution of the average number of times documents published in a journal in the past two, three and four years have been cited in the current year. The two years line is equivalent to journal impact factor (Thomson Reuters) metric. |Cites per document||Year||Value| |Cites / Doc.

Journal Self-citation is defined as the number of citation from a journal citing article to articles published by the same number of total citation per document and external citation per document (i.e. journal self-citations removed) received by a journal's published documents during the three previous years. External citations are calculated by subtracting the number of self-citations from the total number of citations received by the journal's documents. |Cites||Year||Value| |External Cites per per document||2022||4.108| International Collaboration accounts for the articles that have been produced by researchers from several countries. The chart shows the ratio of a journal's documents signed by researchers from more than one country; that is including more than one article in a journal is considered primary research and therefore \"citable\", this chart shows the ratio of a journal's articles including substantial research (research articles, conference papers and reviews) in three year windows vs. those documents other than research articles, reviews and conference journal's items, grouped in three years windows, that have been cited at least once vs. those not cited during the following "}
