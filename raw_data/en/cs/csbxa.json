These herbs are used to treat many illnesses and are crucial in many ceremonies. Listen to Vickie Jeffries (Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation) tell us more about the four sacred herbs. Vickie describes cedar as \"the grandfather medicine\" and sweetgrass as \"the hair of Mother Earth.\" How can you show respect in your relationship with plants? Indigenous Land Relationships in the Carolinas An Interactive Audio Tour created by Quinn Smith through the Equity Through Stories Program This tour features 12 short audio recordings of Indigenous people telling their own stories connected to their relationship with the land.

As a documentarian, Quinn strives to challenge our misconceptions of Indigenous people by documenting a long-silenced, shared humanity. What drew Quinn to the Equity through Stories Program was the ability to uplift Indigenous truths and to forge reciprocal relationships with Indigenous people throughout the Carolinas. Quinn does this by interviewing Indigenous people about their relationships with the land and weaving their stories into audio documentaries to be exhibited at the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants. He also initiates seed-sharing and other reciprocal ventures between Indigenous peoples and Blomquist Gardens. Quinn hopes that his work will help to re-educate Duke Garden's 500,000+ annual visitors and to create a healing space for Indigenous people. "}
