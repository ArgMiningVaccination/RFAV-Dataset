The pandemic situation has made this fact more evident than ever. While researchers all over the world are trying their best to find vaccines and drugs to defeat the novel coronavirus, we need to do our bit to protect ourselves from this deadly pathogen. You can do this, by giving your immune system some extra boost. In this article, we discuss 10 immunity boosting drinks, their benefits and how you can prepare them easily at home. Can Drinks Enhance Your Immunity? There is an ancient saying in India that if you do not eat right, even medicines can not cure you and if you eat right you might as well not need any medicines. Maintaining a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle, with enough sleep and regular exercise goes a long way in keeping diseases at bay. Additionally food and drinks packed with vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients can boost your immune system to a great extent. You need both macro- and micronutrients which help build the cells and proteins of a strong immune system. Immunity is your body's defense mechanism. It not only prevents the entry of germs such as bacteria, virus and fungi, but also fights them off, should they gain entry. Thus, the stronger your immune system, the less are your chances of getting sick due to an infection. Also, you do not have to buy expensive over-the-counter products, for you might have plenty of beneficial ingredients in your very own kitchen. These can give your immune system that extra punch it needs during these winter months. 10 Homemade Immunity Boosting Drinks Staying hydrated goes a long way in keeping your immune system healthy. Besides drinking sufficient water throughout the day, you can whisk up some of these nutrient-packed drinks to help your immune system. Additionally, if you or your child does not like to eat certain fruits or vegetables, blending them into shakes or smoothies can help. This will ensure you do not miss out on the nutritional benefits of those fruits and vegetables. Here are some of the tried and tested drinks made at home to boost immunity. 1. Turmeric Golden Milk This drink has been a favorite in traditional Indian households for its many benefits, such as fighting off the cold, flu or relieving intense pain due to an injury. The main ingredient of this drink, turmeric, is a ubiquitous spice found in most Indian dishes. Scientific research has shown curcumin, the polyphenol abundantly present in turmeric, to have many beneficial properties. [ [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24877064/)] Not only is curcumin an effective antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agent, it also helps in prevention of certain cancers. The other spices added to this drink, such as cinnamon, ginger, blackpepper, increase the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of this drink. Piperine in black pepper greatly increases the bioavailability of curcumin in golden milk by increasing the absorption of curcumin in blood. [[2]](https://www.umassmed.edu/nutrition/blog/blog-posts/2019/6/using-black-pepper-to-enhance-the-anti-inflammatory-effects-of-turmeric/) As little as a pinch of black pepper can greatly enhance the benefits of this drink to your body.
