As part of my job, I take care of COVID-19 patients. One of the fears that I had was, despite wearing the right equipment, I would take the virus home. My wife is pregnant with our first child, and the last thing I wanted to do was bring the virus home. Also, my family, like most families, has family members with chronic health conditions, and I want to do everything I can to keep them safe. What would you like to say to those are who hesitant to receive the vaccine? I think it's okay to be hesitant. I think it's okay to want more information. I think it's okay to say, \"Hey this is new, I want to look into this.\" If I could reassure people, I would say this has been a rigorously tested vaccine, and it has gone through many trials and protocols to make sure it's safe and effective. It's one of the best medical breakthroughs we have had during my career and during my lifetime. "}
