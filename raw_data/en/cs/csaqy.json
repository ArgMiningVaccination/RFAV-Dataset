Modern innovations have allowed chiropractors to incorporate tools and devices to better assist adjustments and treatments. Gentle chiropractic differs from traditional chiropractic mainly through the incorporation of modern devices and techniques. These devices allow for precise, gentle adjustments. At Natural Health & Wellness in Carbondale, IL, we have years of experience helping individuals achieve their health goals through gentle chiropractic care, targeted therapeutic exercises, and custom orthotics. Gentle chiropractic care involves the use of special tools to gently manipulate the spine, providing pain relief without the use of force. One such instrument used to perform gentle chiropractic care is Ultralign, a computer-assisted tool that makes small precise adjustments for non-invasive pain relief. It can be very effective at correcting posture and alleviating nerve pain and chronic conditions. All of this contributes to an improved range of motion and stimulation of the body's natural healing process. Traditional chiropractic care involves physical manipulations performed by a trained professional chiropractor. The chiropractor uses forceful movements and exercises to adjust the spine. Sometimes, these adjustments can be too forceful, and further agitate the musculoskeletal issues it is trying to correct. While traditional chiropractic care has many benefits, many patients prefer gentle chiropractic care. When you first visit our clinic, our chiropractor will assess your body to identify the source of your pain before creating a chiropractic care plan tailored to your needs. Contact us to learn more about the different methods of gentle chiropractic care we use at Natural Health & Wellness. Our team has years of collective experience treating a range of conditions and helping individuals gain greater health and peace of mind.
