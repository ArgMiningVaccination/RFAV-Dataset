It is crucial to address health restrictions effectively and follow the protocols established by the respective health administration agency, to reduce the effects of such diseases. Antibiotics have been used in aquaculture for decades as a bacterial disease prevention strategy, but their use poses a great risk not only to aquatic animals but also to the environment and to human health. Alternative methods to prevent disease or generating disease resistance have thus been investigated and are now an essential part of farm management strategies. Drug and chemical therapy and vaccination are the most common methods for controlling infectious diseases on farms, but more attention has been devoted to fish vaccination as an effective prophylactic strategy. Inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, DNA vaccines, and subunit vaccines are among the several categories of vaccines that have been developed and used in fish. Vaccines can be administered to fish through oral, injection, or immersion routes. Adjuvants have been widely utilized to enhance the efficacy of vaccines by improving the potency and stability of specific antigen-induced immune responses. However, these vaccines are known to induce slight side effects in various fish species. This chapter highlights the safety and efficacy of vaccines used for preventing and controlling infectious diseases in aquaculture. Furthermore, the potency, safety, and stability of vaccines for aquaculture development are described. "}
