While a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management are self-explanatory foundations of a health-promoting lifestyle, minimizing toxic load can be just as important. The proper functioning of your vital organs and minimizing toxic load can influence your health as much as any other controllable factor. A \"toxin\" is any substance that places undue stress on the body. The sum of these substances that accumulate within the body and the burden that they place on vital organs at any given time is referred to as your \"toxic load.\" We are exposed to countless toxins every day, with everything we do, and from sources that we may not even be aware of. Every breath, every bite we take, every minute we stand under the sun, and every chemical (natural or synthetic) that we come in contact with while cleaning our home exposes us to substances that can negatively impact our health. Our lungs, digestive tract, and skin are the most vulnerable pathways. Fortunately, our body has a number of different defensive mechanisms whose purpose is to protect these vital body systems. It starts with the mucous membranes that line our nose, mouth, and throat and trap foreign particles. Inside our digestive tract reside trillions of microorganisms\u2014\"probiotics\"\u2014that maintain digestive efficiency and support our immune system's ability to respond to toxic threats. Finally, the liver and kidneys serve to identify and eliminate toxic substances from our blood. When functioning properly, our body is a very efficient toxic load minimizing machine. The key to maintaining these protecting mechanisms and internal organs is three-fold: minimizing exposure, supporting vital organs, and protective processes through a healthy diet and regular detoxification. An annual \"spring cleaning\" is a simple way to address your immediate detoxification needs and support the vital organs that work daily to keep you healthy. The foundation of doTERRA's detoxification program is the Cleanse & Restore Kit, a combination of several innovative products and an easy-to-follow 30-day regimen designed specifically to help you naturally minimize the toxic load.* Days 1-30 Support Healthy Digestion and Metabolism* Cleanse* Days 1-10 Support Filtering Organs* Days 11-20 Cleanse Tract* Days 21-30 Support Healthy Digestive Function and Immunity* Support Cellular Health* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
