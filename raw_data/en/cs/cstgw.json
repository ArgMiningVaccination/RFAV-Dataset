If you have a mysterious ailment that puzzles your traditional doctor, or if you are experienced with natural remedies, then you will enjoy this shop. It has vitamins, herbal capsules, essential oils, homeopathic, and more. The front of the shop also has gifts. They have tests that they can give you and a consultation regarding the tests if you need to try to determine the source of whatever ails you (there is a charge, but it's a comprehensive evaluation and one of our group found it very helpful to have this done). Lots of unique health items, such as inserts for your pillows to help you sleep better (with lavender, for example), small packs with arnica in three powers (for pain--if you don't know what arnica is, then you will Really come to appreciate this item if you don't wish to suffer from bruises or muscle strain, for arnica is among the best and most highly recommended of all homeopathic medicine). They had a chlorophyll sample on the day we went. They have some Chinese remedies here as well. If you have an ailment, there is something for most ailments, books and information aplenty here, and the staff is very knowledgeable. We were three people, so we spent around an hour exploring options for whatever our needs, whether it was difficulty sleeping, stress from work, or serious health concerns that were puzzling doctors and were therefore going untreated. The shop isn't gigantic, though it has plenty of products to explore, and it had products I would be unable to purchase even at most large grocery stores' health food sections in Austin. Kudos to the owner for kindness. They have some wild hours: 1 p.m.-5 p.m. most days (hey, this is a small town) and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. on Saturday only. So, we got there early on a day she doesn't normally open in the morning. She opened up for us anyway, and then cancelled an appointment she had made to finish up with us, so that was very kind and the way you would hope a store owner would care for you. "}
