Choosing a non-toxic yoga mat made with natural materials instead of hormone-disrupting plasticizers and cancer-causing preservatives is a better choice for the earth and your family. When the \u00d6ko-Test, a German consumer magazine, tested eighteen yoga mats, they found pesticides, nitrosamines linked to cancer, phthalates, and chlorine. Only eight of the yoga mats they tested were non-toxic. Between school, work, and busy schedules, it's essential to find the time for self-care. It shocked me to find out one of my favorite forms of exercise was a health hazard for my family. In this guide, I'll share what to avoid and what to look for in a non-toxic yoga mat. At the end of the post, you'll also find some of my favorite non-toxic yoga essentials. This post may contain affiliate links. Please see my full [disclosure policy](https://naturalbabymama.com/affiliate-disclosure-policy-2/) for details. Quick Navigation Toxic Yoga Mats Yoga has plenty of health benefits from stress reduction and improved balance to better posture, but do the benefits outweigh the risk? Many yogis don't know they are breathing in toxins as part of their yoga practice. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Most commonly, yoga mats are made from PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, a toxic plastic that off-gases. PVC is bad for your health and the environment. Still, it's cheap and easy to use, making it the perfect addition for manufacturers to use in everything from food packaging and children's toys to yoga mats. PVC manufacturing also poisons the water supply and air quality. Since it's non-recyclable, PVC burns cancer-causing dioxins when incinerated. If that's not bad enough, to make PVC easier to work with, heavy metals and other chemicals are added like: - Lead - Cadmium - Phthalates - Chlorine Nitrosamines In a shocking investigation, the German Oko Test found that the same compounds found in tobacco contaminate yoga mats, even natural rubber options. When looking at non-toxic yoga mats, you'll often see vulcanized rubber, a hardened rubber. Unfortunately, hardening rubber creates chemicals like nitrosamines suspected of causing cancer through skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Oko Test found some rubber yoga mats contain nitrosamine precursors that the body converts into chemicals. With eco-friendly, PVC, and nitrosamine free options on the market, why wouldn't you chuck your toxic yoga mat? What Should You Look For In a Non-Toxic Yoga Mat? Now that you know what to avoid, what should you look for in a non-toxic yoga mat? Research on the dangers of yoga mats isn't standard, but their chemicals are proven to cause reproductive harm and toxicity. When looking for your next non-toxic yoga mat, avoid: - PVC yoga mats (even eco-friendly PVC) - Chemical smells - Unknown brands - Synthetic Rubber (recycled or not) - Recycled tires are used in yoga mats, avoid at all costs - Formaldehyde emitting glues - Antibacterial claims - Flame retardant foam - Black rubber often contains carbon black which is highly toxic and derived from coal tar. Avoid mats that are black. Instead, look for non-toxic yoga mats with: - Natural materials (cotton, wool, jute, cork) - Natural rubber (unless you have a latex allergy) - No chemical smell - Water based-inks (for patterned yoga mats) - Nitrosamine, phthalate, and PVC free The 4 Best Non-Toxic Yoga Mats When you choose a safe and long-lasting yoga mat, you can feel good about your environmental impact and family as you journey through your yoga practice. I contacted the manufacturers and read the fine print to find the safest yoga mats for your family. 1.

Beware of a strong natural rubber smell that goes away with time. I've found a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water helps the smell fade. Pros: - Made with Natural Rubber - Glue-free - Long-lasting - Super light travel options - Great for kids This is not on the best list because Oko Test found that while this mat is nitrosamine-free, they found a precursor to nitrosamine which your body could convert to nitrosamines. Oko Test has this mat listed as good but not best. When choosing your Manduka yoga mat, avoid the PRO series made with PVC and the GRP series made with rubber and polyurethane foam.
