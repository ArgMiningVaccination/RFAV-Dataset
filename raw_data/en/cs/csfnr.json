This may mean finding [creative ways to explain cancer](/cancer-information/for-family-and-friends/talking-to-kids-about-cancer/treatment/creative-ways-to-explain-cancer/), but it's also important to introduce the correct cancer terms early on as these are words they are likely to hear. The following list of cancer terms provides two versions of each definition, one for younger children and one for older children. You can also go to our [general glossary](/cancer-information/understanding-cancer/glossary-what-does-this-word-mean/) for any cancer terms that aren't listed here.
