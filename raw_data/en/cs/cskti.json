Jenna entered college as a pre-med student, but the smell of formaldehyde and the sight of blood made her realize that she should choose a different path. After earning a BS in business communications from Cornell University, Jenna spent 15 years traveling the world as a management consultant. Interestingly, her focus was helping businesses become well by optimizing their systems and processes to maximize efficiency, productivity and profitability. Jenna reached a crossroads when she became pregnant with her son, Carter. Doctors told her that she shouldn't be eating certain foods, but they didn't explain why. Jenna thought, \"If these things are unacceptable when I have a child inside me, why are they acceptable at other times?\" She began to question conventional medicine. Carter had some serious health issues when he was just six months old. Jenna bounced around from doctor to doctor who recommended medication after medication. When she went to fill a prescription, the pharmacist pulled her aside and said he wouldn't give her the medication because it could cause fatal respiratory issues for a child Carter's age. Having struggled with her own health issues throughout her life, this was Jenna's breaking point. She knew it was time to pursue her passion and help people become well - not by waiting for problems to arise and treating them with medication, but by preventing and reversing chronic illness through smart decisions that stimulate the body's natural ability to heal itself. Jenna became a Certified Integrative Health Coach through the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. She has also earned her certification as a Functional Diagnostic Nutrition Practitioner (FDN-P). But Jenna knew she could deliver better results with the help of a medical doctor who bought into the functional approach. So she picked up the phone and called her father, Dr. Vincent Leonti. Dr. Leonti knew from the time he was in grade school that he wanted to become a doctor. After graduating from SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, NY, he went back and forth between family medicine and emergency medicine. His preference was for family medicine because it allowed him to develop closer relationships with his patients. Dr. Leonti has always been active. He has even completed five marathons over the years. That's why he was shocked when he went out for a run one day and experienced pain in his chest. A cardiologist told Dr. Leonti that he had an 80 percent blockage in one coronary artery and a 70 percent blockage in another. As a doctor, Dr. Leonti thought he was living a healthy lifestyle, but he unknowingly had been misinformed and developed bad habits that brought him to an unhealthy place. He was forced to make lifestyle changes to improve his health. It was during this time that his daughter, Jenna, began her journey in functional medicine and integrative health. Dr. Leonti had never heard of functional medicine and admittedly thought the concept was more than a little off-base. It seemed to go against everything he knew as a medical doctor. He skeptically attended his first functional medicine conference and instantly saw the disconnect between traditional and functional medicine. Traditional medicine was great at treating acute illness or crisis situations, like a broken arm or heart attack, but chronic illness was a different story. Dr. Leonti realized that so much more could be done to prevent and reverse chronic illness by bringing the functional approach to conventional medicine. Instead of waiting for a problem to arise and treating it with medication, functional medicine attacks the root cause of health issues and prevents problems from occurring in the first place. Dr. Leonti enrolled in the Institute for Functional Medicine and Functional Medicine University, where he is in process of certification. The real-life experiences of a father and daughter, and a shared belief in the power of functional and conventional medicine, soon led to the creation of Princeton Integrative Health. Samantha is a Double Board-Certified Family Nurse Practitioner working towards her Board Certification in Functional Medicine and Aesthetics. She received her Bachelor's and Master's of Science in Nursing from Walden University and holds various certificates, including functional medicine, anti-aging, and aesthetics. Samantha was previously a Charge Nurse in the Emergency Room for five years and also spent a year at Penn Medicine in Princeton, working alongside a multidisciplinary team treating adolescents and adults with eating disorders. Samantha is devoted to the human body performing at its best. Yet it wasn't until she hit \"a wall\" within her health battles that she was motivated to pursue a higher degree and specialize in Integrative Medicine. From a young age, Samantha was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, feeling discouraged (for years) when her doctor's only recommendation was filling script after script for DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), their side effects left her feeling like a prisoner within her own body. She had to be cautious of infections and avoid excessive sun exposure; the word \"toxicity\" appeared everywhere. She knew she needed to become her own health advocate, something she preaches to her patients daily. She thought, \"it's only a matter of time until these drugs wreak havoc on my body worse than my diagnosis.\" Samantha changed her diet and daily regimen. She researched anti-inflammatory foods and supplements. Fast-forward thirteen years, Samantha now lives her life medication FREE and provides information on the effects of Curcumin for anti-inflammatory advantages and the importance of sun exposure as a natural mood enhancer. Samantha considers the arena of Integrative (Functional) Medicine a dream - a place where her passion and career meet. She specializes in women's health and emphasizes the importance of primary prevention and wellness. She motivates and mobilizes her patient's goals by working collaboratively to recognize and eliminate the root causes of disease and dysfunction. Samantha will provide a holistic health plan crafted specifically for your mind, body, and soul. Nutrition has been at the center of Lee's work since 2010, beginning with program development around school gardening and nutrition education - along with advocacy for improved lunchroom food - in Princeton Public Schools. At the same time, Lee began serving in various leadership positions with The Suppers Programs, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that provides support to individuals with food-based health challenges - first as a group facilitator, and subsequently a board member and interim executive director. In 2015, inspired by the dramatic health turnarounds she saw at Suppers, Lee started a local business delivering fresh-prepared, food-based cleanses to clients who wanted to experience an elimination diet but didn't know where to start. Lee's protocol, based on The Clean Program, helped people uncover food sensitivities, regain energy and focus, improve digestion and sleep, and made them see and feel (and taste!) the difference that real food can make. Yet it was not until Lee became a health sleuth for one of her children suffering from a chronic health issue that she felt compelled to get a formal education in nutrition. In 2018, Lee enrolled in Bauman College's program in holistic nutrition where she learned about the remarkable connections among our complex body systems. In turn, her suspicions about underlying causes of health issues were validated and she felt further empowered to apply this knowledge in the service of improving people's lives. After completing the Bauman program in early 2020, Lee saw an opportunity during the pandemic to co-launch another food business, The Simple Stove, which provides clean, nutrient-dense meals in the Princeton area. In the summer of 2021, Lee transitioned back to nutrition consulting with individual clients. As a Nutrition Consultant, she loves that she can combine her passion for nutrition science with her desire to help people achieve optimal wellness. Lee also serves on the board of the Foundation for Airway Health (FAH), and is a member of the National Association of Nutrition Practitioners (NANP). She earned her BA in Anthropology from the University of Virginia. Falecia has been a holistic health professional for over 25 years. She started her career as a massage therapist and later went on to pursue a degree in nursing, and most recently became nationally certified as a health coach.
