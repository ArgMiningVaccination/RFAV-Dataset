Also provided is a method of treating and/or preventing the conditions associated with depression by administering the herbal composition of the invention. [0001] 1. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to a new herbal composition for the prevention and/or treatment of the conditions in associated with depression. [0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art [0004] Major depression is characterized by feelings of intense sadness and despair, mental slowing and loss of concentration, pessimistic worry, agitation, and self-deprecation. Physical changes also occur, especially in severe or \"melancholic\" depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia, anorexia and weight loss (or sometimes overeating), decreased energy and libido, and disruption of normal circadian rhythms of activity, body temperature, and many endocrine functions. There are multiple causes of depression and the causes may include genetic, familial, biochemical, physical, social and psychological factors. Major depression occurs in all groups of people and affects both sexes, with an increased incidence in women, most common in adolescent girls, affecting 5%-10% of the population. [0005] Depressive disorders are frequently managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. The following antidepressant drugs are widely used in the world: selective sertonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as Nardil, Parnate, and L-deprenyl were developed to treat the depression. However, these drugs are potent, often generating problematic side effects such as lethargy, clouded thinking, lack of ability to concentrate, and sexual dysfunction. For example, the side effects of using TCAs are sedation and weight gain and the MAOIs cause dietary and drug interactions. In particular, sexual dysfunction has long been noted as both a symptom of depressive illness and a side effect of many antidepressants. Ferguson J. M. indicated that most antidepressants interfere with human sexual functioning (Ferguson J M. J Clin Psychiatry 2001; 62 Suppl 3:22-34). Moreover, some new antidepressants with reduced side effects such as mirtazapine, bupropion and nefazodone were further developed. However, these antidepressants which are administered in a long-term will cause dry mouth and oral infection. [0006] A herb St. John's wort has been found to improve depression conditions and has a reduced side effect (Ghosal and Shibnath, U.S. Pat. No. 6,224,906). Therefore, the researchers gradually attach importance to the development of the herb drugs. However, the St. John's wort does not have strong efficacy in the treatment of depressant, which only can be used in mild to moderate depression. It is continually desirable to provide herbal drugs which have improved anti-depression properties.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] The present invention relates to a herbal composition, comprising a herb for promoting blood circulation and reducing Congealed Blood or an extract thereof, a herb for transquility or an extract thereof, a herb for sedative or an extract thereof, and a herb for the flow of qi or an extract thereof; wherein the herb for promoting blood circulation and reducing Congealed Blood is selected from the group consisting herb for transquility is selected from the the herb for sedative is selected from group consisting triflora, Gentiann scabra and Schisandra chinensis and the herb for the flow of qi is selected from the group consisting of Citrus sinensis, also relates to a method of treating and/or preventing the conditions associated with depression, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of the composition of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0009] The present invention relates to a novel herbal composition that provides anti-depression effects.

More preferably, the herb for promoting blood circulation and reducing Congealed Blood is Salvia multiorhiza, the herb for transquility is Lilium brownie, the herb for sedative is Rehmannia glutinosa, and the herb for the flow of qi is Citrus sinensis. [0011] Chinese medicine is a complete system of medicine encompassing the entire range of human experience. Chinese medicine is a combination of poetry and science based on a dynamic understanding of energy and flow. According to traditional Chinese medical theory, the fundamental substances of the body are qi (pronounced \"chee\"), blood, jing, shen, and body fluids. The proper formation, maintenance, and circulation of these substances are essential to health. As used herein, the concept of qi is based on the ancient Chinese initial understanding of natural phenomena. That is, qi is the most basic substance by which the world is comprised. Everything in the universe results from the movements and changes of qi. The qi in the human body is different in classification and formation. Generally speaking, the qi has no more than two sources. One is the innate vital substance\u2014one inherits from one's parents from birth. The other is the food essence and fresh air\u2014one receives from air, water and food in the natural world. The meaning of qi has two aspects: one refers to the vital substance comprising the human body and maintaining its life activities, such as qi of water and food (food essence), qi of breathing (breathing nutrients) and so on. The other refers to the physiological function of viscera and bowels, channels, and collaterals, such qi of the heart, the lung, the spleen and the stomach and so on. The deficiency of qi is tiredness and underfunction: some part or parts of the body fail to do their jobs. The usual signs of the deficiency include a low or weak voice that runs out of breath easily, sweating when there is no obvious reason for it, tiredness, runny stools, and lack of appetite. There are a lot of more specific signs of qi deficiency. For example, if lung qi isn't working properly, we will be short of breath, pale, weak voiced, and often catch colds. If Stomach qi under-performs, we will lose our appetite, cannot taste food properly, feel full too quickly when we eat, get runny or loose stools, and feel weak especially in the morning. Both of these qi deficiencies can lead to general tiredness. When the Heart is under qi deficiency, we will get palpitations too: each of the Zang-fu has its own picture when there is a deficient supply of qi. [0012] As used herein, \"Blood\" is actually another form of qi, just thicker than the 'qi-stuff' that gives us vitality and life. Blood is the mother energy in the body: it makes muscles, bones, brain, tissues and all of the rest. It provides a resting place for the qi. Indeed, the Chinese say that whereas Qi leads the Blood, Blood is the mother of qi. So they use the term Blood in a different way from Western Medicine. From the Chinese point of view, what we call blood is just a red liquid, unless it has qi and becomes Blood. How does the red stuff become Blood? The beginning of the process depends on good Stomach qi to feel hungry. By eating, swallowing and digesting the right food and liquids, the Stomach qi can transform them into the red stuff which is the first stage of Blood. This ascends to the Lungs, which move it towards the Heart, giving it energy. But it is only in the Heart that it becomes Blood. Hence, the saying in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is that the 'Heart governs Blood'. The main function of the Blood is to nourish the body, to moisten it and to provide a place for the Mind to dwell and thrive. Words that describe the actions of Blood include stability, suppleness, good texture, resourcefulness, and good complexion. There are four kinds of Blood disharmony. When Blood-deficient, we get pallor, dryness, cracking of joints or nails, uneasiness, irritability, restlessness, poor memory and concentration, falling hair, depression, insomnia, poor sight or tired eyes, impotence or scanty periods and infertility, not to mention dizziness and numbness. (Not necessarily all together. However, some of these problems can occur from other causes in TCM too.) And that is only for starters. Blood deficiency occurs when the Spleen energy is deficient, meaning that our digestion fails to ingest the right food and turns it into blood. [0013] Chinese medicine normally contains several herbs. One commonly used format or template for designing herbal formulas is based on the monarchical form of government. At the top is the king or emperor. Next are the ministers or deputies. Last are the assistants or adjutants. Any herb can fill any of these roles. Which role depends on which herbal formula the herb is used in. These roles work together in the following ways: (i) King herb\u2014primarily responsible for dealing with the syndrome under treatment; (ii) Subject herb\u2014assist the king herb by reinforcing the action of the king herb and treating the concurrent syndrome; (iii) Assistant herb\u2014play one of the three roles: assist the king herb, control the undesirable actions of the king herb, or reduce the toxic effects; and (iv) Servant herb: play two basic roles: direct the formula to the affected region, and harmonize the herbs in the formula.

[0071] According to the present invention, the herbal composition of the invention is a mixture of four herbs at a preferred ratio of the herb for promoting blood circulation and reducing Congealed Blood:the herb for transquility:the herb for sedative:the herb for flow of qi of about 1:1:1:1 (w/w). The weight ratio may vary up to 50% per component. The \"varience of the weight ratio by 50% \" means that each value of each component of the ratio may be increased or decreased by 50%. Thus, as an example, 1:1 can range from 1.5:0.5 to 0.5:1.5 (or 3:1 to 1:3). [0072] Preparation of the Herb Composition [0073] According to the invention, the components of the present invention can be used in the form of powder or extract extracted by conventional solvents. For the powder form, the components of the herbal composition of the present invention are air-dried and finely ground. For the extract form, the components of the present invention can be extracted by conventional solvents such as water, or any other solvent which can extract active substances from the natural substances at a temperature about 25 to the boiling point of the solvent during a period about 20 minutes to about 2 hours. The solvent from the extract solution may be removed to obtain the extract. The resulting extract can be optionally treated through filtration, concentration and dry. The exact proportion of the extracts used in the composition of this invention will depend on the concentration of active ingredients found naturally in each component. Using the guidance provided herein and a basic knowledge of drug preparation and pharmacology, one skilled in the art could easily adjust the proportions of the separate components of the composition so as to obtain a composition which has the therapeutic effects discussed herein. [0074] According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the extract herbal composition is produced by extracting the components with boiling, filtering the resulting extract, concentrating the filtered solution and then mixing the solution to obtain the extract composition. Preferably, the extraction is performed for 1 hour. [0075] According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the powder composition is produced by drying the components and grinding the dried components and then mixing the resulting components to obtain the powder composition. [0076] Dosage Form of the Herbal Composition of the Invention [0077] According to the invention, the herbal composition of this invention can be administered orally. The orally administered embodiments of the herbal composition of this invention can be in any conventional form such as, e.g., powder, capsules (hard or soft), tablets, elixirs, powders, granules, suspensions in water or non-aqueous media, sachets, as additives to food or beverages, or even can be made into a tea. For preparing solid orally administered compositions such as capsules or tablets, the prepared powder or extract can be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier including conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums and other pharmaceutical diluents (e.g., water) to form a solid composition. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, extracts, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicles before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles, preservatives and artificial or natural colors and/or sweeteners. [0078] According to the invention, the herbal composition of this invention can be prepared as unit dosages. A unit dosage can comprise a therapeutically effective amount of each herbal extract for a single daily administration, or it can be formulated into smaller quantities of each ingredient to provide for multiple doses in a day. A unit dosage will depend upon many factors including age, size, and condition of the individual being treated and the number of times the unit will be taken in a single day. In any event, the entire daily dosage will be that which is physiologically acceptable to an individual and can be administered daily over a prolonged period of time. According to the invention, normally no more than 21 g/day of the active herb composition is administered, with part, of the total dose preferably taken at two or more different times during the day. [0079] The present invention is also directed to methods of treating depression, comprising administering an effective amount of the herbal composition of this invention to an individual in need of depression relief. The term \"effective amount\" regarding the herbal composition means that amount sufficient to alleviate the symptoms associated with depression. The effective amount will depend upon the severity of the symptoms and on the responsiveness of the patient to the herbal composition. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies, and repetition rates. [0080] Pharmacological Activity [0081] According to the invention, the herbal composition can be used in relieving depressive states and anxiety. An advantage of treatment of certain cases of depression with the herbal composition of the invention is that it is rarely accompanied by side effects such as sexual dysfunction, as with many prescription antidepressants. [0082] The pharmacological activity of the herbal composition of the invention can be evaluated by the below Forced Swimming Test (FST): [0083] Porsolt et al. developed a Forced swimming test (FST) that includes placing a rodent (a rat or mouse) into a water tank and determining the time that the animal retain immobility. Rodents are placed individually into an transparent acrylic cuboid containing 15 cm (for the mice) or 30 cm (for the rats) of water at 24+1\u00b0 C. for 6 minutes. The durations of struggling, active movement and immobility in the test is recorded by an automatic device. A 15 minutes pre-test was performed 20-24 hours prior to the test. The duration of immobility is used as a parameter of despair in the rodents. The rodents exhibiting less movement on the second FST than that on the vehicle-treated or untreated animal show that the drug has anti-depression efficacy. The FST can be used in the evaluation of a variety of potential antidepressant, including all TCAs tested (i.e., imipramine, phenothiazines cannot be evaluated by the FST. [0084] The following Examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Powder Herbal Composition [0085] The Rehmannia glutinosa, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Lilium browni and Citrus Tangerina were cleaned by cold water, dried and then comminuted respectively. Each comminuted herbs was added 5 to 10 times water by weight and then extracted by boiling water for 30 to 60 minutes through extraction column, respectively. The resulting extracts were filtrated at the room temperature. The filtrated solutions were concentrated and then freezing dried, spray dried or heated with or without reducing pressure to obtain the products in power form. Each powder herbs was mixed at a ration of 1:1:1:1 to form a herbal composition of the invention.Example 2 Antidepressant Efficacy of the Herbal Composition of the Invention [0086] Animals [0087] 160-250 g of male Wistar rats were purchased from NSC (National Science Council, Taipei Taiwan).
