What is 10x more lethal than COVID-19? Viral covidiocy. 9 out of 10 COVID deaths were vaccinated in the K, Israel, Chile and Argentina, where case fatality rate was 1300% higher for the vaccinated than for the unvaccinated, plus a higher 40% contagion rate (5% if unvaccinated): the opposite of the narrative. The USA, also showed worse outcomes for the vaccinated than the unvaxxed. COVID waves seem to have receded due to the increase of herd immunity of the recovered, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. In the USA and Europe, 5 million adverse reactions and 70 thousand deaths were reported linked to COVID vaccines. Informed consent forms can't protect COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers against legal actions, even under immunity by law, not only because they are not really \"vaccines\" but gene hacks to produce the S1 spike protein (or parts), nor because some or all the elements are secret, un-disclosed or hidden, but especially, because the cure had been found, voiding Emergency Use Authorization (EUA): if you get COVID, especially if vaccinated, follow this successful evidence-based treatment: https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/ ( translations: https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/translations/ ). Yet, there are many other options in this document. This research is not \"anti-vaccine\", but pro-sane-vaccines. Unlike insane vaccines, it stands for evidence based medicine, i.e. scientifically proven safe and effective treatments. 500 scientific citations prove a systemic bias against cheap effective cures and towards unethical, ineffective and/or unsafe vaccines. Among dozens of effective treatments here reviewed, ivermectin is the best mass cure for COVID-19 variants. It had been scientifically proven beyond any reasonable doubt by May 2020, yet, instead of informing the public about the amazing results and going back to normal, there was a global scheme to block lifesaving information and promote lock downs, masks, restrictions, experimental vaccines and passports. 1 million dollars of ivermectin would end the pandemic compared to 160 thousand million dollars PER YEAR to keep a perpetual endemic disease, with vaccines always chasing new variants in a never ending lucrative arms race. It is not a matter of unsettled science: there are more RCT studies than for any other standard-of-care treatment. An insane \"war on bugs\" by legal drug cartels? It was an un-treatment pandemic designed to push vaccines and expensive monoclonal antibodies as the only option. The pandemic proved that there is neither quality control nor pharmacovigilance in any country of the world, especially the USA. In spite of more deaths linked to COVID vaccines than all deaths reported since 1990 from all vaccines, there was no real follow up of cases, no studies about subclinical side effects like myocarditis and thrombosis, no interest in public health: Deaths after vaccination (USA, openVAERS.com) With COVID vaccines, Governments have turned a medical act into an administrative mandate. Yet, practically no medical association protested against this violation of the right of the physician to practice medicine, i.e. a customized treatment according to the best knowledge/possibilities. Human rights continue to be systematically violated: to life, to informed consent, to fertility, to ethical treatments (where benefits are higher than harms), to healthcare (instead of sickening-care), to treatments for vaccine injuries, to compensation for injuries and death, to privacy (passes), to freedom (to work, move, assemble, worship), etc. This research presents strong scientific evidence for a planned global genocide: MAY A PERSON : WITH COVID VACCINATION WITH EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AVOID GETTING SICK FROM COVID? No Yes AVOID INFECTING OTHERS? No Yes AVOID HOSPITALIZATION? No Yes AVOID DYING FROM COVID? No Yes AVOID SIDE-EFFECTS LIKE INFERTILITY, MISCARRIAGE, DISABILITY OR DEATH? No Yes GET HEALTHCARE OR MANUFACTURER LIABILITY FOR INJURIES, DEATH OR NEGLIGENCE? No Yes HELP PROTECT OTHERS? No Yes HELP REDUCE THE SATURATION OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM? No Yes GENERATE HERD IMMUNITY? No Yes HELP TO END THE PANDEMIC? No Yes REDUCE THE GENERATION AND SPREAD OF VARIANTS? No Yes AVOID COOPERATION WITH VACCINES PRODUCED WITH ABORTION CELL LINES? No Yes GIVE INFORMED CONSENT WITH A PACKAGE INSERT LISTING ALL THE INGREDIENTS? No Yes AVOID UNDISCLOSED GENE-HACKING, NANO-TAMPERING AND BLUETOOTH CHIP? No Yes From the systematic genocide of abortion, they moved on to the 7 COVID genocides: 1. Engineering and releasing of the infertilizing, handicapping and lethal virus. 2. Maximizing spread (delaying alerts with open borders, forbidding open air activities, cloth masks, lock downs, vaccination). 3. Lethal recommendations (the above plus banning autopsies, pre-term delivery/c-sections, mother-baby separation). 4. Censoring, defunding and persecuting effective 5. Unneeded deadly treatments (ventilation, Remdesivir). 6. Infertilizing, handicapping and lethal vaccines and haccines (especially during pregnancy, breastfeeding and childhood). 7. Magnetoxic attacks: graphenation of haccines, food and beverages, EMF blasts from satellites, towers and phones, etc. The genocidal trend didn't change, only the target population. Same serial killers, different weapons.

From March 8, 2020, the virus started spreading in Bangladesh. Since then, people got infected so exponentially that the country positions at the list of top infected countries in the world. Therefore, the objective of this comprehensive review was representing overall scenario of COVID-19 in different sectors of Bangladesh. Because of insufficient scientific publications, we chose materials published by several agencies, media outlets, newspapers, and policy experts to retrieve details information. Up to 4 March 2021, 547,930 confirmed cases and 8,428 deaths were reported in Bangladesh. An alarming fact is that while the global mutation rate of coronavirus is 7.23 % in average, the rate is 12.6 % in Bangladesh. Although the government ruled preventive strategies such as nationwide lockdown, social distancing, contact monitoring, quarantine, and isolation, it was difficult to implement those due to lack of public awareness, inappropriate attitudes and so on. Moreover, the overburdened healthcare system had a weak response at initial stage because of insufficient healthcare facilities. Consequently, this pandemic affected severely almost all the important sectors of the country, specifically the economy, agriculture, education, and health sector. Hence, focusing on healthcare system, maintaining social distance, and other essential precautions can limit the spread of infection and help to alleviate the severity of this pandemic.

Anti-Covid-19, anti-MMR, anti-Gardasil, anti-poliovirus anti-vaxxer depopulating both unwelcome and repulsive to me.] BREAKING NEWS: Vaccine Catastrophe - Veterinary Vaccine (Live-Attenuated Brucella abortus strain RB51) has incorrectly been indicated as an 'approved' prophylactic therapy for human vaccination against Brucellosis or Malta Fever (also variously known as 'Mediterranean Fever' and 'Undulant Fever'). This error is totally inexcusable as this strain is extremely harmful when given to humans. Immunisation Schedule for Zaire Ebola virus for work where large bull (bovine) and buffalo herds are present (put together for the rescue and care insurers). Zaire Ebola contamination management in large herds of aforesaid large ruminants proves problematic with the biohazard suit that protect from the disease vectors as the animals respond aggressively to the human protective gear leading to panicking animals attacks, attempts of human butchery and animal rummage where people and properties can suddenly become threatened, as a health protection gives rise to animal threat by the rummaging animals trampling and horn attacking people in biohazard gear. The ring fencing experimental Zaire Ebola vaccines were not available at the time of this original plan instigated where the China-based organisation prepared an emergency quantitative easing (QE) cash programme, 'helicopter drops of money' as a mitigation strategy to persuade the food producers and food vendors to continue serving the general public against an infection risk during a major ebola epidemic - to prevent food industry's distribution and production collapses as the personnel might otherwise decide to stop working and to stay home so as to avoid infecting themselves by the dangerous pathogen (in this case a Zaire Ebola Virus). The above can lead to severe food shortages and ultimately potential starvation occurrence unless that epidemic had not subsided soon enough to prevent this secondary consequence from emerging. Because of similarity of early Zaire Ebola symptoms to other infectious illnesses at the early stages, the work undertaken in remote areas, the lead time in medical evacuations in case of illnesses, and the immense cost of privately-funded flying hospital dispatch to carry out a rescue operation, an exhaustive mutual exclusion prophylactic scheme was initiated to minimise unnecessary calls for such a flying hospital facility (remote medical service) from overseas. Reported BEXSERO to GlaxoSmithKline on an unlisted side effect of stealthy temperature rise (see 19/03/2020 version, page 7) to +42.3C / +108.1F with weakening of normal body temperature control like sweating and relative lack of sense of highly elevated body temperature able to cause heat stroke and other related damage to body. The immunisation schedule incorporates emergency authorisation Covid-19 immunisations and coronavirus vaccines that shortly complete their approval. Some of the Covid-19 immunisations likely vanish from marketplace as soon as the pandemic is over whereas some other vaccine designs may seek themselves second life as generic coronavirus immunisations. (The research field of coronaviruses is rapidly changing with these overlooked viruses also causing many common colds is brought into spotlight.) Almost all Covid-19 products have not been tested for concomitant use with many other immunisation products and therefore a reasonable space should be allowed between immunisations to avoid adverse effect risks. Because of this one ought to consider whether at current pandemic situation some immunisation products of lesser importance should be taken and whether it is better to defer them until situation clears (considering the ongoing infections with Covid-19 variants and especially in some remote regions where sequencing of the variants is very sparse as the protection to Covid-19 is very important). Because of above reason, this schedule is not currently geared for rapid deployment in tropics as too many uncertainties lie within which good protection against Covid-19 must prevail. Section on Covid-19 products is continually expiring due to evolving situation. Updates on Streptococcus pneumoniae PCV20. The latest version of the document supersedes all earlier versions that ought to be discarded and not used. Bangladesh Pharmaceutical Journal 2021 Viral infection has made the world to pass through the most critical time of the current century. In December 2019, the Wuhan city of China faced a novel etiological viral agent with atypical secondary pneumonia. The unique virus was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to the worldometer data, as of December 24, 2020, the world lost more than 1.74 million lives and infected more than 79.3 million people with the novel coronavirus-2. As there is no approved drug to combat the disease or vaccine against the virus, the infection continuously triumphed over the current medical system. The epidemiological analysis showed that geriatric patients are generally the most susceptible to the viral infection, and pediatric patients exhibited milder complications. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 displayed that the most frequent symptoms are dry cough, fever, dyspnea, and sputum production. Herd immunity is a tested strategy that could moderate viral transmission in developing countries. In this study, authors abridged the epidemiological outcomes, clinical features, and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The article also focused on vaccine development, herd immunity, and the most promising repurposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 with their clinical trial updates. Golden Meteorite Press As COVID-19 pandemic ravages the globe, eyes turn to vaccines as the most effective way to end the public health emergency. With the strict timeline set by the ever-deteriorating state of global health, COVID-19 vaccine development has seen some of the fastest, most innovative advances in the history of immunology. As our most powerful tool in returning us to the normal routines of life, understanding how vaccines are developed and distributed is critical. While hundreds of millions suffer at the hand of COVID-19, we all wonder: when will a vaccine become available? Let's take a deep dive into the path to COVID-19 immunization \u2014 from knowledge to needle. COVID-19 PANDEMIC. UGANDA IN BRACKETS 2021 The COVID-19 pandemic book is a compilation of detailed information on the disease from its outbreak to its vaccination. The book explains the disease in global context and the Uganda context in particular. The writer of the book collected information from different sources and he expects that it will be used for teaching this generation and the generations to come, understand the COVID-19 pandemic in its scientific and historical descriptions. The writer, to make the book easily readable, broke it down into ten chapters. Chapter one deals with epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this chapter, the writer laid down explanations on the study and analysis of the disease conditions, its determinants, its patterns and its distribution. More clarifications were focused on the name of the disease, its history, its transmission and its pathophysiology. Chapter two highlights is the diagnosis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The focal points under this chapter are the testing of COVID-19, its complications, the pathological findings, its immunity resistance and the management of COVID-19. Chapter three of this COVID-19 pandemic book, concentrates on prevention and treatment of the disease. Prevention described in this chapter involves the use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These are hand washing with detergent soap, use of sanitizers, putting on face mask, social distancing, surface cleaning, use of ventilation and eating healthy diet. Chapter four describes key statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic from its outbreak to its vaccination (Late 2019 to March 2021). The author reviewed statistics on global cases, recovery, deaths, vaccinations and their mitigations. In chapter five, the writer explains the COVID-19 pandemic related researches. He detailed the medical treatment research emerged to counter the COVID-10 disease. Also the chapter explained the researches involved in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. The next chapter (6), was raised to not miss information about responses to COVID-19 pandemic by governments and United Nations. From chapter seven to chapter ten, the author discussed the common global impacts of COVID-19. These are impacts on global economy, impacts on education, impacts on health sector, impacts on arts, entertainment and sports and impacts on social movements in communities. Chapter eleven came up with details on the COVID-19 misinformation. It explains the misinformation about the origin of the disease, misinformation about cases and deaths reports, treatment misinformation and effort to combat misinformation about COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter twelve of the book collected information on protests over responses to COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, Asia, Europe and America. The thirteenth chapter being the last chapter gives details of information about COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. It gives the timelines of the diseases in Uganda, Public Private Partnership responses to the diseases and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 in Uganda. The book ends with indices of brief data of COVID-19 15 most affected countries in the world, the graphical presentation of key COVID-19 statistics. Anaesthesia & Critical Care Medicine Journal 2020 The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we are facing. The virus has spread to all countries except Antarctica. As of 17 August 2020 2020, more than 22,113,000 people have been infected, and over 778,530 people have lost their lives. The global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems, and caused widespread social and economic disruption. Putting societies and economies on hold (lockdown) has helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus. The faster all cases are found, tested and isolated, the harder we make it for this virus to spread. This strategy will save lives and mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. This pandemic requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society response. This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and may never go away. Even if a vaccine was found, coping with the disease would require a massive effort. Countries are racing to slow the spread of the virus by testing and treating patients, carrying out contact tracing, limiting travel, quarantining citizens, and cancelling large gatherings. Educational institutions are closed. COVID-19 has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political crises that will leave deep scars. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. The financial crisis is already having a severe impact on poverty and inequality. The informal sector, a large employer in many EMs, has been highly vulnerable to the lockdowns and demand drops caused by the pandemic. Millions of workers who have abruptly lost jobs and incomes need urgent attention. Currently, there is no vaccine available and there are few specific antiviral strategies. Several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. There is an urgent need to increase pooled sample testing and also start undertaking anti-body testing. Life and livelihood are crucial. The lockdown must be rolled back in a phased and staggered manner while ensuring that high risk groups are encouraged to stay home. Strict social distancing norms, use of face masks and hyperlocalization to contain hotspots and areas of high risk should be the way forward. International Journal of Applied Pharmaceutics 2021 Respiratory diseases are the leading source of morbidity and death for millions around the world of all ages. A 2019 coronavirus outbreak has occurred in China and is spread quickly throughout nearly all across the world. To introduce prevention measures that have contributed to a sudden upturn in the rate of cases around the globe, several nations responded too late. It has prompted nations to close the borders, halted companies, kept people inside their homes, and numerous other measures to prevent their spread. We systematically searched on Google scholar, PubMed, LitCovid, and MedRxiv using the search terms coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, COVID-19, and vaccine for published articles. Present or performed clinical studies were found on the ClinicalTrials. gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and the International Clinical Trial Registry site using the disease searches phrase coronavirus infection. Many repurposed drugs, including antivirals, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, and others, were found to be effective against the novel COVID-19. Governments, private firms, researchers, and non-profit organizations are working hard to create a COVID-19 vaccine. In addition to the new medicines and old drug clinical testing, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines must also be designed and developed. Moreover, positive news in the development of vaccines suggests that new vaccines will be available on the market soon and a bowl of immunity against this virus can be established, thus limiting the spread and eradication of this deadly virus from the surface of the world as with so many viruses.
