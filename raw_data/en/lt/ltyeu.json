As our Administration reflects on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and plans for our city's future, we must work collectively to make it more resilient to future environmental and public health emergencies\u2014and it is vital that we do so in an equitable way. Every New Y orker, regardless of their neighborhood or race, deserves nearby access to high-quality open spaces that are cleaner, greener, safer, and more vibrant. Featuring extensive research and broad case studies, this report shares creative strategies, interventions, and designs that showcase New Y ork City's innovative spirit and openness to reimagining our public realm. The leadership of the PDC is essential in our Administration's mission to improve the quality of public streets and open spaces citywide and to ensure that New Y orkers throughout the five boroughs will equitably reap the benefits associated with public realm design improvements. Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness is the product of a broad interagency collaboration and extensive discussions with community groups and nonprofit partners, and it illustrates how the design of our city streetscapes and public open spaces plays a critical role in improving our physical, mental, emotional, and environmental health. I invite you to join us in making these visions a reality as we rebuild, renew, and reinvent the streets of the greatest city in the world. Sincerely, Eric Adams Mayor Street Lab T eens facilitate a hands-free obstacle course in collaboration with nonprofit organization, Uptown Grand Central, at the Pleasant Avenue Open Street in East Harlem. 6 Designing New Y ork November 2022 T o My Fellow New Y orkers: Throughout history, the people of New Y ork City have proven themselves to be resilient and innovative. Over the past couple of years, we witnessed communities banding together and collaborating on solutions that have fostered social wellbeing and helped local businesses stay afloat. As we plan the recovery of our city, we look to these localized initiatives for guidance. The case studies within Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness showcase ideas from some of our city's most creative innovators, and they also inspire opportunities for growth. This publication shows the great value of public-private partnerships and community collaborations. The lenses of wellness\u2014physical health, mental well-being, social adhesion, and environmental resilience\u2014highlighted in this book should continue to inform how we plan, design, maintain, and program our public realm for years to come. Investing energy into these efforts is central to our administration's goals of building a safer, more equitable, and resilient city. Sincerely, Maria T orres-Springer Deputy Mayor 7 Pedestrians admire Rice T erraces, the vibrant 4,800-square-foot asphalt art mural by Dasic Fernandez, painted in 2021 on Doyers Street in Chinatown, Manhattan.9 Streetscapes for Wellness8 Designing New Y ork \"Well-designed and green streetscapes can improve the quality of life for New Y orkers by reducing the heat-island effect, providing respite and shade, and encouraging physical activity.\" \u2014 Signe Nielsen, former President, NYC Public Design Commission; Founding Principal, MNLA A Changing Course for Streets in New Y ork Comprising more than a quarter of New Y ork City's land area, streetscapes are arguably one of the city's most readily accessed and underutilized public resources. With approximately 6,300 miles of streets and highways, New Y ork City is defined and shaped by its streets.1 These public corridors help us navigate through the city and connect with one another. Streetscapes comprise roadbeds where vehicles drive and park, bike lanes, and the sidewalks and plazas where people walk and socialize. They are lined with street furniture, signage, newsstands, bus stops, street trees, and many other amenities that provide neighborhood services along with social and ecological benefits that help sustain the city. Well-designed and programmed public streetscapes can improve health and mental wellbeing, encourage physical activity and social interaction, and make people feel safe and welcome. A holistic and integrated approach for a safer public realm addresses public health concerns while improving aesthetics, usability, and public perception to support an inclusive and thriving urban environment and public life. Design strategies such as open streets, community engagement toolkits, retail and restaurant extensions, public artworks, and expanded micromobility lanes for forms of personal transportation including human- or electric-powered bikes, scooters, and skateboards, can contribute to this effort.11 Streetscapes for Wellness10 Designing New Y ork Though it is increasingly apparent that people- centered design strategies can contribute to improved quality of life in the public realm, most modern cities were designed and built with a focus on the automobile. After the Ford Model T became widely available in 1908, broad sidewalks and landscaped parkways in New Y ork City were narrowed to provide more generous space for cars.2 At the time, cars were considered a healthy improvement to the smelly, loud, and messy horse-drawn carriages.3 Coupled with the promise of greater individual autonomy, the \"auto boom\" fundamentally shifted the use of city streets and demonstrated the inextricable link between streets and quality of life. Since the 1940s, city planning in the United States has been organized around vehicular efficiency. Robert Moses infamously razed lower-income communities of color to construct highways through and above them, segregating these communities and limiting their access to resources.4 Highways still act as barriers, cutting neighborhoods off from the waterfront, open spaces, transit hubs, social networks, and other communities. Further, they have negative impacts on quality of life, lead to increases in traffic- related injuries and fatalities, and spur health issues for nearby residents, including higher asthma rates and lower cognitive function due to the emission of harmful pollutants.5 These inequities, created by a history of racism in urban planning, are persistent and difficult to eradicate and were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. One non-profit organization, Robin Hood Foundation, utilized its poverty tracking tool to monitor the impact of the pandemic on different populations within New Y ork City. The Foundation's report finds that poverty indicators (e.g., food hardship, housing insecurity, and unemployment) affect Latinx and Black New Y orkers at significantly higher rates than neighboring white populations.6 Still, there are individuals who believe in the street's power to improve a sense of community. In The Death and Life of Great American Cities, writer and activist Jane Jacobs is pointedly critical of the modernist urban planning theories implemented by Moses. Jacobs favors a dense city with walkable streets and healthy, active sidewalks and argues that a network of sidewalks and intersections permits more opportunities for casual pedestrian interactions, fostering safety, social cohesion, and \"a web of public respect and trust.\"7 Streets for People T oday in New Y ork City, unlike many American cities, only about half of households own a car.8 When considering the proportion of residents who are dependent upon non-car modes of transportation versus the number of drivers who live in the city, the physical distribution of public space reserved for car use is inequitable.9 Manhattan commuters use public transit at nearly twelve times the national rate, yet cars occupy an immense amount of space (both while driving and parked), and result in congestion, pollution, noise, and a lack of pedestrian safety.10 How can the streets of a city, so long entrenched within car culture, shift to benefit people? In recent decades, the mission of New Y ork City's Department of T ransportation (NYC DOT) has refocused from the management of single- occupancy vehicular traffic toward the reallocation of street space to pedestrians, cyclists, and buses. NYC DOT has piloted protected bike lanes, curb extensions, pedestrian median refuges, and Open Streets, collecting data that showed reductions in vehicular speeding and injuries without increasing average vehicle travel times. In early 2020, the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the notion that streets are public amenities with the capacity to do more than just move cars. Public health precautions and lockdowns spurred City agencies to think creatively about how to provide areas for safe recreation and support local businesses. New Y ork City witnessed an unprecedented need for added public open space, and longstanding social inequities were further exacerbated by unequal access to quality, people-centered public space. At the same time, reduced automobile traffic on the streets presented opportunities to reclaim the streets for non-vehicular use. There is a growing expectation that streets can perform better and more equitably serve people by enhancing pedestrian and cyclist safety, mitigating pollutant emissions, slowing runoff, cooling urban spaces, encouraging active play and self-expression, allowing for moments of respite, and improving access to quality open spaces. The incredible outdoor experimentations that took place during the pandemic should provide inspiration for urban designers, planners, and policymakers as they look ahead to the future designs of public spaces. Corridors for Connection 3Vehicular traffic congestion, including along this car-dominated avenue in Manhattan, contributes to public health and environmental issues.3NYC DOT's annual Summer Streets event repurposes street space for non-car use, and invites anyone to play, walk, bike, skateboard, run, or relax along the corridor.13 Streetscapes for Wellness12 Designing New Y ork About Streetscapes for Wellness Streetscapes for Wellness is the result of a two-year collaborative research initiative between the New Y ork City Public Design Commission (PDC), the New Y ork Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA-NY), The Fine Arts Federation of New York, and the New Y ork City Department of City Planning Urban Design Office (NYC Planning). Dozens of other New Y ork City agencies and individuals involved in the planning, design, and care of streetscape projects contributed their time and insights to this publication, including the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Department of Parks & Recreation (NYC Parks), and the Department of T ransportation (NYC DOT). Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when public realm interventions and programs were quickly evolving to address issues of health as well as social, racial, and climate justice, the project team altered the course of this initiative to focus on how alternative uses for streets can enhance public wellness. The selected case studies from New Y ork City and a handful of other communities illustrate how innovative initiatives at a variety of scales may inform and inspire future visions for our streetscapes. Most of these projects are temporary in nature and developed during the pandemic, when creativity flourished in the form of tactical urbanism that responded to critical health and economic needs. While the PDC has purview over permanent designs on City-owned streets, these temporary installations can act as proving grounds for future capital projects. The PDC is uniquely situated to help synthesize and guide how these interventions may inform the design of the public realm and urban policy moving forward. Artist Kuki Go led the community-engaged design and creation of a block-long tape mural at the Avenue B Open Street in Manhattan in 2021.14 Designing New Y ork 15 Streetscapes for Wellness This publication is intended to serve as a source of inspiration for designers, planners, policymakers, community groups, and individuals advocating for the use and design of their streets. The case studies suggest ways in which streets can be reimagined to enhance public health with accompanying data that underscores the need to design and build high-quality public spaces to address inequities across New Y ork City. This publication is not a comprehensive how-to guide, a policy document, or a reference manual on street design, NYC DOT's Vision Zero program, or public health. For access to this type of information, see the resources listed in the Appendix. Further, this is not a one-size-fits-all guide. Solutions that may work for certain sites and neighborhoods may not be effective in others. This publication focuses primarily on streetscapes within dense urban contexts and does not have the space or resources to delve into many of the issues facing streets on a broader suburban or rural scale. Moreover, many pressing topics that affect New Y ork City's streetscapes are not addressed in detail within this text, such as sanitation and maintenance, e-commerce, homelessness, and the opioid epidemic.\"NYC Planning is committed to working with diverse communities to plan healthy and safe streetscapes that encourage biking, eating, and shopping, enlivening the city and supporting the well-being of all 8.5 million New Y orkers.\" \u2014 Dan Garodnick, Director and Commission Chair, NYC Department of City Planning17 Streetscapes for Wellness16 Designing New Y ork Wellness Redefined Merriam-Webster defines wellness as \"the quality or state of being in good health especially as an actively sought goal.\"11 Wellness is often associated with individual actions, lifestyle choices, and personal growth that can be achieved with the help of a product or service. This commodified focus can be limiting and inequitable. The following definitions represent four urban design-informed lenses of health that constitute a broader, holistic concept of wellness. These lenses highlight how the health of individuals, communities, and ecosystems can be improved through the design of public spaces. Physical Health A person's baseline physical health is measured by the absence of illness and injury, and a healthy diet and exercise may help obtain optimal health. T aking into consideration a broad range of abilities, as well as systemic inequities that may create barriers to achieving optimal health, public design can enhance physical health by... promoting bodily well-being, active transit, walkability, physical activity, and play for people of all ages and abilities. encouraging and facilitating movement, rest, and exercise. providing comfort and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and people using other micromobility devices for transportation. incorporating accessibility for a variety of users, including people with varying abilities, neurodiverse populations, and people of all ages, races, and gender expressions. Mental Health Mental health is a multi-dimensional concept that encompasses a person's \"optimal experience and functioning\"12 and integrates a sense of individual happiness and purpose with the ability to foster meaningful relationships with others.13 The design of streetscapes can enhance mental health by... providing moments of joy, inspiration, respite, and healing. offering a diversity of sensory needs. mitigating noise pollution or chaotic visual stimuli. improving feelings of safety through better lighting, human-scale design, and the presence of active street life. allowing access to green spaces and nature to support psychological well-being and alleviate symptoms of serious mental illnesses.14 providing a sense of belonging. Research has shown that people living in cities are at higher risk of experiencing serious mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This is likely a result of social and environmental factors and stressors, such as isolation, poverty, over-crowding, sensory overload, and a lack of protective services or sufficient mental health infrastructure.15 5An adaptive basketball game within a New Y ork City street closed to vehicular traffic promotes physical wellness through activity and play inclusive of people of all ages and abilities. 4Free group fitness classes at a plaza space beneath an overpass at 125th Street in East Harlem, New Y ork provide a joyful outlet and an opportunity to improve mental well-being and a sense of belonging.19 Streetscapes for Wellness18 Designing New Y ork Community Health Community health refers to the combined well-being of all people in a place. It is related to public health, but on a localized level and with an emphasis on empowering communities. Designers can cultivate community health by... recognizing community health needs and encouraging a sense of stewardship. bringing people together and fostering social cohesion. allowing for community engagement and input within planning, design, programming, and maintenance processes. honoring local knowledge and community ownership of public realm projects. welcoming all members of a community and designing for inclusivity. Environmental Health Environmental health encompasses all aspects of the built and natural environment that affect public health. As global temperatures rise, and as natural disasters increase in frequency and intensity, cities worldwide will need to adapt to face these challenges. Urban designers can address these issues by... incorporating street trees and greening to aid in cooling the microclimate and preventing urban heat island effect. prioritizing lower-emission car-alternative transit, including active transportation, public transportation, electric vehicles, and micro-mobility options. utilizing water-tolerant plants, permeable materials, and strategic designs that mitigate flooding. sourcing recycled and local materials. \"Vibrant streetscapes designed to meet the needs of NYC's diverse neighborhoods support the physical, mental and social health of communities and keep us connected to our cultures, and to each other.\" \u2014 Dr. Ashwin Vasan, Commissioner, NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene4Prioritizing native plantings, permeable paving, accessible pedestrian paths, and public transportation improves climate resilience and ecological health, such as at Richmond T errace in Staten Island, New Y ork. 3Community-organized public events, including The Soapbox Presents' \"Stoop Sessions\" concerts that originated in Harlem, New Y ork during the 2020 pandemic lockdown, bring neighbors together to allow space for healing and to celebrate and build community.21 Streetscapes for Wellness20 Designing New Y ork Whose Wellness Are We Talking About? Do streetscape design strategies implemented during the pandemic serve all communities equitably? How are the needs of essential workers, small businesses, or street vendors considered in the designation of pedestrianized areas, bus-priority corridors, or loading zones? Does the design of our streets account for ever-expanding modes of micro-mobility or new technologies? Or perhaps consider the ways in which people already use a space? How are our streets adaptable to an ever-changing climate, where disparities in vulnerabilities also tend to fall along racial and economic lines? Do individuals feel empowered to shape their streets? Our streets are public amenities with the capacity to do more and be more. In considering the future of our streetscapes, it is important to meet people where they are and understand the complexities of needs within their communities. Though some neighborhoods have reaped the benefits of certain public realm interventions and programs that aimed to reclaim the streets for pedestrian use and public health benefit, the same solutions may not work for other communities. A one-size-fits-all solution lacking in flexibility is rarely a solution for all. Streetscapes for Wellness are multifaceted, and the needs of our city's most vulnerable and often least-represented populations must be considered in the design and planning of our streets. Equity must be a fundamental driver of wellness. \"A redesigned street will not feel like it's contributing to community wellness if it requires displacement of unhoused neighbors, complex permitting, finding funding for roadblocks, potential harm to small businesses, or worse, the risk of related legal enforcement.\" \u2014 Deborah Marton, Commissioner, NYC Public Design Commission; Executive Director, Van Alen Institute 5The sidewalks in Jackson Heights, Queens, New Y ork are densely packed with informal uses, including street vending and COVID-19 testing. 4In the absence of benches, tree guards are informally used as seating near Dunningham T riangle in Elmhurst, Queens, New Y ork.What's in a Street? Over thirty public agencies and authorities are frequently involved in the design, planning, construction, maintenance, and programming of streets in New Y ork City. In addition to these entities, countless community-based organizations, Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), property owners, volunteers, and individuals also contribute to how these streets are developed and used by the public. Some of the ways in which these groups and individuals affect their city's streets are highlighted in the following vignettes, which represent four primary site contexts found throughout New Y ork City. The use of a street can shift dramatically as it passes through different land use and geographical contexts. Its design should be responsive to its surroundings and primary users and many of the site-informed examples highlighted in these vignettes are explained in greater detail within the case studies that follow.25 Streetscapes for Wellness24 Designing New Y ork A street eatery allows a restaurant to occupy part of the sidewalk or roadbed for dining service.

See: Street Lab Pop-up Programs, p. 46Residential A corridor that passes through a residential area should consider the needs of the people who live nearby. Does this corridor provide space for socializing, play, and recreation? Or perhaps a quiet space of respite? Or a mix and balance of the two? How does it support local small businesses, allow for local deliveries, or make it safer for students to get to and from school? 4Did you know... that any NYC property owner can submit a request to NYC Parks and apply to have a tree planted on their street for free?

See: Healing Spaces, p. 58 The roadway can be reclaimed as public space or designated pedestrian space through social or political artwork. See: BLM Mural, p. 70Planted medians with modified traffic circulation and accessible pedestrian crossings improve safety and quality of life. See: Grand Concourse Reconstruction, p. 100 Establishing designated, protected bike lanes with landscaped medians and clear traffic patterns improves cyclist safety. See: Tillary Street Reconstruction, p. 110Prioritizing bus traffic and limiting other through-traffic can result in increased bus speeds, reliability, and ridership. See: 14th Street Busway, p. 106Commercial A broad boulevard or a transit corridor that passes through a commercial district should consider a diversity of active uses and users throughout the day, including residents and commuters, local, regional, and even international visitors. Are there multiple, efficient forms of transit access with universal design? Is wayfinding legible? How are loading zones and congestion addressed, and how do they intersect with pedestrians or bicyclists? Can the amount of paved area used for cars be reduced? Do cyclists have designated lanes where they are protected from traffic? What is the feel and experience of walking on the sidewalk, and are comfort and accessibility maximized? Designing for a variety of occupancy intentions and flexibility can foster the coexistence of diverse populations. See: Restorative Ground, p. 60Did you know... that NYC DOT partners with artists to paint murals onto asphalt that has been transformed into pedestrianized public spaces, such as this curb extension? Interested professional artists or designers may access information about the Asphalt Art Activations qualification process on NYC DOT's Art Program website. that NYC Planning has overseen the Privately Owned Public Space (POPS) Program since its inception in 1961?

Grant Circle, p. 84Industrial A corridor that passes beneath elevated infrastructure or through an industrial area should be reimagined as more active and attractive assets for the local community. How can greening be increased to slow stormwater runoff and flooding? How can neighborhoods that were physically bifurcated by elevated infrastructure be reconnected? Can forgotten spaces be reactivated and serve new purposes?Did you know... that NYC DOT has been working to improve the safety of pedestrian crossings as part of its Vision Zero initiative? Its traffic and turn calming strategies include pedestrian refuge islands, raised crosswalks, speed bumps, and flexible delineator posts. that NYC DEP manages the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan, which includes rain gardens? These planted areas allow rain to be absorbed into the ground instead of flowing into the sewer system, reducing ponding, providing shade, and greening the streetscape.31 Streetscapes for Wellness30 Designing New Y ork Connecting the streetscape to the waterfront through accessible paths and piers allows pedestrians to immerse themselves in nature. See: Richmond T errace Wetlands, p. 80Vibrant community-created murals brighten the streetscape and infuse the neighborhood with civic pride. See: Grandscale Mural Project, p. 72 T erraced seating and native plantings near a park entry add public amenities that draw passersby into the green space.

See: Coexistence T oolkit, p. 71Open Space Adjacent A corridor that runs along parks, plazas, open spaces, or waterfronts should be designed to take advantage of this proximity. How can barriers be reduced and sight lines improved to welcome more people into these spaces? Can vegetation be added to make the streetscape greener? And can public amenities, such as benches and bike racks, be added along the sidewalk, more seamlessly integrating the adjacent open space into the neighborhood? Wide, accessible, and continuous landscaped bike and pedestrian paths can connect people to parks and encourage active recreation. See: Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, p. 108Did you know... that the majority of New Y ork City's public restrooms are located within NYC Parks? Access to clean, safe public restrooms is critical to maintaining a healthy public realm. that NYC Planning and the PDC typically review any changes made within street ends abutting a boardwalk or body of water? Consult NYC Planning for Waterfront Public Access rules to preserve waterfront view corridors, ensure climate resiliency, and allow for coordination with continuous public access along the shoreline.33 Streetscapes for Wellness32 Designing New Y ork Case Studies The following case studies represent a variety of projects that range in scale and typology, from temporary programmatic interventions to capital constructions. While most of these projects are located within New Y ork City, a couple from other cities have been included as references to balance out local categories. These projects were informed and envisioned by community members, working collaboratively with nonprofit organizations, artists, designers, and City agencies. Some were spurred from a pressing need to provide relief, recreation, and social interactions during a pandemic. Others are the result of years of careful planning. They highlight creative approaches to challenging sites, diverse needs, and regulations. The majority of the projects listed are temporary in nature. While the PDC has purview over permanent designs of City-owned streets, short-term installations can act as proving grounds and inspiration for future capital projects. The PDC is uniquely situated to help synthesize and guide how these interventions may inform future designs of the public realm and urban policy.A Guide to the Case Studies Each chapter includes a primary case study that is sited in New Y ork City and features a chart of \"Key Facts\" and \"T akeaways\" related to the project. Community health data for each of these primary case study neighborhoods is also featured within the Appendix to highlight the context of these sites in relation to broader demographics and public health data. Every case study also includes information about the project type, represented by an icon that indicates its scale and level of permanence: No physical intervention, programming only Examples: toolkits, ephemeral activations Moderate physical intervention Examples: public art installations, permanent road closuresMinimal or temporary physical intervention Examples: mobile installations, temporary road closures Significant physical intervention Examples: construction of structures, plazas, full street reconstructions35 Streetscapes for Wellness34 Designing New Y ork The case studies highlighted embody all or most of the four lenses of wellness described earlier in the publication and are organized into six chapters: Open Streets T emporary transformations of streetscapes from vehicular corridors to pedestrianized public spaces that allow for learning, cooling, commerce, and play Collaborative Recovery Community-based engagement sessions and streetscape interventions that encourage neighborhood stewardship, social adhesion, and healing Streets for Justice A reimagination of streetscapes as public spaces to advance equity through social engagement, advocacy, art, and expression Parks, Plazas, and Peripheries Streets as extensions of green spaces that foster respite within dense urban environments and improve ecological sustainability and climate resiliency Under the Elevated A reclaiming of \"forgotten\" spaces beneath elevated infrastructure through public programming, care, art, and activation Sharing the Street Public space management that gives roadways back to pedestrians, cyclists, public transit, green infrastructure, and artworks36 Open Streets 37 Streetscapes for WellnessOpen Streets1 Repurposing roadways for recreation and community uses has a long history in New Y ork City and other urban areas. In 1914, New Y ork began experimenting with closing streets to traffic for the enjoyment and health of people with the NYC Play Streets program. In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, the Ciclov\u00eda (bikeway) experiment has transformed streets into spaces exclusively for pedestrians and cyclists every Sunday since 1974\u2014and become a rousing inspiration for today's open streets movement.16 Recently, open streets programs have gained popularity worldwide, activating streetscapes to provide open spaces for recreation, reduce pollution, and encourage alternate modes of mobility and active transportation. In 2008, NYC DOT launched its Summer Streets program, closing Park Avenue from Brooklyn Bridge to Central Park to traffic on Saturdays in August. Nearly 300,000 people enjoyed the temporary, seven-mile car-free corridor in 2019, and this annual event, which has since expanded northward to East Harlem, has inspired New Y orkers to envision the street in new ways. With the arrival of a global pandemic in early 2020, NYC DOT initiated the Open Streets program to provide safe environments for New Y orkers to get outside, exercise, and socialize. Through partnerships between City agencies and community-based organizations, Open Streets in New Y ork City have been utilized as outdoor classrooms and play spaces for young people, as cooling areas and gathering spaces for elderly and vulnerable populations, and as a tool for economic recovery, providing a lifeline to businesses struggling during the pandemic. The open streets typology is flexible and adaptable to a variety of community needs but requires the ongoing stewardship, programming, and advocacy of local stakeholders. With simple design interventions, targeted programming, and activations, these programs transform streetscapes from car-oriented corridors into places for people. As cities look to expand the reach of similar pedestrianization initiatives, how will the specific needs of\u2014and resources available to\u2014residents be considered? And, how can these corridors provide both connectivity and respite within a broader urban network? People and pets fill Park Avenue for NYC DOT's annual Summer Streets event in Manhattan, which encourages countless car-free uses of the corridor. See: Open Streets, p. 3838 Open Streets 39 Streetscapes for WellnessNYC Open Streets Team: NYC Department of T ransportation Location: New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2020-ongoing Project Type: T emporary street closures In the spring of 2020, NYC DOT launched the Open Streets program as a way of utilizing city streets to provide people with more outdoor space for socially distanced recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operated through an application process, this program allows local community organizations to take ownership of the maintenance and activation of an approved Open Street. As of 2022, this ambitious program has transformed streets across all five boroughs into public spaces, supporting small businesses, schools, and community- based organizations. Early in the program, NYC DOT indicated specific street segments throughout the city that had the potential to be promising Open Street pilot locations. In addition to these City-designated sites, the program allowed members of the public, elected officials, and community boards to apply for their own Open Street. NYC DOT works with partners and local stakeholders to ensure loading, deliveries, and emergency access are coordinated as part of the Open Streets' operations. The quick implementation of Open Streets demonstrated that New Y ork City's streets could swiftly be transformed for a variety of non-vehicular uses. Later in 2020, the concept was expanded further with the Open Restaurants and Open Storefronts programs, which provide a financial lifeline to restaurants and retailers by allowing them to utilize the street for expanded outdoor dining and commercial activity. The success of an Open Street is largely dependent upon the buy-in from local stakeholders. New Y ork City's longest continuous Open Street, 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, is 1.3-miles- long and passes through a residential neighborhood. Though the corridor has been well-used and maintained and is programmed by the 34th Ave. Open Streets Coalition, a newly formed community-based organization of devoted volunteers, it has also been met with resistance and local requests for operational adjustments. In response, the Coalition has worked to outfit barricades with clear directional signage and tennis ball feet, a low-cost fix that has made it easier for an individual to smoothly and quietly slide a barricade out of position to allow for local vehicular access. And on Staten Island, which has the highest percentage of car owners per capita in New Y ork City, enthusiastic local support has helped make Open Streets a promising public-space model. For example, local stakeholders have come to embrace the Minthorne Street corridor's Full Closure from Bay Street to Victory Boulevard on weekends. Supported by a partnership between a local developer and community organizations, the street had not previously served as a major vehicular thoroughfare, and it has readily been remade as a popular community gathering and outdoor dining space. As the Open Streets program transitions to a permanent feature within New Y ork City, 5Pedestrians and diners enjoy the Open Street and interim Open Restaurants street eateries at East 4th Street in Manhattan. it will be crucial to offer equitable support across communities that may not have the immediate resources to establish their own high-quality public spaces. New Y ork City's current strategy for managing these public corridors builds upon a public- private partnership model, reliant upon local stakeholders or community-based organizations to plan, program, and maintain their spaces. Because the funding of these groups varies significantly across the city, and many neighborhoods do not have a BID or local nonprofit organization with the resources to support these amenities, this has resulted in quality disparities between different corridors throughout the five boroughs. Aiming to rectify a similar disparity within New Y ork City's plaza spaces, NYC DOT worked closely with The Horticultural Society of New Y ork to provide regular operational, horticultural, and sanitation support on select Open Streets across the city, especially those that were formally managed by low-capacity partners. Throughout the pandemic, the Open Streets program allowed New Y orkers to be physically active and connect with others while maintaining a safe social distance. Through the reclaiming of public space for activity, respite, and gathering, as well as communal advocacy and maintenance efforts along corridors, New Y orkers have had novel opportunities to meet and interact with their neighbors. Open Streets allow the promising potential to support schools, promote economic development, and add open recreation space where anyone can play, relax, and socialize. The many creative examples of Open Streets to date have affirmed that these reprogrammed public spaces can support community wellness, contribute to a healthier environment through the reduction of automobile emissions, and provide a range of additional urban benefits that positively impact neighborhoods. 40 Open Streets 41 Streetscapes for Wellness 5Movable barricades and signs delineate vehicular circulation from on-street dining and recreation spaces along the Columbus Avenue Open Street in the Upper West Side, Manhattan.5The Urban Y oga Foundation hosts a Sunday Wellness yoga session at the Marcus Meets Malcolm Open Street on West 120th Street in Harlem. 4Open Streets create safe spaces for young children and families, allowing opportunities for exploratory play and cycling practice. \"Through innovative designs and programs like Open Streets, NYC DOT is showing how we can reimagine our roads for better, alternative uses, contributing to public health and overall wellness for all New Y orkers.\" \u2014 Y danis Rodriguez, Commissioner, NYC Department of Transportation42 Open Streets 43 Streetscapes for Wellness Key Facts Takeaways5In 2021, a community tape mural by Artist Kuki Go activated the Avenue B Open Street in Manhattan, alongside a popular park and playground.

NYC Parks outfitted the original Play Street with two Street Pianos, allowing anyone to play, and an adjacent housing organization hosted folk-dancing. Designed to bring outdoor play spaces to lower income communities that lacked parks, these play streets were very popular within these neighborhoods and the project soon expanded to all five New Y ork City boroughs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the formal management of the Play Streets program shifted to being hosted within NYC Open Streets. T oday, City agencies continue to support the use of streets for play and to provide more opportunities for physical activity for children, and more recently, as sites for outdoor learning.

Morgenthau, former president of the Police Athletic League, jumps rope with children on a NYC Play Street in July 1981.In the summer of 2020, many indoor public spaces were closed due to concerns over community spread of COVID-19. This included indoor cooling centers, which provide air-conditioned environments during periods of extreme heat and serve as a preventative measure against heat stress and illness. In response, the New Y ork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) partnered with the design firm Interboro Partners and the Southeast Bronx Community Organization (SEBCO) to develop The Refreshing Waters, a temporary outdoor cooling station on a pedestrianized section of Tiffany Street in the South Bronx. This street serves as a gathering space and is regularly used by older adults, a population that is at higher risk of heat- related illness. The Refreshing Waters adds a cooling element to a community space and incorporates a misting line, fans, and seating with markers for social distancing along an existing fence\u2014all painted in a cheerful and recognizable blue. The project was re-installed in the summer of 2021 in partnership with an additional community- based organization, THE POINT Community Development Corporation, which provided programming through its Be a Buddy volunteers. Such programming included open mic events, the installation of movable furnishings, and educational outreach about neighborhood resources available during extreme heat events. The project demonstrates how streets can serve as a crucial community health resource while reinforcing neighborhood cohesion.The Refreshing Waters Team: NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Southeast Bronx Community Organization (SEBCO), THE POINT Community Development Corporation, and Interboro Partners Location: Tiffany Street Between Southern Boulevard and Bruckner Boulevard, Bronx, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2020-ongoing Project Type: Small-scale local intervention4Local seniors, many of whom lack air conditioning at home, gather to socialize and beat the heat at this temporary cooling station.46 Open Streets 47 Streetscapes for WellnessEstablished in 2011, nonprofit organization Street Lab creates and shares pop-up programs in support of local community groups, bringing movable reading rooms and other programming environments to outdoor public spaces throughout New Y ork City. In partnership with local advocates and City agencies, Street Lab's pop-up programs transform streets, plazas, and playgrounds into libraries, classrooms, and art studios. Their modular reading room carts are designed to roll into the street and unfold into sculptural shelves filled with books, puzzles, and art supplies, encouraging self-guided exploration and neighborhood cohesion. T o support pandemic recovery efforts and provide safe, uplifting outdoor programming for young people and adults, Street Lab launched a new program called PLAY NYC in 2020, featuring a \"no touch obstacle course,\" and focused its 2021 public space activations in the 33 New Y ork City communities hardest hit by the pandemic.

See: Healing Spaces, p. 58Collaborative Recovery The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the creation of community networks that helped neighbors and businesses survive the new health-related restrictions requiring social distancing. As communities and small businesses faced hardships and losses, longstanding inequities were further exacerbated and brought to light. Faced with imminent challenges and severe emotional trauma, people banded together to engage their communities and strategize tactical solutions in support of equitable wellness. The need for immediate action also provided an opportunity for experimentation in the public realm and a chance to program streetscapes with innovative pilot projects that aimed to combat the erosion of economic stability and support the physical and mental health of communities. While many neighborhood groups were able to quickly respond to and benefit from the City's open streets programs, others were challenged by limited resources and barriers such as language. T o support stakeholders that have historically been underserved by the professional design community, designers and planners partnered with youth leaders, community-based organizations, urban design think tanks, and BIDs, among others, to brainstorm and respond to rapidly shifting obstacles, policies, and parameters. T ogether, they implemented collective design and planning strategies, garnering diverse stakeholder involvement, and encouraging individualized innovation. How can the collaborative activation of our streets foster community adhesion to improve local equity and aid recovery amid a period of crisis? 51 Streetscapes for Wellness50 Collaborative Recovery T o facilitate unique collaborative solutions to challenges presented by the pandemic, the Urban Design Forum and Van Alen Institute\u2014 non-profit organizations that advocate for improving the public realm\u2014created Neighborhoods Now. This initiative supported the formation of partnerships between local design firms and connected these teams of professionals to community organizations within neighborhoods highly impacted by the pandemic. Queens is home to a large percentage of non-English speakers and immigrants and to two of the New Y ork City neighborhoods hardest hit by the pandemic, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. T o support this neighborhood and its many small businesses a team of designers from seven professional practices worked alongside community members and the 82nd Street Partnership, a well-established neighborhood development organization, to transform six blocks within the 82nd Street BID into a place for community recovery. This corridor had served as the site of the annual Viva La Comida! Street Festival since 2011. The lively event had long celebrated the cultural diversity of the neighborhood, featuring food, music, art, and dancing, so the BID proposed it as an ideal spot for a designated Open Street. After initially meeting community members door-to-door, the Neighborhoods Now team identified areas where it could best offer support, skill, or materials. It then set to work with the goals of providing small businesses a lifeline and restoring joy in the community through tactical design interventions that were both colorful and useful. The team spent six weeks during the summer of 2020 working closely with community members to complete an Open Streets application, design and construct street closure barriers, host community volunteer sessions, develop design recommendations for social distancing, provide informational public health signage, and plan future events. The design team worked with community members to design and fabricate hanging planters, planter boxes, and barriers with readily accessible, affordable, and reused materials. Alongside personalized spatial plans for businesses and guidance in the permit application process, these interventions contributed to returning the streetscape to a vibrant, healthy space. T o root its work in the neighborhood, the team occupied a vacant storefront space that was loaned by a member of the 82nd Street BID as a field office. This served as a workspace for fabrication, supply storage, and a center where community members could interact directly with the designers on weekends, contribute to the BID's Open Streets proposal, and receive support filing Open Restaurant applications. T eam members Jing Liu and Emma Silverblatt of SO-IL expressed comfort working in Jackson Heights, as they had established community connections during prior projects.

Liu describes the design team's role as a \"cheerleader to the community.\" With a focus on the community as its client, the team encouraged the connection of local groups and businesses in advance of the design process to \"figure out a wish list of the needs for the community\" before the designers gave their input. This empowered the community to reject one proposed plaza design due to its potential to stimulate gentrification. Ultimately, the community's Open Streets permit application was denied due to security concerns. Further, local small business owners faced restrictions on Open Restaurants permits, due to differences in the definitions of restaurants (licensed by the City and allowed to participate in the program) and retail food stores and groceries (licensed by the State and barred from participation). Disheartened, but not deterred, the design team took the opportunity to identify challenges that had existed within each project phase and to address underlying issues. Early in the pandemic, language and cultural barriers made applying for Open Street and Open Restaurant permits particularly challenging for communities such as Jackson Heights, and occasional discrepancies between enforcing agencies led to further difficulty. The Neighborhoods Now program helped to identify the need for interagency coordination, flexibility, and technological support for community organizations to improve the equity of future open space projects and enhance community health. In 2022, the Neighborhoods Now initiative shifted its energy away from quickly deployed tactical responses and toward broader, long-term recovery strategies for the neighborhood and its main commercial corridor. The team plans to continue its collaboration with the Jackson Heights community and create a roadmap for rebuilding that encourages foot traffic to a safe and vibrant small business district. 5Local carpenter, Moises Baxin, constructs a child's table from recycled materials. 4Information on available services are distributed at the team's field office. 6Street furniture prototype designs explore flexible arrangements for modular barriers, canopies, planters, and tables. 3 A site axonometric highlights the 82nd Street Business Improvement District and partner businesses. 55 Streetscapes for Wellness54 Collaborative Recovery 3Design volunteers collaborate on the fabrication of planter bags. 4Clockwise from top left: Planter bags decorate the roadway seating barriers at Thakali Kitchen, and quickly brighten the roadway dining space in an inexpensive manner; Volunteers paint roadway seating barriers; Designers provide free consultation on City reopening policies and regulations. \"Being in the neighborhood taught us about the community's real challenges and how intersections between policy and public realm design impacts people's experiences and lives\u2014important knowledge to gain as designers and planners.\" \u2014 Jing Liu, Co-Founder, SO-IL Neighborhoods Now, Jackson Heights, QueensRoosevelt Avenue37th Avenue Broadway Baxter Avenue82nd Stre et85th Stre et Key Facts Takeaways In early fieldwork, the team identified 50% of local businesses were closed or nearly closed.Communities can be brought together by organizing around the streetscape as a shared resource.

T o collect and amplify these initiatives, they created @designforsixfeet, an Instagram account that crowd-sourced images of activated spaces and interventions during the pandemic. The social media account soon morphed into a design collaborative that aimed to experiment with new spatial practices to benefit community wellness and create long-term change. Prompted by a conversation with a city planner in Newburgh, New Y ork, Design for Six Feet observed that simply opening streets to pedestrians did not provide dedicated spaces for young people to engage with the city. T o remedy this, the team worked with local partners to launch a competition for designs that prioritized play spaces for children in Newburgh's public realm. Newburgh: Design for Play received more than 70 entries from designers around the world. Jurors divided the projects into three categories: permanent structures, movable structures, and kits of parts. A jury selected three winners, whose entries considered the physical health and emotional wellbeing of local youth. Two of these winning projects, Imagination Pavilion by Starr Whitehouse Landscape Architects and Planners, and MakerBoards by downupNY , were implemented in the fall of 2020. The third project Play and Paint by Anoush\u00e9 Eirabie and Y axin Jiang was implemented in the Fall of 2021. These designs activated space in Newburgh's town center, encouraging people of all ages to play and create, spurring neighborhood interaction while simultaneously respecting the need for social distancing.

YDC hired design studio A+A+A to help facilitate multi-week technical workshops with local teenagers and mentorship groups to consider how physical spaces can foster healing from traumatic events. Y outh participants explored problem-solving through design\u2014dreaming up spaces in which both they and their neighbors might be able to enter and find comfort. The design team then actualized these ideas as designs for mobile \"Healing Sanctuaries,\" portable installations intended to engage community members in specific types of healing: \"Community Sanctuary\" pods for group healing and mobile \"Headspaces\" for individual respite. YDC executed much of the construction within its in-house Fabrication Lab. One Community Sanctuary resembles a portable greenhouse with transparent walls. Inside the wheeled structure, a message board and phone line allow visitors to record stories, while cubbies provide space for visitors to donate or borrow small objects representing personal healing. A second community installation, fabricated in 2021, is an opaque white mobile pod called the \"Release Room,\" which has an intimate interior with padded walls and weighted pillows where visitors can release negative energy. Y oung community members blew off steam and decorated the pod's exterior walls with colorful streaks of paint, by punching its facade with paint-dipped boxing gloves. The three Headspaces allow individual participants to perch on a stool and insert their heads into elevated panoramic cubes curated to offer a moment of escape and foster individual healing through meditation, closeness to nature, and a change of perspective. Healing Sanctuaries were first displayed at Osborn Plaza and subsequently within the neighboring NYCHA campus.

The placemaking installation builds on women-led WIP Collective's research into urban design solutions for neurodiverse populations and comprises three interconnected modules that employ a variety of surface treatments and form a vibrant topography with distinct occupancy intentions: Focused, Active, and Calm. The \"Focused\" zone encourages concentration and collaboration with a large table and seating, whereas the \"Active\" zone provides space for higher intensity activity and movement. The \"Calm\" zone creates a space of respite with hammock seating designed for passive lounging. This temporary installation has been well-used by local construction workers during their break times, by teenagers hanging out after school, by skateboarders practicing tricks, and by toddlers exploring the colorful forms. The installation creates enough flexibility and space for conflicting uses, fostering the coexistence of disparate user groups in the public realm. The project keenly illustrates the importance of considering the wellness of diverse populations and varied user needs when designing public spaces.

See: 125th Street Plaza, p. 72Stre ets for Justic e Whether through collective demonstration or individual action, city streets can be used to congregate people and inspire change. In the summer of 2020, thousands of protestors filled streets in cities across the United States following the murder of George Floyd. These demonstrations follow a long history of people physically occupying roadways and plazas to lay claim to their right to public space. Mobilizing within the space of the street allows protestors visibility and has given rise to an increase in localized activism within public spaces. The projects in this chapter highlight diverse ways in which communities have made streets integral to advocacy for social and environmental justice. In two of these cases, art is used as a powerful tool to revitalize public spaces for social engagement and expression. With the Clean Air Green Corridor initiative, high school students work to bring their curriculum to life and re-imagine the design of the streetscape in front of their school. In California, a collaborative effort resulted in a toolkit of strategies for advancing equal rights for the often- overlooked unhoused population. And, during the pandemic, community members across the country organized online to develop grassroots food distribution and mutual aid networks to serve neighbors in need. Building upon these localized efforts, how can our public spaces be designed to serve a democratic purpose and allow freedom of expression and movement? 64 Streets for Justice 65 Streetscapes for WellnessClean Air Green Corridor Team: Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS) Corridor Y outh Leaders, including 9th through 12th graders; Futures Ignite (formerly Friends of WHEELS); and WHEELS faculty Location: West 182nd Street from Broadway to Amsterdam Avenue, Washington Heights, Manhattan, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2017-ongoing Project Type: Corridor improvements and youth leadership initiative The Clean Air Green Corridor is a Black and Brown youth-led community initiative rooted in Washington Heights. In 2017, a group of students at Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS) embarked on an intensive interdisciplinary course exploring the restoration of their neighboring Highbridge Park. Dr. Jared Fox, an environmental and climate science teacher, and Mr. Erick Espin, a history teacher, created an environmental justice- centered curriculum paired with hands-on restoration work in the park through a partnership with the New Y ork Restoration Project. Through the course, which connected data analysis to lived experience, students researched the local consequences of redlining, the public health impacts of being located next to the I-95 highway, and the injustice of inequitable greenspaces and environmental racism in Washington Heights. The curriculum underscored the value of community-based research. When the intensive academic course ended, a group of six youth leaders stayed involved, researching on the weekends, attending community board meetings, and working with teachers and partners at WE ACT for Environmental Justice to develop a vision for the 182nd Street Clean Air Green Corridor. The students' vision for the Corridor reimagines 182nd Street from Broadway to Amsterdam Avenue as a pedestrianized green pathway, safely connecting the five schools located along the way to open space and community resources. What began as work in the classroom informed youth-led advocacy efforts supported by nonprofit organization, Futures Ignite, and its afterschool and summer programming. Students spent time outside their classrooms leading community engagement and stewardship efforts. Collaborating closely with urban planning, design and community development nonprofit partner, Hester Street, the WHEELS afterschool students dreamed up an idea for a streetscape plaza located on the school's block, which includes spaces for community gathering, public artwork, a green roof, and more efficient trash and recycling infrastructure. Y outh leaders see the potential of the corridor to be an intergenerational environmental justice hub and a youth-affirming space. T ogether with designers from Hester Street, the students co-designed the renderings and graphics demonstrating their ideas. Through a relationship with the Center for Resilient Cities and Landscapes, NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and the Columbia University Earth Institute, WHEELS students also worked with Columbia University Architecture and Planning students and faculty to refine their concepts for the corridor, conduct field work studying urban heat islands, and pursue a connection to the NYC DOT Open Streets Program.

Through their advocacy, streetscape infrastructure including tree guards and NYC DOT decorative planters were installed along 182nd Street. The project is sustained by active youth leadership as the original cohort passes on their knowledge to incoming students. Additionally, alumni who contributed to the Clean Air Green Corridor have returned to WHEELS to co-facilitate the Futures Ignite Environmental Justice Summer Institute\u2014 a unique opportunity that fosters the expansion of leadership skills in community organizing, community science, and policy advocacy, even after graduation. Through this project, students have utilized local knowledge to reimagine the possibilities of the street and public spaces. The initiative was featured at Park(ing) Day 2021, when WHEELS, Futures Ignite, ASLA-NY , the PDC, and NYC Planning collaborated to implement a pop-up installation that reflects the students' work. The event set the stage as a model for a future Open Street, with a pop-up park along with educational and urban-design activities. The pop-up transformed the entire block between the school buildings of WHEELS and I.S. 143 to demonstrate the need for a healthier, safer, and more engaging streetscape for learning and to inspire the next generation of environmental stewards, public health professionals, landscape architects, and planners. With ambitious goals to address climate change within the Washington Heights community, the Clean Air Green Corridor team and its partners have taken steps to transform 182nd Street into a verdant and vibrant corridor, which can serve as a replicable model for communities elsewhere. 6Students worked with designers from Hester Street to envision and illustrate what the Clean Air Green Corridor has the potential to become.5Students create tape art and play basketball in the roadbed between their school buildings.\"All young people regardless of their zip code or social and economic circumstances should be able to go to school in a healthy and green community.

Streets also became a place for artistic support of the movement, when across New Y ork City and throughout the world, roadways were painted with the message \"Black Lives Matter.\" A collaborative effort between architects, designers, and urban planners, the Foley Square Mural covers three blocks in the civic center of New Y ork City adjacent to the African Burial Ground. The 600-foot- long mural was created by three artists, each taking responsibility for a single word: Tijay Mohammed (\"Black\"), Sophia Dawson (\"Lives\"), and Patrice Payne (\"Matter\"). The mural shows how social and political artwork in the public realm can become an important way for the community to reclaim public space, particularly as historically racist policies and policing have sent the message that Black lives are not safe in such spaces. The extensive community engagement process that informed this project also serves as a restorative measure, reframing the streetscape as a place that fosters equitable expression and exchange. Published in 2021, the Coexistence T oolkit explores issues of public space access, safety, and design, with the unhoused population in mind. The project uses Guadalupe River Park, a public space improvement project in San Jos\u00e9, California, as a case study to provide city agencies, non-profit organizations, and stewards of the park with guidance on fostering coexistence in community planning processes. The T oolkit's guided engagement exercises include people who are experiencing homelessness and invite participants to identify what makes them feel comfortable in public spaces, ultimately facilitating the discovery of shared values and the formation of social contracts. Because the unhoused population is often excluded from planning processes, designing for an equitable streetscape requires challenging this notion. The T oolkit states, \"all people, whether they have a permanent home or not, have a right to access and participate in public space.\" Identifying and establishing shared community values is vital to achieving safe coexistence for all people within public spaces. The T oolkit includes exercises about shared values, acceptable behaviors, and accountability that public space stewards can use to gather public input, which can in turn inform design and policy decisions. It acknowledges that individual reactions toward public spaces, including levels of comfort and discomfort, vary based on identities and lived experiences, and it offers a way to respond to and design for this dynamic. The T oolkit's community engagement exercises present an approach that helps cities rethink who their public spaces serve and fosters a more empathetic and equitable public realm.

Partnering with City health agencies and other organizations, GrowNYC has expanded their programs to address food insecurity, build community gardens and compost sites, and educate New Y orkers. During the pandemic, longstanding programs like these were supplemented with community-organized food pantries, fridges, and other food distribution sites, often managed by newly created mutual aid groups. These programs utilize the street as a site for accessing affordable and healthy food, providing an essential foundation for equitable physical wellness. Uptown Grand Central, a group formed by The New Harlem East Merchants Association (NHEMA), works to uplift and strengthen the community along the East 125th Street corridor through advocacy and place-based projects with visual impacts. The organization programs the East 125th Street Plaza, working with the unhoused population in the area. The plaza is now the location of community resources including a GrowNYC Fresh Food Box program, NYC Zero Waste compost collection, free Zumba classes, live concerts and a pop-up snack shop that supports local small businesses. Each summer since 2019, Uptown Grand Central has also worked with property developers and non-profit organizations to turn a construction fence into a vibrant three-block mural gallery. The organization put out an open call for New Y ork City-based artists, specifically with connections to Harlem, Upper Manhattan, and the Bronx. The resulting murals embody a form of community dialogue, exploring a range of themes such as transportation, domestic violence, and hope. This multifaceted place- based resource infuses the neighborhood with civic pride, offering opportunities to engage in healthy activities and celebrate the corridor's social and cultural assets.Community Food Access and GrowNYC Team: GrowNYC, neighborhood mutual aid groups, and community members Location: New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 1976-ongoing Project Type: Pop-up markets and community food Street Plaza + Grandscale Mural Project Team: Uptown Grand Central Location: East 125th Street between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, 125th Street Plaza, East Harlem, Manhattan, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2019-ongoing Project Type: Mural4Fifty artists per year are selected to design murals along the corridor, including artist Gera Lozano whose 2021 mural created a quilt of colorful West African Kente fabric inspired shapes representative of the diverse local community. 5A GrowNYC Fresh Food Box distribution site under the elevated railroad tracks at East 125th Street Plaza, Manhattan.

See: Richmond T errace Wetlands, p. 80Parks, Plazas, and Peripheries Streetscapes play an important role in connecting people to adjacent open spaces such as parks and plazas, which are essential public health resources. Access to parks can positively impact mental health, allowing users moments of respite and closeness to nature. Parks and plazas also provide venues for exercise and physical activity, contributing to physical health. The presence of urban vegetation cools down surrounding neighborhoods, mitigating urban heat island effects, creating more comfortable environments, and reducing stormwater runoff. Within high-density urban environments, parks also offer calm places for reflection, especially when designers have incorporated trees and understory plantings that provide the sounds of nature and seasonal visual interest, helping to mitigate the noise of the city. In addition, emerging research identifies that vegetated public open space increases community cooperation and a sense of belonging.17 It is vital that green spaces appear welcoming, inclusive, and accessible to the surrounding community so that these health benefits are extended to all. T o better integrate green spaces within neighborhoods, NYC Parks launched the Parks Without Borders (PWB) initiative to create more welcoming connections between parks and communities through strategic design modifications such as lowering fences, widening entrances, improving landscaping, and adding amenities along peripheral streets. NYC DOT and NYC Parks have also partnered to co-locate parks and transit stations, coordinating entrances with crosswalks to allow transit users safe access to green space during their daily commutes. Parks can also be used to activate underused spaces and attract people to existing natural features, such as urban waterfronts, helping build connections between communities and health-enhancing resources. 77 Streetscapes for Wellness 76 Parks, Plazas, and PeripheriesSeward Park Team: NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, Seward Park Conservancy Location: Seward Park and Straus Square, Canal Street and East Broadway between Essex Street and Jefferson Street, Lower East Side, Manhattan, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: Completed in 2020 Project Type: Capital park reconstruction The design of a park's perimeter plays an essential role in defining its relationship with the surrounding community. T all fencing, poor signage, and underused spaces may serve as visual barriers to entry. NYC Parks' Parks Without Borders (PWB) program recognizes the importance of reimagining these perimeter spaces and creating visual connectivity between parks and their neighboring communities. The program includes welcoming entrances, edges, and park-adjacent areas. As part of this program, community members were given the opportunity to nominate parks in need of perimeter redesigns and to identify specific areas they would like to see changed or improved. Based on online and in-person outreach, the team selected eight showcase projects throughout the city. The reconstruction of Seward Park, a historic Lower East Side park, was completed in January 2020, marking PWB's first completed reconstruction project. Additional showcase projects include Prospect Park (Brooklyn); Van Cortlandt Park and Hugh Grant Circle/Virginia Park and Playground (Bronx); Jackie Robinson Park (Manhattan); Faber Park (Staten Island); and Flushing Meadows Corona Park (Queens). As a key example of the program's strategies, the renovation of Seward Park has reimagined how the park can boost visual appeal and connect to its surrounding streetscape. This project enhanced linkages between the park and the adjacent streetscape by lowering the perimeter fences, planting street trees, and opening and transforming an abandoned street between the Seward Park Library and the park. A garden area, previously inaccessible to the public, was reimagined with seating and paths that more seamlessly joined the library plaza via the garden to the remainder of the park. Historical elements of the park were preserved, including a marble mosaic map of the neighborhood and a bronze statue of To g o , the famous sled dog. Within the park, the PWB team restored pavement and existing landscaping and added new planting, tables, seating, and exercise equipment. The park is now accessible and enjoyable for all ages with playground equipment, basketball courts, benches for resting, and open space for practicing dance and tai-chi. The variety of options for physical play, exercise, and quiet respite make Seward Park an exemplary space for physical wellness. As a related element of the project, a new courtyard with low amphitheater- style seating and an expanded garden in front of the Seward Park Library enhances the connection between the park and its landmark-designated neighbor. This adjoining space, now open for community programming, provides the library with a new venue for publicly accessible family story time, book talks, and movie screenings. This variety in cultural programs offers visitors joyful and collective experiences, further cultivating community wellness. T o round out Seward Park's newly accessible amenities, NYC Parks worked with NYC DOT to close the adjacent Straus Square slip lane to traffic, integrating the triangular plaza into the open green space. This reclaimed pedestrian space hosts a Citi Bike dock, as well as painted concrete barriers with built-in benches that offer traffic protection and seating. The addition of this space further extends the beauty of the park to the sidewalk and triangle, encouraging use of what is now a remarkably imaginative local resource. 5Historic park elements, such as the To g o sculpture were preserved and celebrated at areas visible from the adjacent street. 4Amphitheater-style seating allows for informal social gatherings and creates space for community programming near the adjacent library.79 Streetscapes for Wellness 78 Parks, Plazas, and Peripheries5A new seating area establishes an improved connection between Seward Park Library and the adjacent garden and street.

Part of the PlaNYC 2030 public plaza program, which aims to accommodate all New Y orkers with open spaces within 10-minutes walking distance from their homes, the park transformed a previously inaccessible waterfront street edge into a welcoming respite from the city. The redesigned green space allows neighborhood residents to immerse themselves in nature and get close to the water via an accessible pier and walking path that runs through the North Shore's woodlands, offering views of the Kill Van Kull channel and the Shooter Island bird sanctuary. The park's adjacency to both a public bus stop and local wildlife makes it an ideal location for environmental education, with a gathering space on the east side of the park serving as an outdoor classroom. Richmond T errace Wetlands is a connector between the street and the waterfront, inviting Staten Islanders to engage with their unique surroundings.

Part of NYC Parks' PWB initiative, the site was nominated by the community with the goal of increasing equitable access and connectivity for residents who live in the historically underserved neighborhoods east of the park. The project added more than 150 new trees, along with a variety of native understory and perennial plants to enhance the park's landscape, which is part of NYC Parks' Forever Wild nature preservation initiative. T erraced seating and a stepping-stone path connect the entrances to the woodland landscape and a running trail, creating new portals between the neighboring east-side communities and the park's natural areas and amenities. In addition to the entrances, NYC Parks and PPA have been working closely with NYC DOT to add protected bike lanes and restore the historic sidewalk landscape design, including an all\u00e9e of native trees, benches, and lighting. Greenacre Park is a world-renowned example of biophilic design (a practice of connecting people to nature). Originally designed by Hideo Sasaki in 1971, the 6,000-square- foot pocket park incorporates nature to create an atmosphere of tranquility in an urban setting. The space is enclosed by three walls, giving it a protected and tucked- away feeling. Comfortable chairs and tables are surrounded by dense greenery under the dappled shade of a canopy of trees. A 25-foot-tall waterfall and babbling fountain drown out the noise of the adjacent busy streetscape. A trellis roof and exposure to sunlight keep the space at a comfortable temperature throughout the seasons. The park is configured as three distinct levels, providing users with a variety of seating options and environments. An outdoor caf\u00e9 with moveable tables, ivy-covered walls, and seasonal flowers add to the intimate garden experience. The opportunity for quiet, reflection, and closeness to nature supports the mental health of city dwellers. Maintained by the Greenacre Foundation, the park is frequented by visitors and lunchtime crowds, receiving more than 200,000 visitors annually.

See: Underpass Park, p. 97Under the Elevated The spaces below transportation infrastructure have often been ignored and languished as little-used, leftover fragments of urban fabric. However, these underways, referred to as \"El-Spaces\" by NYC DOT , have the potential to become vibrant parts of the streetscape and to enhance overall community health. In recent years, public agencies, designers, and community advocates have begun to see the value in transforming underways into spaces that are desirable to visit and functional to the neighborhoods surrounding them. Reclaiming these neglected spaces as multifaceted public resources can aid in the reconnection of neighborhoods that were bisected as a result of racist urban planning decisions that routed highways through communities of color and low-income areas. As New Y ork City's population expands, contextual design solutions for these spaces\u2014which are often located in high-traffic areas\u2014can help mitigate environmental impacts, like noise and air pollutants, improve pedestrian safety, and bring a host of new amenities to underserved communities. Through its El-Space initiative, NYC DOT has embarked on a comprehensive re-imagining of New Y ork City's underpasses through the development of pilots and design toolkits. Pilot projects have tested contextual design interventions intended to transform these spaces into desirable and usable locations for the community. For example, green infrastructure in underway spaces improves the pedestrian experience while helping to mitigate stormwater runoff. Overhead, creative lighting installations improve the perception of pedestrian safety and increase visitor interest. T o date, the effort has resulted in the transformation of underway spaces into lively parks, event venues, and linear gardens that serve equally as mini-sanctuaries amid the urban bustle and the new community anchors that catalyze civic engagement. 89 Streetscapes for Wellness 88 Under the ElevatedEl-Space Pilots Team: NYC Department of T ransportation, Design T rust for Public Space, Industry City, Rockaway Waterfront Alliance, Rockrose Development Corporation, ORE Design, Ciocchini Design Location: 36th Street and 3rd Avenue, beneath the Gowanus Expressway, Brooklyn, New Y ork City, New Y ork; and Jackson Avenue beneath Dutch Kills Street, Long Island City, Queens, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2014-ongoing Project Type: Pop-up installation As a result of transit system development in the late-19th century and mid-20th century, New Y ork City has nearly 300 linear miles of space beneath elevated transportation structures such as highways, bridges, above- ground subways, and other viaducts. NYC DOT recognized the potential of this resource and began a process of reimagining New Y ork's \"El-Spaces.\" These complex, often underutilized public spaces are frequently dark, unsafe, loud, or inaccessible. In collaboration with the Design T rust for Public Space and community partners, NYC DOT has experimented with solutions to transform these areas into improved streetscapes and public spaces. In the first exploratory project phase, the team identified, inventoried, and recorded existing conditions of El-Spaces in neighborhoods throughout New Y ork City. Through participatory workshops, the team developed recommendations for design and programming strategies. Applying these approaches, the team developed pop-up pilot installations at a selection of El-Spaces with diverse site conditions. The first pilot was implemented in Sunset Park, where the Gowanus Expressway separates much of the neighborhood from the waterfront and the multi-use Industry City complex. In partnership with Industry City, this pilot utilized lighting and green infrastructure to enhance safety and increase environmental health and awareness. As part of the project, large copper chutes dynamically channeled stormwater from the overhead Expressway into Corten steel bioretention planters; the diverted runoff provided water for a variety of low-light plants selected for their phytoremediation abilities. LED lighting on planter boxes and support structures brightened the space. A pedestrian walkway was defined with modular decking. NYC DOT explored how similar above- ground green infrastructure systems could be retrofitted at other locations and environments where bioswales are not advisable. At the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, NYC DOT partnered with the Rockaway Waterfront Alliance (RWA) to design a steel-edged \"dunescape\" planter that mimicked natural sand dunes at the nearby beach and contained native plants and seating. This pilot project served as an educational tool for RWA 's youth Shore Corps and Living Classroom programs, where participants learned about green infrastructure and resilient design through the planting, observation, and monitoring of the planter. The \"El-Space T oolkit\" launched by NYC DOT and Design T rust for Public Space in 2020 presents information gained during test phases of the project and synthesizes lessons learned at each step of El-Space development. NYC DOT also created the \"El-Kit,\" a suite of replicable treatments for enhancing El-Spaces including the El-Box (a repurposed shipping container that can be used for retail, storage, or other creative purposes), piloted near the Brooklyn Bridge; the El-Fence (flexible fencing with LED lighting), piloted in Long Island City; and the CityEl (custom seating, lighting and signage installed around structural support columns). 5Corten steel bioretention planters diverted runoff from the overhead Gowanus Expressway to a variety of low-light plants while they were installed in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.91 Streetscapes for Wellness 90 Under the Elevated5The green infrastructure piloted in Sunset Park activated the pedestrian walkway between the Industry City complex and the surrounding neighborhood.

Called Project Underway, the initiative developed through a partnership with NYC DOT over multiple phases, and ultimately evolved into Wellness Way: a multiuse corridor that incorporates pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements alongside wellness-centered activities hosted by community partners. Funded by a National Association of City T ransportation Officials (NACTO) grant awarded at the onset of the pandemic, the Wellness Way pilot was installed at the El-Space adjacent to the Beach 60th Street subway station in the summer of 2020. The site was distinguished by a painted asphalt mural and programmed with activities that nurture holistic community wellness. A farm- share distribution for mixed-income residents provided healthy food; musical performances and public art installations offered a space for joy; and outdoor COVID-19 test sites supported critical public health goals.

However, they can also be designed and utilized to enhance public health by encouraging active transportation and physical activity, mitigating the heat- island effect, and reducing air pollution caused by gas-powered vehicles. Holistic street redesigns simultaneously address competing demands of the road, while prioritizing safety and management needs. Balancing such a broad number of needs requires significant coordination across City agencies and may also necessitate an interim testing period to evaluate how designs work at specific sites. Since 2019, NYC DOT has piloted a limited number of shared streets at select locations with high pedestrian volumes, including near Flatiron Plaza/Worth Square and south of Union Square at University Place in Manhattan. These low-speed roadways are designed for all street users to share and cooperatively negotiate the right-of-way. Whether through capital road renovations or community-based stewardship projects, measures to improve safety can have a positive impact on the community. T argeted design interventions that increase pedestrian comfort\u2014including seating, crosswalk enhancement, bike racks, and improved signage\u2014modify car-dominated environments into spaces for people. Increasing greenery along roadways can boost the pedestrian experience and address stormwater management. Projects that alter traffic patterns to prioritize safety and convenience for active transportation and public transit incentivize users to select these more sustainable options. How can multiple types of use be facilitated by the design of our streets? And how can reimagining these public corridors as shared spaces enhance the safety, wellbeing, and experiences of all people?

The street was designed in the late 19th century with the vision of a grand boulevard, akin to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. However, the road took on the pace of an interstate highway, catering to traffic efficiency rather than pedestrian experience. Although the boulevard is a high- density residential and commercial corridor, green highway signs and low numbers of pedestrian walk signals were characteristics of the boulevard prior to renovations. The project area\u2014which comprises the entire 5-mile stretch of the corridor\u2014has accounted for 10% of pedestrian deaths and major injuries in the Bronx. NYC DOT first identified the need for renovating the corridor in the early 1990s, when twelve pedestrians were killed on the boulevard. The present reconstruction plan\u2014expected to be fully completed in 2023\u2014divides corridor work into four phases, working north from 161st Street to the end of the boulevard at Fordham Road. Phase I was completed in 2008 and included reconstruction of the underpass at 161st Street, installation of bike lanes, and the conversion of a parking lot into Lou Gehrig Plaza. Work for Phase II (East 166th Street to East 171st Street) and Phase III (East 171st Street to East 175th Street) included resurfacing of the main roadway and the reconstruction and realignment of widened medians to create more space for planting pedestrian amenities. Phases II and III also continued the installation of a buffered bike lane on both sides of the street, initiated in Phase I. Each phase included infrastructural and safety enhancements such as the addition of curb extensions and raised crosswalks, the replacement of street lighting and traffic signals, and new water mains and drainage improvements. In 2014, New Y ork City adopted the Vision Zero Policy, a commitment to protect New Y orkers from traffic fatalities. Since adopting the policy, City agencies have collaborated to improve regulations and street design to support this mission. As a part of Vision Zero, particularly dangerous roads, including Grand Concourse, were identified as priorities for Great Street renovations to improve safety. In addition to physical improvements, NYC DOT has lowered the speed limit on Grand Concourse and introduced a campaign to fight drunk driving in the area. Subsequently, NYC DOT began community outreach for Phase IV of the project, which will continue efforts to rebuild and expand medians and modify traffic circulation throughout the corridor. The project will also add public artwork and improve planting and tree canopy to create a more hospitable environment for pedestrians (long-term maintenance agreements were established to ensure the longevity of the plantings). New lighting, bike racks, benches, and wayfinding signage will also improve pedestrian experience in line with the City's Vision Zero Great Streets goals to improve streetscape character and create a safer street for the Bronx. The Grand Concourse renovation is expected to be completed in 2023. 5Widened crosswalks with new trees and plantings create a friendlier pedestrian environment. Prior to the reconstruction, the Grand Concourse had broken pavement, narrow medians, and an unused asphalt lane along the service road. Street geometries are reconfigured to lengthen the merge between local service roads and the main roadway, reducing the likelihood for pedestrian conflicts.44103 Streetscapes for Wellness 102 Sharing the StreetGrand Concourse, 161st Street at Grand Concourse was informally used for years as a parking area for the neighboring Bronx County Courthouse. In 2008, the parking area was transformed to a pedestrianized open space, Lou Gehrig Plaza.4The team added painted bicycle lanes and widened, planted medians with pedestrian refuges as part of the reconstruction. \"The Grand Concourse reconstruction has shown that traffic calming and pedestrian safety measures reduce injuries and fatalities. Lessons learned here are informing our other major Vision Zero projects, creating safer streetscapes across NYC.\" \u2014 Thomas Foley, Commissioner, NYC Department of Design and Construction Key Facts Takeaways Over 34,000 square yards of roadway have been repaved.Prioritizing multimodal streets improves safety and improves daily quality of life. Following Phase I of the reconstruction, the total number of serious injuries on Grand Concourse Boulevard was reduced from 28 in 2014 to 4 in 2017.Investing in upgraded water infrastructure can ensure safer, more accessible streets, as well as reliable service to local residents and businesses.Thirty-three pedestrian ramps were replaced, and 23 new, accessible ramps were installed.By reassigning traffic lanes to specific user groups, circulation can become more legible and efficient. More than 95,000 square feet of sidewalk has been replaced along the boulevard.By establishing a plan for continued maintenance, quality spaces can be enjoyed long into the future.105 Streetscapes for Wellness 104 Sharing the StreetQueens Boulevard has long been known as the \"Boulevard of Death\" due to its high pedestrian fatality rates. Seeking to address the corridor's unpredictable traffic environment and inhospitable public realm, NYC DOT's multi-phase Queens Boulevard Vision Zero project aims to end pedestrian injury on this infamous boulevard. Interim operational improvements, the addition of painted bike lanes, and modifications to the street geometry have successfully decreased pedestrian injury by 55 percent. The permanent design will reconstruct raised malls to calm traffic, add protected bike lanes and a pedestrian path, and integrate mall- to-mall crossings and stop-controlled slip lanes. Landscaping, benches, lighting, and wayfinding will also be placed alongside the malls to alter the public realm, creating a safer and more comfortable pedestrian experience.Queens Boulevard Great Street Transformation Team: NYC Department of T ransportation, NYC Department of Design and Construction, AECOM, NV5 Location: Queens Boulevard, Queens, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2016-ongoing Project Type: Capital street reconstruction 5As one of NYC DOT's Vision Zero Great Streets, the agency has begun to add protected bike lanes, widened crosswalks, and extended medians.5The reconstruction includes raised malls with pedestrian paths, bus shelters, and various public amenities. 3Central vehicular lanes are separated from outer roadways for local traffic, and curb extensions and pedestrian refuges shorten street crossing distances. 6Protected bike lanes will run alongside the planted pedestrian malls.107 Streetscapes for Wellness 106 Sharing the Street In October 2019, NYC DOT introduced a pilot project along a portion of the M14 busway on 14th Street to speed up the bus route, which had seen a decline in ridership. The bus-priority lane is in effect daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.; during these hours exclusively buses and trucks may make through-trips. Other vehicles are limited to local trips, pick-up, or drop-off, and may utilize short- term metered loading zones for commercial loading and unloading. In 2019, after initial success in improving bus travel speed (up to a 24% increase) and ridership (as much as 30%), NYC DOT began to pilot a T ransit and T ruck Priority design in coordination with Select Bus Service on 14th Street to further boost bus speeds. This pilot project serves approximately 28,000 daily bus riders and combines blocks of exclusive access and bus lanes to prioritize bus operations from Ninth Avenue to First Avenue. And, as part of its Better Buses Restart initiative, NYC DOT continues to work closely with the Metropolitan T ransportation Authority (MTA) and New Y ork Police Department to increase bus travel efficiency, reliability, and ridership at other corridors throughout the five boroughs\u2014 particularly in communities with high concentrations of essential workers, where public transit is especially crucial as the City seeks to reopen amid the evolving pandemic. 14th Street Busway Team: NYC Department of T ransportation, Metropolitan T ransportation Authority Location: 14th Street between Third Avenue and Ninth Avenue, Manhattan, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2019-ongoing Project Type: Bus-priority lane5The reduction of vehicular traffic has allowed for the expansion of pedestrian space into the roadbed. 4NYC DOT and the Union Square Partnership BID commission artists to paint the sidewalk extensions along 14th Street annually as part of the agency's Asphalt Art Activations program.5The limitation of non-bus traffic along 14th Street has improved bus travel speeds along the corridor. 109 Streetscapes for Wellness108 Sharing the StreetIn 2004, a neighborhood group, now known as the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative (BGI), developed a plan for the Brooklyn Greenway, a 26-mile landscaped pedestrian and bike path that connects New Y orkers to the waterfront while supporting the City's plans for coastal resilience. Over the past two decades, BGI has partnered with the Regional Plan Association (RPA) and NYC DOT to plan, design, implement, and program the Greenway. BGI also established the Adopt-a-Greenway program to foster long-term community stewardship, and it regularly hosts volunteer events and programs that promote the maintenance and use of the path and adjacent green spaces. The active role of residents generates community wellness and encourages use of the corridor. A particularly popular mile-long stretch of the Greenway runs through Brooklyn Bridge Park (BBP) and is the primary artery that connects park visitors to the BBP piers, which host various passive and active leisure and recreation opportunities. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates and Sam Schwartz, this segment of the Greenway maintains a consistent 12'-wide two-way bicycle path, separated from the pedestrian lane by a cobblestone strip. Clear wayfinding signage and surface markings legibly indicate where pedestrian crossings occur to minimize potential conflicts and facilitate safe recreation. A user survey conducted by Sam Schwartz indicated that on a summer weekend in 2018, approximately 8,500 pedestrians and 835 cyclists used this stretch of the Greenway on a weekday, and as many as 11,000 pedestrians and 2,000 cyclists used the same corridor on a Saturday. The Greenway has helped to facilitate BBP's transformation from a formerly dilapidated industrial waterfront to a vibrant, active landscape. More broadly, the Greenway's success has powerfully shown how shared streets can positively impact communities through a multitude of physical, social, and environmental benefits. The Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway Team: Brooklyn Greenway Initiative, NYC Department of T ransportation, Regional Plan Association, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Sam Schwartz Location: Brooklyn, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2004-ongoing (planning and implementation phases)Project Type: Pedestrian and bicycle pathway 5Pedestrian-scale lighting allows for public use of the Greenway, even after the sun has set. 3Clear wayfinding signage is important near busy destinations, such as within Brooklyn Bridge Park, where it minimizes potential conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists. 3Bike stamps and a cobblestone strip delineate a two-way bicycle path from pedestrian lanes and waterfront seating areas. , Brooklyn Bridge Park111 Streetscapes for Wellness 110 Sharing the Street At Brooklyn's primary gateway to the Brooklyn Bridge, this reconstruction has enhanced the pedestrian and bicycle experience of a highly trafficked intersection while creating a sense of arrival at the famed East River crossing. The project added a new two-way raised and protected bikeway, shared bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and new landscaped medians along the boulevard. The widening of sidewalks and a newly built-out plaza have created more space for the average of around 1,400 pedestrian crossings on a clear or partly cloudy day. The reassignment of traffic patterns and clarification of lane assignments also increased flexibility at the bridge approach. In 2021, to reduce the amount of pedestrian and cyclist congestion (and the potential for conflicts) on the bridge's primary wood deck, a vehicular lane on the Brooklyn Bridge was converted to a two-way protected bike lane. In the first full month following this change, NYC DOT's cyclist count data showed an average of over 4,200 cyclists crossing the bridge\u2014nearly 2,000 more rides than the year prior. This reconstruction turned a dangerous and chaotic choke point into a more stately approach befitting the grand passage between Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn\u2014and made it much safer to take an iconic Brooklyn Bridge selfie in the bargain. Tillary Street Reconstruction Team: NYC Department of T ransportation, NYC Department of Design and Construction, MNLA Location: Tillary Street Division between Downtown Brooklyn and Dumbo, Brooklyn, New Y ork City, New Y ork Y ear: 2012 Project Type: Capital street reconstruction5A raised bikeway and pedestrian path lead to the Brooklyn Bridge. 5Unity by Hank Willis Thomas was commissioned in conjunction with New Y ork City's Percent for Art process that was tied to the capital reconstruction of Tillary Street. A vehicular lane on the Brooklyn Bridge was converted to a two-way protected bike lane that connects bike routes between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Pedestrians cross the upper deck of the Brooklyn Bridge in 2021, following the diversion of cyclist traffic. 44113 Streetscapes for Wellness 112 Appendix Streetscapes for wellness are accessible to people of all ages and abilities.115 Streetscapes for Wellness114 Designing New Y sSt. George & Staple tonJack son Height sWashingt on Height s & InwoodLES & Chinat ownSunse t Park Highbridge & Conc ourseNYC Adult s Reporting Tha t Their Neighb ors are Willing to Help One Another (Percent of Adult s)An indic ator of comm unit y health and sense of belonging.

Accessibility (Ease of Movement)A measure of how friendly and inviting an area is for moving around easily for people of all ages and physical abilities. Neighborhood accessibility is also measured by the distance and time it takes someone to go from one location to another. A shorter distance between blocks often means that a person is naturally able to experience more variety and therefore, may be willing to go longer distances. Activation Animating open spaces by creating opportunities for social activity. For example, playgrounds and sports fields can allow for activation of a park or lawn area. Activation can also be created through community events and other temporary programming. Active Design An applied, evidence-informed approach to leverage the expertise of architects, planners, developers, community members, designers, public health professionals and other stakeholders to improve physical, mental and social health outcomes through the design of the built environment. Built Environment The human-made structures that we live, work, and play in, ranging from buildings and infrastructure to parks and green spaces. Capital Projects Construction projects on or over City-owned grounds that are publicly funded to help improve or maintain them. Civic Pride The feeling of satisfaction and belonging in the local identity of a place; pride in one's city, neighborhood and/or community. Community Engagement The process that facilitates communication, interaction, involvement, and exchange between an organization and a community for a range of social and organizational outcomes. Green Infrastructure An approach to water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle; frequently used to improve climate change resilience. Heat Island Effect Phenomenon that makes areas of a city hotter than their surroundings due to a lack of vegetation, retention of heat in building materials, or an expanse of paved surfaces, especially those that use dark materials, which absorb and retain heat. Landscaping Designing, creating or modifying the visible features of an open space. The terms below are from the New Y ork City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and NYC Planning Connected Communities Guidebook, the NYC Planning Principles of Good Urban Design Glossary, and the NYC DOHMH Active Design Guidelines\u2014all invaluable public resources that relate to wellness within our public realm.

Participatory Design Approach to design that attempts to actively involve all stakeholders in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. (see Community Engagement) Pedestrian Perspective The point of view or experience at eye level of a pedestrian when moving through a city or neighborhood. Urban designers focus on the pedestrian perspective when evaluating any aspect of a project or when designing a building, plaza or any other element of the public realm. Public Open Space Areas that are open to the public to use, such as streets and public parks. Public Realm The spaces and experiences that members of the public share within the built environment. For example, our streets, parks, and plazas are part of the public realm, and the public realm is also shaped by adjacent buildings. Sense of Belonging The feeling of connectedness to a place or community. This is important because if we feel recognized and connected to the place where we live, work and play in everyday, we feel more at ease and can thrive within that environment. It's through a sense of belonging that our built environment can improve our well-being and quality of life. Sense of Scale Scale refers to how elements of the city relate to each other in size or dimension and to how a pedestrian experiences them. Urban Design Urban design focuses on how the elements of our city, buildings, streets, parks, and plazas are designed, built, and arranged in relation to one another, and how people experience the city. Urban Planning Urban planning looks at how features of the city, think of buildings, transportation and infrastructure, open space, housing, and public buildings, connect and relate to one another to shape regulations and investments to promote the health, safety, and economic well-being of the city's residents, workers, and businesses, in the near term and into the future. Planning discussions combine the technical planning practice with the unique needs of our communities. Planners, who may work for government agencies, private entities, nonprofit organizations, or as volunteers, collaborate with communities, other public agencies, and elected officials, to define and address the unique needs, aspirations, and cultures of New Y ork City neighborhoods and their residents. Urban Design Principles A set of values and broad goals identified to inform and guide the approach to the design of a building, open space or other aspect of the built environment. Wellbeing The degree to which individuals feel their physical, emotional and social needs are met. It includes all aspects of community life that have a direct influence on the physical and mental health of its members and the quality of the environment around them.
