T2DM: A \"Sweet\" Walk Through Time Samuel Gonzalez, an obese 58-year-old Hispanic man presents to his primary care provider (PCP) feeling constantly tired and sleepy. When questioned, he complains he is drinking more soda than usual because he feels thirsty all the time and also reports blurred vision and decreased sensation in his feet. As a construction work er, he wants to feel better so he can do his job. What additional questions should be asked about Samuel's symptoms? What lab tests would you expect to be ordered to evaluate his problems? What diagnosis would you expect? On brief history alone, could you have identified classic risk factors for diabetes mellitus? What diagnostic criteria would confirm your suspicions? Once the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is confirmed, what are the next steps in helping Samuel manage his chronic condition? At the completion of this course, you will be able to guide Samuel, and countless others with T2DM, to better health.In the first five minutes that you are reading this course, two people will die of diabetes- related causes and fourteen adults will be newly diagnosed (CDC, 2014). T2DM is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (the number one cause is cardiovascular disease). More than 29.1 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (CDC, 2014). That's about 1 in every 10 Americans. The disease has become a new epidemic in our country; however, it is not a new disease. * * * Diabetes mellitus is an ancient disease, the clinical symptoms of which were identified b y the ancient Egyptians more than 3000 years ago (Ebbell, 1937). The Greek word diabetes means \"to siphon through\" and describes polyuria (excess urination), which is a classic symptom of hyperglycemia. Centuries after diabetes was recognized, the term mellitus, which means \"sweet honey,\" was added to describe the sweet urine identified with chronic hyperglycemia (Ahmed, 2002). For centuries there was no known reversal of symptoms for diabetes. Treatment strategies varied from starvation to overfeeding, bleeding, and even riding horseback to stop the polyuria. During the opium trade, patients were treated with opium (known as \"doping\"), which didn't cure the disease\u2014but the patients probably didn't care! None of these treatments cured diabetes because for centuries the cause for the sweet and high v olume of urine was unknown. Then in 1673 a German scientist removed a pancreas from a dog and induced diabetes mellitus, creating the same symptoms of excessive thirst and polyuria. Nearly two centuries later unique pancreatic cells were identified as the source of sugar problems in the blood and urine. The juicy substance of the pancreas, distinct from the ex ocrine juices, was named insulin (Latin for \"island\") in 1916 (Pratt, 1954). *Islets of Langerhans: Insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, discovered by and named for the scientist Paul Langerhans (1847- 1888). Once the lack of insulin was identified as the cause for diabetes mellitus, several scientists worked to extract, refine, and administer the substance. A German scientist, Georg Zuelzer (1870-1949), successfully injected the pancreatic extract into eight patients with diabetes; however, his research was halted due to demands that he work on weaponry for World WarI. Similarly , a Romanian physician, Nicolas Paulescu (1869-1931), injected the pancreatic solution into the jugular veins of diabetic dogs, reversing symptoms, but his research was halted by the same world war (Pratt, 1954).A continent a way from European researchers, Canadians Frederick Banting (1891-1941) and Charles Best (1899-1965) isolated the insulin molecule and receiv ed credit for the discovery of insulin in 1921 (Pr att, 1954). They successfully filed a patent and contr acted with Eli Lilly , a pharmaceutical compan y, to manufacture the newfound \"medication. \" Scientists and ph ysicians then began to understand the relationship between insulin and sugar in the bloodstream. Insulin w as identified as an anabolic hormone, which builds the body and allows nutrients that are eaten to enter the body cells for growth and life. So , over man y millennia and through the contributions of numerous ph ysicians and scientists, we finally understand the powerful connection between sugar and insulin. Sugar comes from the carboh ydrates we eat and it requires insulin in order to mo ve from the blood into the cells of the body and be used as energy . Without insulin, or minimally sufficient amounts, sugar remains in the bloodstream causing h ypergly cemia, which is the hallmark symptom of diabetes mellitus (DM). Hypergly cemia causes high blood osmolarity (concentr ation of particles), which pulls w ater from tissues in an attempt to dilute the blood, causing polyuria and deh ydration. The deh ydration in turn causes polydipsia (ex cessiv e thirst) and the cy cle of ex cess urination and deh ydration continues. Without the needed energy from glucose the cells ma y starv e, and the individual ma y lose weight as the body breaks down fat and protein for alternate sources of energy . The resulting classic triple signs of diabetes are shown in the bo x below . Classic Triple Signs of Diabetes Polyuria (ex cessiv e urination) Polydipsia (ex cessiv e thirst) Polyphagia (extreme hunger) Walking through time together to learn about the millennia-old disease of diabetes mellitus helps us to appreciate how far we ha ve come in understanding this growing epidemic.

The Sco pe of Dia betes Unfortunately , diabetes has become a common disease in the United States and worldwide. About 9% of Americans ha ve DM, and 90% to 95% of them ha ve type 2 diabetes (ADA, 2015). Americans living in po verty are more lik ely to ha ve diabetes than middle-class and affluent Americans. Diabetes has also been correlated with obesit y, creating a new term among healthcare professionals called \"diabesit y.\" Alarmingly the trend is increasing each decade in our country , with a higher incidence of both diabetes and obesit y that is projected to worsen. With current trends of obesit y and metabolic syndrome, b y the y ear 2030, 1 in ev ery 3 people will dev elop diabetes mellitus (Wild et al. , 2004).

B. by early Egyptians and A yurvedic healers o ver 3000 y ears ago . C. by the American Diabetes Association in 1960. D.Source: CD C, 2015. As shown in the abo ve graph, from 1980 through 2014 the percentage of the civilian, non- institutionaliz ed population with diagnosed diabetes mellitus increased b y: 200% (from 0.6% to 1.8%) for aged 0-44 y ears 124% (from 5.5% to 12.3%) for those aged 45-64 y ears 127% (9.1% to 20.7%) for those aged 65-74 y ears 126% (8.9% to 20.1%) for those aged 75 y ears and older In gener al, the percentage of people with diagnosed diabetes has increased among all age groups. In 2014 the percentage of diagnosed diabetes among people aged 65 to 74 (20.7%) w as more than 11 times that of people y ounger than age 45 (1.8%). It has been said 80% of people older than age 75 will ev entually dev elop DM due to pancreatic fatigue and the prev alence of obesit y. The number of Americans with diagnosed diabetes has more than tripled from 5.5 million in 1980 to 22 million (CDC, 2014). Look ed at pr agmatically , that becomes job securit y for y ou as a healthcare professional! Prevalence of Diabetes by YearSource: Ad vanced Adrenal Education, 2011. Worldwide Prevalence of T2DM Diabetes is increasing dr amatically throughout the world. As countries become industrializ ed, with less manual labor , their populations become more sedentary and people eat a higher calorie W estern diet, which fosters the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. More than 3% of the world' s population has been diagnosed with diabetes, with the highest concentr ations in dev eloped countries. Prevalence of T2DM Across the World Prediabetes and Metabolic SyndromeDue to the burden of rising numbers of people with DM, more attention has been directed at prev enting the disease. In efforts to screen for diabetes, millions more individuals are being identified as ha ving prediabetes , which presents as higher -than-normal blood sugar levels\u2014but not quite high enough to diagnose as diabetes mellitus. A normal fasting blood sugar is 60 to 100 mg/dL. Diabetes is diagnosed b y a fasting blood sugar >125 mg/dL. Prediabetes, or impaired fasting glucose, is diagnosed b y a fasting blood glucose >100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL. The prev 2000 to 34% b y 2010 (Abr aham & F ox, 2013). It is estimated that 19% of Americans currently ha ve prediabetes, which is 86 million Americans age 20 and older , and up from 79 million in 2010 (ADA, 2014). Picture y ourself in a room of 100 people: 19 people will ha ve prediabetes, 8 of them will have type 2 diabetes, 1 will ha ve type 1 diabetes and another 34 will ha ve metabolic syndrome, which is another risk factor that will be discussed later in this course (Aguilar et al., 2015). The Cost of Diabetes Gener ally when we speak of the cost of an ything, we are referring to economic cost. The costs of diabetes, howev er, are not only financial but also in terms of morbidit y and mortalit y. Economic Cost Diabetes mellitus is an expensiv e disease. The total estimated cost of diabetes mellitus in the United States in 2012 w as $245 billion. Direct medical costs were $176 billion, which includes doctor visits, surgeries, hospitalizations, prescription medications to treat complications, inpatient nursing sta ys, and medical supplies. An additional $69 billion is estimated for loss in productivit y, sick da ys, early retirement due to illness, and other factors (ADA, 2012). The majorit y (62%) of the costs are paid b y government insur ance progr ams such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the military , which means taxpa yers are pa ying the bill. Those without insur ance ha ve 55% more emergency department (ED) visits, increasing the overall cost of problems that ma y have been prev entable with adequate medical care and health coaching. The trend is mo ving tow ard increased economic costs; the medical expenses in 2012 were 41% higher than 2007, which w as $174 billion. The human cost, howev er is ev en more. Loss of enjo yable qualit y of life and relationships ma y be the more tragic costs. Mortality (Death)Diabetes is listed as a contributor to 10% of American deaths. This mak es diabetes the seventh leading cause of death listed on U .S. death certificates. Although cardio vascular disease is listed as the number one cause of death, people with diabetes mellitus are at 4 to 6 times greater risk for cardio vascular disease, still placing diabetes as a top cause of premature death. Ov erall, the risk for death among people with diabetes is twice that of people of similar age without diabetes (NIDDK, 2008). Adults with diabetes ha ve a 59% higher risk for death than nondiabetics. Morbidity (Illness) A person with diabetes is more lik ely to be hospitaliz ed than is a person without diabetes. The hospital sta y is lik ely to be longer due to complications (Moghissi et al. , 2009). Diabetes hospitalizations are largely due to the other major health problems caused or worsened b y diabetes (NIDDK, 2008). Chronic h ypergly cemia is the primary metabolic problem of T2DM. P ersistent ex cess glucose in the blood damages tissues throughout the body. People with long-standing t ype 2 diabetes can ha ve cardio vascular damage, kidney destruction, retinal damage, peripher al nerv e damage, foot problems, poor wound healing, and an increased risk of dev eloping Alzheimer 's disease. These problems gener ally begin years before diabetes is ev en diagnosed. For example: Heart disease. People with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more lik ely to die of heart disease than people without diabetes. Stroke. People with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more lik ely to ha ve a strok e than people without diabetes. High blood pressure. Three out of four people with diabetes ha ve hypertension. Eye damage. In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness. Kidney disease. In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. Nerve damage. 60% to 70% of people with diabetes ha ve nerv e damage, known as neuropathy . Amputations. In the United States, the majorit y of nontr aumatic leg or foot amputations is in people with diabetes. Dental disease. One out of three people with sev ere periodontal disease ha ve diabetes.By identifying diabetes early, many chronic complications can be avoided or minimized. For example, cardiovascular and microvascular complications may be prevented or delayed when glycemic levels are controlled. A hallmark study known as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) revealed maintaining blood glucose levels to a near-normal level may significantly reduce chronic complications. The DCCT demonstrated in 1993 that microvascular complications could be reduced up to 70% when glycemic goals are within near-normal levels. Answer: DTest Your Knowledge What percentage of Americans have diabetes mellitus? Apply Your Knowledge What can you do to make an impact on the high statistics of diabetes? Classification of Diabetes Mellitus The classification of diabetes mellitus includes Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes, plus a catchall known simply as \"other.\" Clinical Definition of DM Diabetes is defined by the American Diabetes Association as \"a group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels\" (ADA, 2015).50% of adultsA. 35% of adults, or over 86 million peopleB. 1 in 100C. 9% of adults, or over 29 million peopleD.Diabetes is a disorder that causes chronically high concentr ations of sugar (blood glucose) in the bloodstream. This chronic h ypergly cemia gr adually produces tissue damage, especially to ey es, kidneys, nerv es, heart, and both large (macro) and small (micro) blood vessels. T o simplif y the definition for patients, y ou could sa y that in diabetes the body doesn' t use food effectiv ely. Although the hallmark symptom of diabetes is h ypergly cemia, as noted abo ve there are four different classes or t ypes of diabetes based on the different pathologies in volved. Scen arios Several patients ma y present with similar symptoms but be diagnosed with different t ypes of diabetes mellitus. See if y ou can determine what t ype of diabetes each patient has. Patient 1 An 8- year-old Caucasian girl presents with polyuria, poly dipsia, weight loss, and fatigue for two months. Patient 2 A 57- year-old obese African American man presents with polyuria, poly dipsia, weight loss, and fatigue for two months. Patient 3 A 28- year-old o verweight pregnant Hispanic woman presents with polyuria, poly dipsia, and fatigue for two months. Patient 4 A 15 y ear-old Caucasian girl presents with polyuria, poly dipsia, and fatigue for 2 months. * * * Each one of these patients presents with v ery similar symptoms and all result in a diagnosis of DM, y et each has a different pathology and can be diagnosed with a different type of diabetes. Patient 1 has t ype 1 diabetes mellitus, and labs would probably rev eal the patient has insulinopenia , or absence of endogenous insulin, gener ally due to an autoimmune response that resulted in destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. This patient would require insulin injections for the rest of her life.Patient 2 has dev eloped t ype 2 diabetes with risk factors of age, ethnicit y, and obesit y. This patient will need str ategies for weight loss, meal planning, and probable combinations of antih ypergly cemic medications for the rest of his life if lifest yle beha vior change is not enough to control h ypergly cemia. Patient 3 has gestational diabetes, possibly with risk factors of ethnicit y and o verweight. This patient will probably require insulin injections for the dur ation of the pregnancy . Gener ally, after deliv ery the h ypergly cemia will resolv e. This patient ma y be at risk to later develop t ype 2 diabetes if she remains o verweight or obese after the pregnancy . Patient 4 has the \"other \" class of diabetes, which includes mature onset diabetes of the young (MOD Y), and is a genetic predisposition to insulin resistance. The \"other \" category also includes latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA) and other endocrinopathies such as poly cystic o varian syndrome. This patient ma y or ma y not require insulin injections but will gener ally be able to control h ypergly cemia with or al antih ypergly cemics and balancing mo vement and meals. * * * Knowing the diagnostic criteria is essential to identif y who qualifies as ha ving DM and what is the best treatment str ategy to control h ypergly cemia. The ADA 2015 appro ved four tests, which include: FPG >125 mg/dl on two different da ys. FPG is the fasting plasma glucose, the blood concentr ation of glucose after >8 hours of no caloric e. A random blood glucose concentr symptoms of chronic and unexplained weight mg/dl on two different da ys. OGTT is an or al glucose-toler ance test, the measurement of a person' s blood glucose lev el 2 hours after drinking 75 g of anhydrous glucose dissolv ed in w ater. A1C of 6.5% or higher (ADA, 2015) Hypergly cemia on only one of the four tests is sufficient for a diagnosis of DM. Additional tests ma y be ordered to confirm the difference between t ype 1 and t ype 2 and include a C - peptide (which measures how much insulin the body can produce), auto- antibody studies (which rev eal an autoimmune response seen in t ype 1 and LADA) and genetic studies (which ma y reveal a genetic disorder as in MOD Y). Categories of DM There are four major categories of diabetes: t ype 1, t ype 2, gestational, and \"other .\" Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, or T1DM, is char acteriz ed by insufficient insulin secretion. T ype 1 diabetes usually results from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas. P eople with type 1 diabetes need exogenous (sources outside the body) insulin to surviv e. People with t ype 1 diabetes represent only 5% to 10% of all people with diabetes (Maitr a, 2009). People with t ype 1 diabetes cannot mak e sufficient insulin to surviv e. In the past, t ype 1 diabetes w as called \"insulin-dependent diabetes. \" The ADA changed the nomenclature as more patients with t ype 2 became dependent on insulin for sugar regulation, which w as confusing to both patients and healthcare pro viders; so the name reverted back to \"t ype 1. \"Type 1 diabetes has also been called juvenile diabetes because it t ypically appears in children and y oung adults. T ype 1 diabetes can present as an acute illness; howev er, the destruction of the beta cells ma y have been occurring for weeks prior to the acute symptoms. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, or T2DM, is the most common form of diabetes, and is char acteriz ed by insulin resistance, or sluggish response of insulin after food consumption. T ype 2 diabetes represents 90% of all people with diabetes. Insulin resistance is the reduced response of skeletal muscle cells to tak e up insulin. T ype 2 diabetes is char acteriz ed by two main defects: insulin resistance, in which man y cells in the body become less responsiv e to insulin; and beta cell deterior ation, which leads to sluggish production of insulin b y the pancreas. Even before the disease shows clinical signs and symptoms, mildly elev ated blood glucose (BG) lev els can be detected in tests. This stage of the disease is called prediabetes . The progression of t ype 2 diabetes is gr adual. Ov er the y ears, the individual' s prediabetes worsens, especially if the person is o verweight and inactiv e. Type 2 diabetes w as once called \"adult -onset diabetes\" because the disease dev elops slowly and t ypically appears in older adults. Ninet y to ninet y-five percent of all present cases of diabetes are t ype 2; howev er, the age at which the condition is being diagnosed continues to lower , even including obese children. In the United States, t ype 2 diabetes is found in less than 2.5% of people aged 20 to 39 y ears, 10.5 % of people aged 40 to 59 years, and 23% of people 60 y ears of age or older . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressiv e disease that inevitably worsens o ver time, ev en with appropriate management and maintenance of the ther apeutic regimen. F or man y individuals, up to 50% of beta cell function is lost b y the time the diagnosis is made. An additional 3% to 5% ma y be lost in each subsequent y ear (UK Prospectiv e Diabetes Study Group , 1998). P eople with t ype 2 diabetes also ha ve a progressiv ely reduced secretion of insulin. Initially , man y people with t ype 2 diabetes can liv e without additional insulin; howev er, the disease worsens, and man y people with t ype 2 diabetes ev entually need insulin because of the dur ation of the disease and pancreatic fatigue. Given the r apid increase in the number of people with this condition, and the increasingly younger age when the disease is diagnosed, healthcare pro viders need to be skilled in detection, management, education, and prev ention str ategies in order to decrease the overall burden on health and finances to patients and their families.Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diabetes that dev elops for the first time during pregnancy and is seen as persistent h ypergly cemia. Due to the o verall stress of the pregnancy , and with additional risk factors similar to those of t ype 2 diabetes, such as obesit y, sedentary lifest yle, high-fat diet, age, ethnicit y, and genetic predispositions, almost 21% of all pregnancies ma y dev elop h ypergly cemia. Recommendations for GDM include: Screen for undiagnosed T2DM at the first prenatal visit in those with risk factors, using standard criteria. In pregnant women not previously known to ha ve diabetes, screen for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation with a 75-g, 2h OGT T using the following stricter diagnostic cutoff points: Fasting >92mg/dL in the morning after an o vernight fast of at least 8 hours 1 hour >180mg/dL 2hour >153mg/dL If undiagnosed T2DM is suspected to ha ve existed at the time of pregnancy , rescreen at 6 to 12 weeks' postpartum, using standard criteria. Women diagnosed with GDM should ha ve lifelong screening for the dev elopment of T2DM or prediabetes at least ev ery 3 y ears (ADA, 2012) Other Types of Dia betes Types of diabetes that fall into the \"other \" class of diabetes mellitus include MOD Y, LADA, endocrinopathies, and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). MODY is a genetic mutation in an autosomal dominant gene that affects insulin production. Individuals with this diagnosis are gener ally children less than age 25 with a family history of diabetes for gener ations. These children still produce some insulin and are clinically closer to a t ype 2. They ma y or ma y not require insulin. LADA presents in y oung adults in their twenties and can be confused as t ype 2 because of age; howev er, they do not produce an y insulin and are clinically similar to t ype 1, requiring insulin. They ha ve often been labeled as \"diabetes 1.5\" because they are clinically between type 1 and t ype 2.Endocrinopathies may include poly cystic o varian syndrome, pancreatic cancer or tumors, and other hormonal disruptions in insulin production. Impaired fasting glucose presents as an FBG higher than 100 mg/dl but less than 126 mg/dl, so it does not qualif y as full diabetes mellitus.

Which diagnostic test is appropriate to diagnose this patient? Rationale: The FBS must be administered on two separ ate occasions, not just one. The A1C cannot be used because symptoms have only been reported for 1 month and the A1C is most accur ate over 3 months. The 2-hour postpr andial also requires two occasions. The r andom BG with symptoms is most helpful. S ymptoms alone are not adequate because the polyuria ma y be caused by a urinary tr act infection (UTI) or other problem. Apply Your Knowledge Explain in y our own words, as if y ou were teaching a newly diagnosed patient with diabetes, what the difference is between the four classes of diabetes. Regulation of Blood Glucose Regulation of glucose in the body is done autonomically and constantly throughout each minute of the da y. Normal BG lev els should be between 60 and 140 mg/dL in order to supply cells of the body with its required energy . Brain cells don' t require insulin to driv e glucose into neurons; howev er, there must still be normal amounts a vailable. T oo little glucose, called hypoglycemia , starv es cells, and too much glucose ( hyperglycemia ) creates a sticky , paralyzing effect on cells. Eugly cemia, or blood sugar within the normal range, is natur ally ideal for the body' s functions. A delicate balance between hormones of the pancreas, intestines, br ain, and ev en adrenals is required to maintain normal BG levels. Fuels of the BodyA fasting blood sugar (FBS) on one occasionA. An A1CB. A 2-hour postpr andial C. A random blood glucose (BG) with symptoms D.To appreciate the pathology of diabetes, it is important to understand how the body normally uses food for energy . Glucose, fats, and proteins are the foods that fuel the body . Knowing how the pancreatic, digestiv e, and intestinal hormones are in volved in food metabolism can help y ou understand normal ph ysiology and how problems dev elop with diabetes. Throughout the body , cells use glucose as a source of immediate energy . To keep the body running smoothly , a continuous concentr ation of 60 to 100 mg/dL of glucose in blood plasma is needed. During ex ercise or stress the body needs a higher concentr ation because muscles require glucose for energy (Basu et al. , 2009). Of the three fuels for the body , glucose is preferred because it produces both energy and w ater through the Krebs cy cle and aerobic metabolism. The body can also use protein and fat; howev er, their breakdown creates k etoacids, making the body acidic, which is not its optimal state. Ex cess of ketoacids can produce metabolic acidosis. Functioning body tissues continuously absorb glucose from the bloodstream. F or people who do not ha ve diabetes, a meal of carboh ydrates replenishes the circulating blood glucose about 10 minutes after eating and continues until about 2 hours after eating. A first-phase release of insulin occurs about 5 minutes after a meal and a second phase begins at about 20 minutes. Because the dur ation of insulin' s effect is only about 2 hours, taking a 2-hour postprandial (after meal) BG shows how well insulin w as released and used b y the body . The food is brok en down into small components including glucose and is then absorbed through the intestines into the bloodstream. Glucose (potential energy) that is not immediately used is stored b y the body as gly cogen in the muscles, liv er, and fat. Your body is designed to surviv e and so it stores energy efficiently , as fat. Most Americans have excess fat because they replenish the glucose stores b y eating before an y fat needs to be brok en down. When blood glucose lev els fall after 2 hours, the liv er replenishes the circulating blood glucose b y releasing gly cogen (stored glucose). Glycogen is a polysaccharide, made and stored primarily in the cells of the liv er. Glycogen pro vides an energy reserv e that can be quickly mobiliz ed to meet a sudden need for glucose. Hormones of the Pancreas Regulation of blood glucose is largely done through the endocrine hormones of the pancreas, a beautiful balance of hormones achiev ed through a negativ e feedback loop . The main hormones of the pancreas that affect blood glucose include insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and am ylin.Insulin (formed in pancreatic beta cells) lowers BG lev els, whereas glucagon (from pancreatic alpha cells) elev ates BG lev els. Somatostatin is formed in the delta cells of the pancreas and acts as the \"pancreatic policeman, \" balancing insulin and glucagon. It helps the pancreas alternate in turning on or turning off each opposing hormone. Amylin is a hormone, made in a 1:100 r atio with insulin, that helps increase satiety , or satisfaction and state of fullness from a meal, to prev ent overeating. It also helps slow the stomach contents from empt ying too quickly , to a void a quick spik e in BG lev els. As a meal containing carboh ydrates is eaten and digested, BG lev els rise, and the pancreas turns on insulin production and turns off glucagon production. Glucose from the bloodstream enters liv er cells, stimulating the action of sev eral enzymes that con vert the glucose to chains of gly cogen\u2014so long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postpr andial or \"fed\" state, the liv er tak es in more glucose from the blood than it releases. After a meal has been digested and BG lev els begin to fall, insulin secretion drops and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy , the liv er breaks down gly cogen and con verts it to glucose for easy tr ansport through the bloodstream to the cells of the body (Wikipedia, 2012a). In a health y liver, up to 10% of its total v olume is used for gly cogen stores. Sk eletal muscle cells store about 1% of gly cogen. The liv er con verts gly cogen back to glucose when it is needed for energy and regulates the amount of glucose circulating between meals. Your liv er is amazing in that it knows how much to store and k eep, or break down and release, to maintain ideal plasma glucose lev els. Imitation of this process is the goal of insulin ther apy when glucose lev els are managed externally . Basal-bolus dosing is used as clinicians attempt to replicate this normal cy cle. While a health y body requires a minimum concentr ation of circulating glucose (60-100 mg/dl), high chronic concentr ations cause health problems and to xic: Acutely : Hypergly cemia of >300 mg/dl (>500 mg/dl) leads to confusion, al edema, coma, and, eventually , death (F errante, 2007). Chronically : Hypergly cemia that a verages more than 120 to 130 mg/dl gr adually damages tissues throughout the body and mak es a person more susceptible to infections. The glucose becomes syrup y in the bloodstream, intoxicating cells and competing with life-giving o xygen.The concentr ation of glucose in the blood is determined b y the balance between the r ate of glucose entering and the r ate of glucose lea ving the circulation. These signals are deliv ered throughout the body b y two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon (Maitr a, 2009). Optimal health requires that: When blood glucose concentr ations are low , the liv er is signaled to add glucose to the circulation. When blood glucose concentr ations are high, the liv er and the sk eletal muscles are signaled to remo ve glucose from the circulation.

D.The Role of Insulin Insulin is a peptide hormone made in the beta cells of the pancreas that is centr al to regulating carboh ydrate metabolism in the body (Wikipedia, 2016). After a meal, insulin is secreted into the bloodstream. When it reaches insulin-sensitiv e cells\u2014liv er cells, fat cells, and striated muscle\u2014insulin stimulates them to tak e up and metaboliz e glucose. Insulin synthesis and release from beta cells is stimulated b y rising concentr ations of blood glucose. Insulin has a r ange of effects that can be categoriz ed as anabolic , or growth- promoting.

Inhibits the uptak e and use of glucose b y skeletal muscles. C. Is manufactured and secreted b y the alpha cells of the pancreas. D.The Role of Glucagon Glucagon , a peptide hormone secreted b y the pancreas, r aises blood glucose lev els. Its effect is opposite to insulin, which lowers blood glucose lev els. When it reaches the liv er, glucagon stimulates glycolysis , the breakdown of gly cogen, and the export of glucose into the circulation. In these w ays, the effects of glucagon are catabolic , breaking down cells\u2014 the opposite of insulin' s anabolic effects (Druck er, 2008). The pancreas releases glucagon when glucose lev els fall too low . Glucagon causes the liv er to con vert stored gly cogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High BG levels stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be tak en up and used b y insulin-dependent tissues, such as muscle cells. Glucagon and insulin work together automatically as a negativ e feedback system to k eeps BG lev els stable. Glucagon is a powerful regulator of BG lev els, and glucagon injections can be used to correct sev ere hypogly cemia. Glucose tak en orally or parenter ally can elev ate plasma glucose lev els within minutes, but ex ogenous glucagon injections are not glucose; a glucagon injection tak es appro ximately 10 to 20 minutes to be absorbed b y muscle cells into the bloodstream and circulated to the liv er, there to trigger the breakdown of stored glycogen. People with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve excess glucagon secretion, which is a contributor to the chronic h ypergly cemia of t ype 2 diabetes. The amazing balance of these two opposing hormones of glucagon and insulin is maintained b y another pancreatic hormone called somatostatin , created in the delta cells. It truly is the great pancreatic policeman as it works to k eep them balanced. Complementary Roles of Insulin and GlucagonAfter you've eaten, the concentration of glucose in your blood rises. When it goes too high the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. This insulin stimulates the liver to convert the blood glucose into glycogen for storage. If the blood sugar goes too low, the pancreas release glucagon, which causes the liver to turn stored glycogen back into glucose and release it into the blood. Source: Google Images.

Is used to treat h ypergly cemia b y increasing the uptak e of glucose in muscles. B. Is a hormone that acts on the liv er to con vert gly cogen back into glucose. C. Stimulates the production of insulin.D.Amylin is a peptide hormone that is secreted with insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas in a 1:100 r atio. Amylin inhibits glucagon secretion and therefore helps lower BG levels. It also dela ys gastric empt ying after a meal to decrease a sudden spik e in plasma BG lev els; further , it increases br ain satiety (satisfaction) to help someone feel full after a meal. This is a powerful hormone in what has been called the br ain-meal connection. People with t ype 1 diabetes ha ve neither insulin nor am ylin production. P eople with t ype 2 diabetes seem to mak e adequate amounts of am ylin but often ha ve problems with the intestinal incretin hormones that also regulate BG and satiet y, causing them to feel hungry constantly . Amylin analogues ha ve been created and are a vailable through v arious pharmaceutical companies as a solution for disorders of this hormone. The Role of Incretins Incretins are glucagon-lik e peptides (hormones) made in cells of the small intestine and secreted into the circulation in response to food intak e (Cernea & R az, 2011). Incretins go to work ev en before blood glucose lev els rise following a meal. They also slow the r ate of absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream b y reducing gastric empt ying, and they ma y also help decrease food intak e by increasing satiet y. People with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve lower than normal lev els of incretins, which ma y partly explain wh y man y people with diabetes state they constantly feel hungry . After research showed that BG lev els are influenced b y intestinal hormones in addition to insulin and glucagon, incretin mimetics became a new class of medications to help balance BG lev els in people who ha ve diabetes. Two types of incretin hormones are GLP-1 (glucagon-lik e peptide) and GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide). Each peptide is brok en down b ally occurring enzymes called DDP-4, (dipeptidyl peptidase-4). Exenatide (By etta), an injectable ed as a glucagon-lik e peptide (GLP-1) and directly mimics the glucose-lowering effects of natur al incretins upon oral ingestion of carboh ydrates. The administr ation of ex enatide helps to reduce BG levels by mimicking the incretins. Both long- and short -acting forms of GLP-1 agents are currently being used. The functions of incretins are as follows: Stimulate insulin secretion Suppress glucagon secretion Slow gastric empt ying to prev ent spik e in BG lev elsIncrease satiet y after a meal to signal to the br ain to stop eating Incretins are deactiv ated quickly b y enzymes called DPP-4, in the bloodstream and on the surface of endothelial cells; thus, the glucose-lowering effects of incretins last only a few minutes (Druck er & Nauck, 2006). A new class of medications, called DPP4 inhibitors, block this enzyme from breaking down incretins, thereb y prolonging the positiv e incretin effects of glucose suppression. An additional class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4 inhibitors\u2014note h yphen), are a vailable in the form of sev eral orally administered products. These agents will be discussed more fully later . Incretins Stimulate Insulin Release Source: Wi kimedia Commons. Poor Regulation of Blood Glucose People with diabetes ha ve frequent and persistent h ypergly cemia, which is the hallmark sign of diabetes. F or people with t ype 1 diabetes, who mak e no insulin, glucose remains in the blood plasma without the needed BG-lowering effect of insulin. Another contributor to this chronic h ypergly cemia is the liv er. When a person with diabetes is fasting, the liv er secretes too much glucose, and it continues to secrete glucose ev en after the blood lev el reaches a normal r ange (Basu et al. , 2009). Another contributor to chronic h ypergly cemia in diabetes is sk eletal muscle. After a meal, the muscles in a person with diabetes tak e up too little glucose, lea ving blood glucose levels elev ated for extended periods (Basu et al. , 2009). The metabolic malfunctioning of the liv er and sk eletal muscles in t ype 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction, ex cess glucagon, and decreased incretins. These problems dev elop progressiv ely.Early in the disease the existing insulin resistance can be counter acted b y excess insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas, which try to address the h ypergly cemia. The hypergly cemia caused b y insulin met b y hyperinsulinemia. Ev entually , howev er, the beta cells begin to fail. Hypergly cemia can no longer be matched b y excess insulin secretion, and the person dev elops clinical diabetes (Maitr a, 2009). Answer: DTest Your Knowledge People with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve: Apply Your Knowledge How would y ou explain to y our patient what lifest yle beha viors create insulin resistance? The Problem of Insulin Resistance In type 2 diabetes, man y patients ha ve body cells with a decreased response to insulin known as insulin resistance. This means that, for the same amount of circulating insulin, the sk eletal muscles, liv er, and adipose tissue tak e up and metaboliz e less glucose than normal. Being less sensitiv e to insulin, the liv er does not react to the usual signal of insulin, so the liv er manufactures and secretes more glucose than is needed (Huether & McCance, 2012). Insulin resistance can dev elop in a person o ver man y years before the appear ance of t ype 2 diabetes. P eople inherit a propensit y for dev eloping insulin resistance, and other health problems can worsen the condition. F or example, when sk eletal muscle cells are bathed in excess free fatt y acids, the cells preferentially use the fat for metabolism while taking up and using less glucose than normal, ev en when there is plent y of insulin a vailable. In this way, high lev els of blood lipids decrease the effectiv eness of insulin; thus, high cholesterol and body fat, o verweight and obesit y increase insulin resistance.Insulin sensitivit y, which is an o ver-reaction of cells to insulin. A. No beta cells in their pancreas and no circulating insulin at all.B. Chronic h ypogly cemia. C. Insulin resistance, which is a decreased response of cells to insulin.D.Physical inactivit y has a similar effect. Sedentary o verweight and obese people accumulate triglycerides in their muscle cells. This causes the cells to use fat r ather than glucose to produce muscular energy . Physical inactivit y and obesit y increase insulin resistance (Monnier et al. , 2009). The Problem of Beta Cell Dysfunction For people with t ype 1 diabetes, no insulin is produced due to beta cells destruction. Research shows this is an autoimmune response gone a wry, attacking the body' s own cells. Triggers of that autoimmune response ha ve been link ed to milk, v accines, en vironmental triggers, viruses, and bacteria. For people with t ype 2 diabetes, a progressiv e decrease in the concentr ation of insulin in the blood dev elops. The continuously decreasing a vailabilit y of insulin in t ype 2 diabetes is the direct result of a progressiv e worsening of the beta cells' abilit y to produce enough insulin when it is needed (Huether & McCance, 2012). Not only do the beta cells release less insulin as t ype 2 diabetes progresses, they also release it slowly and in a different pattern than that of health y people (Monnier et al. , 2009). Without sufficient insulin, the glucose- absorbing tissues\u2014mainly sk eletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue\u2014do not efficiently clear ex cess glucose from the bloodstream, and the person suffers the damaging effects of to xic chronic h ypergly cemia. At first, the beta cells manage to manufacture and release sufficient insulin to compensate for the higher demands caused b y insulin resistance. Ev entually , howev er, the defectiv e beta cells decrease their insulin production and can no longer meet the increased demand. At this point, the person has persistent h ypergly cemia. In t ype 2 diabetes, beta cells seemingly exhaust their capacit y to adapt to the long-term demands of peripher al insulin resistance (Huether & McCance, 2012). A down ward spir al follows. The h ypergly cemia and h yperinsulinemia caused b y the o ver- stressed beta cells create their own failure. In t ype 2 diabetes, the continual loss of functioning beta cells shows up as a progressiv e hypergly cemia.

Video (11:46) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTjDi2ZO0n8 Cell Damage in DM Together , insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion lead to h ypergly cemia, which causes most of the health problems in diabetes. The acute health problems\u2014diabetic ketoacidosis and h yperosmolar h ypergly cemic state\u2014 are metabolic disorders that are directly caused b y an o verload of glucose. In comparison, the chronic health problems\u2014 eye, heart, kidney , nerv e, and wound problems\u2014 are tissue injury , a slow and progressiv e cellular damage caused b y feeding tissues too much glucose (ADA, 2015). Understanding Insulin Resistance and What Y ou Can Understanding Insulin Resistance and What Y ou Can ......Beta cells in the pancreas cannot compensate for insulin resistance.A. The pancreas is attack ed by the body' s immune system, resulting in pancreatitis.B. The liv er becomes o verly sensitiv e to insulin. C. Glucose cannot be used as fuel b y any cells in the body . D.Hypergly cemic damage to tissues is the result of glucose to xicity. There are at least three distinct routes b y which ex cess glucose injures tissues: Over time, ex cess glucose attaches to proteins in a process called glycosylation . For example, gly cosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), is the labor atory measure to monitor average gly cemic lev els. Gly cosylated proteins trigger inflammatory reactions, which injure the lining of blood v essels. In addition, gly cosylated proteins stick together on the basement membr anes of capillaries, thick ening the endothelial la yers and disrupting their normal function. Excess intr acellular glucose activ ates an enzyme called protein kinase C , which encour ages the growth of unnecessary blood v essels, leads to blood v essel constriction, thick ens basement membr anes, and releases pro-inflammatory molecules such as C -reactiv e protein and homocysteine. Excess intr acellular glucose reduces the effectiv eness of the intr acellular activities that protect against o xidants and o xidativ e stress. This leads to o xidativ e damage, especially in neurons. (Maitr a, 2009) Risk F actors for Diabetes Mellitus As in an y disease, there are modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors that cause the disease. Genetics, gender , ethnicit y, and age are all noncontrollable. P eople with t ype 1 diabetes who ha ve a genetic predisposition to a heightened and destructiv e autoimmune response cannot control it. P eople who are o ver 65 and of African American descent are at greater risk for dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes, but cannot control those factors. F ollowing a brief discussion of genetics we w ant to focus on the controllable risk factors that we can modif y to prev ent diabetes. Genetic Factors Genetics is lik e being handed a loaded pistol, but the lifest yle beha viors of obesit y, overeating, sedentary lifest yle, and so on are what pull the trigger . It has been said 90% of all chronic diseases can be triggered or prev ented b y lifest yle choices, especially diet and exercise. A person' s genome is a strong determinant of the chance of dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes. F or example, if a dizy gotic (fr aternal) twin dev elops t ype 2 diabetes, the chances are about 25% that the other twin will also dev elop the disease. The disease risk doubles if the twins are monozy gotic (identical): if a monozy gotic twin dev elops t ype 2 diabetes, the chances are about 50% that the other twin will also dev elop the disease (Maitr a, 2009). People with these genetic predispositions, howev er, do not alw ays dev elop clinical diabetes.It appears that, to dev elop t ype 2 diabetes, other health problems must interv ene to activate or worsen the insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction (Maitr a, 2009). P eople with a genetic predisposition ma y be able to prev ent the full dev elopment of the disease b y health-promoting lifest yle beha viors that prev ent overweight and obesit y. Type 2 diabetes is polygenic , meaning that it usually in volves the expression of more than one problematic gene. More than twent y variant genes ha ve been documented as potential contributors to the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes, and the problematic genes are found on a number of chromosomes. There is no single combination of genes that leads to t ype 2 diabetes. Instead, the expressions of a v ariety of combinations of problematic genes ma y create full dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. \"Accumulating data suggest that t ype 2 diabetes is lik ely a collection of man y closely related diseases with v arying but often o verlapping primary mechanisms that in volve both impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance\" (Gr ant et al. , 2009). Answer: CTest Your Knowledge Type 2 diabetes: Apply Your Knowledge Your patient w ants to know wh y he dev eloped t ype 2 diabetes. What risk factors would you review? Controllable Risk Factors Certain health problems are closely associated with the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. These health problems are neither absolute nor independent causes of the disease; that is, not all people with these problems dev elop t ype 2 diabetes. Nonetheless, they are major risk factors because they help to initiate or to worsen t ype 2 diabetes in people with the predisposition for it. Major risk factors for t ype 2 diabetes include obesit y, physical inactivit y, unhealth y diet, hypergly cemia, stress, and chronic inflammation.Is an inevitable disease of aging.A. Is inevitable in people whose families ha ve the disease. B. May dev elop in genetically predisposed people with additional risk factors. C. Is usually caused b y the mutation of a single gene called T2D . D.Fat that is inside the fat\u2014differs metabolically from subcutaneous fat. Intra-abdominal fat is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. A person's waist circumference is a good indicator of the amount of fat inside the person's abdomen (NHLBI, 2015).Obesity Excess body fat causes insulin resistance, and the risk for dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes increases as the proportion of body fat increases. Body mass index (BMI) is used to measure the proportion of body fat to total body weight. The risk is higher when ex cess fat has accumulated inside the abdominal ca vity, as opposed to under the skin. Ex cess intr a-abdominal fat is a feature of more than 4 out of 5 patients with t ype 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue encour ages insulin resistance in a number of w ays. Ex cess fat, especially viscer al fat, leads to higher blood lev els of fatt y acids, and fatt y acids reduce glucose uptak e, causing insulin resistance in sk eletal muscle. Additionally , in obese individuals, adipose tissue releases less adiponectin , a hormone that reduces insulin resistance. Ex cess adipose tissue also secretes additional pro- inflammatory molecules ( cytokines ), which increase insulin resistance. The increased insulin resistance from all these causes leads to h yperinsulinemia, which further weak ens dysfunctional beta cells (ADA, 2015). Answer: ATest Your Knowledge A health problem that directly increases the risk of dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes is: Apply Your Knowledge What is the first beha vior modification y ou should focus on for most people with t ype 2 diabetes? Change in Prevalence of Obesity (by BMI) 2005-2010Intra-abdominal fat. A. Periodontal disease. B. Foot injuries. C. Osteoporosis.D. Source: CD C. Physical Inactivity Physical inactivit y is another major risk factor for the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. In part, this results from the tendency of sedentary people to accumulate trigly cerides in their muscle cells and gain weight. Physical ex ercise is a powerful counterforce to insulin resistance. Regular ex ercise impro ves glycemic control and reduces the risk of dev eloping cardio vascular complications in people with t ype 2 diabetes. \"Furthermore, regular ex ercise ma y prev ent type 2 diabetes in high- risk individuals\" (ADA, 2015). Poor DietAny dietary habits that lead to obesit y also increase a person' s chances of progressing from prediabetes to diabetes. A high-carboh ydrate diet challenges the glucose-lowering abilit y of a person with prediabetes and acceler ates the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. A high-fat, low -fiber diet, especially one that includes satur ated and tr ans fats, causes dyslipidemias, which worsen insulin resistance and foster the dev elopment of t ype 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia A controllable risk factor of diabetes mellitus is progressiv e hypergly cemic states that can be caused b y frequent high-carboh ydrate consumption. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that become o verloaded with glucose are less able to tak e up more glucose, thus hypergly cemia contributes to insulin resistance, prediabetes, and ev entually diabetes (Buse et al., 2008). Stress Stress activ ates the sympathetic autonomic nerv ous system in the \"fight or flight \" reaction. Cortisol , known as the stress hormone from the adrenals, increases and acts as a counter -regulatory hormone to insulin. Cortisol elev ates BG lev els in an attempt to deliv er glucose to muscle cells so as to fight the stressor . Chronic stress leads to chronic hypergly cemia, which in turn increases insulin resistance and triggers t ype 2 diabetes in predisposed people. Chronic Inflammation Type 2 diabetes alters the functioning of the immune system. T ogether , insulin resistance, hypergly cemia, and h yperinsulinemia create a persistent inflammatory reaction. A t the same time, a chronic inflammatory state leads to chronic h ypergly cemia, which then contributes to the progression of t ype 2 diabetes (O'Connor et al. , 2006). People who are in a constant state of emotional and ph ysical stress are continually in a mild state of inflammation. Their blood shows persistent elev ations of molecules of inflammation, such as C -reactiv e protein and interleukin-6. The pro-inflammatory cytokines causer an elev ation in the lev el of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is the direct stimulant of cortisol secretion. Inflammation increases the lev el of blood glucose, causing hypergly cemia and ev entual insulin resistance. F oods, injury , stress, and other disease processes can all create chronic inflammation. Diagnosing Diabetes MellitusSigns and Symptoms of T2DM Diabetes is diagnosed b y documenting h ypergly cemia through blood tests. In addition to blood tests, the initial examination of a patient suspected of ha ving diabetes includes a history and ph ysical examination that looks for signs of disease. Clinical Presen tation Three symptoms\u2014polyuria, poly dipsia, and weight loss\u2014ha ve defined diabetes for centuries. This description written one hundred y ears ago still applies: The symptoms are usually gr adual in their onset, and the patient ma y suffer for a length of time before he thinks it necessary to apply for medical aid. The first symptoms that attr act attention are failure of strength, and emaciation, along with great thirst and an increased amount and frequent passage of urine. From the normal quantit y of from 2 to 3 pints in the 24 hours it ma y be increased to 10, 20, or 30 pints, or ev en more. It is usually of pale colour , and of thick er consistence than normal urine, possesses a decidedly sweet taste, and is of high specific gr avity. (Ency clopaedia Britannica, 1911) In addition to the classic triad of polyuria, poly dipsia, and weight loss, people with diabetes are often weak, frequently hungry between meals, ma y have blurred vision, and are prone to infections. Hypergly cemia can present with v omiting, abdominal pain, deh ydration, mental status changes, or coma (ADA, 2015). Man y times people are newly diagnosed after presenting to an emergency department with acute symptoms that can mimic a flu.

The exam includes: Height, weight, and calculation of body mass index (BMI) Blood pressure, including the blood pressure response to standing (orthostatic measurement) when autonomic dysfunction is suspected Funduscopic ey e exam Skin exam for poorly healing injuries and signs of reduced circulation Foot exam, including palpation of pulses and tests of fine sensation (proprioception, vibration, light touch) and reflex es using a monofilament and tuning fork (ADA, 2015) Laboratory Test Results Blood Glucose Tests The patient 's blood glucose lev els are used to diagnose and to monitor diabetes. F our glucose tests giv e a snapshot of a patient 's current abilit y to regulate blood glucose lev els: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is tak en at least 8 hours after the patient has had any nourishment. Diabetes is char acteriz ed by an FPG >126 mg/dl. Postprandial glucose level (PPG) is tak en 1 to 2 hours after a meal. Diabetes is characteriz ed by any random PPG >200 mg/dl with test (OGTT) postpr andial glucose test. The OGT T is tak en 2 hours after the patient has ingested 75g of or al glucose. Diabetes is char acteriz ed by an OGT T >200 mg/dl at the 2 hour time mark. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) measures the satur ation of hemoglobin molecules over the life of a red blood cell, which is 3 months. The normal r ange is 4-6 mg/dL. Source: Monnier et al., 2009.A1c Values Degree Glycemic Control A1c value Degree of blycemic control <6.5% Near normal 6.5-7.2% Well controlled 7.3-9.3% Moderately controlled >9.3% Poorly controlled In 2010 the American Diabetic Association adopted standards recommending the use of the A1c test to diagnose diabetes with a threshold set at 6.5%. The A1c test reflects the average glucose satur ation o ver three months time and is strongly predictiv e of diabetic complications at higher lev els. The A1c has sev eral adv antages o ver the FPG and OGT T, including greater con venience because fasting is not required. A1c testing is recommended at the following interv als: Twice a y ear to measure o verall control of diabetes Quarterly in the patient whose ther apy has changed, or who is not meeting goals As needed, using P oint of Care testing to mak e timely decisions regarding change of therapy Anemia and hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, ma y distort true results of A1c testing if the red blood cells are impaired. F or conditions with abnormal red blood cell turno ver such as pregnancy , recent blood loss, and tr ansfusion, the diagnosis of diabetes must use one of the other three tests instead of A1c. If symptoms ha ve not been present for three months prior to diagnosis, an A1c ma y not be accur ate as it represents the average of three months. Other Blood Tests To assess for diabetic complications, baseline v alues are needed for:Fasting lipids (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and trigly cerides) Liver function tests Kidney function test (serum creatinine and glomerular filtr ation r ate, GFR) (ADA, 2015) Urine Tests Urinalysis for albumin (ADA, 2015) Urine for microalbumin (thought to be a more sensitiv e assa y for albumin; an early indicator of nephropath Prediabetes and Metabolic Sy ndrome Diagnosing Prediabetes By ying patients with prediabetes, it is possible to interv ene to prev ent diabetes and its complications and impro ve future health. Prediabetes is diagnosed b y the same blood sugar screening lab tests as diabetes. The person' s blood sugar lev els will show a higher BG than the normal r ange but below full diabetes, which is between 100 and 125 mg/dL. It is estimated 86 million Americans o ver age 20 ha ve prediabetes, which is 1 out of ev ery 3 adults (FDA, 2015). Prediabetes ma y not manifest with acute symptoms and is mainly detected b y blood glucose screening tests. An y of four criteria can be used to diagnose prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose BG abnormalities that qualif y as metabolic syndrome: Impaired fasting glucose , which is a fasting plasma glucose lev el between normal and diabetes Impaired glucose tolerance , which is an or al glucose-toler ance test result between normal and diabetes Presence of three of the five disorders of metabolic syndrome The chance that a person with prediabetes will progress to t ype 2 diabetes is high. A person without prediabetes has about a 5% chance of dev eloping diabetes in six y ears. In contrast, a person with an FPG and an OGT T in the prediabetes r ange has about a 65% of developing diabetes in six y ears (Garber et al. , 2008). Managing Prediabetes The goals of treating prediabetes are to slow its progression into t ype 2 diabetes and to reduce the person' s chance of dev eloping cardio vascular disease or micro vascular complications (retinopath y, nephropath y, and neuropath y) (Garber et al. , 2008). Step one in treating prediabetes is intensiv e lifest yle management. Without lifest yle changes, 15% to 30% of people with prediabetes will progress to t ype 2 diabetes within five years (CDC, 2015). The same principles and education are used to treat diabetes. The first recommendation is weight loss : a weight loss goal of 5% to 10% to be achiev ed by reducing the person' s intak e of calories and increasing the person' s physical activit y. Weight loss medications ha ve often been giv en to help reach this goal; howev er, the FDA strongly cautions patients about man y such pharmaceuticals. Because lifest yle modification and health y living beha viors can be difficult to maintain for man y people, most of them progress to needing pharmacologic assistance for weight loss and lowering BG. The following cautions are included on weight -loss drugs for prediabetes and T2DM:Sibutramine (Meridia). In October 2010 the FDA recommended against further use of this drug, as it is associated with unnecessary cardio vascular risks to patients.

Step two in treating prediabetes is anti-diabetic drug therapy , especially for patients at high risk for dev eloping diabetes complications. High-risk patients include those with metabolic syndrome, current cardio vascular disease, progressiv ely worsening hypergly cemia, nonalcoholic fatt y liver disease, a history of gestational diabetes, or polycystic o vary syndrome. Metformin has been appro ved for the treatment of prediabetes b y the FDA and is a top tier medication after lifest yle beha vior modification, which should include ex ercise and meal planning education. Acarbose has also been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and promote weight loss. Other pharmaceutical agents, including am ylin analogues and incretin mimetics, ha ve joined the arsenal for ph ysicians to use for people with prediabetes. People with prediabetes are giv en the same health coaching and guidance as those with diabetes, and management is focused on beha vioral change for health y lifest yles. P atients with prediabetes should also be treated to reach the same lipid and blood pressure goals as patients with diabetes. Answer: BTest Your Knowledge Prediabetes: Apply Your Knowledge What national and state health progr ams are a vailable to help decrease the rising incidence of prediabetes? Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that r aise y our risk of heart disease, diabetes, and strok e. The term metabolic refers to the biochemical processes of a body that is functioning normally . Metabolic syndrome identifies a person as ha ving dysfunctional metabolic processes that put the person at risk for comorbidities. The American Heart Association (AHA) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) identif y metabolic syndrome if there are an y three of these fiv e criteria: Waist circumference Large w aistline (>40 inches in men; >30 inches in women) For people of non- Asian origin >102 cm in men or >88 cm in women For people of Asian origin >90 cm in men or >80 cm in women High trigly cerides >150 mg/dl or on medicines for high HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dl for men, <50 mg/dl for women, or on medicines for low HDL cholesterol High fasting blood glucose >100 mg/dl or diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetesIs diagnosed when the fasting blood glucose lev el is >126 mg/dl.

F or example, insulin resistance can lead to hyperlipidemia and h ypertension; h ypertension increases the lik elihood of dev eloping diabetes; and centr al obesit y can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. P eople tend to have more than one of these disorders at a time (Buse et al. , 2008).

A single disorder that puts a person at risk for psoriasis.D.The Dia betes Hea lthcare Team People with diabetes mellitus can often feel alone and o verwhelmed b y all that is needed to manage diabetes. The realit y is that millions of people are a vailable to help pro vide education and resources and they should be considered part of their own healthcare team. The tr aditional approach to patient care w as to see the patient as sick and helpless, forced to be compliant with the prescribed medical regimen. A new er a has refreshingly changed the par adigm to patient-centered , with all efforts to help increase self -management using the resources and tools pro vided b y the team. The ADA has, in fact, declared the focus of diabetes education to be self -management, not mere compliance with a ph ysician. Team members include the primary care pro vider, nurses, diabetes educators, dieticians, podiatrists, optometrists, pharmacists, social work ers, and more. The diabetes patient is the da y-to-da y disease manager on the team. F or example, a licensed nurse with special training and education can teach each patient how to check daily BG lev els, how to tak e medications, and how to care for injuries and wounds. A dietician can help the patient learn how to plan a health y and manageable nutrition plan based on their culture, food preferences, and economic limitations. In addition, a patient with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist or optometrist for an annual dilated ey e exam. The patient should ha ve regular dental exams. Kidney , artery , or foot problems should be monitored b y the appropriate specialists. If the patient is ha ving psychological or mood problems, a mental health professional should be in volved (ADA 2015). The patient should be referred to a certified diabetes educator , who is a health professional dev oted to helping the patient achiev e self -care beha viors and positiv e behavioral change tow ard health. Each of these professionals is a part of the whole patient team. Diabetes self management education (DSME) is focused on beha vior change. A critical part of caring for people with diabetes is teaching them the o verall treatment plan and how to care for themselv es (ADA, 2015). P eople with diabetes ha ve better outcomes when they understand their disease and ha ve the skills and coaching to manage their liv es so as to keep their BG lev els as close to normal as possible (Strine, 2005). Those people who ha ve not receiv ed formal diabetes self -management education ha ve knowledge gaps, don' t receiv e prev entive services, and are more prone to dev elop chronic complications (K ent, 2013; Strine, 2005).Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) ha ve additional education and tr aining regarding diabetes mellitus and are gener ally co vered under insur ance benefits. A certified diabetes educator (CDE) is a nurse, pharmacist, ph ysician, social work er, or dietician who must tak e a certif ying exam after 1,000 qualif ying hours of working in diabetes education. Adv anced practice nurses, ph ysicians, those with prescribing abilities, and those who ha ve a master 's degree in diabetes education ma y choose to tak e the board certification exam to earn the BC-CDE designation, which focuses on management of diabetes. Public health work ers, health coaches, and non-certified diabetes educators, such as dieticians and nurses without the certification, can be a tremendous support in promoting beha vior change. The ADA and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) ha ve dev eloped similar DSME progr ams that includes focus on sev en topics and self -care beha viors: The AADE has coined them the AADE7 self -care beha viors. An ADA -appro ved diabetes self - management educational progr am focuses on empowering the person with diabetes to achiev e the following: Understand the basics of diabetes and its treatment How to plan nutritious meals How to incorpor ate ph ysical ex ercise into daily life The importance of smoking cessation How to tak e diabetes medicines properly and safely How to prev ent, recogniz e, and cope with acute complications of diabetes How to prev ent, recogniz e, and cope with chronic complications of diabetes How to prev ent, recogniz e, and cope with social and psy chological difficulties caused by diabetes Stress management Click here for an online resource of the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators.Health y eating 1.

Psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. 7.Treatment Strategies fo r Diabetes This is the best time in the history of the world to ha ve diabetes because there are so many treatment str ategies, pharmacologic options, and resources. The o verall goal for a person with diabetes is to learn to liv e as full and health y a life as possible within their physical limitations and to a void complications. Research concludes that k eeping blood glucose lev els as close to normal as possible will help them achiev e this goal. Str ategies to reach the o verall goal focus on gly cemic control through impro ved health y living beha viors. Medical care of diabetes begins with a baseline medical ev aluation. The patient 's current degree of glucose control is assessed, the presence and state of an y diabetes complications are documented, and an y aggr avating conditions, such as obesit y or ph ysical inactivit y, are evaluated. Diabetes is a life-long illness, and people need a life-long plan for diabetes self - management. It is crucial that the patient be a part of the goal making and not subject to some isolated notations b y a ph ysician. As with an y complex health issue, a diabetes care plan begins with a problem list that can be managed b y a ph ysician or diabetes educator . Each item on the list is assigned a goal, and a specific str ategy for reaching the goal. F or diabetes, the problem list begins with \"controlling blood glucose lev els,\" the goal might be \"lower A1c to <6.5%, \" and the strategy would include \"weight loss, increased ex ercise, dietary changes, and (possibly) medications. \" Next, each existing diabetic complication is listed. One item on the list, for example, might be \"glaucoma, \" the goal might be \"reduce daily ocular pressure to <22 mm Hg, \" and the strategy might be \"refer to an ophthalmologist. \" Potential complications are also listed; for example, one might be \"at risk for kidney damage, \" and the goal might be \"w atch for indications of kidney dysfunction, \" and the str ategy might be \"schedule annual serum creatinine lev el measurements, calculate corresponding GFRs, and test urine for albumin. \" Another example of a medical goal is \"elev ated trigly cerides (250 mg/dl), \" cerides to <150 mg/dl, low-fat diet, and increased ph ysical activit y.\" The full problem list with its goals and str ategies needs to be shared with the patient and, ideally , the care team. The pro vider and the patient will both ha ve the o verall plan in mind and will be able to monitor its progress and share its successes. The patient must be involved with the goal making process or success will be limited. The Primary Goal: Glycemic ControlThe degree to which a patient 's blood sugar lev el is closely regulated is called the patient 's glycemic control . Poor gly cemic control leads to chronic h ypergly cemia, which is the underlying cause of diabetic health problems. The first priorit y of diabetes care is to strengthen gly cemic control. FPG and PPG Levels Reducing h ypergly cemia is the goal of diabetic disease control. The degree of a patient 's hypergly cemia\u2014the lev el of gly cemic control\u2014is monitored in two w ays: The a verage degree of gly cemic control can be followed b y measuring the patient 's blood concentr ation of gly cosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c. This test represents a more stable a verage blood glucose o ver the preceding 120-da y period. The current degree of gly cemic control can be followed b y measuring the daily lev els of blood glucose before breakfast and after a meal. Home glucose monitors, which require ev er-smaller amounts of blood to produce a reliable readout, ha ve impro ved this aspect of management; howev er, these v alues fluctuate to a consider able degree during the course of a da y. One w ay to monitor a patient 's glycemic control is to chart and monitor fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels. These measurements are taken by the patient, and the patient or a family member should learn to use a home glucose meter . The American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2015) recommends that most adult patients should aim to maintain goals of: FPG (fasting plasma glucose) = 70-130 mg/dl and Peak PPG (postpr andial glucose) = <180 mg/dl All patients with diabetes should learn to monitor their own blood glucose with a glucose meter and be giv en time to pr actice in front of a diabetes educator to confirm the correct procedure. R egular monitoring can pro vide feedback to patients of how activit y, emotions, and meals affect their BG lev els. R esearch pro vides evidence of a strong association between frequency of self -monitoring of blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (Miller et al. , 2013). P eople can mak e needed daily adjustments b y knowing their glucose number throughout the da y rather than just in the doctor 's office ev ery 3 to 6 months. Patients taking diabetes medications, especially insulin, should also be taught how to adjust their medications, diet, and activit y in response to h ypogly cemia and hypergly cemia.Technology has greatly strengthened the abilit y to measure BG throughout the da y due to the continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Normally the body regulates BG through constant feedback between insulin, glucose, somatostatin, and chemoreceptors in the blood that measure blood osmolarit y (concentr ation of particles). P eople with diabetes have lost effectiv e autoregulation, which results in chronic h ypergly cemic episodes. CGM consists of a glucose sensor , a transmitter , and a small external monitor that allow us to view BG lev els in real time. A small needle is inserted in subcutaneous tissue and shows glucose trends in tissue fluid. CGM is a vailable through sev eral manufacturers but is more expensiv e than con ventional home BG meters. CGM pro vides helpful information to patients managing their own BG lev els, especially those with h ypogly cemic una wareness who ma y not recogniz e symptoms when their BG is dropping. There are doz ens of blood glucose monitors that ha ve different features and costs. Each January the ADA publishes in their Diabetes Forecast magazine a full consumer guide of meters currently on the mark et, which can be helpful in comparing devices and products. A1c Lev els Another good measure of gly cemic control is the patient 's A1c lev el. The American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2015) recommends that adult non-pregnant patients should aim to maintain a goal of A1c <6.5%. Lowering A1c to below or around 6.5% has been shown to reduce micro vascular and macro vascular complications of t ype 1 and t ype 2 diabetes. A1c v alues show the a verage glucose lev el for the past three months, so swings between hypergly cemia and h ypogly cemia, are smoothed out, which ma y not be the true picture. It is important that people taking insulin ha ve more immediate feedback about their blood glucose concentr ation, so daily FPG and PPG monitoring is crucial. Current research also concludes that o verall BG control after meals appears to be a more powerful indicator of overall gly cemic control than FPG lev els.

In the prediabetic stage, a patient 's metabolic compensatory mechanisms ma y be able to a void significant periods of h ypergly cemia. When people with T2DM no longer ha ve the abilit y to k eep their blood glucose lev els within a near to normal r ange, adequate gly cemic control can usually be maintained with a health y diet, weight reduction, and increased ph ysical ex ercise.

D. 7 Self-Care Behaviors Source: Co pyright \u00a9 American Association of Diabetes Educators, 2015. Weight Loss Weight loss is often of primary importance. Ex cess weight is a direct cause of insulin resistance, and, as the ex cess weight increases, the gly cemic control decreases. When the excess fat is viscer al (inside the abdomen as opposed to directly under the skin), the diabetogenic effect is worse (Maitr a, 2009). Eight y to ninet y percent of people with t ype 2 diabetes are o verweight, and a weight loss of 5% to 10% of the person' s body weight will decrease: Average blood glucose lev els Excess glucose secreted b y the liv er Excess blood insulin that appears during fasting Overall insulin resistance One of the first steps in helping an o verweight person regain better control of their BG levels is to encour age them to lose weight. F ormal weight loss progr ams that include low - calorie diets, beha vior modification, and regular ex ercise ha ve been shown to produce sufficient weight loss to impro ve the gly cemic control of o verweight patients with T2DM. An effectiv e goal is a 5% to 10% weight loss (Joffe & Y anagisa wa, 2007). There are no magic weight loss diets, and it is alw ays necessary to reduce people' s daily calories for them to lose weight. In the long run, low -carboh ydrate diets (<130 g carboh ydrates) seem to be about as effectiv e and as safe as low -fat diets, but without intensiv e effort either v ariety of diet t ypically produces only modest weight loss (ADA, 2015). F or those with t ype 2 diabetes who are v ery obese and ha ve a BMI >35 kg/m2, bariatric surgery ma y be considered, because in man y cases it can dr amatically impro ve the patient 's glycemic control (ADA, 2015).Weight loss 1.

Prevention of complications 7.Meal Planning The patient 's diet is an important component of the plan to k eep blood glucose lev els under control. An organiz ed approach to a patient 's overall diet and eating habits is called medical nutrition therapy (MNT). In medical nutrition ther apy, registered dieticians specializing in diabetes work with patients to plan both meal content and eating schedules. The goals are to minimiz e hypergly cemic episodes and to fit the proper meals into the patient 's lifest yle. Appropriately planned eating has been shown to reduce the A1c lev els of patients with t ype 2 diabetes b y 2% to 3% in 6 months. Although numerous studies ha ve attempted to identif y the optimal mix of macronutrients for meal plans of people with diabetes, it is unlik ely that one such combination of macronutrients exists. The best mix of carboh ydrate, protein, and fat appears to v ary depending on individual circumstances (ADA, 2015). Diets must be tailored to individual patients. Nonetheless, there are some gener al principles that can be used as a starting point for patients with T2DM, such as knowing the basic macronutrients of carboh ydrates, fats, and proteins and the micronutrients of vitamins and miner als (ADA, 2015). Gener al recommendations include: Calories Reduction in total calories is usually needed. Fats Reduction in total fats is helpful. Most important is the reduction in satur ated fatt y acids, tr ans fatt y acids, and cholesterol. Satur ated fat should be <7% of total daily calories. T rans fats should be reduced as close to z ero as possible. Carboh ydrates Carboh ydrates should be limited to about 130 g/da y, divided among all the meals. When eating a v aried diet, patients need to estimate the carboh ydrate content of many different meals. F or this, carboh ydrate counting or carboh ydrate ex change rules are two methods that can be used and taught. Fiber Dietary fiber is an important part of an y diet plan. The current recommendations are 14 g of dietary fiber per da y for ev ery 1,000 calories of food; this is 25 g of dietary fiber daily for women and 38 g for men (Amer . Diet. Assoc. , 2015)Miscellaneous F oods Sugar alcohols e sweeteners can be used in moder ation. Alcohol should be limited to 1 drink/da y for women and 2 drinks/da y for men. Antioxidant supplements (vitamin C, vitamin E, or carotene) are recommended only if evidence of deficiency is seen. Chromium supplements are recommended only if a deficiency is seen. (ADA, 2015) Answer: DTest Your Knowledge A health y diabetic diet should include: Apply Your Knowledge What is y our current consumption of calories, fats, proteins, carboh ydrates, fiber , water, vitamins, and miner als? How is y our nutrition? Exercise Movement and ex ercise helps patients with t ype 2 diabetes control their blood glucose levels and reduces their risk of dev eloping cardio vascular disease. The minimum recommendation is 30 minutes of moder ate-intensit y physical activit y 3 da ys ev ery week. Brisk w alking is an example of moder ate-intensit y physical activit y. The positiv e effects of exercise on gly cemic control last for 2 to 3 da ys, but it is recommended that people exercise at least ev ery other da y. Exercise can tempor arily create h ypergly cemia as muscles use up existing blood glucose and the liv er releases stored gly cogen to sustain the activit y. Monitoring BG lev els before exercise, and ev ery hour for long-term activit y, is important to a void hypogly cemia. If BG levels are >200 mg/dL it is recommended to increase w ater consumption and carefully monitor BG throughout activit y to void further elev ating BG lev els.Chromium supplements.A. Antioxidant supplements. 260 g of carboh ydrates daily . C. Less than 7% of daily calories as satur ated fats. D.At the other extreme, h ypogly cemia can be a problem. Some people with T2DM who are taking insulin or insulin secretagogues will become h ypogly cemic with ex ercise. P eople with gener ally good gly cemic control are least lik ely to dev elop sev ere hypogly cemia. Those patients who tend to get h ypogly cemic easily can prepare for ex ercise b y lowering their insulin dose or b y increasing their carboh ydrate intak e before ex ercising. Other conditions require diabetic patients to check with their doctor before beginning an exercise progr am. P atients with sev ere peripher al neuropath y can unknowingly damage their feet during ex ercise that is hard on their lower limbs. In addition, sev ere retinopath y is sometimes a reason to a void vigorous bouncing or head-lowering t ype ex ercise. Exercise progr ams should be tailored to each patient. F or example, people who ha ve been sedentary should begin their ex ercise progr am at low intensit y and gr adually increase the amount and time of their ph ysical activities (Marwick et al. , 2009). To have a significant effect, regular activit y must become a continuing part of a patient 's life. Human nature rev eals we stick to ex ercise goals more consistently when the activities are in a structured setting and when we report our progress to someone, such as attending regular classes and reporting the record. Health professionals and diabetes educators can encour age patients to just mo ve more in their daily activities.

D.Monitoring is a str ategy for o verall diabetes management but it includes much more than just monitoring blood glucose lev els. It also means to monitor blood pressure, lipid lev els, A1c, weight, BMI, liv er function, kidney function, skin and foot care, infections, vision, and overall health condition. It is highly recommended that a patient with diabetes follow up regularly with the primary care pro vider for ev aluation of gly cemic control, prev ention of complications, and treatment for an y additional comorbidities. Medications Medication management often becomes necessary for gly cemic control ev en after lifest yle modification efforts ha ve been made. Ov er time, T2DM worsens, and the degree and frequency of h ypergly cemia increase into a r ange that threatens tissue damage, resulting in eye, kidney , nerv e, and artery problems. When ther apeutic lifest yle changes become insufficient to maintain good gly cemic control for T2DM, it is time to consider medications. Physicians, APNs, and P As ha ve more options to consider when prescribing antihypergly cemic medications. In the past the only options were injectable insulin and or al sulfon ylureas. T oday, over nine classes of medications are a vailable, with multiple br ands and dosages within each class of drugs. The goal of all medications used to manage diabetes is to maintain glucose lev els as near normal as possible while minimizing the danger of h ypogly cemia or other adv y antih ypergly cemic medication is measured b y a drop in A1c lev els. The higher the baseline A1c, the greater the expected reduction (T riplitt, 2014).

Knowing the organ and site of action will also help y ou remember the side effects as alter ations in the action site often produce adv erse effects in that same location. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors act on the intestines to slow the absorption of food. Therefore, gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort are common. It 's also important to note that a patient taking an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor won' t respond quickly to a fast -acting sugar to treat h ypogly cemia because the medication will blunt its absorption. Instead of taking a fast-acting glucose, these patients should consume milk (a lactose sugar), which won' t be blocked and can help treat h ypogly cemia. Biguanides are the first -tier medication suggested b y the ADA and AACE after lifest yle modification. The generic metformin has similar or superior effects to second-gener ation sulfon ylureas and to the more and meglitinides. Metformin acts on sev eral action sites including the liv er and sk eletal muscle cells, so liv er function tests must be done annually and the patient should be taught the symptoms of lactic acidosis. Metformin tends to cause less weight gain than other diabetes medicines. It also poses a smaller risk of adv begins with metformin (AACE, 2015). Combination ther be e than single-drug ther apies and, when metformin is not sufficient to k eep A1c lev els under 6.5%, another medication ma y be added. Currently , no one drug is recommended as the best addition to metformin. Healthcare pro viders (HCPs) choose b y balancing cost, drug side effects, and the individual patient 's toler ance for the medicine. HCPs and patients can feel comfortable using older medications such as metformin and second-gener ation sulfon ylureas, as monother apy or in combination, before newer diabetes medications such as DPP4 inhibitors or meglitinides, especially when cost is a factor (Bolen et al. , 2007). The dopamine agonist known as bromocriptine has been added to the list of FDA -appro ved medications for diabetes and recogniz ed by the ADA despite incomplete understanding of its action. It appears to act on regulating the body' s circadian rh ythms, which can help impro ve metabolism and control weight. DPP-4 inhibitors act on the enzyme that degr ades incretin hormones in the intestines. They enhance the action of the incretin hormones, which slows the absorption of sugars in the intestines. Interestingly , side effects include respir atory problems such as nasopharyngitis, nasal stuffiness, and headache. The DPP-4 agents are tak en orally on a daily basis.Glucagon-lik e peptides are called incretin mimetics , whereas DPP-4 inhibitors are known as incretin . Both of these agents offer important adv antages o ver previously used drugs for T2DM. They both promote weight loss (or are weight neutr al) by slowing gastric empt ying and increasing satiet y. Both inhibit glucagon secretion and counter regulatory mechanisms. Use of these agents as monother apy has a low association with hypogly cemia and there is no recommendation for increased self -monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG); howev er, when used in combination with a secretagogue or insulin, more frequent monitoring of blood glucose is recommended (ADA, 2015). GLP-1s and DPP-4s preserv e beta-cell function and secretion, which has the potential to slow the progression of the disease. The GLP-1 agents are injectables with v arying dosing schedules that r ange and bid to weekly (qw) dosing. Adv erse affects include nausea, v omiting, diarrhea, gastric and intestinal distress and lipodystrophies from injections. Clinical trials and post mark eting reports ha ve identified additional safet y risks that are under activ e investigation for the incretin-based ther apies. P ancreatitis has been reported with each of the agents, but a clear association has not y et been established; it should be noted that people with T2DM already ha ve a three-fold higher incidence of pancreatitis compared to normogly cemic control. GLP-1 agents are being studied for a potential association with medullary th yroid cancer . These agents should be a voided where a family history of this cancer exists. Renal safet y is an additional consider ation with the GLP-1 agents and the DPP-4 agent gener al, saxagliptin has safet all the more serious adverse-effect categories: pancreatitis, cardio effects, h ypersensitivit y, renal ev ents, and increased risk for bone fr acture compared to other agents in this group . Meglitinides act on the pancreas to promote insulin secretion in the pancreas just as the sulfon ylureas do , which puts them at greater risk for causing h ypogly cemia. Sodium-glucose tr ansporter 2 inhibitors (GL T2) are a new class of drugs that act in a completely new w ay to lower blood glucose. This class acts b y blocking kidneys from excreting sucrose into the bloodstream. Within the last fiv e years, the FDA has appro ved new drugs in this class for use in T2DM. In vokana is tak en as an or al agent, once daily . Invokana w as appro ved by the FDA based on nine studies in volving more than 10,000 patients. The trial showed impro vement in both A1c and fasting plasma glucose. In vokana may be used alone or in combination with other agents to control T2DM.The most common side effects seen with this agent are y east infections and urinary tr act infections arising from increased amounts of sugar in the urine. An additional side effect was hypotension due to the increased ex cretion of fluids. The FDA noted that the drug ma y carry some increased heart risks during the first 30 da ys of use, suggesting the need for increased surv eillance and careful patient selection. In vokana is only recommended for patients with T2DM and should not be used in those patients who ha ve sev ere renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, or for those receiving dialysis. For decades, sulfon ylureas had been the only or al option for T2DM. Each new gener ation impro ved the potency critical adv erse affect, howev er, is hypogly cemia, because this class increases insulin ex cretion from the pancreas. It is, natur ally, not appro ved for T1DM because those patients ha ve no insulin to be stimulated. Sulfon ylureas come in combination with man y of the other classes of medications and can be used as mono , dual, or triple ther apy. Thiaz olidinediones (TZDs, as they are commonly known) are a class of medication introduced in the early 1990s to treat T2DM. TZDs act b y increasing muscle cell sensitivit y to endogenous insulin and adv erse effects ha ve been noted in muscular organs such as the heart muscle. As a group , these drugs ha ve had an interesting history char acteriz ed by initial high hopes alternating with strong w arnings or being remo ved from the mark et altogether . The first agent in this class, troglitaz one (R ezulin) w as tak en off the mark et in the late 1990s due to an increased incidence of drug-induced hepatitis. F or sev eral years following the remo val of troglitaz one, no TZDs were in common use. In 1999 rosiglitaz one (A vandia) w as introduced to the mark et. As post mark eting information began to accumulate that showed an increased association with coronary events\u2014including heart attack, edema and congestiv e heart failure (CHF)\u2014it came under closer scrutin y. In September 2010, rosiglitaz one w as withdr awn from the mark et in German y and Fr ance and placed under restrictions in the United States due to these cardio vascular effects. In F ebruary 2011, the FDA issued an advisory that no new patients be started on this agent, and consider ation be giv en regarding patient preference that they be switched to another drug in the class, pioglitaz one (Actos). In the spring of 2011, pioglitaz one had a w arning issued due to an increased association with bladder cancer when used o ver 12 months. German y and Fr ance pulled pioglitaz one from the mark et in June 2011.Currently there are restrictions and w arnings on the two drugs in this class that are still available with regard to their abilit y to cause or worsen CHF , as well as the association of Actos with bladder cancer . Clinicians are advised to carefully consider the risks and benefits of TZDs as well as combination products containing them. The following is a summary of the combination products that include a TZD: Avandamet: A vandia + metformin (restricted or al anti-diabetic medications: Apply Your Knowledge Identif y the affected organ of each class of medications.

Pramlintide (S ymlin); with meals Glucagon-lik e peptides Action: similar to natur al incretin. Increases insulin secretion, slow stomach empt ying and reduces appetite. Albiglutide (T anzeum); weekly Dulaglutide (T rulicit y); daily Liraglutide daily Amylin analogues are synthetic imitations of the natur ally occurring am ylin produced in the pancreas and administered b y injection. Just as insulin cannot (y et) be giv en orally due to stomach acid, which mak es oral ingestion ineffectiv e, am ylin must be giv en by injection. Pramlintide (S ymlin) has man y of the same incretin actions of the GLP-1 agents, ex cept that it does not stimulate insulin secretion; it acts b y slowing gastric empt ying, thus suppressing glucagon release b y the liv er. It also promotes earlier satiet y, with the result that fewer calories are consumed, leading to subsequent weight loss. Similar to the other GLP-1 agonists, S ymlin is administered as a subcutaneous injection prior to meals. Also similar to the GLP-1 agents, it is associated with significant nausea, which ma y limit the abilit y to administer the agent at ther apeutic doses. S ymlin ma y be used for patients with either T1DM or T2DM. When the patient is also receiving insulin, the dose ma y need to be lowered. Pr amlintide (S ymlin) carries a black bo x warning for sev ere hypogly cemia 3 hours post injection. F or patients who are not sensitiv e to symptoms of hypogly cemia, known as hypoglycemic unawareness , this is not an ideal agent. Nevertheless, in a carefully selected population, the lowering of the HgA1c b y up to 1% and the associated weight loss ma y result in significant impro vement in o verall management of diabetes.Glucagon-lik e peptides, a kind of incretin hormone, act to slow glucose absorption in the intestines and buffer the spik e of blood glucose after a meal. This class of medication must be tak en by injection, and patient instruction includes teaching the difference between this and insulin, especially if they are also taking insulin. The most recent impro vements in antidiabetic pharmaceuticals has been this class because the potency now allows once a week injection, which increases patient adherence. Adv erse affects are found in the intestines, howev er, as this is the organ of action. Use of Insulin in T2DM As type 2 diabetes continues it follows a down ward spir al and the pancreatic beta cells weaken consider ably. At some point, the beta cells secrete so little insulin that adequate glycemic control requires the patient to tak e insulin (ADA, 2015). The following table summariz es types of insulin commonly used with T2DM.

One common regimen begins b y adding a long-lasting insulin injection once daily to the existing oral medication(s). The ideal regimen of insulin is the basal-bolus method because it provides the best ph ysiologic action and control. Howev er, man y patients are reluctant to adopt a more complicated routine, so introducing insulin using a simpler str ategy impro ves adherence. Choice of insulin and timing of injection is influenced b y man y factors, including the patient 's visual acuit y and coordination to correctly dr aw the dose, the abilit y to titr ate and calculate doses, and coordination with individual lifest yle factors. Additional factors include patient work en vironment, cost and co verage, cultur al influences, and other medical comorbidities. All of these factors need to be ev aluated and will influence the decision to use a basal insulin once daily , or to supplement this further with premix or meal co verage. If the patient is to be started on insulin b y adding a basal dose, it is giv en in the ev ening along with the regimen of or al agents. This str ategy is associated with less nighttime hypogly cemia. Insulin detemir is associated with less weight gain than insulin glargine. F or most patients with T2DM, the initial daily dose can be weight -based at 0.15 units/kg/da y (0.1-0.2 units/kg/da y is the recommended r ange). Ultimately , most patients will require significantly more due to the high lev els of insulin resistance and o verweight or obesit y in this population. Basal insulin is titr ated upw ard slowly to achiev e a fasting lev el in the 100 mg/dl r ange. F or example, a patient weighing 200 lbs requires appro ximately 44 units of glargine along with metformin and perhaps a second or al antih ypergly cemic in order control.In a highly motiv mealtime insulin (lispro , aspart, or glulisine) will allow for better gly cemic control and add some flexibilit y, as doses are tied to mealtimes and match the pattern of post meal BG lev els. The first pr andial dose is matched to the largest meal and then titr ated to other meals as the patient gains confidence in self -management. This process depends upon the patient 's being sensitiv e to symptoms of h ypogly cemia, along with a willingness to do more frequent self -monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and injections. When using a pr andial insulin, the patient must understand that the r apid-onset insulins must be co vered with adequate carboh ydrate intake in order to prev ent hypogly cemia. Another routine that ma y be appropriate is the use of premix ed insulins, which combines a rapid-acting and intermediate analog (No voLog, Humalog) in v arying concentr ations. Premix es are an appropriate intermediate-intensit y strategy for patients who need impro ved gly cemic control to achiev e target HgA1c, but who desire a simpler routine that requires less frequent SMBG and insulin injections only twice daily . Patients who are selected for this method need to assess frequently for h ypogly cemia. They should also keep a fairly consistent routine with regard to mealtimes. Initial dosing is tied to the largest meal of the da y with a second dose added at breakfast once it is determined that the patient can safely and reliably follow the routine. Ultimately , choice of insulin depends on man y factors, including patient and pro vider preference, con venience, willingness, and the abilit y of the patient to consistently inject insulin one or more times per da y. Continuing the patient on metformin assists in impro ving insulin sensitivit ylureas (glimepiride, glyburide) carries a greater ypogly cemia and should be discontinued. GLP-1 analogs such as ex enatide can be continued. Avoid using insulin as a \"threat\" when patients have difficulty achieving target goals because this will further alienate them from both the provider and the process. Focus instead on the goal of continuing to ha ve the most satisf ying and health y life possible. Answer: BTest Your Knowledge Most patients with t ype 2 diabetes: Apply Your Knowledge How would y ou explain the different kinds of insulins to a patient? Other Major Goals: Managing Comorbidities Dyslipidemia and h ypertension are two health problems commonly found in patients with type 2 diabetes. These comorbidities need special attention because they mark edly increase a patient 's risk of dev eloping cardio vascular disease, which is the major cause of death in people with diabetes. Dyslipidemia The most prev alent lipid abnormalit y in patients with T2DM is a decreased lev el of HDL cholesterol. Health y target lev els of HDL are >40 mg/dl in men and >50 mg/dl in women, and people with t ype 2 diabetes frequently ha ve HDL blood lev els below the target v alues. These patients also tend to ha ve blood trigly ceride lev els abo ve the health y target lev el of <150 mg/dl. In addition, man y patients with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve blood lev els of LDL cholesterol abo ve the health y target lev el of <100 mg/dl. This group of dyslipidemias\u2014low HDL cholesterol, high trigly cerides, and high LDL cholesterol\u2014giv es a diabetes patient a high risk of dev eloping cardio vascular disease, with resulting m yocardial infarction, heart failure, or strok e. For the purpose of setting LDL target lev els, diabetes is considered as great a risk factor as known cardiac disease in establishing the need for anti-lipid ther apy. The ADA now encour ages the use of statins in cholesterol lowering efforts (ADA, 2015).Should tak e insulin supplements as soon as they are diagnosed. A. Will need insulin supplements after taking or al medications for more than a decade.B. Should not tak e insulin supplements due to increased risk of infection at injection sites.C. Have better gly cemic control and no additional risk if insulin is tak en along with metformin and a sulfon glycemic control will also push lipids toward health y target lev els. When lifest yle changes do not achiev e the blood lipid goals, medication should be added. F or heart health, the primary goal is a reduction in LDL lev els, and the recommended drug for lowering LDL cholesterol is a statin (eg, Lipitor). Cardio vascular disease (CVD) is such a serious threat to people with T2DM that they should take statins ev en when their lipid lev els meet the targets, under the following conditions: The patient already has cardio vascular disease, or The patient has other risk factors for cardio vascular disease, such as h ypertension or abdominal obesit y.

Prediabetes and a family history of t ype 2 diabetes. D.Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a frequent companion to diabetes; appro ximately 75% of people with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve hypertension. In part, this correlation is a direct complication of diabetes. Chronic h ypergly cemia causes a thick ening and stiffening of the walls of arterioles, and in turn causes h ypertension (Maitr a, 2009). As with dyslipidemia, hypertension puts a person with t ype 2 diabetes at higher risk for cardio vascular disease. Blood Pressure Goals for People with Diabetes Systolic <130 mm Hg Diastolic <80 mm Hg Therapeutic lifest yle changes are the first -line treatment. When lifest yle changes do not lower blood pressure sufficiently , medication should be used. In t ype 2 diabetes, drug therapy for h ypertension begins with either an angiotensin-con verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor block er (ARB) such as v alsartan. (ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be giv en to pregnant women.) Often, it will be necessary for patients with diabetes to tak e two or more medications to reduce their blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg.

Psychosocial Problems The continuous presence and progression of a chronic illness lik e diabetes creates real psychological stress. Chronic illnesses also str ain finances, productivit y, and relationships. Over time, ev en resilient patients can become fatigued, depressed, or anxious, especially when the disease worsens or when complications appear . In addition, individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are at increased risk for dev eloping T2DM and are often more difficult to manage when diabetes is diagnosed (AACE, 2011). Individuals who are receiving antipsy chotic agents such as respir adyne, quetiapine, olanzapine, and others for chronic symptoms should be monitored for weight gain and screening for T2DM because these medications can cause h ypergly cemia. At each visit, doctors and other members of the diabetes team should ask patients about their mood, their current view of their disease, and the effect of diabetes on their family and finances. The team should also be a ware of signs of psy chosocial problems. These signs include: The appear ance of eating disorders Changes in the patient 's mental abilities Mood changes Depression or anxiet y The appear ance of relationship problems Poor compliance with their ther apy regimen Unexpected hospitalizationsA rubella v accination booster .

F or example, h ypergly cemia is associated with worse outcomes from strok es, heart attacks, and surgery . Even when they normally ha ve good gly cemic control, hospitaliz ed patients with t ype 2 diabetes are at risk for dev eloping h ypergly cemia. First, the stresses of illness or surgery cause h ypergly cemia. Second, when hospitaliz ed, a patient 's usual medications ma y have to be changed or withheld. Third, drugs such as glucocorticoids or v asopressors ma y be administered, which elev ate blood glucose lev els (Moghissi et al. , 2009). While in the hospital, patients with diabetes should ha ve their blood glucose lev els monitored regularly before meals to giv e meal co verage of insulin, and hospital personnel should be a ware of the h ypogly cemia protocol. P atients on continuous intr avenous insulin typically require hourly blood glucose testing until the blood glucose lev els are stable, then every 2 hours (ADA, 2015). Communicating the diagnosis of DM and the most recent BG between hospital staff in perioper ative settings or change of shift is hugely v aluable to avoid hypogly cemic episodes and complications. Blood Glucose Targets for Hospitalized Diabetes PatientsFor most patients Fasting blood glucose <126 mg/dl, with other v alues <140 mg/dl Random glucose <180-200 mg/dl For critically ill patients For nonsurgical patients Random blood glucose <140 mg/dl For surgical patients Random blood glucose should be k ept close to 110 mg/dl For critically ill patients, h ypergly cemia should be controlled with a tested intr avenous insulin protocol that is known to be safe.

Answer: DTest Your Knowledge When patients with t ype 2 diabetes are hospitaliz ed for other reasons: Apply Your Knowledge What is the h ypogly cemic protocol for y our facilit y? Acute Complications of T2DM In patients with t ype 2 diabetes, either extremely high or extremely low blood glucose can cause an acute diabetic emergency . Too much circulating glucose leads to a h yperosmolar h ypergly cemic state (HHS) or diabetic k etoacidosis (DKA). Too little circulating glucose causes h ypogly cemia.They tend to do well on their regular regimen of or al medications and only have problems when they become h ypothermic.A. Hypergly cemia is a secondary consider ation, especially in critically ill patients, and high blood glucose lev els can be toler ated for a few da ys when necessary .B. They should alw ays be put on IV insulin and their blood glucose lev els should be monitored daily .C. Their blood glucose lev els should be monitored regularly and h ypergly cemia should be corrected with insulin, not with or al medications.D.Hyperglycemic Crises Uncontrolled h ypergly cemia can lead to a ph ysiologic crisis of deh ydration, electrolyte imbalance, and confusion or coma. Hypergly cemic crises are t ypically triggered b y physical stress, such as an illness, injury , strok e, or m yocardial infarction, which causes a sudden persistent h ypergly cemia. Without the help of a knowledgeable caregiv er, this sudden hypergly cemia can ev olve to become life-threatening for a patient with diabetes. A hypergly cemic crisis occurs when patients do not ha ve sufficient circulating insulin. The form tak en by the crisis depends on whether there is an y circulating insulin at all. When there is a total lack of insulin, such as for t ype 1 diabetes patients who rely on insulin injections, a h ypergly cemic crisis will tak e the form of diabetic k etoacidosis (DKA). DKA is characteriz ed by hypergly cemia, k etonemia, deh ydration, and loss of electrolytes. At the other end of the spectrum, when there is a relativ e lack of insulin, such as with t ype 2 diabetes, patients ha ve enough circulating glucose to a void metabolic acidosis and ketonemia, so a h ypergly cemic crisis will tak e the form of h yperosmolar h ypergly cemic state (HHS). HHS is char acteriz ed by hypergly cemia that can be twice as high as in DKA, plus deh ydration and loss of electrolytes, only mild k etonemia and acidosis, and notable mental status changes or coma (Kitabachi et al. , 2006). Symptoms of both DKA and HHS can include deh ydration, loose skin turgor , dry in diabetic ketoacidosis), h ypotension, mental confusion, and possibly coma. The sa ying \"Cold and clamm y, give 'em candy , but hot and dry , blood sugar is high. \" can be helpful to remember the symptoms between the two BG extremes. Lab tests should include plasma BG, ABGs, basic chemistry panel, k etones for blood and urine. K etones will be positiv e in DKA but not alw ays seen in HHS if the patient still has some endogenous insulin to prev ent ketosis. Case Scenarios of the Development of DKA and HHS Compare these two scenarios in which an older woman living alone dev eloped a hypergly cemic crisis. Diabetic ketoacidosis The woman has t ype 2 diabetes and requires insulin. She gets pneumonia on Frida y afternoon and dev elops a fev er. Saturda y morning she is tired and somewhat confused. She forgets to tak e her insulin all da y Saturda y. Sunda y, she is found confused, breathing hea vily, and ha ving sev ere abdominal pain, and she is hospitaliz ed with DKA. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state The woman has undiagnosed t ype 2 diabetes. She gets pneumonia on Frida y afternoon and dev elops a fev er. Saturda y morning she is tired and somewhat confused. She is too weak to eat and has only a cup of tea all da y Saturda y. Sunda y, she is weak er, drinks a cup of tea, and eats a few cr ackers. Monda y, she can barely get out of bed. Tuesda y, she is found unconscious, and she is hospitaliz ed with HHS . In the hospital, h ypergly cemic crises are treated aggressiv ely. Intravenous fluids are giv en to replace the w ater deficit. Insulin is giv en to correct the h ypergly cemia. Electrolytes are replaced as needed. Mean while, the cause of the crisis\u2014usually an illness or injury \u2014is treated. In a good hospital, DKA has a mortalit y rate of less than 5%, while HHS has a mortalit y rate of about 11% (Kitabachi et al. , 2006). The reason for higher mortalit y in HHS is that often the patients are older and ha ve more comorbidities, and the hypergly cemia went unrecogniz ed before medical care could be giv en.

D.Hypogly cemia occurs when a person' s blood glucose is too low , usually below 70 mg/dl. People with h ypogly cemia become pale, shaky , sweat y, weak, and hungry . If the hypogly cemia is prolonged, they will become confused and possibly comatose. S ymptoms can often mimic into xication and must be confirmed with a fingerstick BG to a void misdiagnosing. Causes of Hypoglycemia Patients who ha ve type 2 diabetes and who tak e insulin or insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfon ylureas, can become h ypogly cemic if: Too much insulin or secretagogue is tak en The secretagogue w as not discontinued when insulin w as added Too few carboh ydrates are eaten Circulating glucose is depleted too quickly (eg, during ex ercise) Alcohol intak e occurs without eating Kidney disease exists Source: Cryer, 2011. The treatment for h ypogly cemia in a conscious person is 15 to 20 g of or al glucose. The Rule of 15 guides that patients with symptoms of \"cold and clamm y\" should tak e a fingerstick BG. If the BG is < 60 mg/dL, 15 gr ams of a fast -acting sugar should be giv en (1/2 cup or ange juice, 4-6 pieces of candy ,1 cup of milk, 2 gr aham cr ackers). Check the blood sugar again in 15 minutes and, if it hasn' t risen abo ve 70 mg/dL, eat or drink another 15 gr ams of carboh ydrate. W ait another 15 minutes and check a blood sugar again. If the blood sugar is still not abo ve 70, call for medical help . After blood sugar returns to normal, plan to eat a regular meal with protein within the next hour. Do not treat h ypogly cemia with sugar -free sodas or chocolate candy with nuts. The chocolate ma y create a rebound h ypogly cemia and the fat in nuts ma y slow the absorption of the sugar . Teaching patients to identif y causes of h ypogly cemia and to wear some form of identification is important to a void future episodes. Unconscious people can be giv en an intr amuscular injection of glucagon (GlucaGen). In a hospital setting, an IV infusion or bolus of 50% dextrose ma y be giv en. Be careful when giving IV 50% dextrose because it is thick and can cause phlebitis or tissue necrosis. Common Simple Carbohydrates (15 g) 15 gr ams of simple carboh ydrates commonly a vailable are: For their protection, all patients who ha ve diabetes should be taught the symptoms of hypogly cemia. Also , after monitoring their blood glucose lev el for a few months, patients will learn to predict which situations will giv e a dip in their blood glucose concentr ation. Those with t ype 2 diabetes who tend to become h ypogly cemic should carry glucose tablets, and if patients ha ve a history of significant h ypogly cemic episodes, their families, associates, or caretak ers should know when and how to giv e an injection of glucagon (ADA, 2015).

A hallmark study known as the Diabetes Control and Complications T rial (DCCT) rev ealed maintaining blood glucose lev els to a near -normal level ma y significantly reduce chronic complications. The DCCT demonstr ated in 1993, in the final report of the study , that micro vascular complications could be significantly reduced up to 70% when gly cemic goals are within near -normal lev els (NIDDK, 2008). Acute and significant changes in a person' s blood glucose lev el can cause life-threatening problems. Slow , chronic h ypergly cemia is the source of most diabetic illness and death. Longstanding h ypergly cemia causes or worsens the following: v insufficiency , and e Kidney damage (diabetic nephropath y), leading to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or kidney tr ansplant Eye injury (diabetic retinopath y), with macular edema, retinal hemorrhages, neovascularization, glaucoma, and catar acts, an y of which can cause visual impairment or blindness Nerve damage (diabetic neuropath y): Peripher al nerv e damage leads to injuries of the feet, while autonomic nerv e damage weak ens bowel/bladder control and/or causes sexual impotence. Poor wound healing and a risk for infections, which can lead to limb amputations (Maitr a, 2009) Cardiovascular Damage: Atherosclerosis Cardio vascular disease is a leading cause of death among all people and 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease and strok e (NDEP , 2015). Both insulin resistance and the chronic hypergly cemia of t ype 2 diabetes acceler ate the development of atherosclerosis, a disease of large- and medium-siz e arteries. A therosclerosis then causes m yocardial infarctions, peripher al artery obstructiv e disease, renal artery disease, and strokes. Atherosclerosis of a Large Artery The aorta has been slit lengthwise and laid open to show the extensive atherosclerosis of its walls. White fatty plaque and disrupted lesions cover the inner lining. Source: CD C, 1972.Atherosclerosis is a major problem in people with diabetes. A therosclerotic artery disease is a hundred times more lik ely to cause gangrene of the lower limb in people with diabetes than in people without diabetes. Moreo ver, atherosclerotic m yocardial infarctions are the most common cause of death in people with diabetes (Maitr a, 2009). Deaths from cardio vascular disease are 4 times higher in people with diabetes than in other people. An educational focus to reduce illness and cardio vascular disease in people with diabetes is to focus on the ABCs of diabetes, as shown in the bo x below . Atherosclerosis is only one of the detrimental cardio vascular consequences of diabetes. F or example, people with diabetes tend to ha ve poorer outcomes after ischemic heart injury , and people with diabetes are 2 to 5 times more lik ely than people without the disease to develop heart failure (Nesto , 2007). Due to their increased cardio vascular risk, diabetic patients with symptoms suggesting coronary ischemia, especially substernal discomfort brought on b y exercise and reliev ed by rest \u2014should be given an ex ercise or non-stress ECG. If the test results are abnormal, the patient is referred to a cardiologist. Management of Cardiovascular Disease Diabetic patients who ha ve cardio vascular disease or who ha ve an increased risk for the disease because of their age, family history , a history of smoking, or the presence of h ypertension, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria, should be put on an antiplatelet ther apy of 81-162 mg/da y aspirin. Hypertension should be reduced to systolic pressure <130 mm Hg and diastolic pressure <80 mm Hg. Preferred medications are ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor block ers (ARBs), except in pregnant women. Lipid lev els should be tow ard health y ranges. The primary goal is to reduce LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl, and statins should be considered. Source: AD A, 2015.

Renal Damage: Nephropathy In the United States, diabetic kidney damage is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. This t ype of kidney damage, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or diabetic nephropath y, first appears as small amounts of albumin leaking into the urine (microalbuminuria). Without treatment, microalbuminuria progresses to a more significant leakage, macroalbuminuria. Progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria tak es place within 10 to15 y ears in 20% to 40% of those with t ype 2 diabetes. Less than ten years afterw ards, 20% of patients with macroalbuminuria will dev elop end-stage renal disease and will need dialysis or a kidney tr ansplant. After m yocardial infarction, renal failure is the largest killer of people with diabetes (Maitr a, 2009). Patients with t ype 2 diabetes should be regularly screened for microalbuminuria, beginning at the time of diagnosis (NKF-KDOQI, 2015). Diabetic retinopath y is often present b y the time diabetic kidney disease appears, and albuminuria in a patient with diabetic retinopath y is most lik ely due to diabetic kidney disease. A serum creatinine lev el should also be measured y early as a gener al assessment of kidney function (ADA, 2015). Usually appears as a bleeding disorder in which the patient 's blood clots too slowly .A. Is usually treated with bed rest and a much reduced lev el of ph ysical activit y. B.

Treat h ypertension to a goal of <130/80 mm Hg using an ACE inhibitor or an ARB . If a patient already has micro- or macroalbuminuria, add an ACE inhibitor or an ARB regardless of the blood pressure (ADA, 2015). Reduce blood LDL cholesterol lev els to <100 mg/dl and prefer ably to <70 mg/dl; if medication is needed, a statin is the drug of choice, ex cept in patients on hemodialysis. Reduce daily protein intak e to 0.8 g/kg of body weight in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease; this will mak e proteins appro ximately 10% of their total daily calories.

The picture on the right simulates the patchy vision that can be produced by diabetic retinopathy. Source: NWS, 2005.Diabetes damages small blood v essels and capillaries throughout the body . Basement membr anes are thick ened, supportiv e cells are injured, and the blood v essels in the back of the retina ma y rupture and leak, exuding fluid and producing tin y hemorrhages. Diabetic retinopath y is a leading cause of new cases of legal blindness among adult Americans (AAO, 2016). Patchy Vision Induced by Diabetic Retinopathy In the retina, micro hemorrhages and fluid leakage first produce macular edema and lipid deposits (hard exudates), both of which can lead to decreased vision. The blood v essel damage also causes reduced perfusion, and this stimulates the second stage of diabetic retinopath y, called proliferative diabetic retinopath y. In prolifer ative diabetic retinopath y, new blood v essels grow along the surface of the retina, called neovascularization , causing web-lik e vessels that further disrupt the function of the retina and cause decreased vision (Folberg, 2009). Cataracts and Glaucoma Diabetes also increases a patient 's chances of dev eloping catar acts and glaucoma.

A high serum lev el of lipids mak es a person with diabetes more lik ely to dev elop diabetic retinopath y. Serum LDL cholesterol should be reduced to <100 mg/dl and serum trigly cerides should be reduced to <150 mg/dl.

Online Resource National Ey e Institute website Facts About Diabetes Ey e Disease Nerve Damage: Neuropathy Diabetes damages the nerv ous system. The most common problem in people with t ype 2 diabetes is a symmetric peripher al neuropath y in which patients become less able to feel things with their hands and feet. Diabetic nerv e damage begins at the tips of the longest nerves and slowly progresses to shorter and shorter nerv es; therefore, sensation is first lost in the toes, then in the ankles, and later in the fingers (Anthon y et al. , 2009). People with diabetes who ha ve decreased sensation in their feet can be una ware of foot injuries and tend to suffer injuries that cannot heal without special care. T o mak e matters worse, people with diabetes often ha ve reduced circulation in their feet along with gener alized poor wound healing. These conditions cause gangrene of the extremities 100 times as often as people without the disease. Diabetic neuropath y is not limited to peripher al sensorimotor nerv es. Autonomic nerv es throughout the body can be damaged b y chronic h ypergly cemia and cause diabetic autonomic neuropathy , which affects organs in volved with autonomic functions. P atients with diabetic autonomic neuropath y can ha ve postur al hypotension, incomplete bladder emptying, or sexual dysfunction. Specific symptoms of diabetic autonomic neuropath y include: A resting edema of the macular area of the retina as well as the ingrowth of excess blood v essels.A.

In the United States, diabetes is the leading nontr aumatic cause of lower limb amputations (Lipsky et al. , 2004). Management of Diabetic Foot Problems Patients need annual foot exams, prefer ably b y a diabetic foot specialist. The exam should: Inspect skin for abr asions, ulcers, nail infections, or calluses with underlying hemorrhage or discolor ation. Look for tender areas, swelling, or y (Charcot arthropath y) Test for sensory deficiencies using a tuning fork and a standard 10-g n ylon monofilament. Test the ankle (Achilles tendon) reflex. Assess the perfusion of the foot, checking foot temper ature, capillary refill in the toes, and strength of the foot pulses. Check shoes, because rubbing and inappropriate pressure points are common causes of foot ulcers. Patients should be taught not to rely on sensation only , and they should examine their feet daily . They should choose their footwear carefully , keep their nails trimmed, and walk, run, and climb with extr a caution. Patients should be counseled to stop smoking. Refer patients to foot care specialists for ongoing prev entive care and life-long surveillance. Teach patients with diabetes how to clean and care for their feet.

They should also be taught that optimal glycemic control reduces their susceptibilit y to infections. Wounds and injuries should be reported to a member of the patient 's diabetes team, and the clinician should then: Consult a surgeon for sev ere wounds. Clean and debride the wound. Take a culture specimen. Start antimicrobials if the wound appears clinically infected. Aerobic gr am- positiv e cocci (t ypically , Staphylococcus aureus or beta-hemolytic streptococci) are the most common skin pathogens, but chronic wounds tend to ha ve mix ed infections that include gr am-positiv e and gr am-negativ e aerobes and anaerobes.

Psychological Damage: Depression If you're tired of just reading about diabetes, imagine ha ving to liv e with the chronic disease and not ev er getting a break from it. Lik e any chronic disease, diabetes can last a lifetime and requires daily attention, which is exhausting. Diabetes burnout, stress, depression, denial, anxiet y, and ev en anger are all issues that impact mental health for people with diabetes.Assessment questions should be ask ed by the diabetes healthcare team to recogniz e and assess concerns and mental health disorders. Questions that are open ended and nonjudgmental can help patients feel free to discuss real concerns, such as \"Man y people with diabetes can feel sad or angry or ha ve problems eating. How has it been for y ou?\" Studies show a relationship between new diagnosis of diabetes and depression. The mentally ill are also at a high risk of dev eloping T2DM due to poor health maintenance, which can complicate blood glucose control and their mental illness. R eferrals to adv anced prepared psy chologists and counseling ma y be needed. Support groups, online forums, and group education classes can be helpful resources. Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes People with prediabetes, people with components of metabolic syndrome, women who have had gestational diabetes, and people with a strong family history of diabetes are at risk for dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes (R osenzweig et al. , 2008). With good clinical care and education, people with prediabetes can slow or prev ent the progression to diabetes with a proactiv e regimen (ADA, 2015). The first step is recognizing prediabetes in people at risk. Identifying People at Risk National studies show that 1 in 3 adults ha ve prediabetes and only 1 in 10 are a ware of the diagnosis. Since 1997 the ADA has recogniz ed the existence of lev els of glucose elev ation that are out of the normal r ange, but not y et at lev els diagnostic for diabetes. These individual are at increased risk for the same target organ damage as those clinically diagnosed with diabetes. In contr ast to newer guidelines that support use of the A1c in diagnosing diabetes, the newest American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE, 2016) recommend continued use of fasting plasma glucose or the 2-hour OGG to mak e the diagnosis of prediabetes. Newer ADA guidelines recogniz e A1c lev els between 5.7% and 6.4% as being consistent with the diagnosis of prediabetes. V arious professional groups recommend that the following people be screened for prediabetes at least ev ery three years: All people >45 y ears old Women with a history of gestational diabetes or those deliv ering an infant >9 lb Adults with blood pressures of systolic >135 mm Hg or diastolic >80 mm Hg Adults with dyslipidemia People with a BMI >25 People with a large w aist circumference > 35 inPeople with a strong family history of diabetes (t ype 2 diabetes in a first - or second- degree relativ e) People of ethnic groups that are especially prone to diabetes: Nativ e American, African American, Latino , Asian American, or P acific Islander (USPSTF , 2008; ADA, 2015) Proactive Management of Prediabetes In partnership with the CDC, the diabetes prev ention progr am (DPP) teaches people in a twelv e-month progr am to implement lifestyle change. Studies ha ve shown that those involved in the progr am lost weight and decreased their risk in dev eloping diabetes. People with prediabetes should lose weight, increase their ph ysical activit y, modif y their diets b y increasing dietary fiber , and reduce calories, satur ated fats, and tr ans fats. A clinician ma y consider the addition of metformin as an adjunct to lifest yle changes. Additionally , patients should reduce their cardio vascular risk factors b y reducing their blood pressure to below 130/80 mm Hg and correcting an y dyslipidemia. These interv entions can be difficult for patients to follow for long periods. The most effectiv e treatment regimens include frequent contact between patients and their diabetes team members. Prediabetes patients also need regular visits with their ph ysician. Studies show that with proactiv e care the incidence of t ype 2 diabetes can be reduced b y 40% to 50% (Guangwei et al. , 2008).

A. Slowing or stopping the progression of prediabetes to t ype 2 diabetes. B. Giving insulin injections to people at risk for dev eloping t ype 2 diabetes. C. Treating chronic complications, such as diabetic kidney disease, before they begin.D.Summary Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes mellitus. It is a disease in which insulin is not as effectiv e as in health y people, and therefore more circulating insulin (h yperinsulinemia) is needed to k eep blood sugar lev els within the normal lev els. This increase in needed insulin creates insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs when body cells don' t allow glucose to enter easily and is worsened b y overweight and ph ysical inactivit y. In addition to ha ving insulin resistance, people with t ype 2 diabetes progressiv ely lose the abilit y to produce insulin, as the beta cells in their pancreas gr adually fail. Both insulin resistance and beta cell failure worsen with time, so t ype 2 diabetes is usually a disease of middle- aged people; howev er, overweight and obese people of an y age are at risk. A t ypical person with t ype 2 diabetes is o verweight, ph ysically inactiv e, and comes from a family with a history of diabetes or an ethnicit y (African American, Hispanic/Latino , Native American, Asian American, or P acific Islander) with a high risk for the disease. Today, most people with t ype 2 diabetes are diagnosed from a screening blood test before the disease becomes clinically symptomatic. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made b y any one of these appro ved blood tests: A fasting plasma glucose lev el >126 mg/dl documented on two different da ys A random plasma glucose lev el >200 mg/dl along with classic symptoms of diabetes A 2-hour or al glucose-toler ance test >200 mg/dl after ingesting 75 g of glucose documented on two different da ys An A1c > 6.5% (ADA, 2015) Chronic h ypergly cemia damages tissues, and the primary goal of people with diabetes is to keep episodes of h ypergly cemia to a minimum. R egulation of blood glucose lev els is called glycemic control. In gener al, people with t ype 2 diabetes ha ve three target measurements for their degree of gly cemic control: their fasting blood glucose lev els should be 70 to 130 mg/dl, their long-term a verage A1c v alue should BG should be <180 mg/dl.The initial management approach in t ype 2 diabetes is to maintain good gly cemic control by adjusting lifest yle beha viors; specifically , by losing weight, increasing ph ysical activit y, and eating a healthier diet. Later , most patients with t ype 2 diabetes need the help of or al medications to a void chronic h ypergly cemia. The first medication is gener ally recommended to be metformin. As the disease progresses and their beta cells fail, man y people with t ype 2 diabetes ev entually need supplemental insulin. Diabetes puts people at risk for macro vascular problems, particularly atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease, with an increased chance of heart attacks and strok es; therefore, a key part of the management of diabetes is to reduce an y additional cardio vascular risk factors. P eople with t ype 2 diabetes should k eep their blood pressures low (<130/80 mm Hg), they should eat high-fiber , low-fat diets, and they should k eep their blood lipids in a heart-health y range. In addition to cardio vascular problems, patients with diabetes are prone to micro vascular problems that damage ey es, kidneys, and nerv es. People with diabetes also suffer from poor wound healing. Maintaining good gly cemic control and a low blood pressure will reduce the tissue damage caused b y micro vascular diabetic problems. People with diabetes must tak e extr a care to a void injuries, especially to their feet. Wounds, infections, and injuries cause more hospitalizations than for people without diabetes, and wounds and infections need to be treated early and aggressiv ely. When they are sick or hurt, people with diabetes should consult with their health team. The statistics of diabetes show a growing percentage of people with diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome. When a person is disco vered to ha ve prediabetes, the progression to t ype 2 diabetes can often be dela yed with the same treatments that are used for T2DM. P eople with prediabetes and diabetes are all encour aged to lose between 5% and 10% of their total body weight, increase their ph ysical activit y, reduce their caloric intake, reduce the fat in their diet, and eat more dietary fiber . For some people with prediabetes, adding an anti-diabetic medication such as metformin is also helpful. Disease Management in Brief Diagnosis of prediabetes FPG = 100-125 mg/dl (impaired fasting glucose) on two separ ate occasions or 2-hour plasma glucose lev el (after a 75-g glucose load) = 140-199 mg/dl (impaired glucose-toler ance) separ ate occasions A1c between 5.5% and 6.4% Diagnosis of diabetes (b y any 1 test)FPG >126 mg/dl (on separ ate da ys) Random plasma glucose >200 mg/dl with symptoms 2-hour plasma glucose lev el (after a 75-g glucose load) >200 mg/dl (repeated on a separ ate da y) A1c > 6.5 confirmed b y repeating on a different da yDiabetes Treatment Goals Blood glucose A1c (<70 mg/dl when cardio vascular disease >50 mg/dl Triglycerides schedule to 6 months History: review diet, ex ercise, lifest yle, smoking, alcohol use Exam: check weight, blood pressure, feet, patient 's psychological health Labs: check A1c, self -monitored glucose records Medicines: review medicines, consider low -dose aspirin to prev ent CVD Add to annual check Exam: serum creatinine, urine pneumococcal v accination CVD = cardio vascular disease FPG = fasting plasma glucose PPG = postpr andial glucose Source: ADA, 2015. Putting It All Together: Case ScenarioSamuel Gonzalez, as y ou remember from our introductory scenario , is a 58- year old Hispanic male who comes for an initial ph ysical exam after complaining of constant thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, and decreased sensation in his feet for 6 months. A t his wife' s insistence, he hopes there is a pill he can tak e to stop the anno ying symptoms. He is a construction work er and w ants to feel better . He w as told to bring labs before the ph ysical exam. Q: What is the information needed for the initial exam? A: A thorough history can rev eal risk factors and family history as risks for diabetes mellitus. Q: What information should be obtained in the ph ysical exam? A: A thorough head to toe assessment should include an exam of all body systems, including the ey es for an y indications of retinopath y, the feet to assess for poor healing wounds or changes in musculature. Because he has already indicated poor sensation in his feet, the clinician should test for neuropath y using a monofilament and tuning fork for sensation and vibr ation. All the classic vital signs of course are needed. Samuel' s chart rev eals the following: Biometrics Height: Weight: (obese) Vital 28 Total cholesterol 250 mg/dL Medical historyHypertension Surgical history Dental teeth extr action from abscess Family history Mother had large babies in Mexico Father died from a heart attack and w as a smok er Social history Married, with four children Smok er Alcohol use (1-2 beers after work daily) Current medications Lisinopril 20 mg once daily Known drug allergies None Q: What is the probable diagnosis? A: Type 2 Diabetes Rationale: The FBS is >126 mg/dL, with symptoms Q: questions should the clinician ask Mr . Gonzalez? A: Questions about erectile dysfunction, depression; desire for smoking cessation and DSME instruction should be pursued. Mr. Gonzalez is not surprised to hear he has dev eloped t ype 2 diabetes and admits that he has an older brother and uncle with T2DM. He said his wife does w ant him to stop smoking and he has tried on his own but can' t quit. He also admits to some instances of ED and just thought it w as his age. Q: What referr als and additional lab tests should be ordered? A: He should be referred to an optometrist, a smoking cessation progr am, and certified diabetes educator for DSME. The clinician w arns him to \"stop smoking, lose weight, exercise, and don' t eat so much. \" Because of his existing symptoms and risk factors, the physician also puts him on or al metformin 500 mg bid and or al sim vastatin 40 mg qd, and oral bupropion (Z yban) 150 mg bid for smoking cessation. He is told to return in 3 months for a followup after his DSME. A plan is dev eloped to address his ED and probable retinopath y and neuropath y in 3 months after his body has had time to adjust to the medications and the goal of smoking cessation.A point -of care-office lab test for A1c is completed and the result is 10.8%. He is giv en a booklet on diabetes with online resources and a referr al to the DSME progr am co vered b y his insur ance compan y. Q: At the first DSME meeting with the diabetes educator , what topics should be co vered? A: Depending on his insur ance co verage and allow able hours, the diabetes educator should focus on teaching him how to use a glucometer and discuss meal planning impro vements. Although there are sev en self -care management str ategies to be co vered, beginning with key surviv al skills is important. T eaching him how to use a glucometer will allow him self - feedback on all other beha vior modifications he attempts (eg, meal planning, ex ercise). Followup or class teaching visits could focus on teaching the sev en DSME topics, a voiding complications, and in volving his wife. Q: What next steps would occur at the 3-month followup visit and thereafter? A: The ph ysician should review a recent cholesterol panel and an A1c to compare with the initial A1c and log book. F ollowup on blood pressure, smoking cessation, weight, progress with the DSME progr am, depression, and episodes of ED should be addressed. F ollowup visits for ev ery 3 months during the first y ear would be appropriate, especially with acute problems. Annual exams would include, baseline ECG, fundoscopic ey e exams, comprehensiv e lab work to measure liv er and kidney function, a lipid panel, and encour agement to continue to see a dentist.
