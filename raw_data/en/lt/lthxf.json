Origin Octavia Tea blend Quick Brewing Guide Water Temperature: 195\u00b0F Leaf to Water Ratio: 1 tablespoons per 16 oz Steep Time: 4-5 minutes Brewing Instructions General Guide: - Add tea leaves to a teapot, fill-your-own tea bag or infuser basket. - Use 1 to 3 teaspoons (1 tablespoon) of leaves per cup (8 oz) of water. Adjust to taste. - Bring fresh, cold water to a rolling boil, allow it to cool slightly, then pour water over tea leaves and cover. - Infuse (steep) leaves between 2-5 minutes; 3\u00bd minutes is a good average that works well for most tea types. Do not over steep or tea may become bitter. If you prefer strong tea, do not over steep; simply use more leaves. - Remove bag or infuser from water or strain leaves. Enjoy! Water Quality: Tea is only as good as the water used to prepare it. Avoid distilled or unfiltered tap water, which can limit tea's flavor. Bottled spring water or filtered tap water is ideal. Water Temperature: Most teas taste best when prepared with water around 195F (just below boiling) however, some teas require a lower temperature or they may become bitter.

Most \"cleansing\" or detox teas I've found have that flavor and are not enjoyable but this tastes nice. Subtle earthy, herbal flavors from the mint and basil and lemongrass. Simply lovely. Is my liver functioning better? Who knows! But I enjoy drinking this tea. - So good!This tea is delicious and slightly sweet on its own (I assume from the licorice root but I can't taste an anise flavor and that's a good thing!)
