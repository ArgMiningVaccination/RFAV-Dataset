The amount of DHT in the body correlates with how much Testosterone and 5-alpha reductase is in the body. This protocol replicates the energy field of DHT in the body. We utilise the body's natural process to increase DHT in the body, with built in protections for follicles in the scalp and the prostate. Please note. This protocol is potent, hence with protections in place, there is always the risk that the increased DHT will have some impact on the scalp. We highly recommend that you utilise our androgen receptor files to up-regulate androgen receptors in the body (minus the scalp and prostate), to increase androgen activity primarily in the body, and to lessen the impact on the scalp. The Advanced version increases the power, intensity of conversion from Test to DHT, and the intelligence of the file by about 600%. This is ideal for bodybuilders and athletes. The [advanced file](https://spiritualityzone.com/product/dht-megadose-advanced-version/) has a built in clearing function, which performs a clearing of DHT on your scalp and prostate every time you play the file. Both files will also help men with the size and function of their phallus. The [advanced version](https://spiritualityzone.com/product/dht-megadose-advanced-version/) will allow the user to engage with the consciousness of the energy to localise performance anywhere in the body. It is highly advisable for those wanting to get the best out of this protocol, to increase exercise activity, reduce weight, and increase dietary fats in their diet.
