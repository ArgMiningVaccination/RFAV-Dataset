But if you reach for a stick of conventional lip balm instead of the best non-toxic lip balm, you could be putting chemicals on your body that are very dangerous to your health. Fortunately, you can still get the care your lips need when you choose one of these best organic lip balms. Whether you're looking for tinted lip balms, vegan lip balms, or something in between, you'll find exactly what you need to keep your lips smooth and keep your body healthy. Do Conventional Lip Balms Contain Toxic Ingredients? The skin on our lips is some of the most delicate skin on our bodies. It's thin, sensitive, and it gets used every day when we eat, drink, talk, breathe, kiss, and more. Our lips don't have sebaceous glands or sweat glands to protect against heat, cold, wind, or even acidic foods. They also produce very little melanin to protect against sun damage from UV rays. These are just a few reasons why lip balm is an important part of a health and beauty routine. However, many conventional lip balms can contain harmful and toxic ingredients. We already know that everything we put on our skin gets absorbed into our bodies. That's why it's so important to use [natural sunscreen to help fight skin cancer](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-natural-sunscreen/), [natural bug sprays that are safe for the entire family](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-natural-bug-spray/), and [eco-friendly skin lotion that contains natural ingredients](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-lotion-bar/). Ingredients to Avoid in Lip Balms However, in addition to absorbing ingredients, we often swallow what's on our lips when we eat and drink. Here are five of the most concerning ingredients you should avoid in lip balms: - Parabens- Parabens are chemicals that are commonly used as preservatives in cosmetic products. However, they're a known endocrine disruptor and they've been linked to an increased risk of cancer. They might also be listed as propylparaben, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, and butylparaben. - Phthalates- Like parabens, phthalates are often used in beauty products as a preservative. However, they're associated with several health problems, such as cancer, reproductive system disruption, and hormonal disruption. - Petroleum derivatives- Petroleum derivatives can include petroleum jelly, petrolatum, mineral oil, and paraffin. While certain ingredients, such as mineral oil, are prohibited in food products, they're still allowed in beauty products. Since the process of producing these products often requires the use of synthetic chemicals, the odds of them becoming contaminated by these toxins is very high. When they find their way into lip balms, these suspected carcinogenic substances are often unknowingly swallowed. - Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)- Butylated hydroxytoluene, which is better known by its abbreviation BHT, is a synthetic preservative. It's also considered an endocrine disruptor that can damage reproductive hormones in men and women and promote the development of existing tumors. - PEG-8- PEG-8 is an ingredient that helps lip balm penetrate into the skin layers and retain moisture. While this is what we look for in a lip balm, PEG-8 is often contaminated with impurities like 1,4-dioxane. This is a toxic chemical substance that can increase the risk of cancer and damage the cells of the liver, kidneys, and respiratory system. Choosing the Best Natural Lip Balm In a world filled with toxic ingredients and misleading marketing claims, finding a genuinely non-toxic lip balm can be a daunting task. However, you don't have to fear, because we've done the research for you. In this post, we'll take a look at a carefully curated selection of all-natural, non-toxic options that will keep your lips moisturized, protected, and free from harmful chemicals.
