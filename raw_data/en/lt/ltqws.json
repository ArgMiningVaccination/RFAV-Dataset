Natural therapies can help you achieve and maintain a good level of health and wellbeing. \"Dis-ease\" affects the health of all your organs, even though it might be \"isolated\" to one part. Knowing that dis-ease does not simply \"drop in\", but that it has likely been coming for some time means that restoring inner balance takes time. The following conditions respond well to natural therapies: - Stress related issues - Emotional trauma and related conditions, anxiety, nervous stress, depression, insomnia - Chronic disease - Gut issues - bloating, reflux, constipation, diahorrea - Hormone imbalance - amenorrhea, menorrhagia, menopause - Skin conditions - psoriasis, eczema - Intolerances and sensitivities - food inolerances, hayfever The process of healing and re-balancing can be supported by herbs, orchid and flower essences as well as vitamins and minerals. Many conditions respond well to nature's medicine chest and can work alongside allopathic medicine safely to boost healing, limit effects of treatment on other body functions, enhance allopathic medications, as well as protect damage to healthy cells. Herbal Medicine - Heal and Re-balance Kinesiology Re-balance and Re-energise Kinesiology is a holistic system which uses the muscle feedback system to assess the whole body. Drawing on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, kinesiology evaluates body function through the muscle-meridian relationship and establishes connections between imbalances, prioritises them and then determines the most effective protocol. How does Kinesiology work? Kinesiology uses a range of gentle yet extremely powerful, non-invasive techniques that activate your body's own healing mechanisms. Whilst lying on a couch, fully clothed, light pressure is used for testing a muscle which creates a feedback response on the general state of balance in the whole body. To continue the healing process, it is likely you will need to take supplements such as herbs, orchid essences, flower formulas and nutritional supplements, all of which are natural and harmonious with mind, body, and soul. Naturopathy & Naturopathic Principles - Heal, Re-balance and Re-energise \"A system of health care which encourages and promotes the body's natural self-healing mechanism using an eclectic approach.\" Naturopathy uses traditional methods such as fasting, diet, hydrotherapy, mind/body interaction, exercise, massage and fresh air to aid the body in restoring full health and wellbeing. It works well alongside allopathic treatments, often aiding the effectiveness. Discussion and clinical diagnosis, such as pulse reading, tongue and nail diagnosis results in an individual treatment plan which will include ways to reduce toxins and cleanse the body, dietary and nutritional improvements as well as suggestions for lifestyle changes.
