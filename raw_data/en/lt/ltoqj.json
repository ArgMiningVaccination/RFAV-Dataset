The anthroposophic medi - cine, with scientific spiritual methods, allows a qualified biographical and body therapy approaches, improving the health. It includes, in this integra - tive system, medicines that consider the common evolution of human and nature (1, 2). Based on this knowledge, this work describes the results of the application of both neurosciences and anthroposophical methods at the Neu - rodiagnosis and Neurotherapeutics Clinic, Jundia\u00f3 , SP , Brazil, since 1994. The main results obtained are highlighted in scientific publications and can be added to contribute with the publica - tions that celebrate the 100 years of anthroposophic medicine. Materials and methods:Over the years of clinical activities, evidence-based methods have been applied to study and report the results of our efforts to work in sensorial perception, sensorial imagination, diagnostic and prognos - tic in the approach of the anthropo - sophical medical practices combined with neurosciences in the treatment of many pathologies. The anthroposoph - ical scientific method allows a reinter - pretation of our findings. The results obtained have been published as case reports, books, book chapters, confer -ence papers as well as they were pre - sented in seminars and courses. The topics of the study include epilepsy (3), chronic pain (4), brain tumors (5,6), neurosciences and learning (1,2,7), among others (8). Results:Regarding epilepsy, this pathology could be understood be - cause of vital organs surface tension leading to brain responses. The texture analysis of brain images showed differ - ences between patients and healthy in - dividuals even when there are no visual alterations between the groups, cor - roborating what Steiner anticipated and therapeutic bases that he indicat - ed, including revitalization treatments of organs (3,8). Brain tumors are also well treated with anthroposophic ap - proaches (5,6,8). Among the patients treated for chronic pain the relief of this comorbid is achieved by the most of them (4,8). From studies of learning and neurosciences, an algorithm of im - provement of educational methods were also developed (1,2,7). Conclusion:The present work summa - rizes the main results obtained during our clinical and anthroposophical prac - tices, being the basis for the health improvement. The studies have con - tinued exploring the neuroimaging methods and treatment techniques to understand and treat the patients with oncologic systemic diseases, between other topics.

Germany Background:Mistletoe (VAE) have been intensively investigated preclinically and clinically, particularly with regard to antitumoral activity, immunomodulation, quality of live, survival and safety. Medical doc - tors with high experience in VAE ther - apy describe treatment regimens and clinically significant outcomes not re - ported in published studies of VAE. Similar to the NCI Best Case Series Pro - gram, we investigated these additional experiences in high quality CARE guideline compliant case reports. Methods:We asked doctors for cases of VAE therapy in cancer patients which they regarded to show a clini - cally significant outcome connected to VAE therapy. The recruitment strategy included requests via email lists and meetings as well as contacts from a qualitative study with doctors who are experts in VAE therapy. We assessed the cases for relevance (clinically sig - nificant outcome in comparison with the literature), and ran them through a validation process: check for data com - pleteness, triangulation of the data from different sources, reevaluation of crucial diagnostic and follow-up tests, discussion with experts. All patients/ relatives gave informed consent. Results:111 cases were recruited. 91 cases were excluded in the assess - ment process, mainly for relevance and validity. 9 cases were published in peer-reviewed medical journals (1-9), 11 are still being investigated. Older pa - tient data often were incomplete and made validation impossible. The pub - lished case reports cover the tumor sites: skin (1, 2), pancreas (3, 4), kidney (5), ovary (6), pleura (7), skull (8) and lymphatic tissue (9). VAE was admin - istered subcutaneously, intravenously and intralesionally. In some of the cas - es very high dosages of VAE were used. Outcomes were long-term survival, tu - mor regression, improvement of qual - ity of life and reduced side effects from cancer treatment. Conclusion:Significant clinical obser - vations of VAE therapy could be cap - tured, elaborated scientifically and published as case reports in peer-re - viewed medical journals. Our search and elaboration procedure could be a model of how to capture relevant clin - ical experience.

So far, there are few interventions to restrict the quan - tity and increase the quality of screen- time (4).
