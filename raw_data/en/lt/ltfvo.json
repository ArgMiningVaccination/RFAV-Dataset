Undercontract to the U.S. Department of Labor, ManpowerAdministration, Bureau of Work-Training Programs, theUniversity Research Corporation is publishing and distrib-uting these materials through its Information Clearing-house on New Careers as part of a broad spectrum oftechnical assistance in program development, job andcareer design, curriculum writing, and training to NewCareers programs across the country.This manual is designed to be used in trainingCommunity/Home Health workers who will assume sub- professional positions at the entry level. This trainingproeram represents one in a number of first steps in a NewCareers lattice in the field of health services. The materialis structured for tise with seciaUy rlinAvn!t\u00b0g,-1 prc who have a fifth grade reading ability and who have nothad any real previous job experience in the health fields.The New Careers rationale for training health aidesand workers is based on several elementary assumptions:1.The growing need for expanded health services throughout the country requires a correspondingincrease in the number of people who have beentrained and who are qualified to meet this serviceneed.2.Given the necessary job and career opportunity,support, andtraining,the unemployed, under-employed, and disadvantaged of our nation caneffectivelyfillthese positions and participate inprograms that are designed to raise the deliverycapability of health services to optimum level.3.People who are recruited from the area being servedprovide an effective and unique link between thecommunity and the health agency, thereby enhanc-ing the effectiveness of theagency in which theworkers are employed.4.Using New Careers subprofessionals in an integratedprogram of health services frees the professional towork more effectively.5.Real job opportunities and training provide animportant answer to the need of the disadvantagedfor motivation, involvement, training, and careers with growth potential.Itisparticularly important, asis noted in the manual, that:(a)Careful attention be given to developing realistic and concretepositions,withtask expectations andresponsibilities defined as clearly as possible.(b)Supervisors, trainers, and professional workers befamiliarized with the program design expectationsand oriented to effectively using these workers.(c)An exploratory and flexible posture be maintained inboth development and training to ensure that amaximally effective model for local needs is realized.The manualisbased on actual experience intraining aides for these positions in demonstration pro-grams in Washington, D. C., New York, California andother areas. At the same time, it is not to be regarded as arigid format, ,but rather as a program that is to be refinedand expanded to meet local needs. Additional referencesand audiovisual materials are recommended in the body ofthe manual and should be used to expand the scope of thecourse material. We encourage the trainer to approach thematerial creatively and to involve the trainees in the iporning witinerionrio os cnrnplotoly pcssitoa..Chapters I,II, and III introduce the trainer tothe program, and provide suggestions for presentingand implementing a New Careers training program.Chapter IV outlines a basic (core) curriculum for allhealth service trainees; Chapter V, the specialty skillcurriculum for Home Health Aides; and Chapter VI,the specialtyskill curriculum for Community HealthAides.

A NEW CAREERS GLOSSARY Some brief definitions to help readers understand thefundamental concepts of New Careers and the New CareersTraining Model...Human ServicesBroadly defined as the fields of publicservice in which a person-to-person relationship, crucial tothe provision of services, exists between the receivers andthe providers of the services. Includes the fields of health,education, mental health, social services, recreation, lawenforcement, corrections, rehabilitation, housing and em-ployment.Human Service AidesPersons Careersnroarams ttme aide in the delivery of human services.Entry Training -The initial phases of the training program;requiredtoprepare trainees to assume entry-level orfirst-level jobs.Career LaddersThe vertical hierarchy of jobs in humanservices from the level of human service aide through theentire progression of career potentials.Entry-Level JobsThe first step in the career ladder,requiring minimal skill and education and open to previous-lyuncredentialedpersons. Sometimes called first-levelpositions.Task Cluster - The conglomerate of tasks required in aparticular job.Generic Issues in Human Services Those broad issuescommon to all human services, including 1) The Indivi-dual's Relationship to the World of Work; 2) His Relation-ship to People; 3) His Relationship to the Community, and4) Individual Growth and Development.Training in Generic Issues TrairAng and curriculumcontent related to the generic issues of human services. 11/Basic Training in a Particular Human Service FieldTraining in the basic concepts and skills common to aparticular human service field.Job Skill TrainingTraining in the particular skills andknowledge required to do a specific job.On-the-Job TrainingStructured, planned and supervisedtraining in the actual work situation during which thetrainee performs the work and iole required of him, i.e.,learning through doing.Remediation (or Remedial Training) Training in thebasic educational skills required to most efficiently learnand carry out job duties, including preparation for educa-tionai and Civil Service qualifications.

I. TRAINING COMMUNITY/HOME HEALTH AIDES Purpose of This ManualThis manual is intended to provide the guidelinesneeded to prepare lay persons to be community and/or;iome health aides. These aides will be able to provideassistance to professional health workers in community orhome health services.The community health aide is concerned with familyhealth needs, with environmental health, and with thosecommunity organizations that function to protect andimprove the health of the public. The home health aide'sprimary concern is meeting individual health needs in thehome settinggiving bedside care and establishing andmaintaining a milieu of therapeutic and preventive carefor a physically and/or mentally ill patient in his home.This manual has three major sections:1. Introduction and basic health curriculum,2. Community health aide curriculum, and3. Home health aide curriculum.Thif, division of subject matter corresponds to the NewCareers philosophy that there is a nucleus or \"core\" ofinformation that can =Ivo aLu._la 11_11_for training both kinds of aides. The training provided inthe basic health curriculum establishes the necessaryfoundation on which specialty area training can be built. Figure 1. Diagram of Training Model BasicCurriculumin theHealth ServicesCommunity Health AideSpecialty AreaHome Health AideSpecialty Area Who Conducts the Training Program?The 1966 amendments to the Economic OpportunityAct gave impetus to the establishment of training pro-grams for human service aides generally and health aidesin particular. Training programs for health aides are beingconducted by universities, junior colleges, home healthagencies, neighborhood health clinics, hospitals and publichealth departments. The needs and resources of individualcommunities have determined in part what kinds ofinstitutions have done the training.If a university or junior college is the training agency, itmust have the technical staff (nurses, physicians, nutri-tionists, etc.) to teach the specialty area curriculum. Iffaculty members at the school cannot be spared to do theteaching, a contract with the local health department canbe effective in providing needed teachers. Student healthservice staff can also serve as teachers.In the home health agency, which is primarily a service 1agency, it is unlikely to have available training personnel;if it conducts a training program, it may also have to hireadditional staff. Personnel might be hired on a part-timebasis to assist staff members who handle the teachingduties. Members of the medical advisory board might alsobe able to participate as trainers.It is most desirable for a health aide training program tobe operated as a part of a comprehensive health agencysuch as a neighborhood health clinic or public healthdepartment rather than as part of an independent agency.This does not mean that the health aide program shouldnot maintain intrinsic autonomy. To the contrary, theprogram should operate within a framework that allowsfor new approaches and growth. Reiff and Riessman 1have stated that the indigenous nonprofessional must beable to depend on an independent or somewhat inde-pendent source of power and authority; otherwise hisfunction may be subverted by the other needs of theagency.A sound community/home henith nide trair.ir.g progr=must have a skilled person in authority to whom all thetrainees are responsible. To ensure the most effectivetczimember should function as supervisor and trainer. Thisnegates the possibility of differences in opinion between asupervisor and a trainer that could undermine the entireprogram, and cause anxiety and frustration among theaides and confusion among professional staff on optimumutilization of aides.Following accepted administrative principles, the healthaide should be responsible to one, and only one, super-visor. Equally sound and essential, the supervisor/trainershould have both the authority commensurate with thisresponsibility and a realistic supervisory load. To enablethe health aide supervisor/trainer to carry out his responsi-bility most effectively, he should be on the same level asother supervisors in the training agency and should beresponsible to the administrator who coordinates alldepartmental activities. The supervisor/trainer and otherdepartment supervisors in the agency should meet periodi-cally to discuss matters of mutual concern.Regardless of the type of training institution, newintra-agency relationships and referral procedures shouldbe worked out as soon as possible. The teaching staff andtrainees should become acquainted with personnel ofother departments and/or agencies with whom they willinteract. This can be accomplished very easily by visits toother agencies. During these visits, staff members atvarious levels can meet each other and discuss how therole of the health aide can best be interpreted to otheragencies. They can also discuss types of cases to behandled by the health aides. Interagency conferences canbe planned.Early establishment of interagency relationships is parti-cularly vital for a university training program. Since manyuniversities will probably have to rely on a health agencyto provide the experience component of the trainingcourse, early arrangements will greatly facilitate soundplanning and effective implementation of the program. Qnalifications of the Community/Home Health AideTraining SupervisorThere are two kinds of professional health workers whohave the educational background that prepares them totrain health aides: the health educator and the publichealth nurse. Both have the background for training thecommunity health aide who is primarily concerned withpreventive health services or motivating persons to utilizeexisting health facilities. But the home health aide whogives personal care should be trained by the public healthnurse. Either trainer must meet these specific qualifica-tions: 1.Thispersonmustappreciatetheuniquecontribution that a nonprofessional can make intheimprovementanddeliveryof healthservices.2.The person must accept and be willing to beinnovative and try out new ideas.3.The public health nurse must have the qualifica-tions as outlined by the official health depart-ment: a minimum of a baccalaureate degreefrom an accredited school of nursing that is alsoaccredited in public health; at least one year'sexperience in a public health nursing agencyunder the supervicinn nf a Tialifiedhealth nursing supervisor, and education courseson the bachelor or master's level.4.The health educator must have the minimum ofa master's degree in health education from anaccredited school of public health or universitywith a graduate program in community healtheducation.Qualifications of the Community/Home Health AideTrainee 1.The trainee must have an appreciation of thehardships that beset his fellow neighbor thisappreciation can be derived either from expe-rience or close association with his neighbors. Hemust also be of the same economic, educa-tional, and social level as the average person tobe reached by health services.2.The trainee needs to feel that he is part of thelocal community, and neighborhood residentsmust recognize him as part of it. He must berespected and liked by others in the neighbor-hood.3.He must have demonstrated a sincere interest inothers in the local community, have been a neighbor who has helped others in times ofneed, and must have demonstrated an interestin community problems that affect his peers.4.No specific educationdl achievement is required,but the trainee must demonstrate ability to readand write well enough to comprehend instruc-tions and accurately complete records.5.He must have an outgoing personality, befriendly and enjoy working with individuals andgroups.6.The trainee must be articulate enough to giveadequate instructions to others. 2Methods for Recruiting Community/Home Health AideTrainees 1.Contact local community action agency andstate and federal employment agencies. Contactarea ministers, priests and rabbis for names ofpersons who may meet the qualifications oftrainees.2.Invite applications from formal groups (P.T.A.,civic associations, block clubs, church groups)as well as informal groups (bridge clubs, moth-ers' clubs, and back-fence groups).3.Advertise on local radio stations listened to byresidents that are to be served.4.Contact settlement house personnel for namesof potential health aides.5.Newspaper advertisements may be quite helpfulin some localities.6.Invite area public health nurses, social workers,public housing project directors, school princi-pals, and other persons who work closely witharea residents to suggest potential trainees.Suggested Functions and Selected Case Histories ofCommunity/Home Health AidesTwo basic types of health aides have emerged as a resultof needs within local communities.Community Health Aide Functions:Comely and Bigman 2 statethat a person at the\"practical\" level is needed to reach low-income families.Such a person would come from the same environment asthe families served, talk their language, be well acquaintedwith the \"gatekeepers,\" and able to develop meaningfulcontacts through nonverbal communications. This com-munity health aide would receive professional directionfrom well-qualified health workers who provide him withaccurate information that he can present in laymen'spatterns of language and in terms of their health knowl-edge and attitudes. Reiff and Riessman1 described this\"expediter\" role as a link between the client and thecommunity's professional health resources.Here are the functions of the community health aide:1.Motivates patients and families to seek healthcareproviding support, showing interest,conveyingunderstanding,maintainingafriendly relationship, and using other neigh-borly techniques.2.Interprets the importance of seeking preventivecare and early treatment of disease.3.Instructs individuals in the home and in groupsregarding primary prevention (all those meas-ures that promote health such as proper nutri-tion, good personal hygiene, good housekeepingpractices, proper rest, adequate ventilation,adequate exercise, etc.).4.Assists in evaluating the health needs of eachfamily member under close supervision of hissupervisor, for example, by referral to appropri-ate agencies of a mother who needs prenatalcare; a school-age ch2d who needs eye or dentalcare; a father who needs a physical examina- tion; a grandmother who needs follow-up carefor her known diabetic condition; a preschoolchild who never had child health supervision, ora child who appears mentally retarded andshould be examined.5.Assists in determining priorities of health needsand in developing a plan of care, under the closesupervision of the health aide trainer/supervisor.6.Informs the family of available communityhealth facilities where their specific needs canbe met.7.Assists in interpreting the eligibility require-ments of various health facilities to families.8.Assists in making referrals to the appropriatehealth agency regarding care plans; ascertainswhether the patient has actually obtained theservice to which he was referred.9.Accompanies a patient to the health facilitywhen necessary.10.Attends patients' children or elderly relatives intheir home while the patient obtains care at ahealth facility.11.Reports tothepublic health nurse, socialworkers, physician and other professionals sig-nificant findings in relation to health and socialmatters that come to his attention during thepc.:-P-nr.nrrehis fliktipc_12. When appropriate, reinforces the instructionsgiven by the professional and encourages thepatient to follow orders.13.Seeks persons in the neighborhood who haveunattended health problems and initiates ap-propriate action.14.Maintains an accurate record of contacts withfamilies and of the services that have beenprovided.15.Initiates, organizes and assists in implementing aprogam of health education classes under thesupervision of the health aide trainer/supervisor.16.Aids in initiating, organizing and implementingactiviies to motivate large numbers of personsto avail themselves of health services and healthinnovations, (e.g., mass immunization programs,x-ray screening programs, etc.).17.Teaches the family sound housekeeping prac-tices, accident prevention, good nutritional hab-its, and personal hygiene in order to bring abouta more healthful life.18. May perform some housekeeping duties whileattending childrenor elderly relatives whileother members of the family obtain care at ahealth facility. This most often involves prepar-ing food and dressing infants and preschoolers.19.Performs first aid measures when appropriate.20. Helps specialist develop health literature di-rected to the educational level of the targetpopulation.21.Participates in team conferences with profes-sional staff regarding individual families. These two case histories illustrate the combination ofmany of the functions of the community health Admitted: 1-20-64Closed: and 2adults originally referred from a case-worker. The ?resent-ing problem was the need for an 11-year-old diabeti.: childto learn to administer her own insulin. Since this was anursing problem, the case was immediately referred to thepublic health nurse, who visited the home and later calledon the Neighborhood Health Aide Program (NHAP)requesting money for food since the family had nothingto eat at the time.Social and Health Problems Found in the Home On theinitial visit, the community health aide gave the family$3.00 to buy food to alleviate the emergency situation.While she was there, the health aide spent approximatelytwo hours getting to know the mother and listening to theproblems the family was experiencing. The mother admit-ted that her preoccupation with inadequate heat, insuf-ficient food, inadequate income, and marital conflictsoften prevented her from attending to the health needs ofthe family. One specific example was that the diabeticchild was unable to follow the prescribed diet \"becausethere was not enough money to buy proper food with thecc noup1( chrArPiyetd from her husband: and herfrequently unemployed husband took the butter, cheese,and lard from the surplus food allotment and apparentlysold them to partially support his alcoholic habit.\"The numerous unattended health problems uncovered onthe first visit included: (1) the mother was hard of hearingand did not wear her hearing aid because it was in need ofrepair; (2) the mother had discontinued her lipreadingclassesatthe Washington Hearing Society; (3) twoschool-age children needed dental care; (4) the father wasa chronic alcoholic; (5) the diabetic daughter was notfollowing her diet; (6) the same diabetic daughter hadglasses that were not worn because \"they were unattrac-tive\", and (7) one child had been discontinued in the freeschool lunch program.In spite of these tremendous problems, this mother wasinterested in the health and welfare of her family asevidenced by the regular attendance of the children in theChild Health Clinic and schools. Summary of Sequence of Events During a discussionwith the project nurse, it was agreed that the hearingproblem was most urgent and should be dealt with asearly as possible to enable the mother to work moreeffectively with the family problems. The health aidequickly moved on this, and within three weeks, thehearing aid was repaired by the Office of VocationalRehabilitation and the mother was once more attendinglipreading classes. During this three-week period, thehealth aide established a fairly good relationship mth thefather and he requested reading materials relative to his\"drinking problem.\" This material was obtained from theHealth Education and Information Division, Departmentof Public Health, and given to the father with explanationof the contents. The mother was quite concerned about the health of herdiabetic daughter, so this problem received the next highest priority. The public health nurse was aware of the problem with the diabetic diet and worked to help thefamily understand the need for it. The health aide alsoworked on the problem of the \"unattractive glasses.\"After a conversation with the eye clinic staff, the motherwas reassuredthatthediabetic child had a futureappointment date at which time the problem of theglasses could be discussed. The mother was told toencourage the child to wear the present pair until otherarrangements could be made.Following through on advice and plans initiated by thehealth aide, the two children with dental cavities went to the City Hospital Dental Clinic and subsequently to the School Dental Clinic for dental care. The mother, chil- dren, and school personnelwere actively involved inplanning to get the teeth repaired.Unfortunately, NHAP was unable to persuade the schoolprincipal to reinstate the child in the free school lunchprogram at that time, but now the rules are less strict andpractically any child who desires can participate h theprogram. During the entire time NHAP was active withthe family, there was frequent communication betweenhczth;raiiir nurse, and other appropriatehealth and welfare workers.The social problems worsened the father deserted thefamily; the family was evicted; the children were sent toJunior Village Home for unsheltered children; and themother moved in with relatives who lived out of ourservice area. We reluctantly closed the case.What is to be the future of this family? While accompany-inga blind patient to the General Hospital MedicalClinic during the month of October 1964, the health aidemet the mother on her way to the Eye Clinic with one ofher children. She talked briefly with her and found outthat the mother was following through on all of the healthproblems that the health aide encouraged her to work on,and, in addition, had made plans to take another child tothe ringworm clinic the next day. Moreover, it was learnedthat the family (excluding the father) was reunited inadequate housing and was receiving a PAD grant. Themother is now able to give her family a more adequatediet and is attending to the health needs of her family as aresult of self-motivation and determination.We, in NHAP, feel that with this family the health aidehas accomplished the ultimate goal to motivate thefamily to take care of its own health needs by usingfamily resources and by seeking out and utilizing theexisting health facilities for health care. 2.Case History Admitted: 12-04-63Closed: 12-31-65Neighborhood Health Aide ProgramBackground InformationFamily of 8 children and 1adult was brought to the attention of NHAP by the healthaide who lived in their public housing apartment building 4and knew the family. The community health aide dis-covered that the infant had sores on his body and that themother had not sought medical care. In communicatingwith the deaf-mute mother it was learned that the motherhad not obtained medical care for the infant because \"shehad no ,.,ar fare and no one to care for the other childrenwhile she took the infant to the ciinic.\"Social and Health Problems Found in the HomeBecausethe mother was a deaf-mute, she had made very fewfriends but fortunately the health aide was a very c'tosefriend who had, in the past, helped her with her problems.The father had deserted the family several months earlierand the family was receiving a welfare grant. It was believed that the father sometimes visitd the family,thereby threatening their only income source since thegrant would probably be discontinued if a man werefound in the home.During the month of December 1963, several unattendedhealth problems plagued this family. These problemsincluded: (1) the infant had sores on his body; (2) aschool-age child had sores in his mouth; (3) a 5.cheo1-agechild had high fever, sore throat, and stiff neck; (4) apreschooler had a cut on the buttocks; (5) the motherdeveloped severe pains in her abdomPr ; (6.) !atcr VII, it wasdiscovered that the mother was pregnant; and (7) threeschool-age children needed dental care. This motherseemed overwhelmed with the tremendous responsibilitiesshe had to bear without the help of the father.Summary of Sequence of Events Since the infant'scondition was the only health problem known initially, itwas dealt with first.By the time the health aide hadmade all the arrangements for car fare and baby-sittingservice, a school-age child had developed a different typeof sore in his mouth. Therefore, the health aide encour-aged the mother to take both children to the PediatricClinic the same day. The health aide noticed that in herhaste the mother had forgotten to take the writtenreferral slip to the clinic. The health aide was aware thatthis deaf-mute mother had in the past gone to clinics andnot been seen by the doctor because she could not hearher name when called and she was too insecure to let thepersonnel know her problem. In fact, this insecurity hadkept her from seeking medical care. The health aide calledthe clinic personnel to let them know that the mother wasin the clinic and could not hear her name called. After thehealth aide explained the situation, the doctor did treatthe children.A week later, a son fell and cut his buttocks. The motherimmediately summoned the health aide to determine theseriousness of the cut. The health aide saw that the cutwas fairly deep and the child was bleeding so she advisedthe mother to take the child to the emergency room atonce. This time the mother took the written referral slipwith her when she went to the emergency room and thechild was seen without delay.One evening about 6:30 P.M. the mother sent for thehealth aide because her daughter felt very hot, had a stiff neck, and a sore throat. The health aide took thetemperature because she knew that the mother could not read a thermometer. The temperature was 104.2F. Thehealth aide immediately called the home of the projectnurse and was told that the condition could be veryserious and the child should be taken to the hospital atonce. The health aide called a taxi for the mother andhelped her prepare the child for the trip. It was 10:30P.M. before the child arrived at the emergency room, butshe was seen right away because the health aide alertedthe hospital staff. The child was not admitted, but returnvisits were made for additional treatment.The health aide began to suspect that the mother might bepregnant again but it was not mentioned because thehealth aide was aware that the welfare check might bestopped if this mother became pregnant while receivingthe grant. The health aide very skillfully worked with themother and encouraged her to have a complete physicalexamination for \"pains in the stomach.\" After the doctortold the mother that she was expecting, she verballydeniedit. By the time the mother was four monthspregnant, the health aide was successful in getting her toobtain prenatal care from the Health Department PrenatalClinic. This was quite a feat since this mother had had noprenatal care during ihn- previous pregnancies. The healthaidebaby-satfor the mother for subsequent visits.(Incidentally, the welfare grant was not discontinuedwhen the social worker discovered that the mother waspregnant.)During the time the mother was pregnant, the health aidemade plans for three of the school-age children to betaken to a dental clinic. They went with a group ofchildren that was periodically taken by NHAP to theSouthwest Clinic for dental care. The mother seemed verygrateful for the service, since she had not known dentalcare was available.This particular health aide was responsible for initiating athermometer reading class, and as would be expected, thismother was among the first class participants. She learnedto read a thermometer as a result of attending the class.When it was time for the mother to deliver, she looked tothe health aide to assist her in preparing the children tostay with relatives. With the assistance of the health aide,the children were adequately dressed and had a sufficientsupply of clothing for the short visit. The children weresent in a taxi to the home of their aunt, and the oldestchild called the health aide to report their safe arrival.This case is indicative of how the neighborly relationshipwas used in working with this family toward the better-ment of their health. What has happened to this family?Following delivery, the mother kept her appointment forher postpartum examination without the encouragementof baby-sitting service or the health aide. The motherregistered the newborn infant in the Child Health Clinicearly enough so that it was seen when it was one monthold. She takes the child to the clinic regularly.The mother decided that she wanted information thatwould help her with family planning, so she registered inthe Health Department Birth Co faro! Clinic and has keptregular return appointments. Again, this was accomplished 5without the encouragement or services of the health aide.This mother apparently learned the value of medical carefor illnesses and preventive health measures. Although themother may not have overcome the insecure feelingstemming from her deaf-mute condition, at least she nowhas enough confidence to st:ek out health care for herselfand her family. The health aide has achieved the ultimategoal of helping the family to become self-reliant inmeeting its own health needs. Home Health Aide Functions:The second general type of health aide that hasemerged functions mainly to provide \"personal care.\"Most often, this health aide works in a pregram that ispart ofaursing service agency or an organized home-careprograf.. _n- a public agency. The major objectives are tocure disease, rehabilitate patients and eliminate diseasesymptoms. The ap?roach is patient-centered. The homehealth aide visits the patients in the home and performsthose duties outlined by the staff public health nurse inconjunction with the health supervisor. The staff publichealth nurse visits the patient periodically to re-evaluatethe nursing care plan and determine the progress ordeterioration of the patient.In this type of health aide program, ',.he health aide isresponsible to the health aide supervisor for training andsupervision. The staff public health nurse and the healthaide supervisor determine whether the patient can benefitfrom the services of a home health aide. The specificfunctions of the home health aide vary with the assign-ment, but some of the more common ones are: 1.Takes and records temperature, pulse, andrespiration2.Takes blood pressures3.Makes beds (occupied and unoccupied)4.Changes uncomplicated dressings5.Provides patients with bedpans and urinals,cleaning utensils following use6.Assists ambulatory patients or patients able todo partial bathing with baths7.Gives complete bed baths8.Combs hair,dresses patient, or assists withother personal care when necessary9.Reminds the patient to take prescribed medica-tions10. Prepares meals for patient and feeds him whennecessary11.

Her diagnoses at that time were cardio-vascular attack (CVA) with right hemiplegia; diabetesmellitus, maturity onset type; neuropathy, neuro-genic bladder secondary to diabetes, and hypertensivecardiovascular disease.Social and Health Problems Prior to patient's stroke, shewas employed at the U.S. Treasury Department as a GS-2clerk. She had worked at this agencyfor the pasttwenty-three years. As late as May 1965, five months afterthe onset of her illness, she had not applied for retire-ment, because she was hopeful she would recover fromher stroke and return to work. Patient finally decided tofill out hei retirement papers with the assistance of thesocial worker. At the time, she had no income, havingused up all her annual leave, and her creditors wereputting a great deal of pressure on her for their money. InJuly 1965, patient received her first retirement check of$154.00 a month, and a lump sum payment to cover themonths of February through June in the amount ofS690.00. Living in the home is patient's brother, age 45,disabled, receiving a Veterans Administration pension, andpatient's mother, age 87, who receives a small pension of$45.00. Though aged, the mother is very alert and agile inher movements. The family home is paid for.The patient is bedfast with a foley catheter. Total care isrendered by the aged mother, who also does householdchores, meal preparation and washing.It was the decision of the team members that the services ofa health aide would be of great assistance to this patient inareas of personal care, physical therapy and occupationaltherapy.Summary of Sequence of Events Patient was seeninitially by the physical therapist approximately fivemonths after the CVA. At this time, she was a bedpatient, totally dependent, even requiring feeding. Even inhzr ttninvolved side, there were signs of weakness second-ary to The iiiiiolved extremities wetc spaz,lic 3ndwithout voluntary muscle action.A health aide was assigned daily to render personal careand direct the patient in prescribed exercises: active,passive, and strengthening range of motion to all extremi-ties.In addition, the patient was started on sittingexercises progressing to standing and balancing exercises 6in preparation for ambulation. This was incorporated witha constant reminder to the family to demand self-helpfrom the patient.The patient progressed rapidly. Within a month she wasable to ambulate laboriously with the use of a posteriorshell (to keep the knee extended), and a walker.She was later able to dress slowly, transfer from wheel-chair independently and partially bathe herself.Occupational therapy was instituted and the patient wasmore motivated to get out of bed.A permanent long leg and orthopedic brace was orderedbecause the patient showed a potential for independenceeven though she had not regained use of important activemuscles on the involved side.The patient mastered independent stair climbing, andprogressed to the use of a four-legged cane. She still usesthese mechanical aids.She is able to give herself thepassive exercises needed to keep the involved extremitiespliable. Maximum benefit has been reached. The healthaide's visits were reduced according to the progress madeby the patient. Currently, she is visited every two weeksby the health aide only for assistance with occupationaltherapy.It is the opinion of tlic team that the health aide was animportant person in the rehabilitation program of thispatient. The patient, as a result, is able to functionindependently. 2.Case History Admitted: 4-1-66Status: ActiveBackground InformationMr. C is a 63-year-old male witha diagnosis of paralysis due to myelitis or spinal arterythrombosis. He was accepted on the Home Care Programon April 1, 1966.Social and Health Problems Mr. C lives with his sister,age 68; an invalid brother-in-law, age 79; cousins andnieces. Patient has his own room on the first floor of atwo-story house. He is confined to bed or a wheelchair,requiring assistance with bathing his back, lower extremi-ties and transfer activities. He must be changed frequentlydue to incontinence. In addition to giving her brothercare, the sister also cares for her husband. However, shetoo, has a heart condition with certain physical limita-tions.Mr. C is very dependent. He is the youngest member of hisfamily and never severed the dependent ties to his mothercven after adulthood and marriage. This same dependencehas been transirred to his sister who is now in the role ofmother substitute.It was recommended by the team that a health aide beassigned to assist in the needed areas of physical therapyand personal care. I I ISwnntaty of Sequence of EventsThis patient was firstevaluated on April 21, 1966. At that time, he hadconsiderable motor function in the right lower extremity. .One week later he was able to demonstrate slight motorreturn in the left lower extremity.The following week, the health aide and the patient wereinstructed in the physical therapy program which includedpassive and active assistive exercises for all range ofmotion of the lower extremities, resistive exercises, andother instructions.At this time the ultimate goal for this patient was crutchwalking with a long leg brace on left lower extremity .Thehealth aide visited four times a week.Patient progressed nicely until a CVA in May 1966.Patient suffered complete loss of motor function in thelower extremities, impairment of balance, some loss ofstrength in the upper extremities, etc.The physical therapy program and goals were rriised.Since the goal, at that time, had to be one of wheelchairexistence for the patient, the physical therapy programwas amended to stress strengthening of depressor musclesof the upper extremities and transfer activities.The health aide worked diligently with the patient untilhe was able to transfer from bed to chair and backunassisted. He also learned to roll his wheelchair into thekitchen, bathe himself with the exception of his back andfeet, do his exercises (for the lower extremities) unassist-ed, dress himself in pajamas, etc.At this time, the health aide was no longer needed forphysical therapy follow-up. However, we found thatneither the patient nor family followed through on theprogram he had learned.The heath aide has since been sent back into this homethree times a week to help patient transfer to wheelchairand back to bed. Suggested Career Mobility for Community/Home HealthAidesThe Need for Realistic Career MobilityThe New Careers training model provides a new way tohelp people bridge the gap between lack of credentials in ahuman service occupation and job entry with potentialcareer mobility. Career mobility means not only oppor-tunitiesfor initial training and employment but also forsucceeding steps leading to a desired career.Opening up careers, rather than jobs, is the keydistinction between the New Careers training model andother job training programs. \"It is important to distin-guish between job-criented tiaiizing and career-orientedtraining.\" 3 Job training connotes training for positionsthat may or may not be permanent. Career trainingimplies progress through clearly defined steps, each withcarefully stated requirements for further progres:. Jobtraining, especially for people without a high schooldiploma, generally means a dead-end job, a job with nohope and usually little dignity. Career training screenspeople into programs and, while they are in training, helpsthem achieve high school equivalency diplomas or otheracademic certificates.Human service agencies must recognize that the qualityof their service is improved through the unique contribu-tions of indigenous human service aides. Agencies have aresponsibilityto encourage and assisttheir aides inrealizing true career mobility in the same way they do forprofessional staff. Using human service aides makes goodsense for health agencies. The shortage of health man-power is increasing the gap between the ievel of healthcare now possible and the continued unmet health needsof the public, particularly residents in urban slums andpoverty pockets in suburban and rural communities.\"A significant answer to this complex problem has beenthe development of experimental programs for the train-ing and employment of local residents in jobs with careerpossibilities in community health service programs.\"4 Anumber of training centers and health service agenciesthroughout the country have developed entry-level posi-tions in a variety of health-related occupations and havesuccessfully trained and employed undereducated, under-employed, and unemployed people for those positions.Some have also developed career ladders and the necessarysupportive training to encourage and facilitate upward anddiagonal mobility beyond the entry level. Training pro-grams have been conducted for careers as home healthaides, health education aides, mental health aides, physicaltherapy aides, recreational therapy aides, and others.The New Careers training model has demonstrated itspotential for training health and mental health aides. Theplacement of graduates of these programs marks the firsttimethatundereducated,unemployed, andunder-employed people have been helped to the first step incareer mobility.Many health service agencies have successfully utilizedhealth aides for a number of years. For example, homehealth aides function out of public and private nonprofitagencies in California and provide direct patient service tothe chronically ill, the geriatric and handicapped patient.In the District of Columbia a broad variety of humanservice aides in health and mental health have been trainedand assigned to public agencies. In Pittsburgh and NewYork City, aides work in public and private agencies asneighborhood or community health aides. The aides aretrained in carefully planned and supervised programs andreceive comprehensive on-the-job experience. In mostcases, remedial education parallels the training program.The early experiences reported by the agencies employingNew Careerists have demonstrated that this concept isviable and realistic.The critical question now is not, \"Should we use peopleindigenous to poverty areas to fill health needs?\" butrather, \"How quickly can we do so?\" Schaefer 2ndHilleboe5suggest that \"the chc,itx has ceased to be whetherGr nut the order of public health will change in the way itconceived of its mission and of the administrative prob-lems to be solved. The choice is whether coming changeswill be thrust upon community health agencies ill pre-paredtoabsorb them or adapt them, or whether organized health agencies will seize their opportunities,through farsighted planning, and influence the shape ofthe future.\"Career Ladders for Community/Home Health Aide Occu-pationsCareer mobility is the main underlying concept of theNew Careers program. The attainment of the necessaryskills and knowledge that enable a person to adequatelyfunction as a health aide is the beginning of a series ofsteps on the career ladder.Once a person has gained proficiency in performing theduties of either the community or home health aide, thereare two positions to which he might advance: seniorhealth aide and supervisory health aide.The functions and duties that can be assumed by asenior health aide are as follows:1.Work closely with new health aides, providingsupport and making suggestions that will facili-tate their learning process.In the absence of the health aide supervisor andthe supervisory health aide, the senior healthaide can make temporary assignments for emer-gency cases that involve accompanying a personto a health facility, and can stay with relativeswhile other family members attend a healthfacility.3.In community organization projects, the senioraides can be responsible for coordinating theactivites of other health aides and volunteers.4.He can keep accurate records on the progress ofthe community organization team which hecoordinates.5.He can assume the leadership role of a group ofhealth aides who are developing pamphlets orother educational materials on health subjects.6.He can accept speaking engagements afternecessary clearances in instances when anotheragency or group wishes to utilize the services ofan indigenous health worker.Aides who demonstrate exceptional ability and/or showevidence of continued zducation could be delegated theseadditional functions:7.Keeping accurate reports for special projects.8.Under the close supervision of the supervisor orsupervisory health aide, reviewing records of Public Health Nurse/1Registered Nurse/iLicensed Practical Nurse Dietitian/1\\Assistant Dietitian/1\\Dietary AssistantDietary Aideother health aides and making suggestions ofadditional ways in which the recording could beimproved.9.Discussing family situations with other healthaides and suggesting ways some of the obstaclesthey have encountered could be overcome.10. Assuming leadership role in group conferences.After additional experience and the demonstration ofcapacity for supervisory responsibility, the senior healthaide can assume these duties of a superrisory health aide:1.Assigning cases to health aides.2.Providing direct guidance to health aides regard-ing all aspects of providing care to families andpatients. In areas where professional assistanceisrequired, the supervisory health aide isexpectedto recognize the need and makearrangements for it.3.Assisting health aides in planning and imple-menting community organization projects.4.Assisting in providing instruction to new healthaide recruits.S.Evaluating the performance of their supervisees.Other Potential Career Ladders for Community/HomeHealth AidesSome health aides may have an interest in careeradvancement outside the health aide occupation. Thereare numerous avenues open following additional trainingand/or education.The rationaleof New Careers training necessitatespreplanning for those persons who aspire to more chal-lenging occupations and professions in the health field.Early communication with technical schools, junior col-leges, colleges, and health agencies that provide trainingwill provide New Careers administrators with knowledgerelative to the academic and skill requirements for theattainment of the recognized credentials for providingcare in other occupational areas. Health agency admin-istrators, professionals, and educators in the local com-munity may welcome the oppoitunity to plan jointly forthis type of career mobility for health workers. Theoptimum time to initiate this concerted effort is duringthe embryonic planning stages of the New Careers trainingprogram.Potential career ladders for the community/homehealth aide are shown in Figure 2.

TYPICAL PROBLEMS AND RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONSIN COMMUNITY/HOME HEALTH AIDE TRAINING PROGRAMS The problems encountered in establishing a trainingprogram to prepare educationally disadvantaged personsto assume responsible positions as health service aides willrequire considerable attention by the New Careers train-ing program director.The problems most likely to arise can be related to threemain issues: (I) initiation of the training program; (2) therelationship between the trainer and thc health serviceaide trainee; and (3) relationships between the healthservice aide trainees and the recipients of the service. Initiation of the Training ProgramPrior to initiating a New Careers training program forcommunity/home healthaides,the employing healthagency administrator and staff must accept the conceptand role of the health service aide. Such a role has notbeen incorporated into traditional patterns for the deliv-ery of health services. Acceptance of the philosophy thata health service aide can improve the quality of healthcare provided by thehealth team isan importantprerequisite to the reorganization of the staffing patternand re-evaluation of the role each member assumes on thehealth team. It is desirable to re-evaluate functions of allhealth personnel before initiation of a community/homehealth aide training program in order to determine themost efficient utilization of all health personnel withinthe agency. Moreover, this re-evaluation of roles andfunctions should provide the beginning step for jobdevelopment as it relates to the health service aide.All levels of staff in the employing health agency mustbe oriented to New Careers training concepts and objec-tives to ensure that staff members fully understand therationale of this innovative training program. Involvementof all levels of staff in planning for the training program,job development for the health service aide, implementa-tion of the training program, and the entrance on duty ofthe health service aide are essential to attain the overallobjectives of a New Careers program.Relationships Between the Trainer and Health ServiceAideAs envisioned inthe New Careers training model,trainees will be exposed simultaneously to all trainingcomponents (generic issues, basic health training, skilltraining and on-the-job training).Trainers must be aware of and appreciate the uniqueattributes the health aide brings to the health service team.Also, each trainer should appreciate the function of othertrainers in the overall training model. Good interrelation-ships between the trainers and the individual trainees willgo far in fostering a comprehensive, innovative trainingprogram geared to providing knowledge and skills to the 9economically and educationally disadvantaged in the loc:,1community.A clear definition of the responsibilities of the trainerfor each component should be developed jointly by allconcerned during the early planning phase. In someinstances, one person may assume responsibilities formore than one component depending upon the decisionsmade for implementation of the individual trainingprogram.At the beginning of the program, trainees must beoriented to the three components of the training modeland must have a clear understanding of the interrelationsbetween the components and the trainers. This willprevent any confusion and conflict that rn:ght arise amongthe supervisors of the three components and the trainees. Relationships Between the Health Service Aide Traineeand the Recipient of the ServiceBecause most of the trainees will be indigenous to theimmediate area to be served, programs arising from thedual role of a friend or enemy and a person in the helpingrole may requirepreventive measures and, in someinstances, solutions.Extraneous circumstances may have a bearing on thedesirability of an assignment to a specific trainee. When aprospective patient or family is known to the trainee, thetrainee should help decide whether he should be nsignedthe case. The trainee is in the best position to knob, all ofthe ramifications of a previous association with a neigh-bor. Moreover, an inappropriate assignment may have far-reaching effects on the acceptability of the trainingprogram and the job development of the community/home health aide in the local community and employinghealth agency.The recipients of the service can be the most effectivesupporters of the programs. Consequently, it is vitallyimportant to prepare all trainees for the initial home visit.A proper introductionwill include the name of thetrainee, his position and the agency he represents. Eachtrainee should explain to the family and patient thepurpose of the visit.During the visit the trainee should remember that he is aguest in the home and should behave accordilgly. Ifproblems arise between the trainees and the patient erfamily, corrective measures should be instituted withoutdelay. The health aide is in a good position to make ajudgment regardingthetransferof thecaseto aco-worker. As far as possible, steps should be taken toeffect a solution that will enable the trainee to retain thecase. If these attempts fail, the case should be reassignedin a manner that is agreeable to the patient, family andthe trainee. HI. ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM The New Careers training model consiNts of a number ofrelated elementsjob development, daily small-groupdiscussions focused on human job issues,remediation andior basic educatio-.. skill training; on-the-job training, and weekly seminars for supervisory person-nel in these training elementsf'The planning and organiza-tion of any New Careers program should incorporate theseelements and their related curriculum cores.Rationalefor Curriculum and Content\"Cores\"Elements common to all human service areas such aseducation, welfare, health, and law enforcement, comprisethe basic content of the first generic core curriculum.7They include perspectives on poverty; human develop-ment and problems of people, common psychopathology,major problems in the delivery of human services, the useof community resources for the resolution of humanproblems, consumer education, the world of work, minor-ity group history, prejudice, field trips to representativehuman service agencies, interviewing, communication, andremediation.In addition to the generic core curriculum in humanservices, there is a similar \"sub-core\" in health, whichincludes the study of the organization of health servicesand basic information about health, disease and thehuman body. To prepare enrollees for a wide variety ofentry-level health occupations, they should all be exposedto this basic health curriculum prior to or along withspecific skill training. The progression of the curriculumcan be illustrated as follows:prevents the necessity of an enrollee repeating the entiretraining cycle if he or the training team decides that hisinitial choice of entry-level occupation was inappropriate.If a trainee completes the generic and health curriculumand is in the final stage of training as a community/homehealth aide, at which time the decision is made that this isnot the appropriate area of occupation for him, only theskill portion of training needs to be repeated in anotherarea, such as laboratory aide. The same is true for anystage of training or human service occupational area.As trainees in their small groups bring up issues andproblems, these can be related to the broader aspects ofinformation to be presented in the units outlined in thegeneric core curriculum for human services. For example,if one of the trainees reports the arrest of a friend, coregroup discussion could focus on the relationship of thepolice department to the community. If a health problemis brought up, personal and/or environmental health canbe discussed as it relates to the community in which thetrainees live.The content of the skill workshops should be workedout jointly with the health agency at the time specificvacancies for which the trainees will be employed aredefined.The New Careers training staff should take responsi-bility for coordinating the training, leading the coregroup, and providing the remedial support to the program.The health agency should take responsibilities for the jobsupervision and the skill and basic health training. TheNew Careers staff should provide consultation of thesetwo components as necessary. Figure 3.The Progression of Curriculum AreasNew C'areers Training Model training etc. Basic Curriculumfor Social ServiceCase Work Service Aide, etc. Basic Curriculumfor Justice 1Community Relations Aide,Patrolman's Aide, etc. Planning the curriculum for human service aides in thismanner ensures the greatest possible flexibility in theinitial phase of training by providing all enrollees with acommon base of information and experiences which canbe built upon in subsequent curriculum areas. It alsoSalient Points to Stress During TrainingA number of points will need to be repeated throughoutthe training program. These generally relate to proscrip-tions of a legal and policy nature or information con- cerning the aizency in which the aide is training andwill be an employee. The agency supervisor responsiblefor coordinating the skill and on-the-job training may wishto add other points in addition to these: 1.All information that comes to the knowledge ofthe health aide during the performance of hisduty is confidential.When working with a family with which thestaff public health nurse is also working, theresponsibilityforthequality of thetotalnursing care given to the patient rests with theprofessional nurse.3.Effective communication among all workersinvolved with the family is essential.4.At no time will a health aide suggest that anindividual or a family use any type of medicine.Itshould be carefully explained that suchaction is treatment of disease and is never to bedone by an aide or a nurse. There are noexceptions to this rule.5.At no time will a health aide suggest that anindividual or a family has any type of illness,no matter how minor. It should be carefullyexplained that such action is diagnosing and isnever to be done by an aida or a nurse. Thereare no. exceptions to this rule.6.Hisresponsibilitiestothe agency and thenecessity of keeping within the limitations ofthe agency policies should be explained to thehealth aide.7.The aide should have an understanding of thetotalorganizational structure of the parentagency.8.The role of all departments in the parent agencyand of health aides within them should bediscussed.9.The health aide may have to carry out many ofhis functions informally during hours otherthan the usual daily schedule.It is anticipated that once a person is recognized as ahealth aide in the community, neighbors will call uponhint to seek advice during evening hours and the weekend.This aspect of the operation should be encouraged and thehealth aide should be told that the hours of employmentareflexible and heisto be available when needed.Supervision also should be available to the aide duringevening hours and weekends by telephone. If sucharrangements cannot be made, then the program shouldnot operate on a flexible basis. Compensatory time shouldbe extended when the aide works evening hours andweekends. Articulation of Program ComponentsThe three components of this training process theBasic Health Curriculum, Community Health Aide Special-ty Area, and the Home Health Aide Specialty Area aredesigned to be related to the other components of theNew Careers training model discussed earlier. To reiterate,one of the basic concepts of the New Careers program isthat all training components should :)egin and be conduct- 12ed simultaneously. Following this concept, then, the dailytraining schedule for health aides will be:Community Health Aide (CHA)2 hoursBasic Health and CHA Skill Training4 Core Skill Training4 hoursHome Health Aide OJT2 hours -- Generic Core CurriculumThe entire training course should cover a period of sixmonths. Content taught in the generic core, basic healthand skilltraining sessions willrelate to the types ofexperiences gained from the on-the-job component. Care-ful scheduling will enable the trainer to proceed with amore practical approach in teaching the theoretical andskill elements of the training course.A daily plan necessitates a flexible course outline. Forexample, the health agency that is providing the experi-ence for the trainees may sponsor a mass immunizationdrive against measles and polio. The community healthaide trainer sees this drive as an excellent opportunity toinvolve the trainees in a community organization effort.Instead of teaching thetrainees the procedures forparticipating in an interdisciplinary conference, the trainercovers the skill area of community organization and thehealth core of infectious diseases to prepare the traineesfor new activity.To facilitate the shifting of curriculum and skill areacontent, the unit method of curriculum development asused in this manual should be adopted. The job situationdetermines the amount of time and the content area to bepresented during thetraining course; therefore, itisessential that the overall training course be adaptable andallow for alterations in the scheduling of specific ele-ments.Development of CurriculumAs was just mentioned, the unit plan was utilized in thedevelopment of the overall training guide and the accom-panying curriculum manuals for trainees. The anticipatedoutcomes, or the job functions, were examined for thetype of knowledge and skill necessary to enable the healthaide to provide adequate and safe care to the patient. Anoverall objective that states the expected learning out-come was established for each unit. Specific objectives thatcomprise component parts of the overall objective arestated in the unit plan. Following the statements ofspecific objectives, thecontent essential to the accom-plishment of the objectives is developed.The content area represents a skeletal outline of thespecific knowledge and skills necessary to the attainmentof otitcomc goals. ,!&ihe curriculum unfoidb, i.11:-, tra:riershould supplement the material presented in this manualwith additional elements. The depth toward which thetrainer will strive will depend upon the ability of thetrainees to comprehend the material, the needs andinterests of the trainees, and the demands of the jobsituation. The trainees should share responsibility for providing additional content to be taught. It is essentialthat the supplemental elements be closely related to thefunctions of the aides. Teaching activities are suggestedfor each specific learning objective. The activities are not meant tolimitthe creativity of the trainer; on thecontrary, the activities are suggestions only and it isexpected that the trainer will use imagination, and gearthe types of activities to the needs and interests of thetrainees, the equipment and facilities available in the localcommunity, the needs of the patients, and the individualpersonality that lie possesses.As alterations are made in the curriculum, the trainershould accurately record the changes and keep a perman- ent record of them. It isthrough the supplementalmaterial that the goal will be reatized of providing thenecessary knowledge and skills to prepare the NewCareerist to conform adequately to a health service rolethat meets his own needs, the needs of the patient, andthe needs of the health service agency.SchedulingThe New Careers training program emphasizes the needforthetraineetoexperience anxiety conducive tolearning and meaningful success at various intervals duringthe training period. This principle is reflected in thecourse content by the inclusion of frequent examinationand recapitulation sessions.The examinations may take the form of \"return\"demonstrations of a specific skill, an oral or writtenexamination inthe classroom,structured observationduring a group teaching activity, self evaluation of acommunity organization project, and other creative meas-uresthatwillafford the opportunity for the NewCareerist to obtain the feeling that he has obtained ameaningful goal.The recapitulation periods will enable the trainer tore-emphasize those areas that present difficulty as evidenc-ed by the results of the examinations. If possible, thetrainees are to assume major responsibility for assistingother trainees in increasing their knowledge and skillduring the recapitulation sessions. This type of activity,New Careerists helping each other, will enhance theabilitiesof alltrainees in developing techniques forproviding instruction to their patients.The scheduling of the entire training course is predi-cated on the idea that one learns by doing. This conceptis particularly relevant with respect to the types of skillsto be taught, the shortage of health manpower, and theneeds of the service agency. The great emphasis placed onthe on-the-job training component reflects the basic beliefin learning by performing.The six-months training period contains a total of 24weeks or 960 hours. The time allocated for the variouscomponents is: 480On-the-Job Training240Health Aide Skill andBasic Health Training240Generic Core HoursThe community health aide and the home health aideshould be taught the basic health curriculum during the 13same sessions. The specialty areas should be taught inseparate sessions for each type of trainee and in diesettings most appropriate for the specific skill.In addition to the classroom/laboratory activities, thehealth aides should participate in periodic training semi-nars. The purpose of the seminars will be to bridge the gapbetween the on-the-job training component and the basicheal th/skill component.The major technique to be used in the home health aidetraining seminar is the case presentation method. In thisapproach, one or two health aides will describe a patientwho has received care during the previous two weeks. Thesuggested format of the presentation is health of familyd.Inadequate equipment in the homeDuring the home health aide training seminar, thetrainees can engage in problem-solving activities regardinga patient or a general problem. Information sharing andcollective solutions will be encouraged by the trainer. It isanticipatedthatthe seminarwilllead to improvedpatient-care techniques.Suggested Approach to SchedulingThe 24-week schedule which follows is not intended tobe used exactly as outlined. It represents a suggestedapproach to the organization of the learning process andthe integration of the complementary parts of the NewCareers training program. We recognize that no twotraining programs will be the same nor will the samesubjects he taught on the sarne problem on precisely thesame day and the same time.The \"Suggested Approach to Scheduling\" should beadopted as the program develops. We suggest the trainernote very carefully on the appropriate day and time thespecific content and skills taught in the development ofthe given individual training program as a future guide inprogram planning.

THE HUMAN BODY Overall Objective:To gain an understanding of how specificparts of the human body function inhealth and, to a limited extent, in illness. CONTENT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1.Structure of Digestive Tract a.The mouth.Digestion of food begins.(1)The mouth is lined with a soft covering whichis kept wet by saliva (spit).(2) The rf of the mouth is called the palate.(3) The hard palate is in the front of the mouthand contains bones.(4)The soft palate is in the back of the mouth.(5)The tongue has many papillae; it is throughthem that we taste our food.(6)Our ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, and saltis due to the nerves in the papillae.(7)Glands in the oral cavity produce saliva whichassists in digestion of food.(8) Grown-ups have thirty-two teeth, sixteen oneach side, categorized according to shape.(9)Structure of tooth.(a)The tooth has three essential parts: thecrown, the neck, and the root. In thecenter of the tooth is the pulp whichcontains nerves and blood vessels.(b) The pulp is surrounded by a bone-likelayer called dentine.(c)The crown is covered by enamel that isharder than the dentine. 45.4 CTIVITIES 1.The uti-lizecharts or draw-ingsthat thebody that he is dis-cussing.Commonnames forparts ofthe body are to beused as often e s tions,answers,and other discussion.Makeanalogiestomechanical functionsofmachineswhenpossibleandothernonhuman objects. Atthispoint,thetrainer may wish todiscuss oral hygienewith the trainees. OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES Parts ofa Tooth: b.The alimentary canal. Food is swallowed and entersthe alimentary canal (digestive tube), a tube made ofmuscle that is about thirty (30) feet long.(1) The esophagus.(a)Sectionof digestivetubeconnectingmouth to stomach.(b)Digestive action begins immediately oncethe food is swallowed. The two sets ofmuscles force the food or water into thestomach.(2) The stomach.(a)Largest section of the alimentary canal.Pear-shaped, with a three-pint capacity.(b) The pyloric valve at the larger and lowerend of the stomach retains the food in thestomach until certain digestive changeshave taken place.(c)At the point where the esophagus joinsthe stomach there is a cardiac valve whichprevents the food from passing again intothe esophagus. When vomiting occurs, thisvalve becomes relaxed.(3) The intestine.(a)The small intestine is about an inch indiameter and about twenty feet long.(b) The large intestine is about five feet longand four inches in diameter.(c) A short sac called the vermiform appendixis located between the large and smallintestines. 46 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (d)Appendicitis affects the vermiform appen-dix. (e)The large intestine ends in the rectum.(f)The opening of the rectum to the gastric glands produce digestive fluidsand are found in the lining of the stom-ach.(b) The pancreas secretes pancreatic fluid.(c)The liver, the largest gland in the body,secretes bile that is gathered in the gall-bladder.(d)There are numerous intestinal glands inthe small intestine which secrete intes-tinal fluid. 47 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES 2.Process of Digestio,za.Digestion is mechanical, by the teeth and jaws, andchemical, by the action of the chemicals on thefood.b.Digestion begins in the mouth where the food isbroken up by the teeth and mixed with the saliva.The chewing of food well is vital to good digestion.,During this phase, the carbohydrates are changedinto soluble sugars.d.Before the food enters into the stomach the fluidsof the mouth are usually alkaline.e.The sugar and starch will not experience furtherdigestive changes until they reach the intestine.f. g-Unless one is physically fatigued or emotionallyupset, the food normally remains in the stomachfrom one to five hours.Some food may pass into the duodenum, theentrance of the small intestine, within two minutesafter entering the stomach.h.When food leaves the stomach, it is alkaline. Furtherbiochemical changes occur in the intestine in orderto prepare the food for absorption into the bodyand to separate it from waste materials.3.Process of Absorptiona.Digested food must be absorbed before it passes intothe body and becomes part of the body.b.When digested foods are taken into the blood this isknown as absorption.c.No food is absorbed in the mouth or esophagus;little is aksorbed in the stomach.d.The small intestine absorbs most of the food intake,although some is absorbed by tiny folds in the liningof the large ir.testine. e.Water is absorbed mainly front the large intestine.f.Food is absorbed into the blood vessels. This processis assisted by the action of the living cells and themovements of the intestine. g.Indigestible foods pass through the small intestineinto the large intestine and then through the rectum.h.It is important that all waste materials are removedfrom the body through elimination to prevent decayin the digestive tract and also to prevent the passageof poisonous substances into the blood. 48 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES I.To gainanunder-stan dingof howbloodcarriesnutri-ents (the our body.I.Blo a. b.Food usually remains in the stomach from one tofive hours, in the small intestine, about four hours.It may take from six to 24 hours before it passesthrough the large intestine. THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEModIts Composition and FunctionBlood carries oxygen and nourishment to the cellsof the body and carries waste materials from them.Blood is made up of red corpuscles, white corpus-cles, platelets, and plasma. The composition of theblood changes as it passes through the various partsof the body.(I)Red corpusclescontaina substance calledhemoglobin.(2)Red corpuscles carry oxygen from the lungs tothe cells in the body.(3)The oxygenintheair we breathe uniteschemically with the hemoglobin in the redblood corpuscles until it reaches the cells.(4)Oxygen is received from the blood by the bodycells, and the blood also carries carbon dioxideaway from the cells.(5)Although the red blood corpuscles outnumberthe white corpuscles, the white corpuscles arelarger. They are able to change shape. Theyhave the ability to surround and digest bac-teria.(6)Blood plateletsaresmall, ameboid bodieswhich help in the clotting-if blood.(7)The blood plasma is straw-colored and varies incomposition from time to time. It contains thefoods heading toward the cells and also thewaste products going to the kidneys, lungs, andskin.(8) Normal body temperature of an adult is about98.6\u00b0F. This is called the blood heat, becausethe temperature is evenly distributed through-out the body. 2.Systematic Circulation a.As blood passes through the lungs, it secures a freshsupply of oxygen. From the lungs, the blood passesto the left side of the heart. 49I.Show charts depict-ing blood circulation.Allowforfrequentquestionsandan-swers.Encouragegroupdiscussions.Common names ofthe parts of the possible.

Averageresul gainan under-standing of how thehuman bodybreae 'es.b.The heart continuously pumps the blood to all cellsin the body. It is located in the left side of the chestcavity between the lungs.(1) The pumping action of the heart generates arhythmic wave called the pulse. By measuringthe pulse, the rate of heart beats is determined. c.After blood is pumped from the left side of theheart, it passes through the arteries, capillaries, andveins, then returns to the right side of the heart.The arteries carry blood away from the heart.The largest of the arterie.s is the aorta.The aorta spreads out into smaller arterieswhich penetrate every organ in the body.(4)Once these arteries enter the various organs,they divide into capillaries which carry theblood into close contact with all cells in thebody to supply them with oxygen and foods(in solution) and to absorb carbon dioxidefrom them.(5)The capillaries return deoxygenated blood tothe smaller veins.(6)The smaller veins eventually unite into twomain veins which will carry the blood back tothe right side of the heart. d.The right side of the heart pumps the blood into thelungs where it loves the carbon dioxide picked upfrom the cells and secures a fresh supply of oxygen.During this process, the blood changes from a bluishred to a bright red.3.Portal Circulation a.This process carries blood from the digestive organsto the liver.b.Once it passes through the liver, the blood is carriedback to the heart. c.Digested foods are collected from the dipstiveorgans and e,Arbn!ly drates are left in the liver, wherethey are stored as glycogen. THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1.The purpose of breathing (respiration) is to receive aircontaining oxygen into the lungs and to rid the lungs ofair containing carbon dioxide. a.When airistaken into the lungs,itiscalledinspiration. of thehumanlung.Askquestions during and need fur-ther explanation. OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES b.When airis forced out of the lungs. it is calledexpiration. 2.When inspiration takes place, the cartilages to the ribs arebent, the abdominal walls are stretched, and the musculardiaphragm is pushed down.3.The contraction of the muscles during this processincreases the volume of the chest cavity causing an inrushof air.4.The air goes into the nose and then into the windpipe, ortrachea. a.The opening of thetracheais covered by theepiglottis which is raised during breathing and closedwhen swallowing foods.5.The trat-hea leads into the larynx which is below theopening of the windrApe. The larynx has several largepieces of cartilage lined with a membrane.a.Inside the membrane of the cartilage are elastictissues called vocal cords.6.The windpipe has two branches entering into each lung.The branches are call- -1 bronchi. Air is carried to thelungs through the windpipe and bronchi.7.The lungs are elastic and feel like sponge.8.Each bronchus branches out many times, penetrating theent're lung.9.Each of these branches ends in a sac called an air sac.10. The walls of the air sacs are very thin and are surroundedby capillaries. 11.These walls catch the wastematerials from the air webreathe, allowing the oxygen to pass through.12. The oxygen is then absorbed into the blood passing through the capillaries.13. At the same time, carbon dioxide is expelled from theblood ard passes back through the walls of the air sacs.14. When the respiratory muscles relax, the rib cartilages stretch to increase the abdominal pressure, and the air containing the carbon dioxide is forced out of the lungs.15.Suffocation results when there isinsufficient oxygen being absorbed into the blood.16.Victims of suffocation can be revived by means ofartificial 1. SYSTEM 1.Organs which excrete waste from the body. a.Kidneys.(1)Structure.(a)The kidney system is composed of twokidneys, two meters, the bladder, and theurethra.(b)Kidneys aredark-red, bean-shaped andlocatedatthe back of the abdominalcavity. Each kidney is about four incheslong, two and a half inches wide, and aninch thick.(c)The protective covering of the kidney iscalled the cortex. The inner portion is themedulla.(2)Function.(a)The kidney extracts waste materials fromthe blood and delivers them to the blad-der in the form of urine.(b) A mass of capillaries called the glomerulusextracts these waste materials.(c)The tubules collect and transport thewastes to the pelvic area.(d)The meters then carry the waste materialsto the bladder.(e)The was;tes then pass out of the bodythrough the urethra as urine. b.Lungs.(1)Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood inthe air sacs and is expelled through the lungs.(2)All exhaled air also contains water vapor.c.Sweat glands of ne skin.(1)Sweat glands remove waste and mineral saltsfrom the blood.These excretions appear on the skin in theform of perspiration.Sweat glands are particularly active when thebody is overheated. The evaporation of themoisture in perspiration has a cooling effect onthe skin. 521.G eneraldiscussion.Show charts of thedifferent parts of ensurethat the trainees the materialbeing taught. c.The trainer may wishtopointoutthenecessity of bathingas a means of remov-ing these wastes fromthe skin.

(3)Eyes are protected by the deep sockets in thefront.(4) The bones of the face are mostly paired.(5)Cheek bones are protected by the bones of thenose.(6) The upper and lower jaws constitute theremaining important bones of the skull.c.The spinal column consists of thirty-three segments,called vertebrae.(1)These vertebrae enable us to turn and bend thetrunk in various directions.(2) They also support the head and the weight ofthe body. (3)The seven neck vertebrae make it possible toturn the head and to change its position to aidin balancing the body.(4)The ribs are attached to the twelve chestvertebrae.(5)The five vertebrae in the lower back make itpossible to bend at the waist and twist thebody in many directions.(6)The sacrum in the pelvic region consists of fiveimmovable fused vertebrae.2-' 59 OBJECTI VES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (7) At thebase of the spine are four morevertebrae fused to form the coccyx.d.The ribs.(1)Twelve pairs of ribs are attached on one end tothe vertebrae of the spinal column.(2) The other ends of the upper seven are attacheddirectly to the breastbone by flexible cartilagewhich permits freedom of movement necessaryin breathing.(3)Of the other five, the upper three are indirectlyattached; the two lower, having no cartilages,are the floating ribs.e.The arm.(1) Humeruslong bone which extends from theshoulder to the elbow.(2)Radius and ulnatwo bones in the forearm.(3) The row of small bones in the wrist is calledthe carpus.(4)The finger bones are called the phalanges.f.The leg.(1) The upper bone of the leg is called the femur.(2) Two bones, the tibia and fibula, extend fromthe knee to the ankle.(3) The ankle bones are called tarsuses.(4) The toe bones are called phalanges.(5) The knee cap is an extra bone and is called thepatella.Two bones, the collar bone and the shoulder bone,join the arms at the shoulder.g- h.The hip girdle or the pelvis joins a number of thevertebrae to furnish support for the body andpermit flexibility of the legs. i.Mending broken bones.(1) When the bones of a limb are broken, thebroken ends are brought together, and the limbis placed in a splint or cast until new boneforms and hardens to heal the break. 60 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES -6.Cartilage.a.The skeleton of the mature adult develops into hardbone from membrane and a soft, elastic materialcalled cartilage. This process begins before birth, anditis not completed until the twenty-fifth year oflife.b.Examples of cartilage remaining in the matureskeleton are found in the ear and nose.c.Young children have a great deal of cartilage in theirwrists and ankles and should not be lifted by thehands or allowed to stand for long periods of time.7.Joints. a.Joints are found wherever two bones meet.b.Joints are divided into three classes.(1) Immovable joints are found in the skull of theadult.(2)Movable joints are the ball and socket jointsuch as the shoulder, hip, elbow, knee or ankle.(3)Mixed joints are those of the spinal column.c.The bones of movable joints are bound closelytogether by strong bands of cartilage tissue calledligaments.(I) The tearing of these ligaments is called a sprain.(2) The stretching of ligaments is a strain. MUSCLES FOR MOVEMENTI.There are two kinds of muscles: voluntary and involun-tary.2.Involuntary muscles occur in layers in the walls of thedigestive tract and the blood vessels.3.Voluntary muscles.a.Structure.

Considering thefirst day of themenstrual period as day one, ovulationusually (although by no means always)occurs on day_ fourteen. The use of therhythm method would require abstentionfrom intercourse from approximately dayten through day eighteen.(b)The effectiveness of this method is diffi-cult to judge. If the individual woman'scycle is predictably regular, and ovulationoccurs atthe same point during eachmonthly cycle, then the method may bequiteeffective.If no pattern can beestablished,however,theuseof therhythm method may not prove an effec-tive means of contraception.

Treatment:(1)There are three (3) recognized forms of caiicertreatment: surgery, radiation, and drugs.(2) The choice of treatment depends on the type,location, and stage of the disease.(3) Two or three methods can be used for the samepatient.111 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (4)Cure depends upon destruction of the cancer-ous cells.(5)Early cases can be cured by radiation.(6) No drugs have been found that will curecancer.(7)Five years has been generally adopted as thestandard yardstick for cancer cures.(8)Beware of quacks.5.C'auses, symptoms, and treatment of diabetes a.The actual cause of diabetes is unknown, althoughcertain types of people are more likely to developthe disease.(1)Persons who come from a diabetic family:(a)Tendency to contract the disease is in-herited.(b)Most diabetics are not born with thedisease, but contract it later in life.(c)The earlier the disease develops, generally,the more severe.(2)Persons over forty:(a)About 5% of diabetics develop the diseasebefore 15 years of age.(b) The incidence is 5 times greater past theage of forty.(3)Persons overweight:(a)Overeating places a strain on (*most Failing eyesight*(6) Intense itching(7) Pain in fingers and toes(8) Weakness, tiring easily, and drowsiness. 112 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES c.Diabetes is a condition in which the body does notsupply enough insulin to break down certain foods.(1) (3)The insulin released by the pancreas regulatesthe rate at which the body cells use sugar.Much food that is eaten is converted to sugar;all of the carbohydrates; 50 percent of protein;10 percent of fat.If more sugar is present than is needed, it isstored.(4) When a person has diabetes, the cells cannotproperly use the sugar, and the liver andmuscles cannot store the sugar.(5)The foodisstill converted to sugar; sugarpasses out in the urine and accumulates in theblood.(6) The symptoms of diabetes are related to excessamounts of sugar in the blood and urine. d.Treatment of diabetes.The mild diabetic can manage on diet control.Some persons are treated with diet and pills.Some persons require diet, pills, and insulin.Others require diet restriction and insulin.6.Hypertension, arteriosclerosis, cerebral vascular accidents,and some cardiac conditions a.Blood pressure varies from day to day and fromminute to minute.(1)Blood pressure elevates during excitement anddescends during rest or sleep.(2)These changes happen in all persons.b.High blood pressure (hypertension).(1)Inthis country, approximately five millionpeople are hypertensive and can be helped withproper medical care.(2)Hypertension works on the heart and arteries.(a)The heart must pump with increasedforce.(b)If high blood pressure exists for a longperiod of time, improper functioning ofthe heart and arteries may occur. 113 OBJECTI VES CONTENT ACTI VI TI ES (3)Hypertension is not necessarily a serious dis-ease.(4)If hypertensive patientsare properly cared for,they may look and pro-luctive living. (5)Therearenoprecisesymptomsofhypertension.(6) Many peoplewithhypertensionhavenosymptoms at all.(7)Headache, dizziness, and fatigue may be as-sociated with hypertension.c.Arteriosclerosishardening of the arteries:(I)Arteriosclerosis and hypertension sometimes gotogether, but not always.(2) The cause of arteriosclerosis has not beendetermined but is associated with age.(3)Arterioclerosis can be detected by an eyeexamination or a routine physical checkup.(4)Blood is sometimes slowedup because of athickening of the arteries that goes along withthe hardening process.d.Accidents to the blood vessels this results aftermany years of hypertension or when the arterieshave become brittle from arteriosclerosis.(1)Small arteries may break, or if their wallsbecome too thick the flow of blood may stop.(2)If blood slows up too much in big arteries theblood may clot.(3)Stroke or apoplexy result when a small arteryin the brain bursts or is completely clogged.(4) The medical termsare cerebral hemorrhage orcerebral thrombosis.(5)The results of the accidentmay range fromtemporary paralysis, involving a part or half ofthe body, to complete and permanent paralysisending in death.(6) The extent and gravity of the accident dependson the amount of brain damage.e.When the heart's arteriesare affected, circulatoryaccidents may occur in the blood vessels that feed the heart, either partially or completely shutting offthe blood supply to some parts of the heart. 114 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (I)The vascular accident is called coronary heart disease.(2) Coronary heart diseasemay begin with a sharp,constricting pain around the breastbone which spreads to the shoulderor neck.f.Prevention and treatment of hypertension, arterio-sclerosis, cerebral vascular accidents, and some heart diseases.(1) Try not toworry.(a)Worry, nervous tension, and emotionalupsets help raise bloodpressure.(2) Keep your weight normal.(a)Overweight is a health hazard.(3)Avoid work involving continuous pressure.(4)Follow directions of physician on smoking and drinking.(a)Smoking raises bloodpressure in somepatients.(b)Alcohol does not raise blood pressure. Although it may reducenervous tensions,it cannot be recommendedas a treatmentfor hypertension.(5)Proper sleep:(a)Take short naps during the day.(b)Blood pressure is lowest during sleep andrises during working hours.(6)Rest before you get tired.(a)Rest will avoid tenseness and irritability.7.Arthritis and rheumatisma.Rheumatic disease.(1)Rheumatic disease is called arthritis when it attacks the joints.(2)Arthritisisthe most common and oldestknown chronic disease.(3) The effects of arthritisrange from slight painthrough stiffness, swelling, crippling, and pos- sible disability.(4)Arthritis is the nation's number one crippler. 115 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES Approximately13million Americans sufferfrom its effects.Some become completely disabled. Others areableto continue keeping house, engage inoutside activity and also to continue to work on their jobs.A rheumatic disease may strike at any time andat any age.Arthritis accounts for186 million days ofrestricted activity and 12 million days lostfrom work. It costs the nation over a billiondollars a year in medicalexpenses, relief, andlost wages.b.The cause.(1)The cause or causes are Some casesmay result from sprains, infections,or joint injury.(3)Many scientists suspect viruses or bacteria, allergy, the nervous systemor the hormones,but this may not necessarily be true.(4)Others suspect a disorder of the metabolic system.(5)Itis not thought that emotional shock can bring on arthritis or an attack of rheumatism.(6)Attacks often follow changes in the weather.c.Rheumatoid arthritis.(1) About one third of those who visit and are treated by a physician is diagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis.(2)Rheumatoid arthritis usually starts between the ages of 25 and 50.(3)It causes inflammation and thickening of the lining of the joints.(4)This lining may grow into the joint space and fill it.(5)The cartilage that covers the ends of the bones may become eroded.(6) The bonesmay grow together, and the jointbecomes permanently fused.(7)The firstsigns of rheumatoid arthritis are fatigue,muscularstiffness, and weight.116 CONTENT ACTIVITIES (8)Painful swellingmay start at the joints; appear under the skin; muscular wasting and spasmn frequentlyoccur.(9)The disease may affectvarious organs and issometimes accompanied by fever.(10) Although there isno cure for such a disease,proper medical treatmentmay prevent severecrippling.(11) In some patients,despite treatment, the diseasemay lead to chronic disability and sometimes complete crippling.(12) Many suffererscan be aided by simplemeas- ures such as rest, corrective exercises, physical therapy, and aspirin.d.Osteoarthritis.(1)Ostcoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease and results from aging,irritation of the joints,and normal wear andtear.(2)It is less damaging thanrheumatoid arthritis.(3)Itoccurs most frequently in older people, affecting nearlyeveryone over 50 and causingpain to 1 out of 20.(4)Chronic irritation of thejoints is the maincontributing factor, andcan result from over-weight, poor posture, injury,or strain from occupation or recreation.(5)The disease is characterized mainly by degener- ation of joint cartilage thatbecomes soft and wears unevenly.(6)In some cases, itmay wear away completelyand thickening of the ends of the bones mayOCCUr.(7) The remainder of thebody is seldom affected.(8)If the hip jointsor knees are involved, a littleserious deformity or crippling may occur.(9)Common symptomsare pains, aches, and is experiencedwhen the joints arepres- sured by weight.(11) Enlargement of the fingers at the last joint often occurs. 117 .. 1 1 1OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (12) Permanent enlargementsof this type seldomlead to disability.e.Gout.(1)This disease affects thejoints of the feet,especially the big toe.(2) A susceptibilityto it is inherited, and itoccurs mostly in men.(3) This diseasemay rest It from minor injury,excessive eating or drinking, heavy exercise, or surgical operations.(4)Often, attacks occur withno apparent provoca-tion.(5),The patient may haveacute joint inflammationwhich may last for several days or weeks.(6) Many years after theonset, chronic arthritismay g.(1)Fibrositis rheumatic that is characterized or sorenessof fibroustissue,especiallyinthe muscle coverings.(3)Attacks may follow injury,repeated muscularstrain, mental or depression.(4)FibrositisWithin the musclesis sometimes called myositis.(5)Lumbago is fibrositis in thelumbar region and low back.(6)This condition may disappear spontaneously or respond well totreatment, but some casesmay persist for years.(7)Chronic sufferers are rarely crippled. Treatment.(1)Rheumatic disease should betreated by a physician or under his supervision.(2)Self-treatment may be harmful.(3)Inall rheumatic diseases,rest and freedomfrom mental strainare desirable. 118 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (4)Physicians advice to patients with these dis-eases may be: a well-balanced diet, applicationof heat, mild exercises, corrected posture, andavoidance of cold and dampness.(5)There is no scientific evidence that hot springs.mineral waters, or a warm, dry climate aremore beneficial than proper care at home.(6) The established forms for the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis are:(a)Physical and emotional re-t.(b)Physical therapy, such as heat and cor-rective exercises(c)Aspirin in adequate amounts(d)Other drugs(e)Corrective surgery.8.Importance of early detection and treatment of allchronic diseases a.May reverse effects of disease on person.b.Prevent complications and debilitating effects. C.Chances are better for individual to lead a normallife.d.Generally treatment is less expensive in the long run if begun early.e.May prevent death. i Films and Filmstrips on Chronic DiseasesThese materials can be obtained from tile United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.

Health aide probably mostcomfortablewith informal communication,and the atmosphere of an interview need not be formal.c.Nonverbal communcation:(1)People communicate all kinds of things to usby movements of muscles, attentiveness, lackof attentiveness, bodily posture, facial expres-sion, hyperactivity; and various other physiolo-gical signs.(2)Nonverbal communication may sometimes bemore important than verbal communication.(3) An awareness of theways people communicatenonverbally is extremely important when car-ing for infants, children, ill persons, and elderlypeople.(4)Nonverbal communication is usually more dif-ficult to interpret than verbal.(5)Verbal nonverbal communication cannotbe separated inreal situations: they occursimultaneously.d.Written communication:(1)The written word makes a permanent record.(2)The written word does not allow for immediateclarification of unclear points as does verbalcommunication.(3)Often very helpful in confirming verbal com- munication.(4) A copy of the written communication shouldbe retained by the health aide. 130 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES 3.To gain skill in effec-tive interpersonal re-lationships. 4.To understand others, the healthaide must understand himself: (1)Certain attitudes develop as a result of thepersonal experiences during a lifetime.(2)His own attitudes, feelings and prejudices mustbe recognized by .the health aide.(3)The health aide may not rid himself of allnegative attitudes, but if he knows what theyare and what forms they take in his relation-ship to others, he will be better able to controlthem.(4) Some of the attitudes will be of great help inworking with others; others will be hindrances;the skill lies in recognizing and utilizing thepositive ones. c.There are two extremes in interpersonal relations,1)impersonal and unimportant,and 2)verypersonal and quite important.(1)The success of the health aide will dependgreatly upon how he conducts himself inrelationships with co-workers and patients.4.Understanding others. a.People are different. Each person comes with hisown set of values, strengths, weaknesses, attitudes,etc. b.Learn to recognize emotional needs of others. Thesesometimes are far more important than physicalneeds.c.Be intere3ted in the \"whole\" person, not just whatyou are concerned about. Ex.: If mother is worriedabout financial problems, listen to them, don'tinterrupt to discuss health needs. d.Personality differs with each individual. Personalityisdetermined by hereditarytraits and the lifeexperiences of an individual. Personality developsvery early in life. e.Differences in persona,:ty often relate to differencesinperception(one's awareness of theoutsideworld). No two persons perceive the same thing inthe same way. Be aware that the best of intentionsmay not be interpreted that way by others. Do notbedefensive. Attempt tounderstand why the 131A frank discussion ofpositive and negativeattitudes.

From there, worktoward a positive goal. f.Preconceivedideas.Example: All persons withreligious beliefs different from one's own are not tobe trusted.Preconceived ideas are a product ofone's experiences and one's environment. g.Many ill patients experience great fear. Attempt torecognize this in others. Be aware of a patient's fearin all areas of your work. 5.Respect for person's worth. a.Each human being has human dignity.b.Respect is an essential element of good interpersonalrelationships. c.One must respect self in order to respect others. d.Every person has the right to be respected by healthaide providing care. e.The health aide is a guest in the patient's home andshould act accordingly. 6.Suggestions for establishing rapport.a.Introduce yourself and state purpose of the visit.b.Express a desire to assist with health problems andother problems the person may be having. c.Observe for signs of acceptance or rejection. Ifrejection, attempt to discover reasons; if patientis receptive following your continued interest inhira, pursue the interview.d.Informal conversation prior to interview helps toput the patient at ease. e.Show interest in ;-,atient's problems as he sees them. 7.Useful hints on interviewing. a.Make sure you feel relaxed and at ease prior tointerviewing others.b.Encourage the patient to talk freely.c.Be a good listener.d.Determine the pace of the person being interviewed(how fast can the person go?).

CONTENT 1.Definitionfamily health needs encompass the physical,mental, psychological and social elements that contributero the well-being of the family.2.Concepts a.Family health needs are influenced by four majorfactcrs.The health situation itself.The environment in which the family lives.The social-cultural milieu.Patterns of behavior that are characteristic ofthe members of the family.3.A.sessment of family health needs a.The health situation:(1)Nature of the disease or health problem thatconfronts familya member of the family.Example: a patient with a heart conditionrequires adequate rest, special diet, regulatedactivity, and in some instances, special medi-cine.(2) A physiological state may also produce specifichealth needs in absence of a disease. Example:a pregnant patient will need adequate calciumand protein intake, postural adjustment, specialclothing, and regular physical checkups. (3)Age may be the determinant of health needs;each age group has its major hazards to life andhealth. Example: newborn infant is particularlysusceptible to infection, changes in food, aridwater imbalance; the school-age child is parti-cularly susceptible to accidents; the person inmiddle years has needs associated with thehigher incidence of chronic diseases among thatgroup; the elderly personis susceptible toaccidents and is more likely to be malnour-ished.161I1.ACTIVITIES The trainer will directgroup discussiunofthe concepts of thefamily health health aides careplanfortheir own n-the-jobtraining,the health aides willdevelop family careplans for each familyin their case load. OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES (4) Sex may be a determinant of certain healthneeds. Example: females require higher intakeof iron once the age of puberty is reached.Adult males are more susceptible to heartattacks. Certain diseases occur among males onlycolor blindness, hemophilia.b.The environment:(1) Weather extremes, heavy street traffic, pres-ence of wildlife, presence of harmful insects,prevalence of certain dis.s can all be en-vironmental determinants of health needs.(2) The health needs arise from the dangers in-herent in both home and working situations.(3) The rural community may present problemsarising from iinsafe water supply, sewage dis-posal, and the dangers of infections due tobacteriathatthrive in farm environments.Urban inhabitants must be alert to frequentautomobile accidents, unsafe play areas. Thesuburban community may have problems ofgarbage disposal, water supply, and sewagedisposal.c.The social-cultural setting:(1) Low income neighborhoods may show evi-dence of a higher crime and accident rate thanother parts of the community. Such a high riskenvironment may give rise to a general dis-regard for routine health maintenance.(2) Because health services in lower income areas have often proved inadequate to meet thedemand in an efficient manner, the residents ofthe community may showa negative attitudetoward seeking health care, based on previousexperience with long waits and lack of individ-ual attention to their needs. Overcoming thisattitude with individual attention and supportis one of the most important functions of thehealth aide.(3)The dietary habits of some ethnic and regionalgroups may result in a lack of certain nutrition-al necessities.(4)Overcrowded housing, inadequate education,and other indices of poverty are highrates of ver.f.realdiseases, tuber-culosis,illegitimatepregnancies, and somemental illnesses.(5) Someculturalgroups,becauseof long-established habits and a lack of health educa-tion, may make use of various home remedies 162 aN..

Ied.Characteristics of the individual family:(1)Income, physical equipment, competence inutilizing resources(2)Family cohesiveness and emotional security(3)Established patterns of health behavior andattitude toward health care. 4.Definition and concepts of a family care plan a.The family care plan is the written guide that stateshealth needs, goals, plan of action, and evaluation forall members of the family.b.Each family member has his own peculiar healthneeds which arise from age, sex, state of health, andother individual qualities.c.The family care plan is not a static document; it is adynamic plan that changes as the needs of thefamily members change.d.The family care plan developed by the health aideshould contain those action plans that are within thescope of the health aide's functions and are assignedby the supervisor. e.The health aide should keep in mind that a plan isonly as good as the ability of the aide and family toimplement it. 5.Implementation of a family care plana.Statement of health needs, both by health aide andfamily. Quite often the acceptance of health needsby the family comes much later. The acceptance ofhealth needs by the family is a long range goal; inthe meantime, the health aide records all perceivedhealth needs.b.Once the needs have been established, goals aredeveloped:(I)Goals should be simply stated in terms of whatit is hoped will be accomplished.(2) The goals should be stated in such a way thatthey can be tested.(3)Short-term and long-term goals should beoutlined 163 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES 6.To gain skill in eval-uatingtheactiontaken relative to thefamily care plan.c.Following the statement of goals, plans for actionare developed:(1)Areas for immediate action are stated; thenlong-range plans are stated.(2) Sometimes the short-range goals and plans arevery obvious. Example: a pregnant motherneeds a complete physical examination todetermine cause of prolonged upset stomach.(3)Plans for action are usually developed step-by-step according to the resources available withinthe community and the family and the avail-ability of the health aide and other healthworkers.(4)Prior to implementation of the plan, the familymust accept the needs and goals described inthe plan.6.Evaluating the action of the family care plan References on Family Health Needs I. 2.3.4.5.6.a.To what extent have the stated goals been accom-plished?b.Throughout the contact between the health aide andthe family, the accomplishment of goals should beevaluated and re-evaluated.c.The evaluation should take into account the meas-ure of success as seen by the health aide and by thefamily.6.The trainees evaluatethe family care planresults for families towhom they have pro-vided service.

J.Leading causes of maternal deaths, 1960:Toxemias of pregnancyHemorrhageAbortion with sepsisSepsis of pregnancy and childbirthEctopic pregnancyToxemia or sepsis resulting from abortion. 2.Infant and Child Health Information, Problems andNeeds.a.Thenation'slossof infantsisapproximately 110,000 per year inspite of medical progress.(Infant = 1 yr. and under.)b.1960: infant mortality rate 25.7 per 1,000 livebirths. (Is usually much higher than maternal deathrate.) c.There is a large difference between the death rate ofwhite and nonwhite infants.(1)1960: 22.9 white infant deaths per 1,000 livebirths.(2)1960: 43.2 nonwhite infant deaths pc.:,O(X)live births.d.The geographic pattern of infant deaths is consistentwith the pattern for maternal deaths. 166 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES e.Poverty and its many ramifications play an impor-tant role in the infant death rate.f.Six leading causes of death for infants 28 days and under.(1)Immaturity(2)After-birth asphyxia(3)Birth injuries(4)Congenital malformations(5)Variety of diseases peculiar to infancy, includ-ing nutritional problems(6) Pneumonia.g.Ten leading causes of deaths of infants 1 year and under.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)Diseases of early infancy (neonatal)Congenital malformationsInfluenza and pneumoniaAccidentsGastroenteritisMeningitisHernia and intestinal obstructionBronchitisHeart disease(10) Malignant neoplasmsh.Premature infant deaths have declined substantiallyas a result of newer techniques. i.The heart disease deaths during the infant stage aredue primarily to congenital heart defects.j.Preschool period (1-5 yrs.) is the most favorable inrelation to risks of mortality.(1)From 1900 to 1960, the death rate among thisage group declined from 20.0 to 1.1 per 1,000live births.k.The progress made in combating communicablediseases. tlargely responsible for the decrease in thedeath rate of the preschool group. 167 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES I.Comparison of 10 leading causes of death (preschoolgroup): 1900 1960Influenza and pneumonia AccidentsDiarrhea its low death rate, the preschool period isaccompanied by a high morbidity rate.(1)Recovery rate is high.(2)Duration of illness brief.n.Problems relating to mental-emotional developmentare the greatest cause of mental illness.

COMMUNITY RESOURCES Overall Objective:To gainskillinutilizing communityresources. CONTENT STUDYING COMMUNITY RESOURCESThis unit applies the general information presented in thepublic health administration section to a study of the localcommunity. Its purpose is to enable the trainees to acquaintthemselves with the health and social fad:ties of the com-munity they will serve so that they can properly utilize theseresources in the performance of their duties. A list of thefacilities to be studied should be obtained from the localpublic health departm,.nt by the trainer. This list can then becategorized according to the need which each facility serves,e.g., eye clinics, well baby clinics, child guidance clinics. Inthis way, all the facilities available for meeting a particularneed can be presented and discussed in conjunction with adiscussion of the particular health problem involved. Forinstance, when discussing infectious disease and the impor-tance of immunization, the trainer will mention the vaccina-tion services available to the community. The trainees shouldvisit some of the health and service agencies, acquaintingthemselves with procedures and gathering materials concerningthe services rendered by the agency.THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE FILEThe trainees are to work together to compile a communityresources file. The information they collect at the agenciesvisited with the class and in their work with families utilizingthe community services should be augmented by telephoneinquiries so that a complete file of the community resourceswill be available to all the aides.The trainee manual contains an example of a resource filecard. Note that itis only a sample, describing a particularservice agency in Washington, D. C. Emphasize to the traineesthat a complete file on a health or social facility involves a listingofplace,hours,servicesrendered,eligibilityrequirements, the me1liod of obtaining service, fees, and anyadditional information pertinent to an efficient use of thefacility.PUBLIC HEALTH NURSINGAcquaint the trainees with the function of the public healthnurse and the visiting nurse.

OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES i-The person who initiates the referral assumes theresponsibility to follow up the referral to determineif the appropriate care is received.To Ihzderstand Wizen a Referral Is Needed a.A referralisnecessary whenever the agency ordepartment of the agency in which the health aide isemployed does not render the health care needed bythe patient and/or family. Since the communityhealth aide does not provide direct patient care, areferral will almost always be necessary.b.Even though thefacilityoperates on an openappointment basis, a referral is the preferred methodwhen sending a patient to the facility. c.If the facility does not require a written referral, thepatient may desire one and/or feel more secure witha referral.d.Most agencies require or prefer a written referral,but the health aide should always check with theagency to determine its policy. 3.To developskillin3.Referral Methodmaking a referral.a.Ascertain if the needs of the patient can be met atthe health or health-related facility.b.Determine the requirements of the agency to whomthe patient will be referred prior to making thereferral. c.For a written referral, ascertain all of the informa-tion from the patient and/or from records to meetthe requirements of the agency.d.Clear with the facility for a specific time, date, andplace.

INTERDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCES Overall Objective: To skill in functioning effectivelyat an interdisciplinary conference. CONTENT 1.To Understand the Meaning of Interdisciplinary Con-ferences.a.When family problems are extensive and require theservices of many agencies and disciplines, a caseconference may be held by an agency or agencies tofind ways of solving the problems.b.Example: a school-age child has a positive tuberculintest; his mother is hospitalized for tuberculosis inmunicipal tuberculosis hospital. A case conferencemay be called to decide on the proper place of careforthe school-age child. Persons attending theinterdisciplinary nurse(4)Hospital social worker(5)Health aide(6)Teacher(7)School counselor.c.Quite often, the adult patient or the parent of thesick child will be asked to come in so the decision ofthe conferees can be explained to him. This affordsthe committee the opportunity of immediatelyperceiving the reaction of the person. Also, theperson can receive immediate clarification regardingunclear points.2.The Conference.a.The one who initiated the conference should bringthe meeting to order and discuss the purpose of themeeting.b.There should be a brief presentation of the casehistory of the patient and/or family. c.Then the case can be discussed./9i/195ACTIVITIES 1.The health aide of of the health ser-vice aide in the inter-disciplinaryconfer-ence.d.A person should be designated to take notes so thata permanent record will beavailable of the contribu-tions, recommendations, and decisions of the groupmembers. e.The conference should conclude with a summary ofthe decisions made and a statement of the responsi-bility to be assumed by each agency representative. f.A written report should be sent to each participant. 3.Role of the Professional. a.The professional always has the ultimate responsi-bility for the quantity and quality of care providedthe patient or family.b.The professional will contribute information regard-ing care and problems as they relate to his specialty. c.Example: Public health nurse will discuss nursingcare in the home and the problems involved in givingfamily health care.May or may not assume the leadership role. 4.The Role of the Health Aide. a.The health service aide may or may not assume theleadership role. b.The health service aide will contribute informationregarding the care provided and the problems he hasencountered in working with the patient's family.The health aide is in a unique position to provideother committee members with information andproblems that the patient or family found easier todiscuss with him. Many times the health aide willenlighten the professional participants about prob-lems in a specific neighborhood; feelings of thepatient/family toward authority figures, and otherareas that would otherwise not be known to theprofessionals.Example: The mother was reluctant to inform thepublic health nurse that her child missed the wellbaby clinic appointment because she did not havemoney for shoes; on the other hand she willinglydiscussed the problem with the health aide. c.The health aide assumes partial responsibility for thecare provided the patient/family. 196 OBJECTIVES CONTENT ACTIVITIES informa-tion sharing. 6.Tounderstandtheimportance follow-up.5.Information Sharing.a.Information sharing is the technique used in theconference.b.The quantity and quality of information sharing isusually directly related to the effectiveness of theconference.c.Each participant must have the opportunity tocontribute to the conference.6.Follow-up.a.The purpose of an interdisciplinary conference is tobring various agency representatives together tosolve a problem. The conference is a means to anend; not the end itself.b.Following the conclusion of the conference, eachparticipant assigned a particular function shouldkeep all members abreast of his progress. c.The problem may be of such a nature that addition-al conferences are necessary.d.One person should be delegated the responsibilityfor ensuring that the follow-up measures are carriedout.

Sources used to derive these concepts mainly arethose developed over the past few years by the Institute forYouth Studies, Howard University, and other New CareersTraining Programs.The listing of concepts and substantive elements has asits central aim the belief that there are connnon ideas aboutpeople and their specific and general environments whichmust be built into and reinforced in any learning situationto achieve New Careers stated outcomes. These commonideas include (1) recognition of the dignity of the indivi-dual, (2) his right to self-determination, (3) maximumopportunity for his further development and learning, (4)the experimental basis of learning, and (5) the futility ofverbal procedures as a substitute for the personal experi-ences of the individual.*As concepts become increasingly refined and understoodby boththetrainer and thetrainee, the supportivesubstantive elements also become clearer and easier toapply to the learning process. No attempt has been made toarrange the following list in sequential order. The NewCareers Program is a system composed of many comple-mentary parts which interact with each other and whichcannot be isolated from each other.1. Concept: Success in conducting a New Careers TrainingProgram depends on firm commitments fromhuman service agencies for employment andcareer mobility for trainees.Substantive Elements:A. Training should start only when firm commitmentsfor jobs have been received from the employingagency.B. Prior to taining, the employing agency should have acomprehensive job description for each potentialposition as a base for core, remediation, skill andOJT curriculum development.C.Prior to training, the employing agency should havedetermined realistic career mobility for aides throughat least two additional steps with concomitant jobdescriptions and agency requirements for promotion.D. Prior to program initiation, there should be a general orientation to the New Careers program for allemploying agency staff and trainees.2. Concept: The optimum New Careers Training Model isexperience-based from which flows a series of\"core\" progressions: a core in generic humanservices; a core in a specific human service,and the specific skill and OJT core.Substantive Elements:A. The core of generic human services must stem fromthe life and job experiences of the trainees. *A. D. Woodruff. Basic Concepts of Teaching. San Francisco,Chandler Publishing Co., 1961./0/11B. C. D.
