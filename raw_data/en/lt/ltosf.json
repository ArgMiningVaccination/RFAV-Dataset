ANA C ode of Ethics for Nurses Students at Missoula College UM are expected to adhere to the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses. This requirement establishes the basis for long -term development of professional behaviors and ethical reasoning with regard to client care. Nurses are expected as professionals to provide ethically sound care to all clients regardless of circumstance. Ethics is an integral part of the foundation of nursing. Nursing has a distinguished history of concern for the welfare of the sick, injured, and vulnerable and for social justice. This concern is embodied in the provision of nursing care to individuals and the community. Nursing encompasses the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the protection, promotion, and restoration of health in the care of individuals, families, groups, and communities. Nurses act to change those aspects of socia l structures that detract from health and well -being. Individuals who become nurses are expected not only to adhere to the ideals and moral norms of the profession but also to embrace them as a part of what it means to be a nurse. The ethical tradition of nursing is self -reflective, enduring, and distinctive. A code of ethics makes explicit the primary goals, values, and obligations of the profession. The Code of Ethics for Nurses serve s the following purposes: It is a clear, concise statement of the ethi cal obligations and duties of every individual who enters the nursing profession. It is the professional's nonnegotiable ethical standard It is an expression of nursing's own understanding of its commitment to society. Nursing students of the Missoula C ollege UM are expected to follow the fo llowing Nursing Code of Ethics. The provisions listed below come from the ANA's Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (2015) (https://www.nursingworld.org/coe -view-only). (continued on next page) Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 8 Provisions Provision 1. The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person. Provision 2.

ANA's Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (2015) (https://www.nursingworld.org/coe -view-only) Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 9 Section 2 - Curriculum Nursing Program Mission As the guiding principle for the Missoula College Nursing Program, the mission statement is to provide an excellent and dynamic learning environment through creative educational and clinical opportunities. This will prepare graduates for today 's practice as competent and caring nurses who assist in meeting the di verse health care needs for local and global communities. The Missoula College Nursing Program pursues fulfillment of their mission through the five UM Core Themes by: 1. Creating a supportive environment where students are mentored by knowledgeable faculty a nd empowered to reach their full potential; 2. Promoting the development of knowledge and skills necessary for the intellectual, professional, and personal growth of students; 3. Developing partnerships with local and regional healthcare facilities to establish a variety of learning opportunities and provide exposure to diverse populations; 4. Acknowledging the necessity for lifelong learning and providing nursing education pathways to BSN or higher; and 5. Fostering discovery and creativity, critical thinking skills, and competencies at the associate degree nursing entry level. Nursing Program Philosophy The nursing faculty, as an integral part of the Missoula College assumes responsibility for maintaining program philosophy and objectives which support The University of Montana and Missoula College philosophies. This includes the belief that the educational process is a dynamic, interactive process in the gro wth, development, welfare, and economy of the individual, and local, state, and national communities. Faculty members are dedicated to preparing excellent competent and caring nurses to provide holistic care within the scope of practice of the Associate Degree Registered Nurse (RN). The nursing process and critical judgment are the foundations for nursing practice; and these principles are emphasized throughout the curriculum. The faculty supports a nursing career ladder promoting access to multiple entry and exit points to meet the needs of a diverse population. The program also supports and assists students to meet the CAHN goal of 80% BSN nurses nationally by the year 2020. We partner with Montana Tech of the UM for the RN to BSN education transition. Nursing Practice The nursing faculty believes the philosophy of the MC Nursing Program encompasses the concepts of patient centeredness, professionalism, diversity, holism, and caring. This belief is based on the conceptual framework of Virginia Henderso n. The primary concept of Henderson's theory revolves around establishing relationships between nurse, patient, faculty and student. These relationships are based on assessing and understanding the individual needs while promoting optimal outcomes. Hender son professes the importance of developing the whole person, validating that the mind and body are interconnected and act as one unit, and that there must be a balance to achieve optimal independence and health for the patient and nurse (Alligood, 2013). Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 10 The nursing faculty emulates this philosophy by assisting students to advance in knowledge acquisition, responsibility and accountability through structured guidance in order to develop into increasingly competent, independent, flourishing members of the health care team caring for a diverse population. Core Values Patient -Centeredness: Patient -centeredness refers to individuals, families, communities, and health care teams interacting collaboratively identifying personal preferences, values, tradition s, and culture (NLN, p.14), in working toward the common goal of optimum health, healing and recovery with environments across the lifespan. Patient centeredness includes providing care to the patient, family and environment, assisting the patient to direc t own health care. Professionalism (Integrity): Professionalism (Integrity) refers to having a commitment to compassion, caring and strong ethical values; continuous development of self and others; accountability and responsibility for insightful practice; demonstrating a spirit of collaboration and flexibility\" (Girard, Linton, & Besner, 2005, p. 3). It is participating in the advancement of self through education, knowledge, and development to practice within one's own scope of practic e. Professionalism is the utilizing specialized knowledge, derived from the biological, physical, and behavioral sciences performance of holistic patient centered care along with leadership and autonomy to make evidence -based judgment and decisions (RNAO, 2007). Diversity: Diversity comprises internal and external contexts and processes that have an impact on people. Diversity includes physical, psychological, social, spiritual and cultural elements, as well as the conceptual space in which nursing is u tilized, implemented, and evaluated. Diversity also includes historical, political, and economic conditions through which systems of care evolve. Diversity includes environments of structured and unstructured settings with common, well -defined, advanced, a nd/or unpredictable complexity of clients and family. Holism: Holism is a dynamic state of physical, mental and social well -being, defined in accordance with cultural norms and goals that influence the relationships and interactions of the individual, family, and community. The primary focus is: developing a patient's independence, through nursing care that aid, nurture and care for clients, assisting the person to reach his/her optimal health status. Health promotion and teaching methods are appropr iate to the diverse needs and culture of the client, family and community in order to establish optimal health. Caring: Evidence -based and culturally competent healthcare promoting optimal health across the lifespan. Caring for the Associate Degree Nurse is directing and providing care across settings with clear policies and procedures for clients and family, who have conditions which are common, well -defined, advanced and/or of unp redictable complexity, in collaboration with other members of the healthcare team. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 11 Contributing Concepts: National League of Nursing (NLN): The seven core values outlined by the NLN are professional content and environment, knowledge and science, ethics , excellence, holism, integrity, and patient -centeredness (NLN, 2011, page 8). American Association of Colleges of Nursing (QSEN): The six core competencies outlined by QSEN are: patient -centered care, teamwork and collaboration, evidence -based practice, quality improvement, informatics and safety. (IOM, 2011). Center to Advance Health Care through Nursing (CAHN): The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health, recommendation that 80 percent of the nursi ng workforce be prepared at the baccalaureate level or higher by 2020 (IOM 2011). Statement on Nursing Education Missoula College Nursing Program prepares safe, effective nursing care providers who support humankind in all phases of the health -illness co ntinuum. Learning is a dynamic and life -long process which includes faculty/student collaboration and mentorship through supervised experiences. These experiences facilitate holistic healthcare through acquisition and application of specific knowledge, ski lls, and professional attitudes based upon the scope of practice of the Registered Nurse. These beliefs are based on Jerome Bruner's Model of life -long learning. Bruner states that learning is an active process where conceptual structures are built on pre sent and past learning (Bates & Poole, 2003). Education occurs in steps as students in the Nursing Program acquire facts and terms to assist them in identifying principles and ideas. This continues with the formulation of concepts and relationships in hea lth care, allowing a student to use gained knowledge to enhance the quality of care and ability to use reasoning and critical judgment (Bates & Poole, 2003). Nursing faculty supports this constructivist approach to learning by guiding, encouraging caring behaviors, and advancing knowledge in students, preparing them for life -long learning in a diverse health care system. Students are guided to grow in self -awareness, understanding of others, and sensitivity to cultural, moral, ethical, and legal issues, a pplication of critical judgment, and the technical and interpersonal skills fundamental to the practice of nursing. The faculty believes the associate degree graduate utilizes critical thinking and clinical decision making when functioning in the role of care provider, care manager, and member of the interdisciplinary team leading to optimal patient outcomes. The gradua te is prepared to assess, formulate a nursing diagnosis, plan, implement, and evaluate nursing care provided across care settings. The graduate will practice within the ethical, legal, and regulatory frameworks of registered nursing. The RN will provide ca re to diverse populations while utilizing a knowledge base from the arts and sciences.

Timeliness: Please be on time for class. Students must be on time to clinical . Time management is reflective of professionalism and accountability and will affect your professionalism grade & final course grade. Any unexcused absences in clinical result in a non-passing grade, therefore a non -passing grade for the course. 2. Absences : a. If you know ahead of time you will be absent from class, please let your faculty know via phone or email. (Email is preferred). This is part of your professional grade for each class. b. If you will be absent from clinical, you must inform the instructor and charge nurse of the assigned clinical unit two hours prior to the starting time. This is part of your professional grade for clinical. Any unexcused absences in clinical result in a non - passing grade, therefore a non -passing grade for the course. 3. Immu nizations and Testing : Documented proof of the following must be provided by the date indicated in the acceptance letter . Criminal Background Check 10-Panel Urine Drug Screen BLS for Health Care Providers Immunizations o COVID -19 Vaccinations: Documentation of completed vaccination series (Pfizer or Moderna) -or- single dose Johnson & Johnson, OR World Health Organization - approved vaccine series if received outside of the U.S. HOWEVER, pending updated information from our clinical sites, studen ts may have to be \"up -to-date,\" which may include one or two boosters. Otherwise, an approved exemption must be submitted. Exemption Process : Students may request from Linda Barnes, Nursing Program Director, a medical or a religious exemption form. Once fu lly completed, the form is either approved or denied by the university, then each clinical site has the right to approve or refuse. Please know that if an exemption is approved, your ability to complete the required # of clinical hours may be affected. o Hepatitis B Series (vaccinations AND titer): The series of shots is 2, 3, or 4 doses depending on the manufacturer. Some people have received the series as children so will just need a titer to prove immunity. If you have not yet received the series, you wil l need to start this ASAP because it can take several months to complete. The titer is the final step after the vaccination series is complete. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/v is/vis -statements/hep -b.html Provide proof of your hepatitis B vaccination series (HBV) AND a positive titer. (Can be declined, but student must sign declination forms, indicating they understand the full health risk and are taking responsibility if HepB is contracted.) Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 24 o MMR Series (vaccinations OR titer): This is also a requirement to be a student at UM and most other universities. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/ Provide proof of the 2 -shot series MMR (mumps, measles, rubella) vaccination. OR a positive MM R titer. Note that if needing this, the 2 -shot series MMR should be administered at least 4 weeks apart. o TB (tuberculosis): Provide proof of one of the following negative TB tests that was done in the last 12 months. If the test is positive, a chest x -ray is required. (See under How Do You Get Tested for TB? -- https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/general/tb.htm Two n egative TB skin test s that will be \"read\" 48 -72 hours after being administered (this means 4 visits - one for each test and one for reading each of the results) . The second of the two tests must be administered 7 -21 after the first test. OR a Negative Quantiferon TB blood test. o Tetanus with Pertussis, i.e. Tdap: After initial Tdap vaccine is received, a booster is required every 10 years . Provide proof of current Tdap ( tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough/pertussis). https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis - statements/tdap.html o Varicella (2 -dose series OR titer): Provide proof of Varicella (chickenpox) vaccination series OR a titer. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/varicella/hcp/recommendations.ht ml o Flu: Students will be contacted when seasonal flu vaccines are available about this requirement, which is usually in October or November. o Titers & Boosters Explained: Titer: measures the antibodies in your blood to determine if you have immunity to a disease. If titer is negative, a vaccination booster or series is required. Booster: is an extra administration of a vaccine after an earlier dose. This dose is a re -exposure to the immunizing antigen to insure a later positive titer. 4. Group Work: Do not let your classmates down. When group work is underway, pull your weight and share the work. Encourage group participation in an equitable fashion. Off -task chatter is distra cting to others and NOT considered participation. Please be respectful of your classmates. This is part of your professional grade for each class. 5. Academic honesty is a nursing program and professional expectation. In the event that students are suspec ted of cheating, plagiarism or otherwise misrepresenting their work, they will be subject to procedural due process as stated in the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards). 6. Late work, including exams, will NOT be accepted. It must be handed in during the first 10 minutes of class on the day it is due . Emergencies and extenuating occurrences will be handled on an individual student basis. Please speak to the instructor before the due date if you suspect you may not be able to complete the work on time. Faculty has the final decision on whether or not to accept late assignments and circumstances must be extenuating . Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 25 Multiple requests for assignment extensions may result in loss of points on your professionalism grade. 7. Children & Pets: Do not bring children and pets into the classroom. Faculty are aware that emergency situations may occur and would ask that any stu dent who feels compelled to bring \"guests\" in to the classroom seek the permission of the classroom instructor before doing so. 8. Cell phones MUST BE turned off or on vibrate during all class, lab and clinical sessions. Cell phones at the clinical setting s are per faculty discretion and must be on vibrate. There is no texting in class. The focus needs to be on learning. If you must accept a call notify the instructor before and please quietly leave the area and limit distractions to a minimum. This is part of your professional grade for each class. 9. Laptop Etiquette : Laptops are becoming more popular and being used for taking notes and following along with lectures. If faculty feels that student use of a laptop is distracting or a student is \"surfing\", checking emails or otherwise not engaged in classroom content during class, the laptop will no longer be allowed in the classroom setting. This is part of your professional grade for each class. 10. Computer Resources: Students MUST have access to a reliable computer and have good internet connection. There are computers available in the MC computer labs, MC library, and UM library. Not having computer access or an internet connection is not an acceptable reason for lat e work or exams. 11. Class Behavior: There is no emailing or visiting with other faculty in their office during class time. Your focus needs to be on the content being presented in the course you are attending. This will be part of your professionalism grade. 12. Tobacco Use : Smoking, e -cigarettes and chewing tobacco are not allowed in the classroom, lab or clinical setting. Students who smell of tobacco will be asked to leave the clinical assignment; this may result in a clinical failure for the day. This is a tobacco free campus! 13. Substance Use: a. Students will not be allowed to participate in lab or clinical experiences if under the influence of either prescribed or illegal substances that impair their ability to function effectively and safel y. Additionally, no student may participate in lab or clinical while under the influence of cannabis, regardless of the possession of a registered cannabis card . Any concerns should be addressed to the Nursing Program Director prior to lab and clinical experiences. b. Reasonabl e suspicion of impairment due to substance use may result in further drug testing and potential dismissal from the program. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 26 Nursing Program Professional Behavior The nursing profession demands that the individual be responsible, accountable, self -directed and professional in behavior. The process of becoming a professional person begins upon entering a professional education program. Students demonstrate professionalism by : Attending classes and clinical experiences, Exhibiting courteous behavior, Being prepared for class/clinical assignments, Not meeting with or emailing other faculty during class time Turning in assignments and take -home examinations on time, Not consistently requesting extensions for due dates and Being punctual for class/clinical. Evaluation of professionalism is graded each semester. Elements evaluated are reflected in the rubric criteria below. This grade make s up five (5) percent of each course final grade. The behaviors encouraged in this component of the course are important skills needed in the profession of nursing: they are crucial for successful employment and they are crucial for respectful interaction towards others in the profession. Although there is no mandatory policy for class, faculty believes that to be successful in applying content to clinical class attendance is important. We highly suggest that you attend class. Faculty will also not accep t meetings with students when they are scheduled to be in a schooled class. This is not showing respect or professional behavior toward the faculty teaching the course the student is missing. These issues are part of the professionalism grades.

Throughout the MC nursing program, the student will develop and progress in skill level and professionalism. The method of instruction for specific behaviors will vary based on policy, learner needs, a nd role modeling. Professional behaviors will be assessed and evaluated through direct observation, discussion and documented on the clinical evaluation form during and upon completion of each clinical rotation. Student behavior is directly linked to prog ram outcomes, evaluation tools and the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards/). Students not meeting program outcomes and \"acceptable\" criteria according to the evaluation tool and in the Student Conduct Code will be counseled with possible disciplinary action taken as indicated. When students participate in Nursing Lab, the expectations are the same as those for clinical. Dress code and professional behavior is an expectation in lab. All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University. Al l students need to be familiar with the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards/ ). Uniform Policy - Lab Sett ings The uniform identifies an individual as a student in the Missoula College of the University of Montana Nursing program and is to reflect a positive and professional image of the individual and the school. Clinical institutions also have specific dress code policies which govern student dress code for clinical. The full Uniform Policy is listed in Section 5, pages 56-58; listed here are excerpts that apply to lab only. 1. Uniform will be selected by the MC Nursing Program 2. The maroon uniform may be purchased through the University Bookstore, at area scrub shops, or online. 3.

The Missoula College Nursing Pro gram patch must be sewn on the left arm. 5. The maroon uniform is worn during all lab and clinical experiences conducted in agencies where the use of a uniform is required. 6. The name pin includes the student's first and last name, ASN class, and Missoula Coll ege title. It is to be worn above the chest pocket. 7. The name pin MUST be worn at any time the student is in a lab or clinical setting. For patient safety reasons, you will be asked to leave without this proper identification. This will be considered a lab or clinical absence. 8. Clinical specific name badges MUST also be worn at any time the student is in the clinical setting. For patient safety reasons, you will be asked to leave clinical without this proper identification. This will be considered a clinical absence. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 29 9.

UM Student Conduct Code - Regulations / Plagiarism / Cheating According to the University of Montana, The Student Conduct Code, \"embodying the ideals of academic honesty, integrity, and human rights and responsible citizenship, governs all student conduct at The University of Montana -Missoula. Student enrollment pres upposes a commitment to the principles and polices embodied in this Code\". Copies of the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affair s/community - standards/ ) are available from the offices of the Vice President of Student Affairs, Residence Life and the Associated Students of the University of Montana -Missoula (ASUM). Plagiarism \"Plagiarism is the act of using another person's ideas or expressions in your writing without acknowledging the source...to plagiarize is to give the impression that you have written or thought something that you have in fact borrowed from someone else.\" MLA Handbook for Writers of Research papers by Joseph Giba ldi and Walter S. Achert, 3rd edition. New York: The Modern Language Association, 1988. At Reference Desk.PE 1478.G43 1988. Plagiarism is defined in the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student - affairs/community -standards/ ) on page 5 as, \" Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or ma terials as one's own.\" It is a particularly intolerable offense in the academic community and is strictly forbidden. Students who plagiarize may fail the course and may be remanded to Academic court for possible suspension or expulsion. Please see the St udent Conduct Code. It further states, \"Students must always be very careful to acknowledge any kind of borrowing that is included in their work. This means not only borrowed working but also ideas. Acknowledgment of Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 30 whatever is not one's own work is the proper and honest use of sources.\" Papers are evaluated for plagiarism using an electronic program provided by or approved by the University of Montana. Plagiarism is an unaccepted practice and consequences at minimum will be a failure on the assignment. Cheating MC Nursing Program has a No Tolerance Cheating practice. Cheating on any assignment, report, quiz or exam will result in zero (0) points being awarded for that event, is considered gross misconduct, and may be grounds for immediate dismissal from the nursi ng program with no opportunity for reinstatement, as stated in the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards/ ). National Nursing Student Bill of Rights Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for Students of Nursing The National Student Nurse Association (NSNA) Student Bill of Rights and Responsibilities was initially adopted in 1975. The NSNA House of Delegates in S an Antonio, Texas (1991) updated the document; and item #4 was revised by the NSNA House of Delegates in Baltimore, Maryland (2006). 1. Students should be encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and engage in a sustained and independent s earch for truth. 2. The freedom to teach and the freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom: students should exercise their freedom in a responsible manner. 3. Each institution has a duty to develop policies and procedures, which provide and safeguard the students' freedom to learn. 4. Under no circumstances should a student be barred from admission to a particular institution on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, ethnicity, age, gender, marital status, life style, disability, or economic status. 5. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. 6. Students should have protection through orderly procedures against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation, but they are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. 7. Information about student vi ews, beliefs, political ideation, or sexual orientation, which instructors acquire in the course of their work or otherwise, should be considered confidential and not released without the knowledge or consent of the student, and should not be used as a bas is of evaluation. 8. The student should have the right to have a responsible voice in the determination of his/her curriculum. 9. Institutions should have a carefully considered policy as to the information, which should be a part of a student's permanen t educational record and as to the conditions of this disclosure. 10. Students and student organizations should be free to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them, and to express opinions publicly and privately. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 31 11. Students should be allow ed to invite and to hear any person of their own choosing within the institution's acceptable realm, thereby taking the responsibility of furthering their education. 12. The student body should have clearly defined means to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic and student affairs, e.g., through a faculty -student council, student membership or representation on faculty committees. 13. The institution has an obligation to clarify those standards of behavi or, which it considers essential to its educational mission, its community life, or its objectives and philosophy. 14. Disciplinary proceedings should be instituted only for violations of standards of conduct formulated with significant student participat ion and published in advance through such means as a student handbook or a generally available set of institutional regulations. It is the responsibility of the student to know these regulations. Grievance procedures should be available for every student. 15. As citizens and members of an academic community, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by virtue of this membership and should enjoy the same freedoms of citizenship. 16. Students have the right to belong or refuse to belong t o any organization of their choice. 17. Students have the right to personal privacy in their living space to the extent that the welfare and property of others are respected. 18. Adequate safety precautions should be provided by nursing programs, for exa mple, adequate street lighting, locks, and other safety measures deemed necessary by the environment. 19. Dress code, if present in school, should be established with student input in conjunction with the school director and faculty, so the highest profes sional standards are maintained, but also taking into consideration points of comfort and practicality for the student. 20. Grading systems should be carefully reviewed periodically with students and faculty for clarification and better student -faculty un derstanding. 21. Students should have a clear mechanism for input into the evaluation of nursing faculty NSNA Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for Students of Nursing , (https://www.nsna.org/nsna -code -of-ethics.html) Student Confidentiality : Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) What is FERPA? FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, is a federal law passed in 1974 and codified at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g. It is also commonly known as the Buckley Amendment. The law protects the privacy of student educational records and provides rights to students for access to and amendment of those records. FERPA applies to any higher edu cation institution receiving federal funds administered by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 32 Who is protected under FERPA? The rights under FERPA apply primarily to eligible students. An eligible student is an individual who is or has been in attendance at Missoula College. Be aware that a student under the age of 18 or 21 is an eligible student under FERPA if he or she is att ending or has attended the College. Applicants are not technically students covered under FERPA, but because they may attend the University, MC treats their applications confidentially (See nursing program Policy F22 Family Educational Rights and Responsib ility Act). Military Deployment The Missoula College of the University of Montana recognizes the hardships military personnel and their families face at this time of uncertainty. The College understands that military students who are deployed away from their homes or permanent duty stations may experience difficulties with completing the program. The Missoula College encourages service members to continue with their education and assures them that the College will continue to be flexible and responsive to their needs. Military students who have been accepted into the Associate Degree Nursing program will have their place in the program and degree status held from the point of deployment until their return without penalty. Pending the length of time of th eir deployment, there may be some courses that will need to be retaken. These will be looked at on an individual basis. Active -duty personnel who have been deployed from their normal duty stations and National Guard and Reserve personnel called to federa l active duty will have their place in the nursing program and degree enrollment extended to the amount of time they served in support of their service operations. Nursing Program Student Ambassadors Student input and involvement is vital to the Nursing Program's ability to maintain insight to student concerns and challenges. Missoula College University of Montana invites students to be involved in the program though ambassadorships. All students are requested to offer evaluations of faculty, clinical a nd program at the end of the semester. However, there are challenges students have along the way; therefore, faculty will select and offer to 1 (one) ASN nursing program student from each semester to be an ambassador for the academic year. This student will represent students at advisory council meetings, held one to two times per year, attend faculty meetings monthly as invited by the Director and be a direct link to the Director for communication, concerns and student challenges. Students selected are briefed on expectations and methods of professional conduct in communicating concerns and student insight. If a selected student declines to participate, another will be asked to ensure student placement. The selected student ambassador understands the purpose and responsibilities are: To recommend policies toward recruitment, retention and placement of nursing students. Articulate the policies and procedures for the nursing program, faculty and students. Recommend curriculum adaptations based on changing competencies, knowledge, skills and attitudes for successful entry into nursing practice at all levels. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 33 Assist in the identification of resources for educational materials and equipment, clinical practicum and preceptor sites, and support services for students and the nursing program. Assist in long -term planning based on changes in the health care industry, assessment of community needs and educational needs of the nurse clinician. Attend faculty meeting s. Attend Nursing Advisory Committee and other meetings as appropriate.

Tests are to be taken at the times they are scheduled. 2. All Moodle tests will remain open for student testing no longer than 24 hours as set up per course instructors. Students must make arrangements to be able to take an online Moodle test within the 24 hour date and time as set up. If unable, it must be dis cussed with the course instructor prior to the test date and time. Final decision of approving a request will be per the course instructor. Please note that the close time is indicative of when the quiz/exam will no longer be available and the student will not be able to log in after the quiz/exam closing time. 3. If a student is unable to take an exam at the scheduled time due to extenuating circumstances, the student must notify the course instructor prior to the scheduled test date and time to discuss thei r options. Make -up examinations are offered at the discretion of the course instructor for extenuating circumstance. Arrangements for make -up testing will be made with the course instructor. 4. Students are expected to follow established guidelines of test taking in Moodle; any concerns regarding dishonest conduct during test taking will result in a zero for the test and may result in immediate suspension from the nursing program. 5. Exams being administered in Moodle can be taken during school hours or at h ome dependent on instructor preference. In the event an exam in Moodle is being taken at home students are expected to adhere to the following: Students are expected to have an available working computer. Not having computer access is not an acceptable re ason for not completing a Moodle online exam during the allotted time Ensure internet access is working. When internet access at home is not reliable please consider taking the exam in the computer labs or library on campus. Extensions will not be grante d for internet problems unless there are extenuating and unusual circumstances that are verified by your instructor . If you are locked out of Moodle during an examination you must complete the following: o Call or email the professor within 15 minutes of being locked out. The instructor will reset the test. o If the lock out occurs after regular working hours, the instructor will make arrangements for communicating how to be contacted and deal with the lock out. You must leave an email within 15 minutes of being locked out that can be verified by the next morning. Also leave a voice mail with the time of the message. The instructor will reset the test based on following the above policy. This reset can occur only once and the test reset may be a differe nt test than the one that locked out. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 43 If a lock -out occurs a second time, the professor must be notified within the 15 - minute rule and then the student is to make an appointment with the faculty for further arrangements. If a pattern of lock -outs are occurring, this will be handled under the advisement of the student, instructor, program director and/or Health Department Chair. If you are unable to find an assigned examination or unable to open an assigned examination, you MUST contact the instr uctor immediately by email or phone call. Failure to do so could mean a failure on an examination. The instructor must have proof of the sent message either by email or voice mail: Faculty understand there can be technical issues when administering tests in Moodle. The follow guidelines are designed to assist the student and also protect the integrity of the student and nursing program by guarding against cheating. Moodle Tech Support For technical support with online courses or Moodle, contact the UMOnline Help Desk (https://www.umt.edu/umonline/ ); phone 406.243.4999. Please have both your UM 790# and your Net ID# available to verify your identity. Guidelines for Taking Tests in Moodle The goal of the nursing program is to make learning and assessment as efficient as possible. Students are expected to follow the guidelines and parameters outlined by faculty; failure to do so may result in an exam that is not accepted and may result in a \"0\" grade. Nursing courses must be passed with an 80% average for progression to the next semester. Students unable to adhere to set standard of 80% cumulative grades will receive a non - passing grade for the course which is defined as <80 %. Faculty is not obliged to \"round up\". If you have a cumulative score of 79.9% you may still receive a non -passing grade for the course. Dosage Calculations Policy To assist in assuring patient safety and to be in compliance with the learning outcomes of Safety in QSEN, students are required to successfully pass a dosage calculation examination based on the following; For NRSG 234/235 and NRSG 244/245 and NRSG 259/26 1: To promote medication administration safety in the clinical setting, students will be required to earn a minimum of 100% on a dosage calculation quiz prior to starting clinical experiences in NRSG 235: Adult Nursing I. Students will have two attempts t o earn a 100% on the dosage calculations quiz. In the event a student is unable to earn a 100% on the quiz after the initial attempt, the student will meet with the instructor, discuss areas of concerns, and develop a mutual action plan to assist the stude nt in achieving goals of safe medication administration. The final attempt will be scheduled at the discretion of the instructor. In the event students are unable to earn a 100% on the quiz after two attempts, students will not be allowed to pass medicat ions in the NRSG 235 clinical setting (This could potentially result in a failing grade for the clinical portion of this class). Students may use calculators and are advised to come prepared. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 44 For NRSG 246/247 (Health & Illness of Child & Family Nursing): To promote medication administration safety in the clinical setting, students will be required to earn 100% on a pediatric dosage calculation quiz prior to starting clinical experiences. Students will have two attempts to earn a 100% on the dosage calcul ations quiz. In the event a student is unable to earn a 100% on the quiz after the initial attempt, the student will meet with the instructor, discuss areas of concerns, and develop a mutual action plan which will include a mandatory tutoring session to as sist the student in achieving goals of safe medication administration. The final attempt will be scheduled at the discretion of the instructor. In the event students are unable to earn a 100% on the quiz after two attempts, students will not be allowed i n the NRSG 247 clinical setting. Students may use calculators and are advised to come prepared. Kaplan Nursing What is Kaplan Nursing ? Kaplan Nursing is an educational partner that offer s resources to increase content learning and test preparation throu ghout the program. The complete program offers multiple assessment and remediation activities. Students are guided through online tutorials, assignments and practice exams that assess strengths and weaknesses and allow students to remediate in weak areas . The combination of the Kaplan program along with the nursing curriculum content assists students to prepare for the workforce and to successfully pass the NCLEX examination. Data from student testing and remediation can be used for program's quality impro vement and outcome evaluation. Kaplan information and orientation resources can be accessed from your student home page. It is mandatory that you spend time navigating these valuable orientation materials found on your Kaplan student home page. Integrated Testing: Kaplan provides integrated testing in all major content areas. Tests may be assigned during the course and/or as part of active learning/remediation. Focused Review Tests: Kaplan offers Focused Review (Practice) tests available to stu dents 24/7. The student can either select from a list of standardized tests or create their own customized focused review. Students can review their results and remediate weaker content areas. Proctored Exams: Each course may require an end -of-semester p roctored exam to assess course content learning. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 45 Clinical Resources & Digital Clinical Experiences: Kaplan and Shadow Health provide a variety of mid -fidelity simulations that offer focused assessments of different clients. The Kaplan modules in their C linical Resources section guide the student through a Chart Assessment, Physical Assessment, Nursing Diagnosis, Care Planning and Evaluation. Shadow Health's Digital Clinical Experiences guide students through patient interviewing and assessments, and char t documentation. NCLEX Prep: Kaplan offers an NCLEX -RN preparation course that is split into three phases. Phase I contains content and tests to be completed by the student before the face -to-face NCLEX preparation class. Phase II is a live class offered by an NCLEX expert from Kaplan. Phase III is used for final preparation for taking the NCLEX and includes 7 Question Trainers, NCLEX Sample Tests, and a Readiness Test that will give the student a probability of passing the NCLEX. Progression in Nursing Program In order to continue in the nursing program, the student must: Maintain a grade of B or better in all required nursing courses and maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Working LPNs in the ASN program must maintain an unencumbered LPN license in the State of Montana. Maintain ability to meet essential functions for nursing with or without reasonable accommodations. Maintain current BLS for Health Care Providers, Flu vaccination (during Flu season) and TB testing (these are the vaccinations and tests that must be renewed/updated regularly). Complete all nursing courses in the prescribed sequence. If a student withdr aws or makes a C or less grade in a nursing course, the student cannot progress in the nursing course sequence until the student has reapplied and been reaccepted into the nursing program. The course must be successfully completed with a B or greater o n the second attempt or the student with removed from the nursing program. Course repetition will be based on instructor availability, clinical site availability, and program resources. 90-100% = A 80-89% = B 70-79% = C 60-69% = D Below 59% = F Students must s uccessfully complete the program within approximately 24 months from acceptance into the ASN program . Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 46 Progression Requirements in Lecture/Clinical Courses Students must pass all nursing classes in order to progress to the next semester . There is no exception to this rule. Students must achieve at least 80 % in the didactic and lab portion and a \"Pass\" grade in clinical to pass the course. All clinical requirements must be completed by the end of the academic term. A course grade of incomplete will only be assigned to students that are in good academic standing in the nursing program and have negotiated an \"incomplete\" contract with the faculty by the last day of class before finals. Progressive Disciplinary Policy Studen ts may be required, based on conduct, to be placed in a progressive disciplinary mutual action plan or contract. The progression is based on student conduct and need to ensure client safety and the development of professional behaviors and accountability. Step 1: Verbal Discussion and possible Mutual Action Plan (MAP) or Student Contract, Documentation placed in student file. Step 2: Mutual Action Plan or Contract, copy to file. Meet with Director if applicable. Step 3: Dismissal if student is unable to meet Mutual Action Plan or Contract Criteria. Dismissal from Nursing Program The global performance of a student may result in student dismissal when the cumulative picture of a student's behavior is determined unacceptable for the profession. If the overall presentation of the student in the view of the Program Director shows consistent problems, the student will be dismissed from the program. A student may be dismissed from the nursing program for the following reasons: Through the progressive disciplinary process whereby a student does not improve or comply; however, students may be removed without progressive disciplinary process in cases of unsafe client care, sentinel events or risk to public safety. An unsuccessful a ttempt (C, D, F, or withdrawal) in a required nursing course. A student may only repeat and reapply to the nursing program once. After a course has not been successfully passed the second time, the student is no longer eligible to reapply to the nursing p rogram. All nursing courses may be repeated only once. Disciplinary reasons and/or unsafe/unsatisfactory skill performance in lab or client care in the clinical area. Appeals Students wishing to appeal the dismissal action must do so by following the a ppeals process described in the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community - standards) . Each clinical facility may develop i ndividual institutional policies related to student conduct in cooperation with the Nursing Program Director. A clinical facility may refuse to accept a student or request that a student be withdrawn from the facility after citing cause. This may be a bas is for dismissal from the program. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 47 Miscellaneous Policies Withdrawals / Audits / Refunds from Nursing Programs Withdrawing, failing or not completing a required class will result in the student losing their position on the accepted list, and therefore their place in clinical. Reapplication to the program must occur if there is no space availability for the next semester. This decision is based on keeping with the Montana State Board of Nursing regulation 24.159.662 (3) when providing direct patient care, no more than ten students may be supervised at a time by a faculty member. Students should consult the Registrar's Office to determi ne the last day for withdrawal. Tuition refund depends upon the time the withdrawal application is filed. Consult the UM Undergraduate A dmissions office and the University of Montana Catalog for details. Withdrawals are NOT permitted during finals week. Address, Phone Number, and Email Changes Students with a change of address, phone number or email are requested to make these changes to their records and demographics. Changes must be made in Cyberbear. Please make sure to provide your changes to the Nu rsing Program Administrative Associate as well so that your nursing program records can be updated. Please make changes as quickly as possible to ensure accurate means of communication between Missoula College, faculty, and students. Student and Faculty C ommunication All communication between students and faculty must be through the University of Montana UMConnect. This can be a direct communication using UMConnect or through a specific Moodle course. Texting (except in clinical) or use of private email ac counts is not acceptable. APA Format and Citation The Nursing Department follows the American Psychological Association (APA) citation guidelines. A valuable resource for APA formatting and citation is the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association , 6th Edition, Washington, DC, by the Am erican Psychological Association.

It is your responsibility to completely fill out the form , have signed, and submit to the Missoula College cashier by the deadline along with the application fee. Fees /deadlines are listed on the application. As part of UM policy, no ncomp liance by the application deadline will mean waiting until the FOLLOWING term to graduate. Th e result is a delay in taking the NCLEX. Graduation information /application (https://www.umt.edu/registrar/students/graduation.php ). Financial Aid Counseling at Graduation Financial ai d counseling is available upon graduation via Federal Student Aid (studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) regarding responsibilities of financial assistance payment plans and can be completed electronically. Degree / National Certification Exams Successful completion of the Associate of Science in nursing coursework leads to an Associate of Science Degree in Nursing. Award of the AS is not contingent upon the student passing any type of external certification or licensure examination. After the nursing program has been completed, students are eligible to take the national licensing exam (NCLEX -RN). Successful completion of this exam is required for licensure and employment. A graduate may receive a temporary license when they have completed the application to test. This temporary license along with an Employer Sworn Statement is required for employment as a Graduate Nurse, and a graduate is responsible for notifying a prospective employer of their status in this regard. The temporary license is only active for 90 days. The NCLEX exam needs to be completed within this time limit. Upon successful completion of the licensing exam, the candidate receives their permanent license. It is the student's responsibility to contact the registrar's office to obtain transcript release forms and to submit the forms with the required fees to the Board of Nursing of the student's choice. Once you have successfully passed the NCLEX you will be licensed to practice nursing in the State of Montana or the state o f your choice and can then work in anywhere in United States after you complete an application with the State Board of Nursing for the State you wish to be employed. An applicant may be denied a license if he/she has a criminal record including a Minor i n Possession (MIP), complete their application fraudulently or withhold information, or fail to meet other standards or requirements established by the Board of Nursing.

Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 52 Expected Clinical and Lab Behavior Nurses are expected to exhibit profess ional behaviors. Throughout the MC nursing program, the student will develop and progress in skill level and professionalism. The method of instruction for specific behaviors will vary based on policy, learner needs, and role modeling. Professional behavio rs will be assessed and evaluated through direct observation, discussion and documented on the clinical evaluation form during and upon completion of each clinical rotation. Student behavior is directly linked to program outcomes, evaluation tools and the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards/). Students not meeting program outcomes and \"acceptable\" criteria acc ording to the evaluation tool and in the Student Conduct Code will be counseled with possible disciplinary action taken as indicated. When students participate in Nursing Lab, the expectations are the same as those for clinical. Dress code and professi onal behavior is an expectation in lab. All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University. All students need to be familiar with the UM Student Conduct Code (http://www.umt.edu/student -affairs/community -standards/ ). Student Clinical Role 1. Personal belongings (wallets, purses, books, etc.) are discouraged from being broug ht to the clinical area due to lack of secure areas. Coats are to be hung in the areas provided for nursing staff on each unit. 2. Gum chewing and tobacco use are not allowed on the unit. Please avoid crowding staff lounges. Eating and drinking at the nurses' stations is prohibited by OSHA standards. Do not eat or drink stock foods on the nursing units. 3. Latex Sensitivity: There is a possibility that you will encounter latex either in the nursing lab or in clinical. Please follow this protocol: A: If you think you may have a latex allergy, see a physician, call an allergist, and request a blood test to determine your sensit ivity. B: If it is determined you are sensitive to latex, minimize or avoid contact with latex. Check package labels, avoid powdered gloves, select nitrite or vinyl gloves if appropriate/available and wash hands immediately after wearing gloves. C: Notify your instructor or primary nurse if you develop a skin rash or have difficulty breathing after using/wearing latex products. D: Follow any physician recommended treatment or precautions. 4. Confidentiality and HIPAA compliance is top priority . HIPAA is a federal mandate that must be followed by facility and students. Never discuss a patient with anyone not directly involved with that patient's care. NEVER discuss patients in the cafeteria, elevator, at home or in any public area. Do not write the patient's name, initials, birth date or any personal identifiers on any of your written assignments, assignment sheet or other notes. Breech of this confidentiality will result in immediate dismissal from assigned clinical area and completion of a Student Mutual C ontract. Repeat offenses may result in probation, suspension, or dismissal from the program. Never take a photograph in the clinical setting. This is a state and federal offense that can be punishable by fines, jail time, loss of employment and/or license. This action could jeopardize the viability of our nursing Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 53 program. Any breach of confidentiality will result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the program. THINK BEFORE YOU ACT! 5. Patient charts may not be taken off the nursing units . If the nurses' station is crowded, take the chart to the conference room after leaving a note in the chart holder stating where the chart is and who has it. No part of a chart may be copied . Computer copies of lab results, etc. may not be taken off th e unit or used in student care plan assignments. 6. Language in all areas (including break areas) will be well -modulated, sensitive, and sensible and will not be of a confidential nature. Objectionable language use in any clinical area will not be tolerated. Offenders may be removed from assigned areas and referred to student services. Never discuss your personal problems with patients, visitors, or hospital staff. Be cautious about expressing your opinion without thinking. Do not become involved with the family business of patients. 7. When answering the phone , identify the unit and give your title. For example: \"Orthopedic Unit, Alex Smith, Student Nurse.\" Do not take any orders or messages from physicians. 8. At the completion of your shift , check to make sure your patient's room is neat and that your patient has fresh water, etc. Remember to pick up after yourself in patient rooms, utility rooms, conference rooms and nurses' stations. Give a detailed written and/or verbal report to your primary nurse of care gi ven, any unusual assessments and care remaining, before leaving each day. 9. On each assigned unit , be familiar with the location of the environment of care board, crash cart and the procedures for a code blue. Be familiar with the phone numbers at both hosp itals for reporting code situations: Providence Saint Patrick Hospital - 75330 Community Medical Center - 2222 Other clinical sites - 911 10. When leaving the nursing unit for any reason, let your primary nurse and instructor know where you are going and why. You may and should attend all tests and therapies with your patient. Students will not be solely responsible for a patient while accompanying them off the unit and wil l not substitute for hospital personnel for transport. Students may not accompany patients outside the institution alone. Students are allowed one 30 -minute break for each six - hour shift worked and after 8 hours 2 fifteen -minute breaks. Breaks are to be t aken off the nursing units but on facility grounds in designated eating areas and must first be approved by your primary nurse. Keep in mind the priority of timely patient care which may at times delay scheduled breaks. 11. Before discharging a patient , make final check with the primary nurse: all patients must have IVs discontinued, received needed supplies, medications, prescriptions, personal belongings, discharge instructions and a written discharge order by the physician . 12. Seek Learning Experiences : It is your responsibility to seek and find learning experiences such as procedures to perform. Word of warning: Do not let us find you standing around with your hands in your pockets!!! Clues to upcoming procedures include noting NPO signs, special sets and equipment brought to the unit and listening carefully during report. Call your instructor for all procedures. Before performing any tasks or procedures, ask yourself \"WHY?\" You should be prepared to discuss the rationale and underlying principles for all procedures. Never assume anything! Find the needed information!! Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 54 13. Document according to agency and unit policy format . Documentation varies from facility to facility and from unit to unit. Have all nurses' notes approved by instructor or primary nurse prior to writing them in the chart until you are comfortable with the format. Do not chart on the computers in the nurse's station at SPH. Start notes on scratch paper promptly after initial patient assessment and update appropriately throughout the shift . Record vital signs, I and O, and medications promptly. 14. Medications are to be set up and administered only in the presence of your instructor until designated otherwise by your instructor. Follow exactly the medication administration protocol learned in classroom and lab, as well as facility protocol. Page your instructor 30 minutes before each scheduled medication time (unless previously arranged with the instructor). Know the medications (generic and brand names, usual dosage range, action, side effects, route, dosage and any pertinent nursing implications). If unable to reach your instructor, ask your primary nurse to give the medication. 15. Demeanor: Demonstrate an interest in nursing, your patients and others while on duty. Be the first person to smile and say hello to hospital staff members, patients, visitors, etc. 16. Policy & Procedure Manuals : When orienting on a nursing unit, be familiar with where the policy and procedure manuals are located on the computer facility website or on the floor. You will be expected to follow them. 17. Start -of-Shift Protocol - Charts : Each day prior to report, review patient's chart for any changes or new orders. Make appropriate changes on your daily report sheets and use the information to ask pertinent questions during report. Having thoroughly studied the chart the day before, you need onl y to check the preceding 24 -hours of nurses' notes, doctors' orders, vital signs and other flow sheets, doctors' progress, lab and diagnostic reports and medication administration record (MAR). If the chart is unavailable to you the day before, you are responsible for making time to prepare properly PRIOR to report. If your assigned patient has been discharged, it is your responsibility to notify your clinical instructor and select an alternate patient to care for. Remember as well, if there is identifying information on your report sheet, it may not leave the facility and must be shredded. 18. Start -of-Shift Protocol - Primary Nurse : Introduce yourself to your primary nurse on arrival to the unit. You are expected to participate in bedside report on all of t he patients assigned to your nurse. Tell him/her what your hours will be and what you will and will not be doing. 19. Patient Assessments : On all assigned patients, you will systematically perform assessments that are complete and within the scope of practi ce for the nursing student. Please be attuned to provider orders. Report questionable or abnormal findings promptly to the clinical instructor and primary nurse. 20. Taping Patient Reports : If asked to \" audio -tape\" a report on your patient, write out the information on scratch paper and have it approved by your primary nurse before recording. Students who tape report must be available to oncoming shifts to answer questions. 21. Substance Use : Students are responsible for following all facility work and safety rules and for observing the standards of behavior of our clinical affiliate sites. You are strictly prohibited from using or being under the influence of prohibited substances or alcohol while in clinical. We recognize the use of any drug, legal or illegal, can adversely affect a student's work performance and safety . The misuse of legal prescriptions is a common form of drug abuse. There are situations where students can safely and efficiently perform their jobs while taking prescribed drugs. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 55 It is your responsibility to ask your provider or pharmacist about the potential effects of your prescription medication(s) before starting clinical. A student must inform the Nursing Program Director of the use of a medically prescribed drug or an over -the-counter drug that might affect, alter or impair behavior, motor functions or physical or mental abilities prior to starting a clinical rotation. Chemical dependence has been identified as a primary concern of the Montana State Board of Nursing, according t o the Executive Director. Complimentary online courses have been developed to help students and nurses to better understand the physical and behavioral signs of chemical dependency. Students are encouraged to access these courses entitled: \"Nurse Manager Guidelines for Substance Use Disorder\" and \"Understanding Substance Use Disorder in Nursing\" . These are self -paced courses from the National Council for State Boards of Nursing, (NCSBN) meant for nurses at all educational levels. 22. Practice all Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals : Identify patients correctly o Use at least two ways to identify patients. For example, use the patient's name and date of birth. This is done to make sure that each patient gets the medicine and treatment meant for them. o Make sure that the correct patient gets the correct blood type w hen they get a blood transfusion. Improve staff communication o Quickly get important test results to the right staff person. Prevent infection o Use the hand cleaning guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organiz ation. o Use proven guidelines to prevent infections that are difficult to treat. o Use proven guidelines to prevent infection of the blood from central lines. o Use safe practices to prevent infection after surgery. o Use proven guidelines to prevent infections o f the urinary tract that are caused by catheters. Use alarms safely o Make improvements to ensure that alarms on medical equipment are heard and responded to on time. Use medicines safely o Before a procedure, label medicines that are not labeled. For example, medicines in syringes, cups and basins. Do this in an area where medicines and supplies are set up. o Take extra care with patients who take medicines to thin their blood. o Record and pass along correct information about a patient's medicines. Find out what medicines the patient is taking. Compare those medicines to new medicines given to the patient. Make sure the patient knows which medicines to take when they are at home. Tell the patient it is important to bring their up -to-date list of medicines every time they visit a doctor. Identify patient safety risks Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 56 o Find out which patients are most likely to try to harm themselves Prevent mistakes in surgery o Make sure that the correct surgery is done on the correct patient and at the correct place on the patient's body. o Mark the correct place on the patient's body where the surgery is to be done. o Pause before the surgery to make sure that a mistake is not being made. Clinical Attendance Tardiness in clinical is defined as up to 15 minutes late for a clinical assignment. Tardiness past two occurrences will be considered an absence. A student contract will be form ulated with a student with attendance and punctuality problems. Personal appointments made during scheduled clinical hours will be considered an absence . An absence in clinical must be excused by documentation from a healthcare provider or must constitut e an extenuating circumstance AND must involve prior notification to the clinical instructor and to the primary instructor. Not doing so will result in an unacceptable score for your clinical experience . Supervision During Clinicals Students are expected to communicate any issues or concerns that may arise in a professional manner using the appropriate chain of command. In the clinical setting all issues or concerns should be reported to the supervising clinical faculty. Any unresolve d issues or concerns should then be reported to the Course Instructor and/or Program Director. The overall responsibility for the Nursing program is with the Program Director at the MC. Clinical Preceptors Students may participate in clinical experience s under the direct supervision of a preceptor in some of the courses. The use of preceptors by students must be approved by the clinical faculty. Courses offering a preceptor component may include: NRSG 235, 237, 245, 247, 261 and 267. Facilities utilize d for preceptors must have an active affiliate agreement. The Preceptorship learning experience follows standards to ensure student, facility and preceptor safety and policy compliance. Preceptors are chosen in cooperation with the facility and are supe rvised by Missoula College Nursing Faculty who are available for consult during the entire clinical experience. Each student will be assigned to only one nurse. The student to preceptor ratio is 1:1. Orientation and a Preceptor manual are provided to bot h the student and the preceptor. MC faculty make visits (in person or electronically) to the facility during a time when the student is present, two to four times per semester and/or as needed depending on the total hours of the Preceptorship. MC faculty is available by phone during the entire time the student is participating in clinical hours. The contact information will be provided to the preceptor. MC faculty is available to assist staff in the evaluation of the student. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 57 Each course that h as a preceptor learning experience has a Preceptor Manual available to students and the preceptor. The manual outlines the clinical and course objectives for the student, preceptor, and responsible faculty. It also provides general information about the student and the program. Students are not allowed to be in clinical more than three (3) twelve (12) hours shifts in a row, unless preauthorized by faculty. Between classroom and preceptorship hours, fatigue could be a potential patient harm issue; theref ore, students must adhere to the time constraint. Students and/or faculty arrange clinical schedules with the assigned preceptor. Prior to the first day of the preceptorship clinical, the MC faculty must have a copy of the schedule. Any changes in schedu le must be communicated with instructor. In NRSG 235 Adult Nursing I, there is opportunity for preceptorship hours at Montana State Prison. NRSG 266 Managing Client Care Clinical, the preceptorship starts at the beginning of the course. In NRSG 245 and NR SG 261, Adult Nursing II and III, there is an opportunity for rural nursing preceptorship clinical. These students apply and are picked by faculty to participate in the program. Clinical Evaluation Each clinical instructor may complete a midterm and fi nal written evaluation. Evaluations review mainly the student's psychomotor and affective behaviors during the rotation, and also include evaluation of cognitive skills. These evaluations will be discussed between the student and the clinical instructor. T his represents an opportunity to discuss the student's progress and should not be interpreted by the student as undue criticism. Students are asked to accept constructive criticism in a professional, positive manner and to learn from this feedback. It is t he student's responsibility to meet with the instructor to review the evaluation. Clinical paperwork is considered part of the clinical evaluation. Paperwork must be typed with appropriate use of spelling and grammar. Correct use of APA format is an expe ctation. The paperwork may be returned to be corrected when spelling, grammar and/or APA format is not appropriately followed. Students have the opportunity to evaluate instructors and clinical sites, if pertinent, at the end of each course via a formal course evaluation form. Travel to Clinical Training Sites Students must have available and reliable transportation in order to insure that the student is able to arrive on time, both at local and distant clinical sites. Lack of transportation is not considered a viable reason to miss clinical. Situations related to snow and ice will be considered. As a rule, if The University System ca ncels face to face classes campus wide due to inclement weather, clinical is also cancelled. Please listen to local radio and television regarding campus closures and late starts. Clinical Site Parking Students are expected to abide by the parking policy provided by each facility. Vehicles must be Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 58 parked in appropriate areas and may be subject to towing at the student's expense. A parking violation may result in loss of clinical privileges, an unacceptab le score for that clinical experience and possible dismissal from program. Providence Saint Patrick Hospital: Vehicles must be parked on the streets or in designated student parking lots. Do not park in the designated patient parking areas. Students wil l be issued citations by Missoula Parking Commission if parked in the wrong areas. Community Medical Center: Students are to park in the lots designated for employees. These lots are located in front of the hospital farthest away from main entrance. Th e front areas are for visitors and clients. In the event a student is noted to have parked in a visitor or client area, clinical privileges may be revoked and students may not be allowed to return to clinical. Please refer to Orientation Module for furth er clarification. Pre and Post Clinical Conferences Pre and post clinical conferences are an integral part of the student's learning. Conferences are informal and interactive; therefore, all students are expected to contribute by sharing clinical experiences related to the learning objectives and focus for the clinical experience. Students are guided to set new goals for their next clinical experience. Attendance and participation are mandatory. Pre-Clinical Conferences Pre-clinical conferences last 10 -15 minutes, are between an individual student and th e clinical instructor, and occur prior to delivering direct patient care. The purpose of the Pre -conference meeting is to: a. Present and clarify the objectives for the clinical experience. b. Address student questions regarding the assigned patient. Post -Clini cal Conferences Post-clinical conferences last 30 -60 minutes, involve all students assigned to the clinical site and the clinical instructor, and occur at the end of the clinical. Again, attendance is mandatory, and considered part of the scheduled clinic al hours. Students are advised not to plan personal appointments during clinical conference, as they will be considered absent from clinical. The purpose of the post -clinical conference is to: a. Analyze clinical experiences and share learning experiences w ith classmates, b. Correlate theory to clinical practice, c. Provide an opportunity to identify, clarify and explore nursing problems. d. Provide for active participation of each student. e. Present assigned patient or other case study. f. Practice effective communicatio n using SBAR as a means to \"report\" and communicate with peers and supervisors. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 59 Uniform Policy - Clinical Experiences The uniform identifies an individual as a student in the Missoula College of the University of Montana Nursing program and is to reflect a positive and professional image of the individual and the school.

The name pin MUST be worn at any time the student is in a lab or clinical setting. For patient safety reasons, you will be asked to leave without this proper identification. This will be considered a lab or clinical absence. 8. Clinical specific name badges MUST also be worn at any time the student is in the clinical setting. For patient safety reasons, you will be asked to leave clinical without this proper identification. This will be considered a clinical absence. 9. Variations in the dress code due to the requirements of the clinical s etting will be clarified by faculty. Exceptions to the dress code which are related to cultural or religious beliefs may be granted by the Program Director or a designee, upon written request by the student. 10. Students are expected to have required supplies during clinical at all times. These include: functional stethoscope working penlight report sheet pen appropriate clinical paperwork 11. Official uniforms and identification must be worn anytime a student is at a lab or clinical site. This includes when choosing a patient. 12.

The following are guidelines to assist students in their decision making. Fever greater than 100 .4 F Diarrhea Contagious rash or undiagnosed rash with drainage Cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth Shingles Antibiotic therapy of less than 24 hours, i.e. strep throat Untreated Lice infestation Cough with yellow or green sputum Vomiting (contin ued on next page) Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 61 COVID -19 policy and procedures mandates: o Missoula College Nursi ng Program Policies Procedure Manual, Student Resources (https://www.umt.edu/missoula -college -nursing/nurs ing- student -resources.php )/ o University Information (https://www.umt.edu/curry - health -center/corona -virus.php ). Questions: Students with any questions or concerns regarding clinical attendance and communicable disease or infection control should contact the instructor. For additional information, please refer to the Center for Disease Control (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/ ). Reporting of Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Student Policy on Bloodborne Pathogens, September 20, 2012 Students in any academic, research or occupational program at the University of Montana at risk for blood borne pathogen exposure are required to initiate the Hepatitis B vaccination series prior to their first potential exposure. Exceptions include studen ts who have previously received the complete hepatitis B vaccination series and antibody testing has revealed that the student is immune or the vaccine is contraindicated for medical reasons. Students must also have training comparable to that required in the OSHA Blood borne Pathogen Standard in paragraph (g)(2)(vii)(I) prior to initial placement in a clinical or academic setting where there is reasonable anticipation of a potential blood borne pathogen exposure. Students who cannot meet this requirement , for personal or health reasons, must have their case reviewed by the Institutional Biohazards Committee (IBC) on an individual basis. Final approval or waiver must be granted in writing, prior to their first potential exposure to human blood or other pot entially infectious materials. Records of the waiver or approval shall be kept in the students file within the department. Procedure 1. Students who are unable to meet the requirements of documentation of immunity or initiation of the vaccination series, for personal or health reasons must provide written documentation of the reasons, for review by the Institutional Biohazards Committee. Requests for review by the IBC must be made by the student early enough to allow resolution prior to the studen t's first potential exposure to human blood or other potentially infectious materials. 2. Per CDC guidelines, students who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should complete a second 3 -dose vaccine series or be evaluated to determine if they are He patitis B surface antigen (Hbs -AG)-positive. Revaccinated persons should be tested at the completion of the second series. Persons who do not respond to an initial 3 -dose vaccine series have a 30 -50% chance of responding to a second 3 -dose series. Perso ns who prove to be Hbs -AG-positive should be counseled regarding how to prevent HBV infection to others and the need of medical evaluation. Nonresponders to vaccination who are Hbs - AG-negative should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should o btain Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) prophylaxis for any known or probable parenteral exposure to Hbs -AG- positive blood. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 62 3. Effective June, 1996, students are required to present, prior to their first potential exposure to human blood or other potenti ally infectious materials: a. Documentation of serologic immunity ( > 10mIU/ml) or b. Documentation of immunization series with plan for final titer and revaccination or booster as indicated (see #2 above) or c. Documentation of completed review by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and signed by the IBC Chairperson with statement of exemption from immunization requirement and waiver form signed by the student or d. Documentation of initiation of the immunization series. Students will NOT be al lowed in areas or settings which may present their first potential exposure to human blood or other potentially infectious materials without this documentation. Exposures If a student has an exposure (i.e., eye, mouth, mucous membrane, non -intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or potentially infectious materials) in a clinical setting, the student is financially responsible for obtaining post -exposure testing. Testing and counseling shall be done at the Curry Health Center whenever possible. If exp osure occurs outside of Curry Health Center's hours of operation, the student must report to an Emergency Department to obtain the post -exposure testing. Records of the exposure and follow -up shall be kept in the student's file in the Environmental Health and Occupational Safety Office. Procedure for students with an exposure: 1. Immediately inform your clinical instructor and primary nurse. 2. Follow any clinical site policy and procedure. 3. Report to Curry Health Center for evaluation and testing. 4. Expenditures o ccurred due to an exposure are the responsibility of the student. Training Student training shall be done prior to the student's first potential exposure to blood borne pathogens. The training shall include the requirements of the Blood borne Pathogen S tandard, universal precautions and the University of Montana policy. This training is done at new nursing student orientation through the training provided for The University at large at the beginning of each semester. Students will repeat this training i n their third semester. Standard Precautions The following safe work practices for health care workers are advocated by the Center for Disease Control. When the term Standard Precautions is used, it will refer to the following set of work practices: 1. All health care workers will use appropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure when contact with blood or bodily fluids is anticipated. 2. Gloves must be worn when touching blood, bodily fluids, mucous membranes, or n on-intact skin. 3. Gloves must be worn when handling items or surfaces contaminated with blood or bodily Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 63 fluids. 4. Gloves must be worn while performing venipuncture and other vascular access procedures. 5. Gloves must be changed after contact with each client. 6. Masks and protective eyewear or face shields should be worn during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other bodily fluids in order to prevent exposures of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. 7. Gowns or aprons should be wo rn during procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or other bodily fluids. 8. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly with water and antiseptic cleanser if contaminated with blood or other bodily fluids. 9. Hands should be immediately washed after gloves are removed. 10. Healthcare workers must take precautions to prevent injuries caused by needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices during or after medical procedures, when cleaning instruments, and duri ng disposal of used needles. 11. To prevent needle -stick injuries, needles should never be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. 12. After they are used, disposable syringes, needles, scalpe l blades, and other sharp items must be placed in puncture -resistant containers for disposal. These containers should be as close as practical to the area where disposable sharps are used. 13. Mouth pieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices sho uld be available for use in areas in which the need for resuscitation procedures is reasonably anticipated. 14. Health care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis must refrain from handling client and client -care equipment until the condition is resolved. 15. Healthcare workers will use effective hand washing methods BEFORE and AFTER all client contact.

Signature Date: ______________ Please submit this form to the Nursing Program Director Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 76 At-Risk Student Policy Purpose: To identify students who are at risk of failing the nursing program due to academic, behavioral and/or personal issues. If a student is determined to be at risk, a plan for remediation is initiated. Remediation may be considered when a nursing student: does not meet the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) as identified on clinical and/or course outcomes needs additional time and/or support before completing a course or the nursing program does not demonstrate the skills and/or personal attributes necessary t o succeed as a nurse Philosophy: The Missoula College Nursing Program faculty are here to guide and teach. We believe that even students who are facing difficult circumstances can successfully complete the nursing program. Nursing students must develop pr ofessional, ethical, and behavioral skills to successfully practice nursing. Part of the nursing faculty's job is to help guide and mentor for the development of these skills. Ultimately, it is up to the student to follow through with faculty recommendatio ns, remediation plans, behavioral contracts, and referrals to support services. Our At-Risk Student Policy allows the student to participate in the Remediation and Intervention processes. This policy follows the Nursing Student Handbook. Definitions of an At -Risk Student: 1) A student who has missed deadlines for required documentation (TB, CPR, vaccines, etc.), or other required orientation materials. 2) A student with excessive absences (see Professionalism Rubric) in at least one nursing course per se mester. 5) A student who is repeating a nursing course or who has been reinstated into the nursing program for any reason. 6) A student who is minimally passing or has <80% in one or more nursing courses. 7) A student who has been identified by a clinical instructor as unsafe or unprofessional. 8) A student who has demonstrated at least one unprofessional and/or unethical behavior while in the nursing program. This applies to the classroom, lab, and clinical settings. 9) A student with communicatio n difficulties, whether due to a language barrier, lack of communication with instructors, a lack of socialization/interaction with peers, poor communication with clinical site staff, and/or a lack of engagement in the educational process. 10) A student wh o has extenuating circumstances outside of the nursing program that cause additional stress, such as severe financial stressors, prolonged illness or other health issues, legal issues, death of a loved one, work schedule conflicts, etc. 11) A student whose performance and/or behaviors have caused other faculty and/or students to come forward and report their concerns. Step 1: Develop a Remediation Plan: 1) Once an at -risk student has been identified, the course instructor will complete the \"Nursing Student Remediation Plan\" document and will review it with the student. 2) Since knowledge, skills, and attitudes are learned over time and must be reinforced, at the end of each semester, faculty who have identified an at -risk student Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 77 must present their document ation (a copy of their completed \"Nursing Student Remediation Plan\", and/or \"Warning to the Student of Potential Failure\", and/or any other relevant documentation) to the faculty who will be teaching that student the following semester. This will ensure co ntinuity for the student and the faculty. 3) Students who have displayed unprofessional, unethical, and/or behaviors that are inappropriate will receive a remediation plan that includes an explanation of the behaviors, and may be required to complete addit ional assignments and/or be required to sign a contract that will extend the duration of the nursing program. Students will be warned in writing if further behaviors could result in dismissal from the program. 4) Students who have verbalized and/or appear to be struggling with personal issues will be provided with resources to improve their chances of success. These resources may include a referral to the Curry Health Center counseling services, information regarding local support groups, a list of outpatie nt mental health providers, education about scholarship opportunities, crisis hotline phone numbers, Office for Disability Equity, etc. Step 2: When the \"Remediation Plan\" does not result in the necessary changes, faculty will also provide the student with a \"Warning to the Student of Potential Failure\" document. The \"Warning to the Student of Potential Failure\" document can also be given during step one. Nursing Program Student Handbook Fall Semester 202 3 Page 78 Remediation Plan The remediation process is designed to promote the success of students at -risk of failing a course because they have difficulty accomplishing course objectives and/or meeting course requirements. The process is not intended to replace course curriculum or course requirements but to supplement the student's learning. The remediation process is initiated to address the following situations: academic jeopardy (i.e., low quiz/exam scores), lack of clinical competency (i.e., failing a clinical or lab competency, unsafe behavior in the clinical environment, medication errors), and/or lapses in professional judgment (i.e., tardiness, absenteeism, unprofessional behavior). The remediation process is initiated by faculty as soon as an at risk student is identified. The faculty member is re sponsible for meeting with the student to discuss the identified concerns and develop an individualized remediation plan. The remediation plan must be documented on the form \"Nursing Student Remediation Agreement\" (see attached) and meet the following guidelines: The Remediation Plan must clearly describe the area(s) of deficiency. Remediation outcomes must identify specific, measurable goals the student must attain or perform to demonstrate success. Remediation activities must be individual ized to the student's area of weakness. They may include, but are not limited to, completion of suggested computer based practice tests, written review materials, practice questions, instructor developed materials, hands on laboratory skill practice, or a ny other materials/methods suggested by the faculty. A time frame for completion must be agreed upon and documented in the remediation plan. The remediation form must be signed by faculty and student.
