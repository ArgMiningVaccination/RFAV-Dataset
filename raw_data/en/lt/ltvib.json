The British Medical Journal reports on what happened to a 4-year-old with autism. When their children have chronic illnesses, particularly autism, parents may grow frustrated with conventional medicine and try alternative therapies. That can be dangerous, [BMJ Case Reports ](http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2016/bcr-2016-215849)noted. In a case report by Catriona Boyd, MD and Abdul Moodambail, MD of the Department of Pediatrics, Barts Health National Health Service Trust, London, United Kingdom, the authors describe what happened to one autistic child whose parents took him to a naturopath. The boy, age 4, was admitted to an emergency room with symptoms including vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Tests showed he had hypercalcemia plus a high level of vitamin D. After he had been treated at the hospital for several days, the boy's mother revealed she had been giving him 12 supplements recommended by the naturopath. Those included calcium, vitamin D, cod liver oil, camel milk, silver, zinc, and Epsom bath salts. His calcium level peaked at 4.46 mmol/L. He was treated with hyperhydration, calcitonin, furosemide, and pamindronate before his calcium level returned to normal. The boy made a full recovery two weeks later. Police were called in to investigate the naturopath.
