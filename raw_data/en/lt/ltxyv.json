Knowing that I have to seek for a permanent and holistic solution, I dove into nutrition and embraced a wellness philosophy. It was a life-changing journey. I went from being sick and frail, to feeling strong and healthy today without any medical interference. \"This experience led to an understanding of the importance of practising dietary and lifestyle in accordance with Law of Nature, a core belief on which the company is built.\" \u2014 Mr. Chong Fat Eng (MSc Holistic Nutrition, United States) WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT FORMULATED BY CERTIFIED NUTRITIONISTS Led by Mr. Chong Fat Eng (MSc Holistic Nutrition, United States). After years of careful research on the modern eating habits, we are certain that our wholefood supplements are next to what Mother Nature can offer. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT YOUR HEALTH FIRST, PROFIT SECOND Never mind about high production costs and paper-thin profit margins. Ultimately, we are just a bunch of stubborn idealists who wishes for your health, not merchants aiming for your wealth. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT BY 100% NATURAL, WE MEAN No heat. No extractions. No fortifications. No binders. No artificial sweeteners. No colourings. No flavourings. No preservatives. No shortcuts. No hidden ingredients. No gimmicks. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT THE NAKED TRUTH 50% of what you are paying goes into the product itself - raw sources, farmers, maintenance of facilities, import taxes and shipping fees. Do you know what you are paying for a bottle of synthetic supplements? PREVENT, NOT CURE NOT AT RISK? THINK AGAIN. Our local newspaper stated that around 50 Malaysians die every day, due to heart attack. You are more at risk than you think. Eat to prevent, not to cure. Start "}
