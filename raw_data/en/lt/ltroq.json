I know that this is a crazy and scary time in the world right now with COVID19 happening. But, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is packed full of tips and knowledge to keep you and your household healthy. It helps to know that there are things you can do to support your health, strengthen your immune system and keep your sanity during these trying times. After following preventive measures (washing your hands, social distancing, etc.), the best way to combat any virus is to support and strengthen your immune system. Did you know that acupuncture, along with other aspects of TCM, is a great way to strengthen the immune system? Its true! And a strong immune system is the best defense right now. Acupuncture has been around for thousands of years and has been proven to treat a variety of symptoms and conditions, but it really excels at illness prevention and keeping people healthy! Acupuncture can help to increase immune function. Studies have shown that acupuncture has a regulating effect on cellular and humoral immunity [[1]](file:///C:/Users/debri/Documents/Striving%20for%20Health/Marketing/Blogs/Acupuncture%20and%20immunity.docx#_ftn1). This means it can promote immune response to secrete antibodies to fight against pathogens. So, Acupuncture can be a great way to help the body fight germs and viruses [[2]](file:///C:/Users/debri/Documents/Striving%20for%20Health/Marketing/Blogs/Acupuncture%20and%20immunity.docx#_ftn2) and boost the immune system [[3]](file:///C:/Users/debri/Documents/Striving%20for%20Health/Marketing/Blogs/Acupuncture%20and%20immunity.docx#_ftn3). In TCM the immune system is governed by a specific type of Qi (vital energy) called 'Wei Qi'. This is our energetic defense system. It helps to protect us from pathogens (like viral infections) and exterior attacks on our bodies (wind, heat, & cold). We can boost and strengthen our 'Wei Qi' to stay healthier by using herbs and by activating specific acupuncture points on the body. Specific acupuncture points can increase immune functioning as well as decrease stress on our nervous system. If you are not able to make it in for Acupuncture during the lockdown, the same points can be stimulated at home, with Acupressure, to strengthen the immune system and support your 'Wei Qi'. Acupressure is super simple and can be done at home with just your fingers, no fancy equipment or pills needed. It will have a milder effect than acupuncture, but it is the next best way to stimulate the acu-points and reap their powerful healing effects. The following 10 step protocol is a great way to boost the immune system and the entire body, all in the comfort of your own home. And...can be done in your PJ's. Think of it as your daily all-natural immune booster. This protocol should help you keep your body healthy and happy so you can keep pathogens at bay right now, which is what we all want to do! The protocol is totally safe, super effective and so easy that any age can do it, from kids to the elderly. How do you do it you ask?? 1. Get in a comfy position. 2. Locate the point. 3. Apply pressure to the point with your fingertip. You can use small circular motion or just gentle pressure on the point. 4. Stimulate each point for about 30 seconds. 5. Repeat the point on the other side. Most points are found on both sides of the body, so make sure to do both sides where possible. 6. Work your way through the points in the order they are given.
