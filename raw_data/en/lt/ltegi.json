It's fair to say that I've met a number of healers over the years, so when I received an email from Atmantan Wellness Centre saying they're going to host one of the \"world's best healers\" as a special incentive for guests visiting the resort around the new year, curiosity struck again. I met the London-based Jacqueline Bourbon at a hotel room in Nariman Point. Bourbon had offered to conduct personal healing sessions in lieu of interviews and as I was the last interaction for the day, I entered an already charged room. A healer, transformational teacher, medium and a sage, Bourbon calls her practice 'spiritual healing', which like other energy-based healing practices such as reiki, is a transfer of energy that works on a patient on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level, on an unconscious and conscious level. I didn't need much convincing myself, but for those who do\u2014Bourbon's BSc in occupational psychology and her articulate and informed approach is likely to put even skeptics trying energy healing for the first time at ease. That she's a passionate advocate of integrating holistic and alternative practices with conventional medicine is also a bonus. This is Bourbon's third trip to India and I ask if she's looking forward to her month-long stint at Atmantan\u2014a new holistic resort that we've written about earlier [here](http://www.vogue.in/content/these-15-minute-sugar-and-dairy-free-dessert-recipes-take-the-cake/#cocoa-wellness)\u2014and if healing works better while on holidays. \"You are away from the pulls and stressors of \"everyday\" life, and when you are relaxed, you are infinitely more receptive,\" she says. Edited excerpts from an interview. Does spiritual healing work on cynics as well or does the recipient have to come to you with an open mind and a willingness to heal? It's easier if the person comes with an open mind and heart. As a matter of fact, I also work a great deal with animals and babies. They are always incredibly receptive to healing as they are able to sense more readily something that is good for them. Naturally, I don't have to ask them to come with an open heart or mind. I regularly work with cynics. It's quite normal to be doubtful if you have not had any experience of healing before. I don't seek to persuade them with words. It works under most circumstances. I believe that if a recipient has come to me, there is already a part of them that is open, and willing to heal, or they would not bother to come. All of my work is permission-based. Since I rarely use touch, I am able to help people working remotely without being physically present, in all corners of the world. How would you respond to people who call energy healing a pseudo-science? Is there any anecdote you could share? I would rather not refer to healing as a science at all, although there are correct disciplines and some scientific principles involved in the transmission of energy, but I would rather refer to it as a 'healing art'. I regularly work in collaboration with doctors across the world, and in fact established a practice with some doctors in London's Harley Street in 2009. My belief and experience is that illnesses are diseases of the mental, emotional, or spiritual bodies, which if left unheeded, manifest in the physical as an illness. Spiritual healing can reach the parts that medicine and surgeries cannot as it works simultaneously on all those levels. I always encourage doctors that I work with to give me their \"hopeless cases\" where the condition consistently recurs, or is believed to be terminal. I firmly believe in the power of traditional western medicine working alongside and collaboratively with alternative and holistic practices such as Spiritual Healing, and it is my dream to see this properly established in years to come. Some of my doctor colleagues are also yoga instructors, practitioners in acupuncture and Chinese medicine, or naturopathy themselves, and it is a pleasure to work as a team with them. If you'd like some examples, one springs to mind: the first is that my own spiritual mentor was diagnosed with cancer many years ago when I first started to practise. I gave her regular healing between her diagnosis and her operation for bowel cancer. When she awoke from the anaesthetic, the doctor said that once he had opened her up, he thought he had the wrong patient, as the tumour that he had seen on a scan and the one he operated on were completely different, as it had shrunk significantly from her first consultation. Later, on a follow up consultations, tests indicated that the cancer had spread and had gone to her liver. She called me in some distress. I could not feel that she had any cancer left in her body, arranged quickly to give her more healing and asked her to be re-tested as soon as possible as she was naturally distraught at the idea that it had returned as a secondary cancer and in a less easily treatable place (in those days). When they re-tested they found that the cancer was not there. What is the best time to try Spiritual Healing? Would you say it is a time of the year or before milestones in one's life such as marriage or a new job? Generally, people come when they have a problem in their life that has unsettled them. I also treat many friends and co-workers who are without particular problems, and who just need a personal boost. It can give you terrific energy if you just need a little extra spring in your step! We call it a \"turbo-charge\". Sometimes people do come when they anticipate issues that might arise\u2014these are generally people who already have had some positive experience of healing. I am frequently consulted by politicians before future elections, for example. I myself believe that pre-emptive is better than curative, but, I don't think the time of year or a particular milestone is an essential factor. I do see people come at a particular time of year when they have anniversaries of trauma or bereavement as it is also helpful for them to honour or pass these occasions peacefully. Does it help for partners or families to try Spiritual Healing together so they can share their experiences? Interesting question! I do in fact treat couples, and sometimes whole families. But in the first instance, I always see each individually, as in the example of a couple, it is often one partner that is causing a problem for the other, and it isn't always helpful to see them together. Some of the treatment and healing is done while talking, and sometimes without words. In any case, I never discuss what I do with people, even between husband and wife. It is their prerogative to discuss freely with each other if they choose. Once they are at that point, I am happy to see them together as well as individually. When I work on children under the age of 12, one parent must always be present, so they too benefit from healing while I work on their child. This sometimes helps communication and the bond to also be improved between the child and parent. On occasions, I have worked on a whole family as the issue that affected them required this. The power intelligently goes to wherever it is needed, so if I feel it is appropriate to work on a group together, then this is quite possible. I have also worked on sports teams as a group. While individual sessions are more powerful and concentrated, it is obviously more powerful when couples or families come together, albeit being treated separately as the sharing of experiences itself is a very powerful tool and facilitator for them. I work with a Swiss gentleman who says he has benefitted greatly from sessions with me and ruefully wished a while ago that his wife would be more open to such sessions. I told him to rely on the power of the spirit, and sure enough, after several months, for the first time she also asked to work with me quite independently. I know that the sharing of their experiences since has strengthened something between them, which was a joy to see. What I frequently see happen is that one person comes in for treatment\u2014the others then observe an acute positive change, are intrigued, and then come themselves.
