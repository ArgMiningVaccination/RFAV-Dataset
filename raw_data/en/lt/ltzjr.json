NEWSLETTER FALL 1998 2 ANIMALS AND HUMANS IN TH E SAME TREATMENT ROOM Officials at the Maryland De partment of Health and Mental Hygiene Epidemiology and Disease Control Program, strongly recommend that acupuncturists use separate treatment rooms. However, there is no law mandating this recommendation. If an acupuncturist has no ot her option and must treat animals and humans in the same room, officials caution that pr oper hand-washing and disinfec ting techniques be applied to avoid environmental exposure and risks. NEWSLETTER SPRING 2002 CEU COMPLIANCE Extensions may be granted to those proving extreme hardship or illness. Licensees that have not complied will not be granted renewa l and the applicant will have to later reinstate. MINUTES-NOVEMBER 8, 2005 CEU PROVIDERS The board voted unanimously to discontinue the approval of CEU providers; therefore, effective January 18, 2005, the Board would no longer approve continuing education courses. MINUTES- JANUARY 18, 2005 Effective January 18, 2005, the Board of Acupuncture will discontinue review and approval of individual providers of CEU program s.

NEWSLETTER-WINTER 2005 CONSULTATIONS FOR HERBS Someone from Blue Cross and Blue Shield questioned whether consultations for herbs are within the Board of Acupuncture's scope of practice. The Boar d discussed the matter and directed Ms. Heisler to write back and st ate that consultations are within the Board's scope of practice as long as the consultation is for herbs. MINUTES -NOVEMBER 9, 2004 DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS COMPLIANCE According to \u00a71A-309 (15), a licensee MUST cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board. When the Board is alerted that a licensee may be in violation of th e disciplinary statue, the Board must determine whether the violati on has occurred, and if so, what action must 3 be taken to protect the public. During an investigation, the Boar d may contact licensed acupuncturists as witnesses to as sist in its investigation. Historically, the Board has found that some licensees are unwilling to come forth with this information. Consequently, the Board ha s been forced to issue subpoenas in these cases. In addition, some licensees may try to obstr uct the truth or provide false information. This type of behavior has dire consequences and would warrant disciplinary action. As a licensed acupuncturist, it is very important that you assist the Board when initially called upon in an investigation. If it is de termined that you have obstructed the truth, withheld information, or have been unwilli ng to cooperate during an investigation, the Board may take disciplinary action against your license. NEWS -FALL 2000 ENGLISH-PATIENT RECORDS Effective January 1, 2006, mainta in all patients' records in English; and if requested by the Board, effective January 1, 2006, provide an English language translation of the records by a Board approved translator, at th e licensee's expense, of records compiled prior to January 1, 2006. NEWSLETTER SPRING 2005 FOREIGN APPLICATIONS Effective February 16, 2004, a regulati on was adopted to have all foreign applications/transcripts reviewed by an out side agency - American Association of Collegiate Registrars & Ad missions Officers (AACRAO). MINUTES -MARCH 30, 2004 HOMEOPUNCTURE The Board received a letter regarding home opuncture to question whether this practice fell within Maryland's scope of practice. The letter stated that an acupuncturist was arrested for performing this procedure in Canada. The procedure involves dipping a needle into homeopathic remedies before inserting it into a patient. The Board felt that dipping a needle into a homeopa thic remedy was not a form of oriental medicine and did not fall under the Board's scope of practice but because homeopathy is not within the bounds of acupunctu re or oriental medicine, it is not an issue on which the Board can give an opinion. MINUTES -SEPTEMBER 8, 1998 LAB WORK A licensee inquired whether she could ask pati ents to go to a laboratory for blood work and use the lab to prepare ac upuncture treatment plans for her patients. The Board's Counsel stated that the Board's statute doe s not allow acupuncturists to make medical diagnoses. However, the acupunc turist can refer a patient to another health care provider to make the diagnosis and use that di agnosis to prepare treatment plans. MINUTES - APRIL 26, 2000 4 MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS One role of the Maryland Acupuncture Board is to assure quality health care provided by acupuncturists and to ensure that acupuncture licensees are competent to practice. To assist the Board in this role, the following regulation was promulgated: 10.26.03 Standards of Practice. C. A licensee shall: (8) Report to the Board or other appropria te authority conduct in the practice of acupuncture that indica tes a violation of: (a) This chapter; (b) Health Occupations Article, Title 1A , Annotated Code of Maryland; or (c) Other federal or State laws. Although acupuncturists have a legal, ethical and professional duty to keep information about their patients confidential, there are certain circumstances under which they must report particular events or conditions to the Board. As a licensed acupuncturist, you must notify th e Board if you have reasonable grounds to believe that another acupuncturist has sexually abused or is mistreating a patient or has violated any sections of the Maryland Acupuncture Practice Act. If you obtain information from a patient about another health professional, you should advise the patient of your requirement to file the report. Mandatory reporting is your exemption to standard health professional-patient confidentiality requirements. Breach of pr actitioner-patient confidentiality in these circumstances does not constitute professiona l misconduct. On the contrary, failure to report something that must be reported by law can result in ch arges of professional misconduct. Most patients are afraid to report abus e due to retaliation. Mandatory reporting sometimes helps ease a patient's reluctance to report misconduct, since it becomes the practitioner's responsibility to report the misconduct to the Board. It may help to clearly discuss the requiremen ts and limitations of c onfidentiality and your legal responsibility for mandatory reporti ng at the beginning of your professional relationships. This may help a patient d ecide what he/she may wish to disclose. NEWSLETTER-WINTER 2004 MEDICAL RECORD RETENTION Question: May I charge patients when they request a copy of their medical records? Answer : Yes you may charge for the copying of a medical record. A health care provider may require a person in interest or any other authorized person who requests a copy of a medical record to pay the cost of copying and postage for mailing. 5 Question: How long do I have to retain a pat ient medical record after the patient has died or ceased coming to my practice? Answer: If the patient is an adult, you must retain the medical record for 5 years from the date the record was created. Fo r a record created about a minor patient, the record must be maintained until the pa tient reaches the age of majority plus three years (i.e., 18 + 3 = 21 years of age) or 5 years after the record was created, whichever is later. Question: May I refuse to disclose a medical record to a patient, if the patient fails to pay for health care rendered by me? Answer: No, you may not refuse to disclose a medical record because of the patient's failure to pay a medical bill fr om you. In addition, if you do not disclose the medical record for this reason, you could be found guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction could be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000 for the first offense and not exceeding $5,000 for each subsequent conviction for this violation [Health General Article Section 4-309(d)]. Question: What is considered a \"timely re sponse\" to a request for medical records? Answer: An acupuncturist should mail a copy of the medical record within 21 business days. Maryland Code Annotate d, Health General Article Section 4- 309(a) states \"a reasonable time but no more than 21 working days after the date a person in interest requests the disclosure.\" Question: When a treating acupuncturist le aves an office/facility where she/he has treated patients and where the records are maintained, who keeps patient records-the acupuncturist or the office/facility? Answer: Simply stated, it is the Board's position that original records remain with the office/facility. A patient certainl y may authorize release of copies of the records to the treating acupuncturist, in which case a copy would be sent and the originals remain with the office. NEWSLETTER SUMMER 2005 NEUROFEEDBACK The Board received a letter from an indi vidual requesting permission to perform EEG Neurofeedback and EAV under the supervision of a licensed acupuncturist. After review, the Board determined by that these techniques should not be delegated. MINUTES- JANUARY 14, 2003 OMD The Board discussed the issue at length. Mr. Serejski moved to allow an acupuncturist to use the title OMD behind his/her name if the acupuncturist earned a legitimate OMD 6 degree. However, it would be inappropriate of the acupuncturist to refer to or portray himself as a physician or medical doctor, es pecially in advertising. Ms. Lewis seconded the motion. The Board unanimously approved the motion. MINUTES -MARCH 6, 2001 PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS Can a physician assistant practice acupunc ture without being licensed by the Acupuncture Board.? After review of the st atute, Board Counsel concluded that a physician assistant could not practice ac upuncture without an acupuncture license. MINUTES -JULY 14, 1998 REFUNDS POLICY The Fee Schedule Regulation does not provide refunds for any fee. MINUTES -JULY 9, 2002 REINSTATEMENT The regulation allows a 30-day grace period for late renewals with a late fee of $100. It also imposes a more restrictive monetary penalty in that late applican ts would have to pay the late fee, renewal fee and reinstatement fee. MINUTES -MAY 14, 2002 The Board received a phone call from a former licensee wanting to rein state her license. When the licensee was informed of the rein statement procedures, she questioned whether she could apply as a new licensee. After consulting with legal counsel, the Board found that there is no legal restriction preventi ng a current licensee from applying as a new applicant in lieu of reinstatement. To close the loophole, the Bo ard changed its statute: \"A person who has been inactive over 6 years and can provide documentation of maintaining an active license and practice in another state shall pa y the renewal fee but may be exempt from the reinstatement fee\". MINUTES-NOVEMBER 4, 2003 RENEWAL FORM - Question 4 Questions on the renewal forms have gone under intense scrutiny by the Office of the Attorney General in light of the Americans with Disabilities Act and are on all renewal forms for every Board. Anyone who lies about any one of these could be subject to disciplinary measures. RESEARCH STANDARDS AND INFORMED CONSENT Informed consent is needed before you may be gin clinical research trials on patients. The purpose of informed consent is to allow patie nts to learn enough about the study to decide whether or not to participate. Informed c onsent for a research study should include the following information: Why the research is being done What the research hopes to accomplish 7 A description of what will be done duri ng the study and how long the patient is expected to participate The risks/adverse reactions the patient may encounter from participation in the study The benefits that the patient may e xpect from participation in the study Other treatments that are available if the patient decides not to participate in the study Verification that the patient has the right to leave the study at any time, and that standard treatment will be provided without penalty The possibility that the patient ma y be photographed, if appropriate; The possibility that data fr om the research study may be shared and provide a list possible recipients SHAMANIC RITUALS At its meeting on January 12, 1998, the Board issued a Declaratory Ruling stating that shamanism is not within the scope of acupuncture. Shamanism is a spiritual phenomenon practiced in some form by numerous aboriginal hunting and gathering cultures, including thos e in North America, Asia, Africa and Europe. Traditional shamanism involved the practitioner entering an ecstatic trance in order to move the consciousness outside the body to contact the spirit world. Post-shamanic practice incorporates traditional shamanic ritual and folklore into modern agricultural and manufacturing so cieties. In both traditi onal and contemporary shamanic practice, the shaman may serve as a healer, as well as priest or c onduit with the spiritual world. The shaman may use a variety of techniqu es, including chants, magical signs on the patient's body, herbal remedies, or contact with the spirit world, to heal an afflicted individual. In addition, a shaman may empl oy techniques to alter the consciousness of the client in order to effect healing of an affliction. Based solely on these definitions, shamanism cl early falls outside the scope of practice. Even if the practice of shamanism might so mehow involve normalizing or altering the energy flow in an individual's body in order to bring about healing or pa in relief, it is not effected through the use of principles of traditional oriental medicine. The Board has determined that integrating shamanism or shamanistic practices or rituals into his or her practice of acupuncture is in appropriate for an acupunc turist. Although the practice of shamanism is unregulated and acupuncturists licensed in Maryland have a right to perform other alterna tive therapies, they should not perform these therapies under the aegis of a Maryland acupuncture license. 8 A licensed acupuncturist engaged in shamanic ritual or practice has a professional obligation to adequately inform the public that such practices are out side the scope of the practice of acupuncture. Failure to do so may result in a finding that the acupuncturist has provided false and misleadi ng information to the public. To conclude, the practice of shamanism or us e of shamanic ritual falls outside the scope of practice of acupuncture. While a li censed acupuncturist may practice other unregulated alternative therapies, the licens ee may not mislead the public into believing that the state regulates such practices or are in any way c onnected to the practice of acupuncture from shamanic ritual or practice. NEWSLETTER SPRING 1998 SEXUAL MISCONDUCT At no time would the Board consider it appropr iate for a practitioner to establish an intimate relationship with a patient. An acupuncturist must maintain professional boundaries, even when the patient initiat es crossing the boundaries during your professional relationship. If a licensed acupuncturist and his/her patient mutually desi re a personal relationship, the professional relationship must be terminated and the acupuncturist must refer the patient to another health care practitione r. Both parties must wait be fore engaging in an intimate relationship for a time when it is reasonably certain that the professional relationship will have no further influence on the personal relationship. It is important to remember that a lice nsed acupuncturist should never exploit a relationship with a patient for his/her advant age, including a persona l, sexual, romantic, or financial relationship. It is also unaccepta ble to engage in a sexually intimate act with a patient - at any time! Warning signs of sexual misconduct may include: Excessive sharing of personal information Change of appointments to a social location Use of alcohol or drugs during treatment Constant questioning about sexual issues that are not related to treatment Requests for secrecy Physical contact or bodily exposure that is not part of acupuncture treatment Touching in a sexual manner Always respect and maintain professional bounda ries with your patients. Ensure that your patient is reasonably informed about tr eatments before they are rendered. Make sure that your patients are comfortable w ith the treatments and that you cause them no embarrassment. NEWSLETTER-SPRING 2002 9 STUDENTS PERFORMING ANIMAL ACUPUNCTURE At its March meeting, the Board had revi ewed the legality of Maryland Acupuncture schools offering courses in animal acupunctu re to students and concluded that the legislation that allows for the practice of acupuncture on animals does not authorize this practice. MINUTES -JULY 14, 1998 STUDENTS NEEDLING IN CONT INUING EDUCATION WORKSHOPS A licensee wrote to the Board requesting approv al for students to attend a needling course she wanted to sponsor. The course was desi gned to teach softer in sertion and would be conducted in a non-educational facility for continuing education purposes. The Board voted to deny student participation in the workshop. MINUTES -JULY 13, 1999 TAI CHI AND CHI GONG The Board has decided that Tai Chi and Chi G ong are indeed within the scope of practice of the Maryland Acupuncture Practice Act. CORRESPONDENCE-NOVEMBER 20, 2003 ZERO BALANCING Zero balancing would appropriately fall under \u00a71a-101(2)(iii) Manual........therapies only when performed in accordance with the pr inciples of oriental acupuncture medical theories.
