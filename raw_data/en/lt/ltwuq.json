The present randomisedtrial tested the hypothesis that BCG vaccination at birthwould reduce early childhood hospitalisation inDenmark, a high-income setting.Methods Pregnant women planning to give birth at three Danish hospitals were invited to participate. Afterparental consent, newborn children were allocated toBCG or no intervention within 7 days of age.Randomisation was strati ed by prematurity. The primary study outcome was number of all-cause hospitalisationsanalysed as repeated events. Hospitalisations wereidenti ed using The Danish National Patient Register. Data were analysed by Cox proportional hazards modelsin intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.Results 4184 pregnant women were randomised their 4262 children allocated to BCG or no intervention.There was no difference in risk of hospitalisation up to 15 months of age; 2129 children randomised to BCG experienced 1047 hospitalisations with a mean of 0.49hospitalisation per child compared with 1003hospitalisations among 2133 control children (mean0.47), resulting in a HR comparing BCG versus no BCGof 1.05 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.18) (intention-to-treatanalysis). The effect of BCG was the same in childrenborn at term (1.05 (0.92 to 1.18)) and prematurely(1.07 (0.63 to 1.81), p=0.94). The effect was alsosimilar in the two sexes and across study sites. Theresults were essentially identical in the per-protocolanalysis and after adjustment for baseline characteristics.Conclusions BCG vaccination at birth did not reduce the risk of hospitalisation for somatic acquired diseaseuntil 15 months of age in this Danish study population.Trial registration number NCT01694108, results. BACKGROUND BCG, primary prophylaxis against tuberculosis, is among the most widely used vaccines globally.1 Randomised controlled trials indicate that the mayhave bene cial 'non-speci on reducing non-tuberculosis neonatal mortality in low-income set-tings by reducing severe early infection. 23The association between BCG and childhood morbidity,primarily atopic disease has been studied with con-flicting results. 4The only randomised trial so far among 121 newborns with high risk of atopyfound BCG to be associated with a signi cant reduction in the use of medication for eczema. 5 From 1979, routine BCG vaccination at schoolstart was gradually discontinued in Denmark dueto low prevalence of tuberculosis. If BCG has bene-cial non-speci c effects on health also in high- income settings, stopping routine BCG may havedeprived children of these bene cial effects. W e therefore conducted a large-scale randomised trial in Denmark to test the effect of BCG given at birthon childhood morbidity, including hospitalisation,infections, atopic disease, growth, development andimmunological indicators. The present paper pre-sents the effect of BCG on the primary outcome,all-cause hospitalisation from birth to 15 months ofage. W e hypothesised that BCG vaccination at birthwould reduce all-cause hospitalisation by 20%. METHODS Setting, study population The procedures of The Danish Calmette Study were published in details elsewhere.6Briefly, pregnant women planning to give birth at three DanishWhat is already known on this topic? BCG is the primary prophylaxis against tuberculosis. BCG is among the most widely used vaccinesglobally. There may be non-speci c bene cial effects of neonatal BCG vaccination upon the infantimmune system, reducing early infections andatopic disease. What this study adds? BCG vaccination did not reduce the risk ofhospitalisation for acquired somatic disease duringtherst 15 months of life in a Danish study population.

Inclusion criteria were gestational age of 32+ weeks, birth weight of 1000+ grams and a signed informedconsent from the parents. Exclusion criteria were maternal intakeof immunomodulating medicine during pregnancy , signs ofsevere illness or major malformation in the infant and no Danish-speaking parent due to concerns about language barrier. Newborns were allocated 1:1 to standard BCG vaccination withthe Danish strain 1331, or no intervention within 7 days of birth.The children were allocated 1:1 in permuting blocks of 2-4-6using an online system. Since in prior studies the strongest non-specic effects on mortality have been seen among the smallest newborns, 23the allocation was strati ed by prematurity de ned as gestational age <37 weeks. The allocation was planned strati ed also by sex and study site; however, by programme error the allo-cation was strati ed only by prematurity . Parents were not blinded to allocation since the local in flammatory reaction caused by BCG vaccination could not be mimicked, but the parents were asked notto disclose if the child had received BCG to keep study staffblinded during the data collection.Follow-up The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalisations. Since themeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) may also have non-speci c effects, follow-up was censored at 15 months of age where MMR is scheduled in the Danish national vaccinationprogramme. 78 All Danish residents have a unique identi cation number, which was used to obtain information from The Danish National Patient Register on acquired, somatic all-cause hospitalisation,including dates of admission and discharge and categorised by theInternational Classi cation of Diseases V .10 (ICD10) diagnosis codes. 91 0Outpatient and emergency department hospital con- tacts not leading to admission, and hospitalisations starting before or at the date of randomisation were excluded. Since the studyaimed to examine if BCG reduced acquired somatic morbidity ,diagnostic codes due to administrative procedures, admission tothe maternity ward in connection with the delivery , congenitaland birth-related conditions, psychiatric disease, and injuries wereexcluded (ICD10-speci cation in the online supplement).

Downloaded from Furthermore, follow-up consisted of telephone interviews and clinical examinations at 3 months and 13 months of age; sec- ondary outcomes and adverse events will be publishedseparately. Power calculation Sample size estimates were based on 95% CIs and a 90%power. T wenty per cent of the child population in Denmark wasexpected to be hospitalised during the rst 15 months of life. 11 T o detect a 20% reduction in hospitalisations during the rst 15 months of life, 3972 newborns needed to be included. W eexpected a very small loss to follow-up in the registry-basedstudies and aimed to include approximately 4300 newborns. Statistics Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the HRof all-cause hospitalisation between the BCG and controlgroups. Adjustment for recurrent hospitalisations for each childwas done using robust SEs for the estimated HRs. The resultsare presented as HRs with 95% CIs and corresponding p values.The children were censored at migration, 15 months of age ordeath, whichever came rst. The analyses were strati ed by pre- maturity in accordance with the randomisation procedure. In themain 'intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis 'hospitalisations within the period from randomisation to 15 months of age were ana-lysed according to randomisation group. W e also conducted a'per-protocol (PP) analysis 'in which children who did not follow the allocation were excluded and hospitalisations from time sincevaccination for the BCG group and time since randomisation forcontrols was included. Curves for mean number of hospitalisa-tions by randomisation arm as a function of time since random-isation were estimated using the Nelson-Aalen method. Further,we tested the effect of BCG on time to rst hospitalisation. Secondary analyses Using Cox models, we tested if adjustment for baselinecharacteristics changed the estimates. Since previous studiesindicate that the non-speci c effects of one vaccine may be modi ed by a subsequent different vaccination, 12follow-up was divided into 0 -2 months (0 -89 days) while the children had received BCG or nothing, and 3 -15 months (90 -456 days) when the children should have received one to three doses of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumonia vaccine accord- ing to the routine vaccination programme.8 W e also estimated potential effect modi cation by caesarean section, administration of antibiotics to the mother during deliv-ery, birth weight <2500 g, one sibling, atopic disposition, vac- cination 2 days of age, maternal BCG vaccination and by the two vaccine batches used in the study. The analysis by batch was adjusted for calendar months. All analyses were performed using Stata V .13 (StataCorp LP , T exas, USA). RESULTS Randomisation and baseline At the three hospitals 16 521 pregnant women were invited. No response was given by 6148 families, and 6189 families wereexcluded primarily because they declined participation after beinginformed verbally about the study ( gure 1 ). Four thousand one hundred and eighty-four pregnant women were randomised and their 4262 children allocated to BCG or no intervention(gure 1 ). Baseline characteristics with potential in fluence onchildhood morbidity d id not differ between the two allocation groups except for ethnicity other than Danish and smoking, which were more common in fam ilies of control children ( table 1 ). The study population was characterised by a large proportion of highly educated parents, with a high prevalence of atopic diseases. Treatment assignments and crossovers T wo thousand one hundred and twenty-nine children were ran- domised to receive BCG and 2133 children to the control group. Eleven children randomised to the BCG group did not receive the BCG vaccine and 36 children randomised to thecontrol group received the BCG vaccine on their own initiativeleaving 2118 children allocated to BCG and BCG-vaccinatedgroups and 2097 children randomised to control and not vacci-nated groups in the PP analysis.

Until 15 months of age, the 2129 children randomised to BCG experienced a total of 1047 the mean hospitalisation percontrol child being 0.47. Hence, there was no difference innumber of hospitalisations from randomisation to 15 months ofage in the ITT analysis ( table 2 andgure 2 ). There was no effect modi cation by prematurity , sex or study site (table 2 ); however, the rate of hospitalisation was lower at the Kolding site where short acute admissions were classi ed as out- patient consultations.

Downloaded from Secondary analyses Adjustment for all baseline characteristics essentially did not change the estimates (see table 2 and3), the HR of hospital- isation was 1.05 (0.93 to 1.20) for children randomised toBCG. For children randomised to BCG, the risk of hospi-talisation was 0.98 (0.83 to 1.16) until 3 months and 1.09(0.94 to 1.27) after 3 months of age. No statistically signi - cant effect modi cation by caesarean section, administra- tion of antibiotics to the mother during vaginal delivery , birthweight <2500 g, 1 sibling, atopic disposition, age ation 2 days, maternal BCG vaccination and BCG vaccine batch was observed ( table 3 ). However, a tendency towards protection against hospitalisation was observed among BCG-vaccinated children whose mother was also BCG vaccinated(table 3 ). DISCUSSION W e hypothesised that BCG at birth would have non- speci c bene cial effects and reduce overall childhood hospital- isation for somatic acquired disease (injuries excluded) from birth to 15 months of age by 20% in the high-income setting of Denmark. W e were not able to con rm this. Strengths and weaknesses The strengths of the present study lie in the randomised clin-ical multicentre trial design with adequate power. Data on theprimary study outcome, all-ca use hospitalisation, were col- lected independently of the study, decreasing the risk of bias.All participants could be followed up through the publicregisters. The study may be limited by our choice of all-cause hospital- isation as primary outcome, which was chosen because of itspotentially high impact on public health and because thisoutcome included both hospitalisation-requiring infections andsevere manifestations of atopic disease. Given the high incidenceof hospitalisations, this outcome, however, may not have beenspeci c enough to detect a potential bene cial immune-training effect of BCG. Comparison with other studies In low-income settings, two randomised controlled trials amonglow birthweight children found BCG to reduce non-tuberculosismortality until 6 months of age, in particular neonatal sepsisand respiratory infections. 23Recent immunological studies have provided a potential mechanism by showing that BCG induces trained innate immunity through epigenetic reprogramming ofmonocytes, 13 14which was still present 12 months after BCG.13 15In Guinean babies, BCG was associated with increased responses to heterologous innate stimulation.16 There may be other explanations for the lack of effect of BCG on all-cause hospitalisation in Denmark. First, in a system with free healthcare, hospitalisation for acquired somatic disease may not represent a suf ciently speci c measure of disease. A high level of parental concern in combin- ation with a low professional threshold for hospitalisation ofyoung infants is likely to have in flated the hospitalisation rate. The rate of all-cause hospitalisation was 50% higher thanexpected. Second, there are obvious differences in exposure to infection between Denmark and the low-income settings where the bene- cial non-speci c effects of BCG on mortality have been observed.

Downloaded from siblings, thus, presumably the exposure to infections was limited until they started day care around 1 year of age. Third, we previously found that maternal immunity may also be of importance to the non-speci c response to measles vaccin- ation in the child;17we therefore also asked whether the mothers in The Danish Calmette Study had been BCG vacci-nated. In low-income settings the majority of mothers will havebeen BCG vaccinated, whereas in our study only 17% of themothers had been BCG vaccinated, because BCG was discontin-ued in the early 1980s. That early exposure may be of import-ance to the child 's response to BCG was also indicated by two studies comparing cytokine responses after BCG in UK andMalawi infants, and nding signi cant differences, which were ascribed to exposure very early , in utero, or within the rst few months of life. 18 19Further, it has been shown that foetal T helper cells can be sensitised to mycobacterial puri ed protein derivative in utero .20In agreement with this, in a preplanned secondary analysis of hospitalisations for infection within thepresent trial, a signi cant bene cial effect of BCG among chil- dren of BCG-vaccinated mothers was observed (personal com- munication, Stensballe LG, Greisen G, Jeppesen DL, et al. The effect of BCG vaccination at birth on risk of hospitalization for infection in Denmark. A randomized clinical multicenter trial.2015. Unpublished work). If maternal exposure to BCG ormycobacteria is essential for the development of bene cial non- speci c effects of BCG, this may the bene cial effect of BCG observed in low-income countries but not overall in thepresent study. Fourth, genetics differ between the populations of W est Africa and Denmark; 21-23however, the in fluence of this is not clear and it should be noted that others have found evidence of bene-cial effects of BCG in Denmark. 24 CONCLUSIONS BCG vaccine at birth did not decrease the risk of hospitalisationfor somatic acquired disease until 15 months of age in our high-income setting.
