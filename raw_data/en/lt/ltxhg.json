Our skilled practitioners supply patients with treatments ranging from chiropractic adjustments to spinal decompression and soft tissue therapy. General Information Chiropractic care is a form of holistic medicine that pertains to the spine and its relationship to overall health. All treatments are geared toward restoring nervous system function to achieve better health and less pain. Treatments focus on getting to the root of the problem, thus supplying long-lasting relief. In terms of healing, all treatments are meant to optimize recovery. Treatments Our Stratford chiropractors are qualified to administer chiropractic treatments such as the classic spinal adjustment. With this particular treatment, a chiropractor will ask you to lie on your front. The practitioner will then manually apply pressure on different areas of your back to enhance nervous system function. We should note that sometimes the treatment is enhanced through the use of specialized devices. The maneuvers will also assist with circulation. As a result, you have less back pain, and circulation promotes the healing of injuries. We use this technique to help with headache and migraine pain, as well. Your chiropractic treatment plan may consist of therapeutic exercises. For this particular treatment, a practitioner from our chiropractic office will guide you through various movements and stretches. They work on that particular body part to increase function and flexion. The motions promote circulation to the area as well, which can facilitate the healing process. We may also recommend massage therapy to ease your discomfort. Why Chiropractic Care Chiropractic care is known to cause few side effects. The ones it does cause tend to be mild and short-term. In fact, they all tend to resolve within days of the treatment. This particular treatment is all-natural and contains no substances and is non-addictive. All treatment plans are customized to your needs and condition.
