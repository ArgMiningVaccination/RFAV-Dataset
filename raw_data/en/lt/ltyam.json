In the event that an absence from a mandatory attendance session occurs, the student must immediately notify the Department Chair or the Program/Division/Course Director involved (or his/her designee) of the circumstances causing the absence . To complete the process for an excused absence, verbal notification must be followed by a written request with sufficient documentation attesting to the reasons for the absence. The student is solely responsible for informing the Department Chair or the Program/Division/Course Director of the circumstances resulting in the absence and for submitting a written request for an excused absence. Absences to Attend Off -Campus Conferences and Events A policy has been established for students to be excused from c lasses/laboratories/rotations to attend approved off -campus functions. This policy includes a procedure for student organizations and individual students to follow. 1. Students seeking permission to attend an off -campus conference or program must be in good a cademic, discipli nary and professional standing. 2. Midwestern University -approved student organizations must seek and be granted permission from the appropriate college dean or program/division director to send student representatives to an off -campus activity. This written request (usually made by the president of the organization) must be made at least one month prior to the activity. Student organizations may offer partial reimbursements for students who travel to approved professional conferences/e vents within the United States. Expenses for international travel are not eligible for reimbursement by student organizations except for approved clinical rotations for course credit, University -approved research conferences (at which the student presents research done at Midwestern University), or the DO Care medical missions. The process for petitioning for reimbursement and minimum/maximum awards are determined by each awarding student organization. All processes must follow the reimbursement guidelines set forth by the Business Services Office. 3. Students who desire to attend an approved off -campus activity must obtain a signature approval from the course directors/coordinators of the course(s) that they will miss through an Absence Request Form. These sig n-off forms are available in the Dean's office of the appropriate college. Completed forms indicate that students are approved to attend the activity because they are performing satisfactorily in the courses to be missed and are in good academic, disciplin ary and professional standing. Written requests to attend approved off -campus activities must be submitted to the appropriate college dean or program/division director a minimum of two weeks prior to the activity. Students on rotation need to follow the g uidelines for an excused absence that are outlined in their clinical education manual. 4. Students attending off -campus conferences or events must take full responsibility for making up any missed classes, laboratories, examinations, or other course assignmen ts. For Non -Emergency Personal Absences A policy has been established for students to be excused from classes/laboratories/rotations for non-emergency personal absences. 1. Students seeking permission to be absent from class for personal reasons should be in good academic, disciplinary and professional standing. 2. Students who are requesting permission to miss class for personal reasons must obtain a signature approval from the course directors/coordinators of the course(s) that they will miss through an Absence Request Form. These sign -off forms are available in the Dean's office of the appropriate college. Completed forms indicate that students have an approved absence. The forms must be submitted to the appropriate college dean or program/division director a m inimum of one month prior to the absence. Students on rotation need to follow the guidelines for an excused absence that are outlined in their clinical education manual. 3. Students with excused absences for personal reasons must take full responsibility for making up any missed classes, laboratories, examinations, or other course assignments. Academic/Professional Honesty and Integrity Academic/professional honesty and integrity are expected of all students throughout their course of study at Midwestern Unive rsity. Any violation of the Code of Rights and Responsibilities of Students of Midwestern University is considered to be a serious academic violation and may result in a reprimand, monetary fine, written warning, filing of a Student Incident Report, acade mic and/or disciplinary warning/probation, suspension, dismissal or other penalty deemed appropriate by the student's respective college dean. Academic/professional misconduct constitutes a breach of academic/professional integrity that violates the academ ic/professional foundation of an institution, contaminates the honesty of its scholarship, and compromises the integrity and wellbeing of its educational programs. The policies on students' academic and professional responsibilities are included in Appendi ces 1 through 4. Address Information Each student has the responsibility to provide the University with their permanent address and telephone number, and a current/preferred address and telephone number, if the student is not residing at the permanent ad dress while attending school. Any change of address and telephone number can be made through the student's personal page at http://online.midwestern.edu. Alcohol Policies and Procedures Midwestern U niversity does not condone any form of alcohol abuse by its students. No alcohol may be manufactured, consumed, distributed, exchanged, or sold by students on Midwestern University property or in any facility affiliated with , or associated with , Midwestern University. Alcoholic beverages may be served at an on - or off-campus event only with the prior approval of the Dean of Students (see Alcohol Policy and Procedures for On -Campus Events below). Any student who attends class or a rotation or is o n the premises of a facility affiliated with Midwestern University while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is subject to an immediate drug screen for cause, and possible disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal. Alcohol Policy and Proce dures for Recognized MWU Organizations ; On-Campus Events Alcohol, in moderation, is allowed at on -campus student events only with the prior written approval of the Dean of Students. Only recognized student organizations are allowed to sponsor on-campus eve nts with al cohol. On-campus events which are open to the community are prohibited from serving alcohol. Alcohol is not permitted at any athletic event. The following procedures are in force to establish criteria for the responsible use of alcohol on campus and at on-campus student events, and to minimize a student organization's liability should a mishap occur during the event: 1. All student organizations (represented by their president or designee) must complete and submit the Alcohol Application Form in the Office of Student Services. 2.

Illinois and Arizona State Law prohibits individuals under the age of 21 from consuming or possessing alcohol. It is the responsibility of the sp onsoring organization to assure that underage drinking does not occur. The student organization responsible for the event will be asked to end the event immediately if someone under the age of 21 is knowingly served alcohol. If the group does not comply, s ecurity will be asked to assist. Students must be prepared to present identification to show proof of age should the bartender request it. 8. Food (not snacks) and non -alcoholic beverages such as soda, coffee, punch, etc., must be available the entire time th at beer and wine are being consumed. 9. Service and consumption of alcohol are restricted to the approved area. No containers (unused/partially used kegs, bottles, etc.) may be removed from the approved area. Unused alcohol will be dumped at the conclusion o f the event. Unopened bottles of wine will be kept intact and returned to the place of purchase, or, with the approval of the Office of Student Services, may be saved for a later function or purchased by another student organization for use at a different function. Unopened, repurposed wine must be stored in the Office of Student Services. 10. Admission to the event is restricted to Midwestern University students, faculty, and staff. Individual students (depending on the event) may bring a guest, however, tha t student is responsible for the actions of their guest. 11. No alcoholic beverages may be brought to an on -campus student function. Any alcoholic beverages brought in from the outside will be immediately poured out by security, staff, faculty, or student lead ers responsible for the event. Student organizations are responsible for their students ' behavior. Violation of the alcohol policy by students bringing in additional alcohol will result in suspension of alcohol privileges for the sponsoring organization f or a period of one year. 12. Anyone found inducing or forcing students to drink an alcoholic beverage against his/her expressed desire (including \"spiking\" nonalcoholic beverages) or adding a controlled substance to a drink will be escorted from the student ac tivity, and will be subject to disciplinary action and will face possible legal action.

The Dean of Students, faculty advisor, security personnel, or any other professional staff member of the Office of Student Services may terminate the service of alcohol or the event for any reason. 19. Fees will be assessed to the sponsoring organization for damages incurred. Alcohol Policy for Off -Campus Events Any student function that is funded, in part, by the University requires University approval through the Office of Student Services. The University will not authorize the us e of any University funds collected and administered by a University office or agency, including funds raised by student organizations, for the purchase, supply, or serving of any alcoholic beverage for off -campus events. The University reserves the right to decide which off -campus events will be approved based on the circumstances of the event. Student organizations, groups, classes and councils/student government associations, must have administrative approval through the Office of Student Services to spo nsor an off -campus social event with or without alcohol. Sponsoring organizations must complete all necessary paperwork prior to event approval. Depending on the nature of the event, participants may be asked to complete a University waiver form. Failur e to complete paperwork and receive authorization could result in termination of the event as a sponsored event of that organization. Off-campus events with alcohol must observe the polices for serving alcohol at on -campus locations. The off-campus event may not be located at an individual's residence, but must be at an establishment, which holds a valid liquor license. In addition, students must comply with all local, state and federal laws regulating consumption of liquor. No persons under 21 years of age may consume alcohol. Off-campus events with alcohol may be advertised via the University e - mail system, but only with prior approval of the Office of Student Services and all e -mails must be routed through this office. The Office of Student Services reserves that right to determine which off -campus social events will be approved. If a component of the off -campus event is on -campus and alcohol is requested, students must complete all required paperwork as stated previously for on -campus approval. Any event sponsored by a recognized student group or organization that violates any of the provisions of these policies will be subject to cancellation or termination. Exclusions This policy does not include attendance at professional conferences where alcoho l may be served at a conference reception as part of the conference registration fee. This policy does not apply to \"approved\" functions that are directly sponsored and organized by the University, its colleges, or the Alumni Association. Downers Grove Onl y: Individual student organizations and classes may not order busses through Midwestern University when sponsoring an off -campus social event in which the primary purpose is drinking. The University Student Senate and the Student Councils/Student Governm ent Associations may order busses for off -campus events at which alcohol is served if the event is co-sponsored by the particular College/Program and/or the Office of Student Activities. Alcohol Resolution passed by Downers Grove Student Senate, 2009: The University Student Senate (Senate) would like to state that, in relation to events with alcohol, the Senate supports conduct befitting a health professional and encourages intelligent decision -making. Therefore, at events where alcohol will be present and the main purpose of the event is a fundraiser for a Midwestern University (MWU) organization, the MWU organization can benefit from the sales of the alcohol as long as the event is approved by the Office of Student Services. However, if the event benefits a non -MWU organization, proceeds (partial or complete) from alcohol sales may not be the main source of revenue. In keeping with the promotion of a health -conscious lifestyle, MWU organizations are prohibited from sponsoring and/or using University resour ces to promote an off campus MWU organization event with an \"open bar\" / \"all you can drink\" option. Furthermore, the Office of Student Services reserves the right to restrict the time frame and/or location(s) of an off campus event that includes alcohol. Audiorecording/Photorecording/Videorecording Audiorecording (audiotaping), photorecording, videorecording (videotaping) and/or digital recording in any format, including cell phones, of lectures, lecture material, laboratories, laboratory material, clinic al settings, especially surgery and patient encounters, is prohibited without the written permission of the instructor(s), preceptor(s), faculty, or administrative personnel. All requests for such recordings (tapings) must be submitted to the instructor(s) or faculty member(s) in writing prior to the lecture, laboratory or clinical experience. If approved, the student must be present while recording (taping), unless there are previously approved extenuating circumstances. All such recordings (tapings) are f or the exclusive use of the student who has been given permission to record (tape), and cannot be distributed to other students without the written permission of the instructor. Distribution of recorded (taped) lectures or lecture materials in any format o r venue without written permission will result in disciplinary action. In any event, no recording may be shared or distributed outside of the University without the written permission of the President. Audiorecording (audiotaping), photorecording, videor ecording (videotaping) and/or digital recording in any format of meetings with instructors, faculty and/or administrators is prohibited without the written permission of the instructor(s), faculty member(s) or administrators. Unauthorized recordings (tapin gs) are unprofessional and will result in disciplinary action under the Midwestern University Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In Downers Grove, students may also face prosecution under the State of Illinois Eavesdropping Laws. The Illinois Eavesdropping Act makes it a felony for a person to record others without their consent. B Bicycles Bicycles may not be parked inside University facilities with the exception of individual residence hall rooms or apartments. Bicycles may not be stored in comm on areas in the residence halls or apartments. Students are encouraged to park their bicycles in the bicycle racks provided on campus. Bicycling is restricted to campus sidewalks and driveways. Students should use common sense and consideration when pedes trians and cars are present. Bonfires (Downers Grove Campus Only) On the Downers Grove campus bonfires are allowed at the barbecue pit, only. Student groups wishing to hold a bonfire must seek approval and apply for a burn permit from the Village of Downers Grove through the Office of Student Activities. Children under 18 are not permitted at bonfire events. For the safety of all involved, students are asked to use discretion and common sense regarding this type of event when alcohol is being served t o assure the safety of others. A Faculty advisor and MWU Security Officer are required to be present in order to host a bonfire. Approval of such events is at the discretion of the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students reserves the right to cancel a bonfi re or the event for any reason. Bookstore The campus bookstore is located on the upper level of The Commons on the Downers Grove Campus and in the Cactus Student Center on the Glendale Campus. These bookstores are owned and operated by Matthews Bookstores. The purpose of the bookstores is to work with each teaching faculty member to obtain a list of required and recommended textbooks and supplies for each class offered by the University, and to provide these items for sale in the store. The bookstores also offer a growing selection of health science reference books and equipment, a variety of school and office supplies, greeting cards, imprinted clothing and souvenir items, and a small line of food items and sundries. Their primary goal is to offer excellent customer - oriented service to all members of the Midwestern University community and to be a resource whenever possible to these individuals. The bookstores may buy back textbooks at any time throughout the year, subject to salability determined by current market demand. The bookstore has exclusive rights to sell books and approved merchandise to MWU students, faculty and staff. Selling of books or merchandise that is typically sold in the MWU Bookstore by students for purposes of fundraising or other purpo ses is prohibited unless previously arranged with the bookstore. C Cancellation of Classes The University may cancel on -campus classes in the event of exceptionally inclement weather. Students on the Downers Grove Campus should tune in to one of the follow ing stations after 7:30 am. AM FM TV WLS 890 WLS 94.7 FOX 32 WGN 720 US 99 WMAQ -TV (CH 5) WBBM 780 B 96 Chicagoland Cable TV The University also uses the RAVE alert system to inform students, faculty and staff of University closures and re -openings via text messages. The RAVE alert system allows the University to provide instant notification to students, faculty and staff regarding emergency situations on campus. University closures may be the result of weather or other conditions on campus that inte rfere with the normal conduct of business or that present a potential threat to members of the University community. Student should follow the instructions sent via the RAVE alert. Information is also posted on the Midwestern University website and sent to MWU community members via University email. Career Planning and Posting Services Midwestern University hosts an on -line job posting service on the Job Finder heading on the Midwestern University web site ( www.mid western.edu ). MWU clinical faculty, alumni, preceptors, and other academic and corporate partners are invited to post relevant job opportunities. MWU students and alumni have exclusive password -protected access to this database to help them in their caree r placement efforts. Conduct Code Students are expected to emulate the legal, moral, and ethical standards expected of professionals in their respective areas and display behavior that is consistent with these qualities. A Code of Responsibilities and Rights of the Students of Midwestern University has been approved. A copy of this document is included in Appendices 1,2 and 4. This code clearly states the mode of behavior that is expected of students in acad emic and professional settings. This code cove rs on - campus and off -campus activities. Students are expected to read and follow this code. Students also need to be aware that a lack of professionalism may result in possible disciplinary action, including failure, probation, suspension or expulsion. Counseling Personal counseling for students is provided through the Office of Student Services on -campus Student Counselors for counseling issues that may arise while enrolled at Midwestern University. In addition, a Student Assistance Program, underwritten by Aetna Student Health, is available for all MWU students at no cost to the student. The Student Assistance Program is a 24/7 program that allows students to contact an individual who can best assist with their personal counseling needs should the on -camp us Student Counselors not be available. The Student Assistance Program, which also allows for assistance with legal issues, is designed to serve as a no-cost, confidential assistance program to help students with an immediate crisis, prior to seeking an in -person professional appointment, or when the on -campus Student Counselors are not available. Students can access the Student Assistance Program through a toll free number (877-351-7889), by email at AskSAP@aetna.com, or via a website at www.AetnaSAP.com. The Deans of Students, as well as the Academic Deans/Program Directors, and faculty are also available for the professional and academic counseling needs of all students. The Director of Student Financial Services is available to help students who seek a ssistance in managing their finances. The Residence Life staff members are available to assist students with issues pertaining to on -campus housing. Midwestern University understands many students have personal concerns that may affect their academic and personal lives. In most instances, the student can overcome such issues independently. In other instances, normal peer -to-peer, student -faculty, or student -administrative assistance can serve either as motivation or guidance to the student, helping resol ve their problem. In some cases, however, the efforts of the student, faculty member, administrator, or peer cannot help resolve the student's problem. A student may be advised to request a leave -of- absence from their Program Director/Dean until their per sonal issues are resolved. Midwestern University believes it is in the interest of the student, the student's family, and the University to provide on -campus counseling to help students deal with a variety of personal concerns. The Student Counseling Serv ices will handle such problems in the following way: 1. The University recognizes that almost any human concern can be successfully treated provided it is identified in the early stages and referral is made to an appropriate modality of care. 2. The purpose of t his policy is to assure students that if they have personal concerns that are affecting their academic and personal lives, they will receive assistance to help resolve their problem in an effective and confidential manner. Students are assured that utilizi ng the Student Counseling Service will be confidential, unless otherwise regarded by law. 3. Concerns will be handled in a forthright manner. 4. Students who have a problem that they feel may affect academic performance are encouraged to voluntarily seek counsel ing and information on a confidential basis by contacting the Student Counseling Service. 5. It is strongly encouraged that the students comply with referrals and recommendations of the Student Counseling Service. Midwestern University provides the above stated student counseling to help students deal with a variety of academic, professional and personal concerns. Short -term counseling is provided at no cost for all MWU students. Students who present with long -term issues are referred to off - campus specia lists for assessment and treatment. All efforts are made to make referrals to providers on the student's health insurance network to minimize additional costs. Procedures To preserve confidentiality, students can make appointments directly with a Studen t Counselor. The Assistant Dean of Students (Downers Grove - 630-515-7142) or the Manager of Student Counseling (Glendale - 623-572-3629) serve as the initial contact, perform a preliminary assessment and assign the student to the counselor who can best se rve the student's needs. A counselor can be reached Monday through Friday during business hours to schedule an appointment, however, accommodations in scheduling are flexible for students off -campus or on rotations. For those students who cannot be on -camp us, the counselor can provide assistance via the telephone, or students can access the Student Assistance Program 24/7 when the on -campus Student Counselors are not available. Mandatory Assessments The Dean of Students and the individual college deans res erve the right to require a student to undergo a medical assessment if their physical and/or mental status is determined by the deans to warrant concern. Such circumstances are only enacted when it is determined that the personal well-being of the student is in question, or when the student is suspected of being a threat to his/her own well -being or to the well -being of others. Under such serious circumstances, the Academic Dean or the Dean of Students may place the student on a temporary suspension until i t is determined by the clinical evaluator that the student is medically/psychologically able to return to the classroom/clinical setting. In this situation, Midwestern University will be responsible for all arrangements and payments of the initial clinical assessments. The deans may also require the particular student to sign an agreement that allows a treating physician/psychologis t/counselor to disclose to the deans documentation that the student is complying with any recommendations that were set forth t hrough the clinical assessment/evaluation of that student. In other situations that are less severe, the student may be required to sign an agreement that allows the treating physician/psychologist/counselor to disclose to the deans, only that the student is being treated by that particular clinician and is capable of remaining in/returning to the classroom/clinical setting. Knowledge of any clinical assessment will be kept strictly confidential. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) All students who are dire cted by their curriculum to rotate through clinical/hospital sites need to be certified at performing Basic Life Support (BLS) procedures. Medical and physician assistant students also must be certified at performing Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) procedures. These procedures are usually licensed for two years. Individual colleges/programs typically provide opportunities for their students to obtain these certifications during their academic tenure. Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act As required by federal law, Midwestern University must disseminate information to currently enrolled students about policies and procedures to report criminal actions on and close to campus, current policies concerning security and access to facilities on campus, and information on campus law enforcement and statistics concerning incidents of local crime. This information is provided in Appendix 5. Students interested in further information should contact the Office of Safety and Security. See also the section on Secur ity. Criminal Background Checks Due to growing nationwide concerns regarding the suitability of today's health care providers, many hospitals, health care systems, clinics, physician offices, or pharmacies providing health care services require disclosure of an individual's criminal history. In addition, many state statutes also require disclosure of an individual's criminal history in order to apply for certain health professional certificates, registrations, and licenses. Existence of a criminal history m ay subject an individual to denial of an initial application for a certificate, registration, or license to practice in a clinical setting or result in the revocation or suspension of an existing certificate, registration, or license. In response to this g rowing trend, Midwestern University requires students to submit to criminal background checks. It is the policy of Midwestern University that all accepted students must submit to a criminal background check prior to matriculation. In addition, students who remain enrolled must submit to a criminal background check as needed to remain eligible for continued participation and/or to participate in clinical rotations. A criminal background check may necessitate one or more of the following: 1) a standard crimin al background check conducted through an approved background check agency, 2) a fingerprint background check conducted by an approved agency, in which the prints are submitted to both State Police and the FBI database and/or 3) an International Police Clearance. The procedure utilized to conduct the background check will be based upon the individual's residency status, country of origin, time in residence in the United States and specific program requirements. In accordance with the laws of the State of Ill inois, CCOM students are required to undergo fingerprinting as part of the criminal background check process. Students in other programs may also be required to undergo fingerprinting. The criminal background check involves obtaining an authorization from a matriculating or current student that allows the University to obtain the student's individual criminal history. The results of the background check are reviewed by the Dean of Students to determine whether or not there is a record of criminal activity, including misdemeanor and/or felony charges and/or convictions. If there is a positive record, the Dean of Students will inform the appropriate Academic Dean and the Director of University Risk Management so the University can make a determination whether the criminal history will negatively impact the student's admission status or ability to complete the practical training/rotation requirements of the degree program. Criminal background checks are conducted through Student Services as part of the initial s tudent matriculation process and on an as -needed basis thereafter while a student is actively enrolled at Midwestern University. 1. All matriculating students must complete the Criminal Background Release and Consent Form to conduct the criminal background ch eck. All newly admitted students who have submitted a matriculation deposit are provided with access to a copy of the University Criminal Background Checks Policy and the Criminal Background Release and Consent Form. By going to the Midwestern University w ebsite (http://www.midwestern.edu) and selecting MWUNET, the student can complete the Consent Form, which can be found under the Student Services Tab on the portal. The Policy can be accessed by logging into the Student Handbook under the Resource section and selecting 'Criminal Background Check Policy'. a. Incoming pharmacy, optometry and dental students will complete a criminal background check through the appropriate application agency (PharmCAS, OptomCAS or ADEA). The results of those background checks wil l be forwarded to Midwestern University. b. Incoming international students must complete an International Police Clearance, either under the guidance of Midwestern University or their application agency. If the international student has also resided in the U nited States within the seven year period prior to matriculation, the student must also complete a criminal background check. The International Police Clearance must be initiated by the student according to the guidelines of the country from which the Clea rance is required. c. Incoming students must complete the criminal background check requirement prior to matriculation. For students who are admitted close to their matriculation date, or for students whose situation may necessitate an extension, the criminal background check must be completed by the end of the first month of the first quarter of enrollment for their program. Failure to complete the background check within the stated timeframe jeopardizes their continued enrollment, and the student may be requ ired to take a mandatory leave of absence. 2. The Office of Student Services will contract with a professional service to conduct the criminal background check. 3. The Dean of Students will review all criminal background check reports and determine whether or no t a record of criminal activity exists. If a record of criminal activity exists, the Dean of Students will conduct a criminal background investigation. The investigation may include any of the following components: a. Request for additional detailed informat ion about the positive criminal background check report. This may entail one or more meetings with the student. b. Collection of additional data, e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprints and report, concerning the positive criminal background check report. Following the criminal background investigation, the Dean of Students, in consultation with the Academic Dean (or their designees), will determine whether or not the student should be disqualified from matriculation or continued enrollment. A recor d of criminal activity will not automatically disqualify a student from enrollment or continued enrollment. The University will consider such factors as (but not limited to) the nature of the crime, the age of the individual at the time the crime was commi tted, length of time since the criminal activity, any fines, sanctions or convictions, the nature of the clinical program and the relatedness of the conviction, and whether the University will be able to provide appropriate professional clinical training t o the student. Students who are permitted to matriculate with a positive criminal background check are required to sign a waiver stating their understanding of the possible negative impact of their background check on their education, postgraduate training and licensure. 4. Failure to disclose criminal activity or material misrepresentation of information by an incoming student is deemed to be falsification of the application and may result in denial of admission, matriculation and/or dismissal from the progra m and University. Failure to disclose criminal activity or material misrepresentation of information by an enrolled student is deemed to be a violation of the student Code of Conduct and may result in dismissal from the program and University. Incoming and enrolled students must disclose any criminal activity, including misdemeanor or felony charges/convictions to their Academic Dean and the Dean of Students. 5. Failure of the student to present appropriate forms to the Office of Student Services for the purpo se of conducting criminal background checks when requested will bar the student from initial matriculation and/or continued enrollment. 6. Students with a positive criminal background check are individually responsible for checking the licensing and certifica tion requirements in any state where the student is interested in participating in a postgraduate residency training to determine whether or not their criminal background will be a barrier to participation. 7. Students are required to disclose to the Dean of Students and appropriate Academic Dean any arrests, criminal charges, or convictions against them during their entire period of enrollment as a student at Midwestern University. Disclosure must be made immediately after the incident that resulted in charge s so the University can assess the impact of the incident on the student's academic progression. Such arrests, criminal charges, or convictions may negatively impact a student's ability to obtain and/or complete clinical rotations or preceptorships, post -graduate residency placement or licensure. 8. Midwestern University does not guarantee clinical rotations, post -graduate residency placement or licensure for students who have a positive criminal history. Clinical rotation placement, post -graduate residency pl acement, and licensure are governed by separate entities who use their own specific set of standards that may be different than those used by Midwestern University. In such cases, the University confidentially shares information about the student's positiv e criminal history with potential preceptors and practice site representatives as necessary and on a need -to-know basis. This may include releasing a copy of the original Criminal Background Check report for their review. This gives the preceptor and site representatives an opportunity to decide whether the student is acceptable to the site. For this reason, scheduling and completion of practical training/rotations and graduation may be delayed. In some instances, it will not be possible to arrange for prac tical training/rotations at specific sites. Under these circumstances, the college/program will work with the student to find a possible clinical rotation site that will accept a student with a positive criminal background check. a. If this information is kno wn by the University prior to the student's matriculation, the Academic Dean (or their designee) will meet with the potential student to discuss the consequences of the positive criminal background investigation on the student's ability to complete degree requirements, post -graduate residency placement and licensure so that appropriate action can be taken. b. If this information is known by the University after the student's matriculation, the Academic Dean (or their designee) will meet with the student to dis cuss the consequences of the positive criminal background investigation on the student's ability to start/resume practical training/rotations and the student's ability to graduate, secure a post -graduate residency and obtain licensure so that appropriate action can be taken. 9. Records concerning a student's positive criminal background check are stored in a confidential file in the Student Services Office. 10. In the event that a student is assigned to a practical training/rotation site that requires a copy of the original Criminal Background Check report prior to a student's placement at the site, the student's criminal background check report and cover letter will be scanned into an encrypted password protected PDF file. The encrypted PDF file will be forwarde d via email to the rotation site coordinator. D Disability Services It is the policy of Midwestern University to ensure that no qualified student with a disability is excluded from participation in or subjected to discrimination in any University program, activity, or event. Midwestern University makes reasonable accommodations to the physical and mental limitations of students to the extent that such accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business. Disabled students' rights a re protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and its amendments (2008). Section 504 prohibits any program or activity, which receives federal funding from discriminating against qual ified persons with disabilities in employment as well as all other activities. The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act 1990 (42 U.S.C. d12101 et seq.) was developed \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimin ation against individuals with disabilities\". Technical Standards Midwestern University has developed a set of technical standards that are required of all matriculating students. Students must meet the technical standards for their program throughout their period of enrollment. Individual programs at Midwestern University may include additional expectations related to essential functions or job duties specific to the practice of that profession. Definitions: Disability: The term \"disability\" means, with respect to an individual; a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; b) a record of such an impairment; or c) being regarded as having such an impairment. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102 as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008) Even if a condition is an impairment, it is not automatically a disability. To rise to the level of a disability, an impairment must substantially limit one or more major life activities. Impairment: A physical or menta l impairment means; a) any physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), car diovascular, reproductive, digestive, genito -urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or b) any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities . 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.104; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.104 (under the original ADA) Major Life Activity: Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bendi ng, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. A major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102 ( as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008) Substantially Limits: The term \"substantially limits\" means; a) unable to pe rform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or b) significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the cond ition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j) - Substantially Limits (under the original ADA) Policies for Accommodating Students with Disabilities Midwe stern University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Toward this end, Midwestern University policies and procedures ensure that students with a disability will not, on the basis of that disability, be denied full and equal access to academic and co -curricular programs or activities or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under programs offered by the University. To ensure full implementation, three important areas have to be considered: 1. The rig ht of the University to set and maintain standards for admitting and evaluating the progress of students. 2. The right of the student with a disability to be included on the basis of criteria that does not unfairly discriminate because of the disability. 3. The right of the faculty to establish and monitor standards of academic performance and to assess content domains. Rights and Responsibilities of the University Rights To establish technical standards for admission of students into MWU programs. Maintain Univ ersity's academic standards. Request current documentation from a student completed by an appropriate professional source to verify the need for reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids. Discuss a student's need for reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids with the professional source of his/her documentation with the student's signed consent authorizing such discussion. Select among equally effective and appropriate accommodations, adjustments, an d/or auxiliary aids in consultation with students with disabilities. Deny a request for accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids if the documentation fails to verify the need for the requested services, or the documentation is not provid ed in a timely manner. Refuse to provide an accommodation, adjustment, and/or auxiliary aids that is/are inappropriate or unreasonable including any that: o Pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others; o Constitute a substantial change or alteratio n to an essential element of a course or program; or, o Pose undue financial or administrative burden on the University or student. Responsibilities Ensure that University courses, programs, services, job opportunities, activities, and facilities, when viewed in their entirety, are offered in the most integrated and appropriate settings possible. Provide information regarding policies and procedures to students with disabilities and assure its availability in accessible formats upon request. Evaluate stu dents on their abilities, not their disabilities. Provide to a student reasonable and appropriate accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids following a timely request. Maintain appropriate confidentiality of records and communication conc erning students with disabilities except where disclosure is required by law or authorized by the student. Rights and Responsibilities of Students Rights Equal access to courses, rotations, programs, services, jobs, activities, and facilities available through the University. Reasonable and appropriate accommodations, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids determined on a case -by-case basis. Appropriate confidentiality of all information pertaining to his/her disability with the reasonable choice of whom to disclose their disability to except as required by law. Information reasonably available in accessible formats. Responsibilities Meet the University's and individual program's qualifications and essential technical, academic, professional and inst itutional standards as any other student. Identify themselves in a timely manner as an individual with a disability when seeking an accommodation. Provide documentation from an appropriate professional source that verifies the nature of the disability, fun ctional limitations, and the need for specific accommodations. Follow specific procedures for obtaining reasonable and appropriate accommodations, academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids. Have the responsibility to advocate for their own individual need s and to seek information, counsel, and assistance as necessary, and within reason, to be effective self - advocates. Rights and Responsibilities of the Faculty Rights Identify and establish the abilities, skills, and knowledge that are fundamental to academic programs/courses and to evaluate each student's performance against these standards. Fundamental program and course standards are not subject to modifications, although a student with a disability is entitled to reasonable accommodations to assist him/her to meet the program/course standards. Determine which modification/accommodation it will provide the student with the goal of assuring that such modifications/accommodations are effective and to impose reasonable rules for the provision of academi c adjustments and auxiliary aids. Responsibilities Has the responsibility to make reasonable modifications for a student with a disability with respect to the adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted. Select and administer tests us ed to evaluate students so as to best ensure that test results accurately reflect aptitudes or competencies and do not discriminate against a student with a disability. Tests designed to measure specific skills related to fundamental standards are allowabl e even when those skills are impacted by the disability. Has the responsibility to evaluate students in a nondiscriminatory manner. Procedures and Information Regarding Requests for Accommodations: The following procedures and information serve as a guide for students seeking special accommodations for disabilities. A written application for accommodation of a disability must be made by the student ( RADA ). Verbal disclosure prior to or following admission is not sufficient. Students may apply for special accommodations anytime during their academic curriculum, however, if granted, the accommodation is given only for the academic year in which it is requested. Subsequent applications must follow for each academic year the student is requesting accommodation s (including requests during clinical rotations, clerkships, preceptorships, internships, or any other off-campus programs that are part of the students' required college/program curriculum). In the following section 'Dean of Students' refers to the Dean o f Students or his/her designee. How do I request an accommodation and who do I contact? A student requesting an accommodation under the ADA for a disability must contact the Dean of Students Office. A written application for accommodation of a disability (RADA ) can be filled out in the Office of Student Services. Do I need to have documentation prior to my meeting with Student Services? Although students can apply for accommodations at any time during their academic program, it is strongly advised that if you are seeking accommodations, you have the following paperwork and documentation submitted to the Office of Student Services prior to your request. Students must fill out the Request for Accommodations for Disability Application (RADA ) prior to consider ation of such requests. To expedite the process, students are encouraged to have this form completed prior to their meeting with Student Services. In addition, students need to fill out a Confirmation of Request for Accommodations for a Disability ( CRADA ) form, which allows the Dean of Students to disclose to other necessary University Officials the circumstances regarding the student 's disability in order that the accommodation(s) will be appropriately met. Documentation is required from a qualified health professional or diagnostic service agency and a report must be on file in the Office of the Dean of Students before any accommodation can be granted. Students requesting accommodations should download the appropriate form for their specific disability for completion by a qualified professional. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that all required documentation is forwarded to the Office of the Dean of Students. A student's request for accommodations will not be considered until all supporting documentation has been received. Application Form s and Documentation Form s (Select appropriate area(s)) : Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Learning Disability Physical/Medical Disability Psychological/Psychiatric Disability Confirmation RADA Form Request for Accommodations for a Disability Application (RADA) - AZ Request for Accommodations for a Disability Application (RADA ) - IL Accommodations The following is a list of accommodations that may be considered, given the student has provided the appropriate documentation: Extra time on timed examinations and/or quizzes Extra time on in -class assignments Provisions to take examinations and/or quizzes in a distraction reduced environment (smaller room, few test takers). Please note: a private, separate room may not be feasible. Audiotaping of lectures, when available Front row access in classes with assigned seating Other acc ommodations will be considered as presented What happens after I provide documentation and discuss my requests with Student Services? Following receipt of the accommodation application and the supporting documentation, the Dean of Students convenes a board consisting of the Dean and Assistant Dean of Students, a representative of the appropriate college's Dean's Office, a counselor and/or a psychologist, and other educational officials who are deemed necessary to consider the request in light of the support ing documentation. Decisions are based on the following criteria: Has the student provided appropriate documentation that he/she has a disability? Was the request submitted according to the procedures stated above? Is the request reasonable within the stud ent's required program of study? That is, the student's program of study is not fundamentally altered by this request. Does the request for accommodation interfere with a required component of the student's academic program? Without this accommodation, wou ld the student still be able to effectively learn the required material? If the requested accommodation meets the criteria, the Dean of Students will request the accommodation, in writing, from the Department Chair/Program Director/Course Director in charg e of the course or courses within which accommodations are being requested. It is the responsibility of the Dean of Students, in conjunction with the Department Chair/Program Director/Course Director to inform all appropriate instructors of the request for accommodation each academic quarter. It is the responsibility of the Dean of Students to discuss with the student how he/she can communicate to faculty and facilitate initiation of the requested accommodations. Students are reminded, however, that they must reapply each academic year to be considered for accommodations. What are my responsibilities once the request has been made to the department chairs? Once the accommodations have been approved and all necessary notifications have been made from the O ffice of the Dean of Students, it is the student's responsibility to discuss the details of, and to arrange for, the approved accommodations with individual course directors in a timely manner. Courses may have unique examination scheduling concerns, such as for practical exams, so students must do this prior to having the accommodation made available. It is the student's responsibility to approach the specific instructor of the class they wish to be accommodated and discuss what works best for them, withi n the parameters of the requested accommodation(s). Students, while having a specific disability and requesting accommodations for one course, may or may not want special accommodations for other courses within their program of study. The course director w ill not automatically provide accommodations unless the student has specifically requested the accommodations in a timely manner and discussed the details of implementing the accommodations prior to the accommodations being needed. What if I encounter pro blems with receiving accommodations after I have gone through the proper procedures? Students are encouraged to immediately bring problems or complaints to the attention of the Dean of Students. It is the responsibility of the Dean of Students to monitor a ll arrangements regarding disability accommodations. If a student feels he or she is being discriminated against because of a disability, he or she has the right to request an investigation into such a matter through the stated complaint policies and proce dures in Appendix Two, Section 1 of the current MWU Student Handbook. What do I do if I have not been tested within the required time frame and need documentation or if I feel I have a disability and need testing? Students who are in need of testing to provide current documentation should meet with the Dean of Students Office. Information on testing and testing locations can be obtained through the Office of Student Services. Costs of testing and assessments are the responsibility of the student. In addi tion, the Dean of Students reserves the right to request additional testing of the student before granting accommodations if he/she feels that the documentation provided by the student is not sufficient and/or does not comply with the criteria stated previ ously for appropriate documentation. Students must pay for all evaluations and assessments. What if I have just been diagnosed with a disability? Can accommodations be applied retroactively? Accommodations are only granted starting with the date the stude nt is approved for accommodations by the Disability Committee. Accommodations cannot be applied retroactively to courses/exams that have already been completed. What if my request for accommodations is denied? Is there an appeal process? Yes, following n otification of a decision from the Dean of Students, a student may appeal the decision. He or she has 7 working days to submit a formal written appeal of the decision to the appropriate college dean. The appeal must be submitted in writing and delivered to the Office of the Dean of the appropriate college within this 7 -day period. The request should be accompanied by a narrative explaining the basis for the appeal. An appeal must be based on one of the following premises: a. Material or documentable informatio n not available to the involved faculty and staff at the time of the initial decision; b. Procedural error and/or c. Bias of one or more staff or faculty members involved in the decision. The Dean will make a decision on the validity of the appeal. If a studen t is not satisfied with the decision of the Dean, the student appealing may request a personal meeting with the President or her/his designee in accordance with the appeal process stated in Appendix 2, Section 1C of the MWU Student Handbook. What happens to my individual reports, assessments, and documentation and who has access to my detailed records? Access to these records is restricted. Copies of the detailed assessment are kept under strict confidentiality in the Office of the Dean of Students and may only be viewed by this Office, members of the Disability Board and individuals that the student has identified. If the accommodating department(s) or instructor(s) wish to view a copy of the student assessment, they must show reason why they wish to view the assessment and may do so only with the written consent of the student. What about accommodations for licensing board examinations or other licensing certification examinations? Students who wish to request accommodations for licensing board examinations or other licensing certification examinations are urged to contact the governing body or institution responsible for the administration of such examinations as early as possible. Requirements for requesting accommodations under the ADA for the se examinations may be different from those of MWU and the process involved may be lengthier than that at MWU. Receipt of accommodations from MWU does not guarantee granting of accommodations from a licensing board or licensing certification exam administr ation. Dress Code Students are expected to dress in an appropriately professional manner. Some departments may establish a dress code for particular activities (e .g. scrubs for dental lab; closed -toed shoes for gross lab). The wearing of clothing having caricatures, messages, symbols, etc., that, based on societal norms, can be construed to be vulgar or offensive or to contribute to creating a hostile learning/academi c environment demonstrates inappropriate professional judgment that may be subject to review and action by the Dean of Students along with the student's respective college Dean. Some programs/colleges have established a dress code for particular activities (eg. business casual; scrubs for dental lab; closed -toed shoes for gross lab). For the Glendale Campus: The College of Veterinary Medicine and the Physician Assistant Program have adopted a Business Casual Dress Code for their students who are in the dida ctic (non -clinical) year(s). Business Casual typically means dress shirts (shirts with collars) or polo -type shirts (not T - shirts). Dress slacks (not jeans or shorts), and shoes but not necessarily ties or suits for the men, and dress shirts, appropriate b louses, or polo -type shirts, slacks, skirts and dresses, but not necessarily suits for women. Flip -flops should not be worn to class or lab. Shoes are required for all labs. Students in the Physician Assistant Program or College of Veterinary Medicine shou ld check with their administration for details concerning what does and does not constitute Business Casual attire. If a student is in a facility participating in patient care \u2014no matter how briefly \u2014he or she must comply with the following dress code: The p hoto identification badge must be worn so that it is visible to anyone approaching. Clean, professional coats or jackets that clearly identify students according to their professional program and status and that distinguish them from physicians and other health care professionals must be worn by students when with a patient, unless other dress is specified by the program/college or service (eg., scrub suits in surgery, obstetrics or dental labs/clinics). Male students are encouraged to wear a tie. When they do not wear a tie, only the top button of their shirt should be open at the neck. T-shirts, sweat shirts, halter tops, tank and tube tops, and backless or midriff -baring tops are not allowed. Casual slacks, blue jeans, fatigues, white trousers, short skir ts, short dresses and shorts are not permitted. Dress shoes are required, except in the dental clinic/simulation lab, surgery or obstetrics, where clean athletic shoes may be allowed. Wearing of socks/stockings should be determined by the dress code of the specific facility. Sandals are not acceptable. Any visible body piercing, except ears, must be removed. Visible tattoos should be discretely covered. Scrub suits are not to be worn e xcept when the student is on the obstetrics service, in surgical scrub, in the emergency department or in the dental clinic/simulation lab. Scrub suits are not to be worn in other areas of medical centers, particularly not on the floors where there are pat ients or in the cafeteria (except in an emergency situation and only if the scrub suit is covered by a white coat.) Hair is to be neat, clean, and properly maintained. Failure to observe these dress code policies may result in the student being asked to le ave the premises. Habitual violators are subject to disciplinary action. Individual sites may have dress code requirements that are more stringent than those outlined above. Students must also comply with the dress code of the facility in which they are rotating. Students are expected to dress in a professional manner at the commencement ceremonies. No unauthorized decoration (writing or other adornment) is permitted on your graduation gown, hood, or mortarboard. Drugs and Alcohol Midwestern University do es not condone any form of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse by its students. No alcohol or illegal drugs may be manufactured, consumed, distributed, or sold by students on any Midwestern University property or in any facility affiliated with or associated with Midwestern University. Alcoholic beverages may be served at an on -campus event only with the prior approval of the Dean of Students (see Alcohol Policy and Procedures for On -Campus Events). Any student who attends class or a rotation or is on the pr emises of a facility affiliated with Midwestern University while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is subject to immediate disciplinary actions. Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse Policy and Procedures A Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse P olicy and Procedure has been established for Midwestern University in order to appropriately serve the needs of faculty, staff, and students. This policy has been established to implement a drug -free workplace and academic environment consistent with feder al and state law, including the terms and conditions whereby employees, students, volunteers, faculty, physicians, and other professionals may be disciplined for violation of these policies and tested for suspected use of an illegal drug or alcohol. As par t of the Drug -Free Workplace policy, entering students must sign and submit a statement to the Office of Student Services indicating that they are drug -free and that they agree to abide by Midwestern University's Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse Pol icy. The signing and submitting of this statement occurs as a part of each new student's Orientation Program the week prior to the onset of classes. The Dean of Students maintains these statements in the Office of Student Services. In addition, the Office of Student Services emails a copy of the current Drug - Free and Substance Abuse Policy annually to all students for their review. Midwestern University maintains a drug -free environment consistent with the principles of the Federal Drug -Free Schools and Co mmunities Act and the Drug -Free Workplace Act. All offers of employment and enrollment of students are conditional on students abiding by Midwestern University's Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse Policy. In addition, a student who is convicted of a state or federal offense involving the possession or sale of an illegal drug (a controlled substance as defined by the Controlled Substance Act and does not include alcohol and tobacco) that occurred while the student was enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid, is not eligible for Title IV funds. For more detailed information concerning Title IV funds and convictions for the sale of an illegal drug see the Student Financial Services section of the catalog. The stated policies and procedures apply t o all students of Midwestern University on campus, or at all facilities operated by the affiliated entities. The stated policies and procedures also apply to any student who is enrolled at another academic institution but rotating in a clinical service on the premises of a facility operated by MWU. The University reserves the right to evaluate any student if there is reasonable cause to suspect that he/she is abusing or is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs/substances. A student is considered t o be under the influence when his/her ability to perform usual tasks is diminished or impaired due to the apparent use of an illegal drug/substance, alcohol, or a combination thereof. Any student who attends a class or a clinical rotation under the influen ce of alcohol or who is suspected of abusing drugs will be required to undergo an immediate drug and/or alcohol screening in accordance with this policy. While the costs of these initial drug screenings are typically the responsibility of the appropriate college or the Office of the Dean of Students, transportation to an emergency room for those students who are exhibiting signs of physical/mental impairment will be the responsibility of the student. If a student is found to have a positive drug screen and he/she is taking prescription drugs, he/she will be asked to provide documentation to both the University and/or the Medical Review Officer in the form of either a physician's or pharmacist's name and phone number where they can be contacted for verificati on. If however, the student is found to have a positive drug screen without documentation of a legitimate prescription, he/she will be subjected to disciplinary action, which may include immediate suspension and/or medical leave. Although extreme cases may result in expulsion, it is the intention of Midwestern University to assist students with chemical dependencies by helping the student receive the appropriate counseling and treatment for his/her dependency (see the following section). Counseling for Che mical Dependency The Office of Student Services has developed procedures to assist students and ensure appropriate care for any student who is impaired due to alcohol and/or drug dependency and abuse. Students who are chemical dependent can approach key pe rsonnel on campus to get assistance with their dependency, and feel confident that the information they provide will remain confidential to only those individuals who need to be involved. Such personnel on campus may include program directors, faculty advi sors, counselors, college administrators, and the Dean of Students. The college dean and Dean of Students are the primary individuals who will work with the student to ensure appropriate care. Clinical preceptors and/or Clinical Coordinators may also need to be notified, depending on circumstances. Midwestern University cannot guarantee clinical rotations for students with chemical dependency issues. All costs involved with counseling/treatment programs for chemical dependency are the responsibility of the student. Procedures: 1. If a student on campus or at a rotation site displays behavior that is indicative of substance or alcohol abuse, the Office of Student Services should be contacted. The reporting faculty member, staff member or preceptor should provide written documentation of the incidents which led to the initiation of the report. Per University policy, the student may be subjected to an immediate drug screen at a facility designated by the Office of Student Services on each campus. The stude nt must sign a waiver permitting the release of the results of any drug/alcohol screen to the University. Refusal to sign the waiver will be considered as admission of a positive test. A diluted specimen result is also considered a positive test. 2. If a st udent on campus or at a rotation site appears to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, the Office of Student Services should be contacted. The student should not be allowed to leave the premises. The Office of Student Services or the preceptor should call emergency services immediately at 911 to have the student taken to the closest emergency room. The student must sign a waiver permitting the release of the results of any drug/alcohol screen to the University. Refusal to sign the waiver will be considered as admission of a positive test. If a student is determined to have a positive drug screen as part of the requirements for a rotation, or in response to a drug screen that was administered because of reasonable cause, as stated above and in a ccordance to the above stated Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse Policy, the procedure will be as follows. 1. The student will be placed on leave or suspended until he/she has successfully completed a chemical dependency evaluation from a provider approv ed by the University. The student is responsible for the cost of the chemical dependency evaluation. If the student is determined to have a chemical dependency, the student must complete a chemical dependency rehabilitation program that follows the recom mendations in the evaluation. The cost of such a chemical dependency program is the responsibility of the student. In order for the student to return to classes/clinical rotations, the student will be required to develop a contractual arrangement with th e chemical dependency rehabilitation program that includes random drug screens and which allows for open communication with appropriate MWU administration. The student must submit a copy of the contractual arrangement as well as a letter from the chemical dependency program stating that the student is fit to return to full -time student status. Failure to comply with the stipulations of the chemical dependency program or failure to remain drug free will result in immediate suspension and possible dismissal . The University also reserves the right to discipline the student for violations of its drug free workplace policy in accordance with the Student Handbook. 2. If it is determined that the student does not have a chemical dependency, but has violated the Uni versity's drug free policy, then the University reserves the right to randomly drug screen the student though the remainder of the student's tenure with MWU, at the student's expense, to verify that the student is abiding by University policy. The Univers ity also reserves the right to discipline the student for violations of its drug free workplace policy in accordance with the Student Handbook. Date Rape Drugs Zero -Tolerance Policy The college adopts a \"zero -tolerance\" policy toward possession, use, distr ibution, or sale within the University community of date rape drugs including GHB, Rohypnol, ketamine, or any similar illegal drugs that can be given to a student without his or her knowledge. This policy is in effect for all members of the campus communit y, and extends to residence life and on - and off -campus University and student organization events. Students who are charged with possession, use, distribution, or sale of date rape drugs are in violation of the University's \"Code of Responsibilities of th e Students of Midwestern University\" as stated in Appendix 1 and of the University's \"Bylaws and Regulations of the Code of Responsibilities and Rights of the Students of Midwestern University\" stated in Appendix 2 of this handbook. Students can be discipl ined under the judicial proceedings stated in Appendix 2, Section 2 of the Student Judicial System. Students may be prosecuted under Illinois or Arizona criminal statutes. E Eating and Drinking in Classrooms To ensure a safe, clean, and healthy environment for all students on campus, no eating, drinking, or smoking will be permitted in any classroom, laboratory, lecture hall or auditorium. Students or student groups can provide food in the classrooms or lecture halls only with prior approval from the Dean o f Students, Assistant Dean or Assistant Director/Coordinator of Student Activities. Student violators will be referred to the Dean of Students for disciplinary action. Student groups who have prior approval to host events with food that take place in a cla ssroom, atrium or lecture hall must designate a clean -up committee. Student groups and organizations will be subject to sanctions for not cleaning up following approved events. E-Mail All students are required to check their University e -mail account on a daily basis. Official, \"in writing\" college and campus -wide communications are sent to students over e -mail. Students are responsible for information that is transmitted through this electronic medium (see Computer Code of Conduct). The student University email account is the only electronic mailing address recognized by the University. The University and its employees are not responsible for forwarding email to students at personal email accounts that are not held by the University. Information included in student emails should follow the guidelines of appropriate professional conduct. (See Computer Code of Conduct and Appendix 2, Section 2, Subsections a and b under 'Grounds for Action: Academic and Professional Misconduct '). Students are not to send ca mpus -wide e -mails without the prior approval of a student's respective dean or the Dean of Students. Excessive e -mails substantially slow the system's network capabilities. Attempts at minimizing the load to the network should be practiced by all MWU stude nts, faculty, and staff. Please Note: Although students are required to check their University e -mail accounts daily, and are able to use their accounts as alumni, it should be noted that a student's university e -mail account is the property of MWU and is to be solely administered by University Information Technology Services. A student is prohibited from contracting with third party software companies that require any type of intervention on the part of other students, staff, faculty or administration when attempting to freely e -mail that student's university e -mail account. University Information Technology Services, through the discretion of the Deans, has the sole authority when limiting or preventing access to a particular student's email account. Failu re to abide by this policy and any other computer code of conduct violation may result in disciplinary action in accordance to Appendix 2, Section 2 of this handbook. Emergency Campus Phone Numbers In the event of an emergency, use any campus telephone and call the following numbers to contact the proper authorities. Please be prepared to give appropriate information, such as type of emergency, location, phone number, and other information requested by Security. If the emergency is of an extreme nature, call 911 immediately, and then call Campus Security so they can direct the emergency vehicle to the correct location.

Students are asked to inform family members/friends that only emergency messages will be relayed to students. The caller must clearly state that an emergency situation exists. The caller will be asked for his/her name, his/her telephone number, relationship to the student, and the nature of the emergency. On the Downers Grove Campus, the student emergency message telephone number is 630/ 515 -6470. On the Glendale Campus, the student emergency mes sage telephone number is (623) 572 -3210. These numbers are only available for use Monday -Friday, from 8 am to 4:30 pm. At all other times, please contact Security (630/515 -7111 in Downers Grove, 623/572 -3201 in Glendale). Emergency calls for students on rotations at outside facilities must be directed to those facilities. Students are urged to obtain and familiarize themselves with the necessary information available at these facilities to ensure the expeditious handling of emergency calls. All affiliate institutions will make every attempt to locate a student and deliver an emergency message; however, there is no guarantee that a student can be located. Therefore, it is advisable for students to develop alternative ways of receiving emergency calls and m essages. Extracurricular Academic Activities Students or student organizations wishing to host events involving extracurricular academic activities ( i.e., speakers, mini -courses, drug fairs, or noncredit courses) to which members of the non-MWU community will be invited must have the approval of the Dean of Students or his/her designee.

Failure to evacuate during a fire alarm may result in disciplinary action. Firearms/Weapons No firearms, ammunition, explosive devices, o r other weapons may be carried, concealed or otherwise, by any student on institutional property. Violators of this policy are considered to be a threat to the academic environment of the institution and are subject to immediate suspension or dismissal fro m the University. Fire Safety Midwestern University rules and Downers Grove/Glendale ordinances prohibit smoking in designated areas, including classrooms, residence hall rooms, and common areas. In addition, state and city ordinances provide penalties for any purposeful damage of or destruction to property by fire. On-Campus Residents Cooking in the residence hall rooms on the Downers Grove Campus is strictly prohibited . Microwaves, popcorn poppers, hot plates, and other types of cooking devices are not allowed in any residence hall room. Microwaves are located in the kitchens on the lower level of Redwood and in the kitchenettes, located on each floor, in Redwood . The University and the Downers Grove Fire Department reserve the right to make regular inspections of student residence hall rooms to minimize the incidence of fires. Students who are found to be in violation of this policy will face severe disciplinary action and may be subject to fines, termination of their housing contracts, suspension, and/ or expulsion from the University. Cooking is permitted in any apartment that has kitchen facilities. Outdoor barbecuing is prohibited on apartment balconies/entryways. Designated areas are made available for outdoor barbecuing. The issue of fire safety in University housing facilities is a constant concern. On -campus residents can help keep their homes and their neighbors safe from fire by following all housing regulations concerning fireworks, explosives, and the use of electrical equipment and by followin g general common sense safety standards. Refer to the MWU Residence Hall Handbook for detailed rules and regulations regarding on -campus residents. Food Service On the Downers Grove Campus, food service is available year -round to all resident and nonreside nt students.

G Gambling Arizona and Illinois law prohibits gambling in any form , the sponsoring of lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, with the exception of lotteries and raffles conducted in accordance with state and local law and approved through the Office of Student Activities. (see Raffles for additional information) H Harassment/Unlawful Discrimination Midwestern University believes in the dignity and worth of its students, faculty, staff (including interns, and residents ) and therefore maintains a policy of nondiscrimination for all students, faculty and staff regardless of race, color, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation , religion, national origin, ethnic ity, disability, status as a veteran, marital status, p regnancy status, or age. Any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment that has the effect of substantially interfering with the individual's performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning/working environment is not tolerated by the University. This policy/procedure establishes a protocol whereby those who believe they have been discriminated against or harassed may obtain redress promptly and equitably through formal and informal procedures of the University. This policy applies to all members of the University community, each of whom is expected to report promptly complaints about violations. Students found to be in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, discip linary warning, disciplinary probation, suspension, or dismissal. No action shall be taken against anyone who submits a complaint that he or she believes to be valid - regardless of the outcome of the investigation; however, any person found to be intentio nally dishonest in making the allegations or to have made them maliciously is subject to University discipline. Definitions Unlawful Discrimination: Unlawful discrimination refers to unfair or unequal treatment of an individual or group based on protecte d status, such as race, color, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation , sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ethnic ity, disability, status as a veteran, marital status, pregnancy status, age or other protected group status as defined by law. Harassment: Harassment includes all unwelcome conduct (whether verbal, physical, visual or written) based on an individual's protected status, such as race, color, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation , sexual orientation, religion, nationa l origin, ethnic ity, disability, status as a veteran, marital status, pregnancy status, age or other protected group status as defined by law. Among the types of conduct prohibited by this policy are teasing, jokes, slurs, epithets, and negative stereotypi ng based on another person's protected status. Even where the conduct is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to rise to the level of a legal violation, MWU discourages any such conduct in the workplace and/or any of our related educational settings and re serves the right to take remedial action for all conduct it deems inappropriate. Complaint Process: 1. Informal Complaint Resolution Any member of the MWU community may seek advice, or information, on matters related to harassment without having to lodge a formal complaint. Students who feel they are being harassed, or are uncertain as to whether what they are experiencing is harassment, are encouraged to talk to the Dean of Students. The complaining party (the \"complainant\"), will be informed as to the opt ions available under this policy, including upgrading the informal complaint to a formal written complaint (see below #2). At the complainant's request, steps will be taken to resolve the complaint informally. The aim of the informal resolution process is to ensure that the alleged offending behavior ceases and that the matter is resolved promptly. The name of the complainant will be held in confidence during the informal resolution process, unless and until the complainant agrees that additional people mus t be informed in order to facilitate a solution. The Dean of Students will have the discretion to determine when the situation warrants notification of an alleged offender. If deemed advisable, constructive, confidential informal discussion to increase aw areness will be undertaken with the person alleged to have violated this harassment policy. An informal complaint may also be elevated to a formal complaint by the Dean of Students because of the severity of the factual allegations made by the complainant or because of the frequency of allegations against the alleged offender (see section below). 2. Formal Complaint Resolution Prior to any formal action, a formal complaint must be reduced to writing, identifying both the complainant and the alleged offender . 1. After a complaint has been reduced to writing, an investigation of the alleged harassment will be initiated by the Dean of Students, if possible, within 3 working days. For complaints against faculty, staff, administrators and preceptors, the Dean of Students and the Director of Human Resources will initiate a joint, formal investigation of the allegations, with the right to interview other parties in relation to the complaint in order to conduct a fair and thorough investigation. 2. The investigation wil l include, at a minimum, an interview with the complainant. The alleged offender will be interviewed if it is determined that the allegations, if true, would constitute a violation of this policy. The alleged offender will then be informed of the nature of the allegations, the identity of the complainant, the facts surrounding the allegations, and will be afforded a full opportunity to respond to the allegations. Any other person who may have information regarding the alleged harassment may also be intervie wed. 3. Notes and documentation of all interviews relating to the investigation will be maintained. All matters related to the investigation shall remain confidential to the extent permitted by law, provided it does not interfere with MWU's ability to investi gate or take corrective action. 4. The Dean of Students will report his or her findings to the college dean/department or division head/program director of the alleged offender for disposition typically within 10 working days of the receipt of the written com plaint. For incidents involving faculty, staff, administrators and preceptors, the findings will be reported to the Vice -president of Human Resources, as well as the college dean/department or division head/program director when applicable. 5. The report shal l include the allegation, the investigative process, the persuasiveness of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses. The report shall arrive at one of the following 3 findings based upon the preponderance -of-the-evidence standard (i.e., that is more likely than not that harassment/unlawful discrimination occurred): a. Harassment/unlawful discrimination has occurred; b. Harassment/unlawful discrimination did not occur; or c. There is inconclusive evidence as to whether harassment/unlawful discrimination occurred. 6. Upon review, the college dean/department or division head/program director or Vice - president of Human Resources responsible for receiving the report will recommend or take appropriate disciplinary action, if applicable. 7. Notification of the findings and disposition as recommended by the college dean/department or division head/program director or Vice -president of Human Resources shall be provided, confidentially, in writing, to both the complainant and the alleged offender. 8. The complainant or the all eged offender may appeal the decision of the college dean/department or division head/program director or Vice -president of Human Resources or Dean of Students. 9. All complaints and associated resolutions will be kept on file in the Office of the President i n accordance to HLC/NCA accreditation requirements and in the Office of the Dean of Students when complaints/resolutions involve students. Appeal by a Student 1. A student's request for appeal must be submitted in writing to the President within 14 calendar days of the date of notification of findings. The President can designate the appropriate Vice President, Chief Academic Officer to review the case. 2. The appeal shall proceed according to the procedures stated in Appendix 2, Section 4 of this handbook. Protection Against Retaliation MWU shall not in any way retaliate against any individual who informally or formally complains of harassment. Retaliation is a serious violation of this harassment policy. Any person found to have retaliated against another indiv idual for reporting harassment will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Hate Crime Arizona and Illinois law provides for criminal and civil penalties against an individual or individuals who assault, trespass upon, or cause dam age to the property of, or injure physically or emotionally another person or persons because of such persons of race, color, gender, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation , religion, national origin, ethnic ity, disability, status as a veteran, marital s tatus, pregnancy status, or age. Hazing Illinois law prohibits hazing. Although Arizona does not have a specific law pertaining to hazing, Midwestern University will not condone any form of hazing. No organization or individual(s) may engage in any form o f hazing of any student enrolled in Midwestern University. Students engaged in such activities are subject to suspension or expulsion from the University. Hazing is defined as any action taken against another individual, whether on - or off -campus, for the purpose of inflicting pain, humiliation, embarrassment, or any form of discomfort on another individual by means of horseplay, practical jokes, or trickery. Included in this are any action or actions that force students to participate in activities that ar e not consistent with the University's mission, rules, regulations, policies, or federal, state, and local laws. I Identification Badges The Office of Media Resources arrange s for the issuance of photo identification badges to new students during orientation or the first week of class. ID badges are necessary to gain access onto campus and into all campus buildings, for use in the library, and for identification purposes. This badge must be worn and visible while the student is in any on - campus institutional facility or is participating in a clinical rotation at another facility. Failure to provide proper student identification may result in a member of the security staff requ esting the student to leave a University facility, denying the student admission to the University, or referring the student to the Dean of Students. If a student identification badge is damaged, lost, or stolen, the student is required to inform the Offic e of Safety and Security and arrange for a replacement badge. A fee of $25.00 is required to replace a lost or damaged ID badge. The replacement fee is waived if the ID badge is stolen and the student can provide a copy of the police report. Once a stude nt has requested a replacement ID badge, the previous ID badge is permanently deactivated. For this reason, it is not possible to issue a refund once the replacement process in initiated, even if the student finds their previous ID badge before receiving a new one. Students should not: leave IDs on car dashboards punch a hole in the card lend cards to anyone Students may put money in a declining balance account that is accessed through their ID card. Monies in the account may be used in the bookstore, caf eteria and at copy/print machines in the library and computer labs. Money may be placed on the card on -line at http://online.midwestern.edu by using a credit or debit card. Students can receive a refund of the balance of the monies remaining on their ID card upon graduation through the Business Office . Immunizations, Titers, Tuberculosis and Other Related Requirements To complete the matriculation process, all students must submit completed medi cal files documenting completion of a physical exam, immunizations, tuberculosis and titer blood testing. Specifically, all students must submit documented laboratory proof of the absence of tuberculosis and proof of immunizations against measles, mumps, r ubella, varicella (chicken pox), diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis and hepatitis B. There may be some additional requirements depending on the student's particular program, e.g., Veterinary Medicine students are also required to show documented laboratory proof of rabies vaccinations. In addition, all students in health professional degree programs are required to prove the efficacy of their immunizations through blood titers, to measure the level of circulating antibodies associated with these various diseases. Depending on the program, students may also be required to submit to a drug screen. All students must inform their program if they have a communicative disease as it may directly impact patient contact and classroom/laboratory attendance. While enrolled, all students in health professional degree programs must submit annually documented laboratory proof of the absence of tuberculosis, must update diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccination if necessary, and must receive an annual seasonal influenza vaccinatio n. Cost for these requirements must be paid by the student, but may be built into the student's financial aid budget. Any reimbursement from an insurance plan is a matter between the student and his/her insurance carrier Immunization clinics for some vacci nation/inoculations are provided on both campuses to assist students with their compliance requirements. Information on immunizations, titers, cost, and immunization clinics is provided through the Wellness Center (Downers Grove Campus) and the Office of S tudent Services (Glendale Campus). Waiver of a University Immunization Requirement A student can request a waiver for a University immunization requirement for documented medical or religious reasons from the Office of Student Services and their respective College Dean/Program Director, but the student must be aware that the requirements are established by affiliated rotation sites and Midwestern University. Failure to satisfy immunization requirements will compromise a student's ability to participate at c ertain clinical rotations sites that require those immunizations. Moreover, procurement of alternate clinical experiences and/or clinical rotation sites that do not require immunizations may not always be possible. As a result, a student's progression thro ugh their academic program is likely to be slowed as a result of leaves of absence, a student's anticipated graduation date is likely to be delayed, or the student may be unable to complete their respective clinical program and not graduate. If a student's clinical training is at a Midwestern University clinic, the student with an approved immunization waiver will be required to follow the patient contact restrictions stipulated by the University Office of Risk Management and the health professional degree program. Record Access Students are required to keep a copy of all health information turned into the University. A student who wishes to inspect his/her original health and/or immunization file can do so through their online Student Portal . To receive a c opy of such record, the student is required to submit a written request to the Wellness Center on the Downers Grove Campus and the Dean of Students on the Glendale Campus. Requests for records will be honored no later than one week from the written request date. Inspection of a student's original health record is made in front of the responsible administrator or designee. Students are allowed copies of their medical records. Students requesting multiple copies of their health and/or immunization records may be charged a copying fee. Impairment of Life Safety Devices/Systems A policy has been established to discourage the destruction or impairment of campus life safety systems or devices. The destruction or impairment of campus life safety systems or devices such as fire alarms, defibrillators or exit doors, is a malicious act and could be life threatening. Any student found responsible for such acts is subject to disciplinary action, fines, and/or costs to repair damaged systems or devices.

Insurance Health Insurance The University requires that all full -time and part -time students enrolled in any University program be covered under a health insurance plan acceptable to the University. Midwestern University has made Student Medical Health Care Plans available to students. Students may choose health care insuran ce through Midwestern University or may choose their own plan. Evidence of acceptable non -University health insurance coverage must be provided prior to program matriculation and prior to registration for the fall quarter each succeeding year thereafter by completing an on -line waiver form that can be accessed through the online Midwestern web site ( http://online.midwestern.edu ). Students must also provide a letter from the insurance company verifying coverage o r a dated computer screenshot from the insurance company website verifying coverage at the date of matriculation and/or specifying the duration of the coverage with a termination date. Medicaid and other state sponsored health plans provide only catastroph ic coverage if the holder is residing outside of the state providing coverage. It is strongly recommended that Medicaid only be used on the Downers Grove campus if the student is a resident of the state of Illinois and will be undertaking his/her academic classes/clinical rotations in Illinois or on the Glendale campus if the student is a resident of the state of Arizona and will be undertaking his/her academic classes/clinical rotations in Arizona. It is further recommended that students who are carrying M edicaid should acquire additional temporary health insurance coverage if they participate in clinical rotations in a state different than their documented state of residence (Illinois or Arizona) so the student is covered for more than emergency/catastroph ic care. It is the student's responsibility to notify Student Services of any change in their insured status. A student's health insurance coverage may be randomly verified. Failure to maintain health insurance may result in immediate suspension or dismiss al. The University Student Health Care Plans are underwritten through AETNA U.S. Health Care Insurance Agency and administered by AETNA Student Health. Details of benefit plan coverage and related premium costs are available by calling the AETNA Student He alth at 800/927 -0783, contacting the Office of Student Services or online at http://www.aetnastudenthealth.com . One-Month Mandatory Extension Period for Graduates - Downers Grove Although the University bills students for their AETNA health insurance coverage on a quarterly basis, the final quarter for a graduating medical student includes a mandatory additional month of coverage past the medical student's graduation date. The cost of this buil t-in one -month health insurance extension is included in the medical student's final quarter bill. The University does not provide additional options for extending a medical student's health insurance coverage past this one -month built -in extension period. Please see the Office of Student Services for further details concerning this mandatory one -month health insurance extension following graduation. Students are eligible to remain on the AETNA insurance plan during a leave of absence. Students on a leave who wish to maintain coverage must inform the Office of Student Services and work out a payment plan with the Accounts Receivable Office. One-Month Mandatory Extension Period for All Graduates - Glendale Although the University bills students for their AETNA health insurance coverage on a quarterly basis, the final quarter for a graduating student includes a mandatory additional month of coverage past a student's particular graduation date.

Dental Insurance Downers Grove Campus Midwestern University has made optional student dental plans available to students through AETNA U.S. Health Care Insurance Agency. Coverage ends upon graduation. Studen ts on a leave of absence have the option to retain dental coverage, but must inform the Office of Student Services and work out a payment plan with the Accounts Receivable Office.

The Midwestern University Dental Institute provides lower cost dental services to students as well. Glendale Campus Aetna Student Health in Arizona do es not offer a dental insurance plan, but rather includes a dental membership plan that provides discounted rates depending on the dentist and the particular dental services. The Midwestern University Dental Institute provides lower cost dental services to students as well. Disability Insurance Students are also automatically enrolled through the University for disability insurance. This charge will appear annually on a student's bill along with his or her tuition, fees, any applicable insurance charges , housing charges and meal plan payments . Coverage ends upon graduation , but can be extended by contacting the insurer directly . Students on a leave of absence must retain disability coverage for the remainder of the current academic year. For information, contact the Office of Student Services. Disability insurance is mandatory for all health professional students in full -time programs, except for post-graduate professionals enrolled in the Doctor of Health Sciences and Doctor of Nursing programs. Liabilit y Insurance Professional liability insurance during clinical education is provided by the University. The University does not, however, provide coverage for clinical rotations or other activities outside of the U.S. Rotations in hospitals and/or facilities under the jurisdiction of foreign governments will not be covered under the Midwestern University student malpractice and/or comprehensive general liability insurance. Students who are interested in a rotation site in a foreign country that requires malpr actice insurance must pay for their own insurance coverage. Worker's Compensation Insurance Coverage Worker's Compensation Insurance coverage is designed to cover employees only. Since students are not employees of either the University or the facility at which they are on rotation for educational purposes, this insurance coverage cannot apply to them, unless otherwise required by law. Expenses incurred due to a needle stick while on clinical rotation (see Needle stick Policy) are not covered through Worker 's Compensation and need to be submitted through the student's health insurance provider. Expenses not covered through the student's health insurance provider should submitted to the Office of Risk Management. Students participating in the Federal Work Study Program are also not covered by Worker's Compensation Insurance. Intellectual Property Rights and File Sharing in Regard to Course Materials 1.

Lockers The Downers Grove Campus is currently developing a procedure for locker use in Science Hall. CCP students may request a locker in Alumni Hall at the time of orientation. CHS students may request a locker in Alumni Hall from their specific program. At the end of the academic year, locks will be forcibly removed, and the contents discarded. Glendale Campus lockers are available in Sahuaro Hall, Cholla Hall, Agave Hall, Glendale Hall, Cactus Wren Hall and Ocotillo Hall. Locker selections are available online through your student portal. From the Student Services tab, click on Locker Selection under General Information. Please contact Student Services if you have any questions concerning lockers. In Glendale, locks are recommended however, locks must be removed at the end of the locker assignment. If locks are not removed in a timely manner (wi thin one week after the conclusion of the locker assignment period), the student(s) assigned to the locker(s) will receive a written notice with a compliance date from the Office of Student Services. Failure to remove the lock by the date indicated in the notice from the Dean of Students will necessitate the forcible removal of locks by Campus Security. Midwestern University assumes neither liability nor responsibility for personal property lost or stolen from student lockers. Lockdown By definition, a lock down involves the confining of persons to a secure location following a public announcement, typically through the mass notification system, in response to a violent disturbance or threat of imminent danger. Please note: experts advise to Run, Hide, and Fi ght if necessary , given the circumstances. The following information pertains to a Lockdown scenario in which the option is to shelter in place should it be unwise to run or fight. All faculty and staff are informed on how to identify the closest lockabl e internal room that has no windows. There may be circumstances where lecture halls or laboratories are the closest and most accessible lockable room. Lockdown drills are necessary and must be followed as though an actual lockdown is occurring. The Unive rsity community will be notified of a lockdown situation via the emergency notification system. Immediate responses to a lockdown notification in which the option is to shelter in place are as follows: 1. Obey a faculty or staff member in terms of being dire cted to a lockable room or leaving the premises . 2. If you are in a classroom, quickly check the corridors for any recognizable person and direct them into the room with you . 3. Most classrooms, offices, and conference room doors will automatically lock during a lockdown. However, if you are in a classroom, office, or conference room that has a lockable door handle, press the thumbolt lock into the locked position . 4. Turn off the lights . 5. Go to the furthest corner of the room away from the door (and windows if prese nt) and remain silent . 6. Do not open the door for any reason until the local authorities grant an \"all clear\" or unlock the door with a key . 7. Do not leave the room if you hear a fire alarm. Wait for the alarm to be verified by the emergency notification syst em. 8. Remain in lockdown until local authorities grant an \"all clear\" If you are unable to make it quickly enough to a lockable room, find cover as best as possible. Individuals should be aware of their surroundings and must use discretion in an emergency situation. Lost and Found The Lost and Found on the Downers Grove Campus is located in the Office of Safety and Security ( lower level of the Commons ). Students and employees are encouraged to turn in items and articles found on campus to this office. The Of fice of Safety and Security is responsible for completing a \"Found Item Receipt\" form and maintaining a log ( i.e., the date the item was received, a description identifying the article, and its disposition) of all items received and detail any attempt to c ontact the owner of the item, if known. If the item is of value ( i.e., jewelry, cash, etc.) it is turned over to the Vice President of Business Services with a notation to this effect in the log. Items turned in to Lost and Found will be held for one year and then, if unclaimed, will be donated to a charitable organization. The Lost and Found on the Glendale Campus is loc ated at the lobby Security desk in Sahuaro Hall. Students and employees are encouraged to turn in items and a rticles found on campus to the Lost and F ound. The Lost and Found items will be stored in the security office, and a log will be kept of the items. Items turned in to Lost and Found will be held for one year and then, if unclaimed, will be donated to a charitable organization. The D epartment of Student Services also serves as an area for lost and found items only on a temporary basis, and are shortly sent to the Sahuaro Hall Lost and Found. M Mailboxes Mailboxes for students enrolled in classes on the Downers Grove Campus are located in The Commons and are assigned by the Supervisor of the Mailroom. Students enrolled on the Glendale Campus have mailboxes located in Barrel 3 and are assigned by the mailroom personnel. Students will be responsible for their mailbox key. The cost to repl ace a lost key is $35. When students become involved with clinical rotations, other professional training assignments, graduate, or leave the Downers Grove Campus for an extended period (eg, summer vacation), they are required to complete a forwarding addr ess form and return it to the Mailroom Supervisor or the University will not be responsible for forwarding mail. The MWU student mailboxes cannot be used for the purpose of solicitation by or for outside businesses, associations, or vendors. All students and student groups who wish to distribute information to the student population via the student mailboxes must have prior approval of the Office of Student Services . Mailboxes are not provided for students on the Glendale Campus, other than through the U. S. Postal Service for those students living in On -Campus Student Housing . Marijuana , Medical and Recreational Use Medical Marijuana is now permitted if prescribed by a physician in both the State of Arizona and State of Illinois. The state laws permit th e use of medical marijuana by individuals possessing lawfully issued State medical marijuana cards. However, federal laws prohibit marijuana use, its possession, and/or its cultivation at educational institutions that receive federal funding. The use, possession, or cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes is therefore not allowed in or on the premises of any Midwestern University property, including student housing apartments; nor is it allowed at any University sponsored event or activity off campus . All students sign a Drug -Free Workplace Certification Document prior to matriculation attesting their willingness to abide by the Midwestern University Drug -Free Workplace and Substance Abuse policy . Multiple states and one district currently allow recreational marijuana use. Although students may participate in clinical rotations in those states, regardless of state law, Midwestern University and its affiliated clinical rotation sites prohibit students from th e use of drugs, including marijuana, which are illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 . Students testing positive for recreational marijuana use will be subject to University disciplinary procedures irrespective of the state in w hich the marijuana was used .

Reporting of Crime Statistics Statistics concerning the occurr ence on campus of criminal offenses reported to campus security, local police, or any official of the University who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities are located in Appendix 5 of this handbook. Sexual Misconduct, including T itle IX Violations The University is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all its members. Sexual misconduct is a serious violation of the standards set by the University community since it creates an atmosphere of distrust and inequality and w ill not be tolerated. Sexual misconduct includes sexual harassment, sexual abuse, sexual assault or rape, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. This policy/procedure establishes a protocol whereby those who believe they have been subjected to se xual misconduct may obtain redress promptly and equitably through the policies and procedures of the University. This policy applies to all members of the University community, regardless of position/status, gender , gender identity, sex, sexual orientation , marital status or pregnancy status . Each member of the University community is expected to report promptly complaints about violations. Any student found to be in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, suspension, or dismissal. Any action taken by the University is independent of actions taken by external law enforcement agencies. No Retaliation Statement: No action shall be taken against any one who submits a complaint that he or she believes to be valid - regardless of the outcome of the investigation; however, any person found to be intentionally dishonest in making the allegations or to have made them maliciously is subject to University di scipline. Title IX Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 prohibits sexual discrimination. Sexual harassment and sexual violence are considered forms of sexual discrimination, and are therefore violations of Title IX. Violations of the University S exual Misconduct Policy must be reported to Dr. Teresa Dombrowski, Dean of Students - Title IX Coordinator, Downers Grove campus or Dr. Ross Kosinski, Dean of Students - Title IX Coordinator, Glendale Campus. Confidentiality Employees of the University, inc luding Resident Advisors in Housing, are required to report incidents of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator regardless of whether the student reporting the violation requests confidentiality. Campus counselors are not required 'to report, withou t the student's consent, incidents of sexual misconduct to the school in a way that identifies the student' (OCR) and therefore can be approached in confidence. Nonetheless, Midwestern University will make every effort to maintain the confidentiality of th e student reporting the violation. However, requests for complete confidentiality may hamper the ability of the University to fully respond to the incident and restrict the University's ability to pursue disciplinary action. Furthermore, the University may determine that its requirement to provide a safe, non -hostile and nondiscriminatory environment for all students supersedes the confidentially request of the student reporting the violation. Evaluations of requests for confidentiality will be made by the Title IX coordinator on each campus.

A student organization whose activities have been consistent with its charter and have resulted in progress toward achieving its goals shall be recommended for approval to renew recognition. A student organization whose activities have been substantively inconsistent with its charter or have failed to lead to progress toward its goals shall be recommended for probationary status.
