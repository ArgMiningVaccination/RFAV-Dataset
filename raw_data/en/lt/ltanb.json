SPECIAL REPORT: INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Psychiatry, as conventionally practiced, is being influenced by increasing openness to non-Western healing traditions in the context of accumulating research evidence for select [complementary and alternative medicine](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/east-meets-west-6-tips-incorporating-cam-psychiatry) (CAM) modalities and growing demands for more personalized care. Individuals who seek psychiatric care for depressed mood, anxiety, and other common mental health issues are increasingly concurrently seeking CAM options via Chinese medical practitioners, naturopathic doctors, herbalists, chiropractors, homeopathic physicians, energy healers, etc.1 At the same time, increasing numbers of physicians are being trained in CAM approaches and incorporating CAM into their medical practice.2 Collectively, these trends have resulted in rapid growth of integrative mental health care, a collaborative care model that incorporates modalities from psychiatry and CAM and focuses on the whole person; one that has the dual objectives of optimizing well-being and treating specific mental health problems. This Psychiatric Times Special Report contains concise reviews of selected CAM modalities. In addition, this issue's continuing medical education article reviews CAM interventions for mental health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The [CME article](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/covid-19-and-mental-health-global-consequences-and-cam-approaches) reviews and discusses progress on CAM interventions for enhancing [resilience](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/the-science-of-resilience-and-wisdom) and well-being during prolonged periods of social isolation during lockdowns, and for treating depressed mood, anxiety, and other mental health problems associated with the pandemic. For instance, data from studies of the [neurobiological mechanisms of mind-body medicine](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/neurobiological-mechanisms-of-mind-body-medicine) support the notion that mind-body practices (eg, tai chi, qigong, yoga, and meditation) enhance general well-being and alleviate symptoms of stress, anxiety, depressed mood, and other common mental health problems These beneficial effects are mediated by neural and physiological mechanisms. As you will read, further research is needed to determine which interventions are most effective for specific disorders and to identify the physiological and neural processes that mediate beneficial effects. The use of [herbals](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/herbal-medicine-what-psychiatrists-need-to-know) is another common practice that is noted in this Special Report. Widely used herbals typically have bioactive components that mediate complex effects involving multiple neurotransmitter systems; regulate gene expression; and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or endocrinologic effects. In contrast, psychotropic medications are synthetic molecules designed to have discrete modulatory effects on specific neurotransmitter systems. There is evidence that patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex trauma also leverage integrative medicine and nutrition. Dietary modification, nutraceuticals, hydrotherapy, exercise, body-centered therapies and sleep hygiene, and psychedelics are among the 17 components of [integrative approaches to PTSD](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/exploring-integrative-medicine-and-nutrition-for-ptsd). Although these pieces just scratch the surface of CAM use in psychiatry, hopefully it provides you with preliminary insights and inspiration.
