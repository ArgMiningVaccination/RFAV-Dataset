Describe the role of legislation in pediatric obesity, similar to legislative changes affecting other pediatric issues, such as tobacco control. Introduction Pediatric obesity has been viewed as a growing epidemic of the past few decades that requires intervention, similar to tobacco use and its accrued medical risks that hasprompted multifaceted preventive efforts. Affecting as many as 34% of American children,(1) obesity can be viewed as a top public health threat due to its associated morbidity andmortality. (2) The medical consequences of obesity accounted for 40% of the health-carebudget by 2006, with an expected $147 billion in health-care spending alone in 2008. (3)In 2006, obese adults had estimated medical costs $1,429 higher than those for persons ofnormal weight. (3) For children coming to a pediatric integrated health-care deliverysystem, expenses were $179 per year higher in obese children versus children who had normalbody mass index (BMI). (4) Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2002 to2005 for children ages 6 to 19 years, the total additional health expenditure in prescriptiondrugs, outpatient appointments, and emergency department visits for children who hadelevated BMIs was estimated to be $14.1 billion annually. (5) Pediatric obesity affects all organ systems, (6) with its medical sequelae paralleling the increasing prevalence in younger children. Type 2 diabetes is being diagnosed in morbidlyobese 9-year-olds, and bariatric surgery has been performed in children as young as 12years. Prevention is paramount, and pediatricians need easy tools that help with earlyrecognition of developing obesity, preventive counseling, and treatment. Bariatric surgeryremains an option, albeit a last resort, because the morbidly obese individuals who suffermedical complications remain at risk for a shortened lifespan if they do not achievesignicant weight loss. This article discusses trends in epidemiology, recognition, andtreatment of obesity in the primary care ofce as well as community interventions andprevention. Denitions Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. BMI (dened as weight inkilograms divided by height in meters squared) is an indirect measure of weight status and isplotted against age- and sex-specic percentiles. In the United States, children and adolescentsare dened as obese if their BMI exceeds the 95th percentile for age and overweight if theirBMI falls within the 85th to 95th percentile range for age. BMI is easily measured, has pediatric norms available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) websites, is easilycalculated by available web programs, and can be used easily for tracking childhood obesitytrends within a population. However, measuring overweight and obesity in children ages5 to 14 years is challenging because, as noted by the WHO, there is no standard denition *Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case; Head, Section of Adolescent Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH.Article nutrition Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 363 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023of childhood obesity applied worldwide (http://www. who.int/mediacenter/factsheets/fs311/en/index.html).Comparison of the CDC and WHO data and methodol-ogy reveals similar graphs, with small variations. (7) Pragmatically, the pediatrician can use the WHO's downloadable growth charts for children from birththrough 23 months, and the CDC website's download-able BMI graphs for tracking for children ages 2 yearsand up. The electronic medical record can make trackingof BMI even easier through programs that calculate BMIautomatically and record both the vital signs and BMIinto the health supervision visit record. However, BMI measurements do not reflect adiposity accurately because a muscular individual might have thesame BMI as an oversized endomorph (for those in theUnited States, imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger in hiscompetitive bodybuilding years compared with a life-sizecartoon character such as Fred Flintstone). High leanbody mass can elevate weight, leading to a higher BMIwithout corresponding high adiposity. Epidemiology The prevalence of pediatric obesity has grown in the pastfew decades, with increases occurring worldwide in de-veloped more than in developing countries. Despite anincrease in efforts to recognize and treat pediatric obe-sity, trends in obesity have not shown a decrease; at best,there is a plateau in rates. Ogden and associates (8)showed a prevalence of overweight of more than 33%,varying by ethnicity. The prevalence of obesity diagnosedin children ages 6 to 19 years tripled from 2003 to 2006;in children ages 2 to 5 years, the incidence of obesity rosefrom 5% to 12.4%. (9) A study of 11,653 children ages5 to 17 years in a longitudinal set of eight cross-sectionalsurveys, with use of data from the Bogalusa Heart Studyfrom 1973 to 1994 plus BMI data from routine schoolscreening in 2008 to 2009, showed a threefold increasein the prevalence of overweight and obesity from 14.2%to 48.4%. (10) Factors Contributing to Increased Childhood Obesity Prenatal influences include the food milieu provided by the placenta, with prenatal nutritional deprivation, ges-tational diabetes, and high birthweight all positively cor-related with obesity. In the rst year after birth, BMIincreases substantially, and the infant has a large numberof adipose cells. Between 4 and 6 years of age, adiposecells reach a nadir and subsequently increase sharply innumber in a process termed adipose rebound. The younger and heavier the child is at the time of adiposerebound, the more likely he or she is to become an obeseadult. As Ariza and associates state, \" . . . the adipose cells accumulated during this period will forever call out to befed.\" (11) Table 1 outlines the correlation between pediatric obesity and adult obesity by age, as adapted from variousstudies. (12)(13)(14)(15) In a retrospective cohortstudy of 854 children that included longitudinal data,Whitaker and colleagues (14) found that 1 to 2 year oldswho had a nonobese parent had an 8% chance of becom-ing obese adults, whereas 10- to 14-year olds who had atleast one obese parent had a 79% chance of becomingobese adults. Using the National Longitudinal Study ofYouth 1979 health data on 1,309 children born in 1965 to 1966 and tracked from 1981 to 2002, Wang andassociates (13) found that 80% of male and 92% offemale adolescents whose BMIs were greater than the95th percentile became obese adults. These results aresimilar to the longitudinal ndings from the BogalusaHeart Study, (12) a cohort of 2,610 adolescents ages15 to 17 years from 1975 who were followed into theirearly 30s by 1993, at which time 86% of boys and 90%of girls whose BMIs were more than the 95th percen-tile in adolescence remained obese as adults. Protective factors for obesity include breastfeeding, being a part of families who have active lifestyles andminimal television usage, and having nonobese parents.(16)(17)(18) Genes play a role in pediatric obesity but do not account for the dramatic recent increase in prevalence.Exogenous influences such as the demise of the familydinner, with more families eating fast food on the run;prepackaged foods that have high ratios of saturated fat(and trans fats until recently) and high-fructose cornsyrup; less accessible and lower intake of fruits and veg-etables in the average urban family; lack of safe areas to Table 1.

Sports for the elite childathlete are easily accessible, but affordable options for therecreational athlete, particularly the obese child, may belacking. The media also has contributed to the increase in childhood obesity, with advertisements to children sig-nicantly affecting their food preferences. The averageparent often succumbs to a child's request for the latesthigh-calorie, low-nutrient craze in the grocery store.Feeding trends also have an impact. For example, tod-dlers who are fed more than they require learn to selectand eat more than they need. In a culture in whichproviding food represents providing love and providingmore is better, conspicuous consumption has obviousconsequences. (19) Risk of Underdiagnosis in the Pediatric Population Underdiagnosis of pediatric overweight and obesity re- mains a concern. In a recent study using electronicmedical records of 711 patients ages 2 to 18 years seenfor well care between June 1999 and October 2007 in alarge medical system in northeastern Ohio, (20) theprevalence of overweight and obesity was higher thantypical, much more than the 10% seen in other countries.With overweight dened as BMI of at least the 85thpercentile but less than the 95th percentile and obesitydened as BMI of at least the 95th percentile or at least30, 19% of children were were obese,and 33% the obese group (8% of all children) weremorbidly obese. Of note, when the assigned billing In-ternational Classication of Diseases (ICD)-9 code forobesity was used as the means to determine whetherobesity was recognized and formally diagnosed, only10% of overweight patients, 54% of the obese patients,and the morbidly undiagnosed patients whose electronic med- ical records were reviewed manually (n /H11005195), 10.8% of overweight patients, 38.2% of obese patients, and 40%of severely obese patients were given a diagnosis otherthan overweight or obesity by ICD-9 code. This trendmay reflect the current lack of reimbursement in Ohioand other states for treating only obesity; ICD-9 codesreflecting the medical complications of obesity have bet- ter reimbursement. In this cohort, girls were more likelyto be diagnosed than boys, as were African American and Hispanic patients more than white children and adoles-cents. However, a statistically signicant trend was doc-umented toward an increasing rate of diagnosis duringthe study period until 2005, when the percentage ofpatients diagnosed per year reached a plateau; this trendparallels the heightened awareness of the obesity epi-demic by the public, including parents and medical per-sonnel. (20) Heightened awareness does not necessarily translate into vastly improved response, prevention, and treat-ment, as suggested by the plateau rather than decreasein prevalence of obesity in Ohio. Analogous to the chal-lenges of opposing the tobacco industry with respect tosmoking prevention and cessation, combating obesitybegins with awareness of the problem followed by asteady progression of multilayered interventions leadingto generational change. Benson and colleagues (20)found that use of automatic flagging of abnormalBMIs is insufcient to provide long-term increases indiagnostic rates; rather, more active strategies are nec-essary to encourage clinicians to diagnose pediatricobesity. Clinician Awareness and Response Similar to recognizing domestic violence, many primarycare clinicians do not know what to do once they diag-nose obesity in a pediatric patient. Besides determiningBMI, electronic medical record software can automati-cally produce a proactive response by suggesting hand-outs, action steps, and even recipes that are download-able at the time of a patient encounter if a patient has ahigh BMI. However, pediatricians may lack access tosuch resources. Communities also can improve efforts to treat obesity. For example, the Ohio Business Roundtable declaredpediatric obesity a priority issue and worked with legisla-tors, vested business partners, health professionals, chil-dren's hospitals in the state, and the state chapter of theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics to pass legislation forgreater physical activity in schools, higher nutritionalstandards in school cafeterias, and limited choices inschool vending machines. Challenges of Obesity Unfortunately, the term obesity has been used for dis-crimination and teasing and not for recognizing a diseaserequiring treatment. This lack of disease nomenclaturehas been a barrier to insurance reimbursement, withnutrition obesity Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 365 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023tertiary prevention paradoxically paid better than pri- mary prevention; it is relatively easy to have an insur-ance company pay for an adult coronary bypass in theUnited States as opposed to funding treatment for obesepatients who do not have associated comorbidities. Until2004, even Medicare payment regulations containedthe phrase, \"Obesity itself cannot be considered an ill-ness.\" (21) Proponents of the view that obesity is not adisease argue that one can be overweight yet physicallyt, but that belief should be challenged, as suggested bythe evidence that obese children as young as 10 years ofage develop atherosclerosis, at 9 years of age developtype 2 diabetes, and at earlier ages develop other comor-bidities associated with obesity. Medical Consequences of Pediatric Obesity Elevated BMI in childhood is associated with multiple comorbidities in the pediatric age group (Table 2).Blood pressure elevations can be seen in adolescence andrarely before that age. Table 3 outlines the simple posi-tive changes associated with only a small drop in BMI.(22)(23)(24)(25)(26) Table 4 delineates recommendedlaboratory assessment for overweight and obese chil-dren. (27)(28) Overweight children tend to be taller,have advanced bone ages, and mature earlier comparedwith their nonobese peers. Early puberty correlates withhigher adiposity in adulthood as well as an increase intruncal fat distribution in women. Adipose cells on the hips, once formed, last forever, and these cells increasein size more than number with age. Omental adiposecells, on the other hand, can increase in number with age.Central fat distribution, perhaps through an effect oninsulin concentrations, appears to be an important medi- Table 2.

Leptin, produced by adipocytes, is elevated in obese women, and a raised leptin value is associated with higherrates of infertility. (29) Early maturation can lead tolower self-esteem in girls, with a marked increase inunhealthy dieting behaviors. Treatment: The Pediatrician's Role As noted earlier, the rst step in the ofce setting is torecognize when overweight or obesity occurs; in simplestterms, pediatricians need to include in their practice thetracking of a patient's BMI with the same rigor applied tofollowing other growth parameters. The second step is toreact to an increasing BMI with an approach that pro-motes positive family change without decreasing thechild's or the parent's self-esteem. For example, whenconfronted at the 85th percentile and aweight percentile that is higher than the height per-centile, the pediatrician can tell an 8-year-old child,\"You are awesome, and together with your parents, weare going to keep you healthy and have your weightstay the same this year, while you keep getting taller!\"Pairing this statement with small, steady changes thatthe parent can implement with close medical follow-upevaluations tends to work better than a remonstrativeapproach. Ideally, a child in the overweight category (BMI 85th to 95th percentile) should be seen at least quarterly, withdietitian visits for both child and family to help withportion sizes, healthier choices, and positive changes infamily behaviors. Children in the obese category (BMI/H1135095th percentile) should be seen monthly, with steady change promoted in positive terms. Reimbursement re-mains a challenge, but improvements may result fromadvocacy with groups such as the American Academyof Pediatrics and the Alliance for a Healthier Genera-tion, community partnerships such as the Ohio BusinessRoundtable, and health-care organizations such as theCleveland Clinic. Interventions in the ofce setting tend not to work until the child (and parent) is ready for change; pre-mature interventions can lead to learned helplessness(\"This diet will never work\") and ongoing dieting at-tempts and disordered eating (\"Maybe this diet willwork\"). The result can be long-term weight gain andphysiologic changes supporting the disordered eating(\"Skip the diet or either overeat or undereat accord-ingly\"). In the very young child, the pediatrician requiresparents (and other family members involved in foodpreparation and portioning) to modify diet and exercise willingly to ensure success. Motivational interviewing can be used to help manage change, such as asking open-ended questions about howthe child feels about his or her weight: Has she ever beenteased about her weight or bullied, and if so, how didshe feel? What did she do at the time or after? Together,what do you think you (the child) could do the nexttime teasing or bullying happens? How and in whichways do you want your parents involved? Families canlearn active listening strategies and ways to avoidweight-related teasing in the home and to advocate forthe child at school. Family members should be encouraged to cut out their own weight-related talk and promotion of dietingwith a \"talk less, do more\" philosophy, as promoted byDr Diane Neumark-Sztainer (30)(31) and others. Asshe artfully notes, \" ...i ft h e child is not a good reader, you don't want to make them feel stupid to help themread more\" (presented in a talk to the Society for Pedi-atric and Adolescent Gynecology, Las Vegas, Nevada,April 16-18, 2010). Similarly, body dissatisfaction should not be used as a motivator for change in the obese child. Rather, obesechildren should be encouraged to feel great about them-selves, and the pediatrician should play to their strengths,working to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. Othersimple solutions include removing television sets fromthe bedrooms and limiting television and video game usefrom infancy onward. Another simple intervention isencouraging families to discourage eating in front of thetelevision or computer to stop the child (and parent)from eating more than anticipated. In the ofce setting, the pediatrician may be asked to prescribe medications to \"treat\" obesity, despite a pau-city of data on drug effectiveness in the pediatric popu-lation. Metformin has been associated with modestweight loss of 5 to 10 lb in adolescents who have insulinresistance. Orlistat, which prevents absorption of fat, hasbeen associated with some weight loss due to dietary fatmalabsorption, but the associated gastrointestinal dis-tress has limited its effective use. Sibutramine, which hasbeen approved for use in adolescents 16 years of age andolder, inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotoninand has been associated with BMI decreases of more than5% when used in combination with behavioral therapy.Diet pills, stimulant medications, and caffeine pillsshould not be prescribed because misuse increases therisks of sudden cardiac death.

Fad diets do not tend to help,and the Ornish diet, a combination of a specic life-style and a high-ber, low-fat vegetarian diet, doesnot provide the fat grams necessary for adolescent brain development. For a select few highly motivated adolescents or young adults who require more than 30 lb of weight loss,the protein-sparing modied fast, which works like amedically monitored Atkins diet with low overall en-ergy (usually 1,500 to 1,800 kcal/day), protein, and fatintake, is intended to promote ketosis and breakdown offat for energy. Adolescents monitor their urine daily forketones, with monthly blood sampling to detect electro-lyte abnormalities or uric acid elevations due to rapid lysisof fat cells. Rarely, a patient who needs to be on this dietmay require allopurinol when uric acid /H9262mol/L). protein- sparing modied fast diet has been associated withweight losses of 30 to 50 lb. Typically, a patient is on the protein-sparing modied fast diet from fall to Thanksgiving, with a dietitian allow-ing weight gain of no more than 5 or 10 lb during theholiday season; resumes the diet from New Year's day tospring break; and eats a stable diet as he or she goes offthe strict meal plan. Keys to success include monthlyphysician and dietitian visits, positive parental support,and high motivation by the adolescent. Bariatric surgery still is an extreme treatment, al- though a potentially lifesaving one, that is associated witha signicant decrease in the comorbidities of morbidobesity. (22)(23)(26) Surgical rates in adolescents havetripled from 2000 to 2003, with better outcomes re-ported by those surgeons who specialize in pediatricbariatric surgery and who perform more surgeries peryear. (33) Adolescents being considered for bariatricsurgery require pre- and postoperative medical, dietary,and psychological assessment and support to ensurehealthy long-term outcomes. Suitable surgical candi-dates must have achieved abstract thought or the abilityto foresee consequences; have the ability to followthrough with needed medical follow-up; and be fore-warned that they may need plastic surgery later for excessskin reduction, which may not be covered by health insurance in countries such as the United States. Long-term monitoring of the adolescent patient is imperativefor achieving optimal physical and psychosocial outcomes. Most successful programs for weight loss in the ofce setting are grounded in theories of behavior change, witha goal of nding the right motivation for the rightconstituency. For example, the ofce pediatrician sets agoal of small, manageable changes aimed at motivatingthe child and parent rather than following what wouldpersonally motivate the pediatrician. In our institution, key objectives for weight loss include: 1) preventing obesity as part of every routinechild health supervision visit; 2) enhancing primarycare clinicians' skills in identifying and treating over-weight and obese children, including comorbidities;3) expanding services regionally, working collabora-tively with schools and community; 4) enhancing carefor the rare teenager who needs bariatric surgery be-fore, during, and after the operation; and 5) perform-ing the outcome analyses to measure the impact of theprogram. One Center's Approach: The Cleveland Clinic Pediatric Obesity Initiative To give readers a tangible example of a current pro- gram that is evolving successfully, we share the experi-ence of the Cleveland Clinic. This program addresses anumber of the dimensions of the obesity problem andadds a community perspective. Incorporating lessonsfrom other institutions, the Cleveland Clinic developedevidence-based best practices (Fig) for treating obesity.For an ofce-based approach, the Cleveland Cliniclooked at the success of the Maine Youth OverweightCollaborative, which used a 5-2-1-0 behavioral approachto counseling in 12 pediatric ofces. Their \"Help MEGrow!\" Project proposes 5-a-day fruits and vegetables,2 hours or less of television or screen time, 1 hour ormore of exercise, and 0 sugar-sweetened beverages. Afterinitiation of the program in Maine, BMI 94% and BMI screening to 92%. Parents at the intervention sites receivedmore nutritional and exercise counseling than did non-intervention parents. Pediatricians reported improve-ments in their own skills in managing pediatric obesity.Schools in southern Maine participated in the MaineYouth Overweight Collaborative, using a resource kitcontaining strategies to promote the 5-2-1-0 goals.Teachers appreciated the tool kit but found difcultywith implementation.nutrition obesity 368 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023Similar to the Maine Youth Overweight Collabora- tive, the Cleveland Clinic pediatric obesity initiative em-braces the \"5 to GO!\" message (Table 5). The \"5 toGO!\" message was introduced gradually into the Cleve-land Clinic workplace as well as into local and statewidesites. Besides \"5 to GO!,\" the Stoplight diet (34) also wasintroduced, featuring foods associated with the colorsred, yellow, and green. Red light foods (eg, cakes, friedchicken) mean \"stay away,\" yellow light foods (eg,ground beef, dark chocolate, olive oil) mean \"proceedwith caution,\" and green light foods (eg, salmon, brownrice, mean \"GO!\". \"GO!\" foods meetthe following nutritional criteria: they contain 100%whole grain and minimal saturated fat, no trans fat,minimal added sugars and syrups, and minimal sodium.In markets and other food services, \"GO!\" foods areplaced at eye level and labeled as such with caloric/energy descriptions. In Cleveland, \"GO!\" foods now aresold commercially at the national sports team's arena andat local stores, \"GO!\" foods discounts are highlighted,and easy-to-use recipes are provided at these locales. A typical behavioral intervention at the Cleveland Clinic is identifying who is bringing the red foods intothe house; brainstorming about what red foods couldeasily be changed to yellow or green; and generatingsolutions, such as weekly meal plan- ning, packing a lunch rather thanrelying on the school lunch, or hav-ing a scavenger hunt for \"GO!\"foods in the grocery store. As noted by Lawrence and asso- ciates, (35) leading by exampleprovides a powerful means of be-havior change. At the start of the\"GO!\" foods initiative, fewer thanhalf of health-care facilities sur-veyed, including the ClevelandClinic, had started shifting awayfrom high-calorie, low-nutrient-dense vending machine options oreliminating fast food. The Cleve-land Clinic, the second largest em-ployer in Ohio, now has no transfats, no nondiet soda pop, and onlyhealthy options in its vending ma-chines and food services on its maincampus, 9 regional hospitals, and12 family health centers. All em-ployees receive free use of the t-ness facilities, with a $100 gift for going 10 times a month for 10 months; Curves\u00ae and Weight Watchers\u00ae are also freeto employees. Over the rst year, employees lost121,000 lb cumulatively, with other incentives for Figure. Components of a pediatric obesity program: the Cleveland Clinic example.

Recent advocacy efforts include coverage of benets for the offspring of families as well ascontinuing kickbacks for ongoing participation in aweight management group (Fit Youth program, based on the Epstein model (36)) that consists of 12 weeksof intervention by a dietitian, exercise physiologist, psychologist, and pe diatrician, with mandatory parental involvement plus longer-term plans for meeting quar-terly with support groups. In preliminary analysis, chil-dren and adolescents have been shown to break the cycleof gain, with achievable weight maintenance or modestweight gain. Longer analysis should help determine ef-cacy over time and the appropriate follow-up necessary tosustain family changes. School-based Interventions Schools also can promote change. In Cleveland, beforeefforts to reduce obesity began, schoolchildren couldconsume 3,500 kcal daily just through the subsidizedbreakfast and school lunch options. Packing a lunch candecrease caloric intake during the school day. In astudy of 2,774 adolescents in California, Hastert andBabey (37) found that adolescents who brought lunchfrom home 5 days a week ate less fast food, drank lesssoda pop, ate less fried potatoes and less high-sugarfoods, and consumed more fruits and vegetables com-pared with adolescents who never brought lunch toschool. Local, state, and national efforts, including the Na- tional School Lunch Program and the Alliance for aHealthier Generation, have targeted improvements inschool lunch menus. An agreement between the Alliancefor Healthier Generations and the soft drink companiespromoted the following changes: in elementary schools,soda pop is to be replaced with water and 8 oz nonsugar-sweetened 100% juice as well as fat-free and low-fatflavored and regular milk. In middle schools, the samestandards hold, with juice portions increased to 10 oz.For high schools, 50% of choices are water, with lightjuices and sports drinks that contain no more than100 kcal per container making up the other 50% (http://healthiergeneration.org). Does BMI Screening Make a Difference? BMI screening provides baseline data for evaluating var-ious interventions in the ofce, school, or communitysetting. Screening itself does not accomplish weightchange; it is the precursor to intervention. Layered inter-ventions; interventions at multiple sites, including the home, the medical home, the school, and the commu-nity; and legislative interventions are likely to promotethe generational change necessary to reverse the trends inpediatric obesity. As noted by Homer in a recent supplement to Pedi- atrics , state-specic data are needed to inform and craft local solutions, with BMI as a user-friendly tool. (38) Inone of Cleveland's inner-ring suburbs, the Lakewoodschool system analyzed BMI data, nding that the poor-est children had the highest BMIs, correlating with thelowest academic achievement (Cleveland Clinic data inpartnership with Lakewood Hospital, 2009). These nd-ings were correlated without implied causality other thanpoverty as a barrier to both academic achievement andhealthier food choices. The Lakewood community hascollaborated with the Cleveland Clinic in several efforts:1) Nutritional analysis of food content in the schools;2) Promotion of a farmer's market showcasing local pro-duce; 3) Establishing \"walking school buses\" in which parents walk children through different blocks to pro-vide a safe and more active route to school in certainneighborhoods; 4) Acquiring support by the localpolice force and school superintendents to ensure safeplaces to play; 5) Adding the \"Food is Knowledge\"program that targets kindergarten children, teachinglanguage arts, social studies, math, science, and otherparts of the curriculum by using healthy food as themedium; and 6) Adding the \"Healthy Futures\" pro-gram for 4th to 6th graders that targets healthy life-style habits, including nutrition and exercise. Theseefforts plus Ohio legislation hope to promote genera-tional change. Early detection of childhood obesity predicts better out- comes long term. In a British study, the strongest predictorfor successfully reducing BMI was younger age at time ofdiagnosis (specically elementary school age or younger)(39). In a German pediatric obesity clinic, children youngerthan 12 years of age had a fourfold greater success rate atBMI reduction than did adolescents. (40) As mentioned,although BMI screening in the pediatrician's ofce is thenatural starting place for ofce-based interventions, moreneeds to be done. In the Live, Eat, and Play (\"LEAP\") primary care randomized trials, family doctors screened and appliedsystemic interventions for children who had high BMIsin the United Kingdom, with high investment of resourcesand only modest results. (41) In the school setting, severalstates, including Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee,nutrition obesity 370 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023have routinely sent the results of BMI screening home to parents via a condential report card. In contrast, in the United Kingdom program, parents could request theirchildren's data, but the data were not routinely sent home.A recent analysis of ndings from Arkansas, (42) where theGovernor and State General Assembly mandated BMIscreening in 2003 at year 4, showed: 1) An increase in policies for school personnel con- cerning the selection of foods for school-sponsored ac-tivities and prohibiting the sale of junk foods. 2) A policy shift in schools and school districts away from using physical activity as a punishment and towardrequiring lifetime physical activities to be included inphysical education programs. 3) Increased use of certied physical education teach- ers in elementary schools. BMI screening in the pediatrician's ofce has been found to be safe and acceptable, especially if paired withrecommendations and resources that are affordable andaccessible (39)(43)(44) BMI surveillance programs, inwhich individual data are used to shape policy but are notindividually reported back to parents, are deemed saferthan BMI screening in the schools in which individualBMI report cards are shared with families. (45)(46)(47)Surveillance data provide a means to track populationchange without affecting individual students or puttingthem at risk for potential bullying, inappropriate dieting,or other negative sequelae. BMI screening in schoolsremains controversial because not every program meetsthe American Academy of Pediatrics recommendationthat screening be paired with effective, affordable treat-ment options. (45)(46)(47) Methods for screening mat-ter; use of a private room and trained personnel can avoidthe discomfort expressed previously by one third of obeseUnited States 5th through 8th graders who were publiclyscreened. Nonprivate screenings for BMI may increaseweight-related teasing, bullying, and inappropriate diet-ing behavior, leading to rebound weight gain and low-ered self-esteem. (47) The Role of the Urban Corner Store Food availability affects food choices. Some communitiesdo not have a readily available large grocery store. In astudy of 833 urban school children in 4th to 6th grades,Borradale and associates (48) found that childrenshopped at corner stores frequently, purchasing energy-dense, low-nutrient foods and drinks with an average ofmore than 1,497 kJ (356.6 kcal) per purchase. Morethan 50% of these children were eligible for free orreduced-price meals. The children spent little money on these purchases, averaging $1.07 /H110010.93 on an average of two items, usually consisting of chips, candy, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Ludwig and colleagues (49) foundthat among nearly 550 Massachusetts school childrenfrom diverse ethnic backgrounds, each additional serv-ing of sugar-sweetened beverages accounted for anincrease in both BMI and prevalence of obesity, ad-justing for anthropometric, demographic, dietary, andlifestyle variables. Children now drink 3 cups of sodapop for every 1 cup of milk, with an increase inconsumption of fast foods by many urban and subur-ban children. (50) In areas of New York City, including the Bronx and Harlem, ethnic and local neighborhood stores have beenfound to offer only whole milk; shifting offerings to skimand low-fat milk represents one small change. (51) An-other change is offering baked rather than fried chips atreduced rates in attractive packaging at eye level forchildren. One more option is having fresh produce thatis affordable. In Omaha, Nebraska, a neighborhoodfood-growing project has resulted in signicant fooddistribution of their own grown produce. Such urbangardening projects bring pride to the local children andaffect their food choices. Children in cities such as Detroit, Michigan, run after food distribution trucks adorned with pictures and play-ing music similar to local ice cream trucks, clamoring fortheir favorite homegrown fruits and vegetables. (52) Inaddition to Cleveland's Department of Public Healthneighborhood food growing project, the Cleveland Clinichas its own farmer's market that has changed urban neigh-bors' buying patterns, promoted by coupons for local pro-duce. The change has been conrmed by simple surveytools measuring the number of fruits and vegetables con-sumed and the number of family dinners per week. The Built Environment and Other Necessary Community Components Safe playgrounds, green spaces, bike paths, and \"walking school buses\" remain integral contributors to commu-nity wellness and constitute the \"built\" environment.Communities can promote tax incentives for super-market development in indigent areas, supplementinghealthy food availability with urban gardening projectsthat provide direct benets to self-esteem. In New York City, child care laws (NYC Department of Health and Mental Health, Amendment Article 47)have been enacted to prohibit television and video use forall children younger than 2 years, with a 60-minute limitnutrition obesity Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 371 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023per day on educational programs for children older than 2 years. (53)(54) New York child care centers are alsorequired to ensure 60 minutes of physical activity for allchildren, to eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages, and toprovide only 1% or skim milk. (53)(54) Community solutions require an integrated approach, with emphasis on health promotion efforts; opportuni-ties for physical activity through the built environmentand mandated in-school activities; use of certied physi-cal education instructors in schools to ensure a lifetimewellness approach with necessary skills-building; pro-vision of appealing and high-quality meals anda la carte options; stocking of nutrient-dense, low-calorie choices in vending machines and in neighbor-hood stores; and establishment of nutritional standardsfor beverages and snacks while removing supersized por-tions.

Plot BMIs and discuss with parents the signicance of the BMI with other growth curve measurements duringofce visits from infancy through childhood andadolescence. Schedule frequent visits with children who have elevated BMIs, emphasizing small, manageable changesusing motivational interviewing techniques. In growingchildren, weight maintenance alone may be a goodgoal. Write a prescription for exercise. Encourage lifetime physical activity and serve as a role model for activeplay in the community. Tips include suggesting familybowling rather than dinner and a movie, family walkswith conversation during which parents can learnmuch from their children (and vice versa), and familytennis. Promote the family dinner as many nights a week as possible. Keep mealtimes pleasant, with parents settingout offered foods in healthy portions and the childhaving some choice in which foods are served and howmuch is served per meal. In food wars, parents tend tolose; the child who is gaining and growing likely ismeeting his or her needs. Every meal does not have tobe perfect. Help families stop the \"weighty talk,\" that is, calling attention to the need for dieting. Encourage parents, schools, and communities to nd rewards other than food. Help families and schools create \"tease-free\" environments, especially because weight-related teasingstarts in the home and spreads to the community andschool, with potentially devastating effects on a child'sself-esteem. Teach media literacy to decrease the \"pester power\" of children for high-calorie, low nutrient-dense foodchoices. Join a school health advisory board or other community collaborative network to be an agent ofchange. Link with academic medical centers to help with program design and evaluation that can measureimpact and disseminate evidence-based best practicesand policies.nutrition obesity 372 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.9 September 2011 Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/32/9/363/839473/zpx00911000363.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023PIR Quiz Quiz also available online at http://www.pedsinreview.aappublications.org. 1.
