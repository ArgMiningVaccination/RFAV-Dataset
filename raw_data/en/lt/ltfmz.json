Turmeric is generally safe, but there are some potential risks to consuming it in high doses. [Turmeric](/drugs/turmeric), a classic Indian spice, has been gaining more and more attention in recent years as a natural remedy for a wide variety of health complaints. \"In the past couple of years, [turmeric] has constantly been on the lists of cool new ingredients to add to things, and more research is being done on the benefits, so I think people are picking up on that,\" says Maggie Michalczyk, RDN, the Chicago-based creator of the food and nutrition blog of [Once Upon a Pumpkin](https://www.onceuponapumpkinrd.com/). [Turmeric](//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/turmeric-curcumin-benefits-side-effects-types-more/) (Curcuma longa) is a close cousin of ginger, and is the spice responsible for curry's characteristic yellow hue. ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476200/)) This bold root has been [used for centuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522354/) in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and other traditional medicine systems to ease arthritis, reduce gas, improve digestion, and increase overall energy. ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92752/)) Today, there's preliminary research that may support some of these traditional uses. For example, one of turmeric's primary benefits is that it's a potent anti-inflammatory; a study showed it's more effective than common anti-inflammatory medications like [ibuprofen (Advil)](//www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ibuprofen) and [aspirin](/drugs/aspirin). ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15489888)) Thanks to its inflammation-fighting powers, turmeric may help treat inflammatory conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer, according to another study. ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19594223/)) Many of turmeric's potential benefits stem from a specific compound: curcumin. According to a review published in 2022, curcumin has been shown to lower inflammation, as well as improve insulin sensitivity, which plays a role in type 2 diabetes prevention. ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754684/), [6](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance)) Curcumin also contains antioxidants, which are compounds that help protect against damaging free radicals found in environmental pollutants like cigarette smoke. Overexposure to free radicals can lead to oxidative stress, or an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants, and potentially lead to diseases and health conditions like arthritis and heart disease. ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249911/)) Curcumin [has been shown](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/6/10/92) to improve systemic markers of oxidative stress, which may help protect against the damaging effects of free radicals. In other words: Turmeric (and curcumin on its own) may be a worthwhile addition to any healthy diet \u2014 whether you add it to food or take it in the form of a supplement. Here's what you need to know about the safety and recommended dosages of this popular yellow spice. Turmeric and Curcumin: How Much Is Too Much? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recognized turmeric as generally safe, and when added as a spice to foods, it's unlikely to cause adverse effects. ( [8](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=182&showfr=1)) Curcumin Dosage: What's Safe? In supplement form, though, the concentration of curcumin and other curcuminoids is significantly higher than what you get in a typical serving of ground turmeric (as high as 95 percent versus 3 percent). ( [9](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/how-does-turmeric-spice-differ-from-turmeric-curcumin-supplements/tumeric_spice_vs_supplements/)) This means a supplement with 0.5 grams (g) of turmeric extract will give you about 400 milligrams (mg) of curcuminoids, whereas 0.5 g of the ground spice will only provide about 15 mg, according to estimates from ConsumerLab, a third-party supplement testing agency. (9) In general, up to 12 g curcumin per day has been shown to be safe, but there are instances when high levels of curcumin and other curcuminoids in turmeric supplements may cause negative reactions, especially if you have certain health conditions. ( [10](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283492603_Curcumin_an_Active_Component_of_Turmeric_Curcuma_longa_and_Its_Effects_on_Health)) Groups That Should Approach Taking Turmeric With Caution A 2017 review advised approaching curcumin supplements with caution if you take [antidepressants](/antidepressants/guide/), antibiotics, [antihistamines](/antihistamine/guide/), anticoagulants, cardiac medications, or [chemotherapy](//www.everydayhealth.com/news/chemotherapy/) treatments. ( [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28734960/)) It's a good idea to check with your doctor if you're taking these (or other) medications, or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The Potential Side Effects of Turmeric and Curcumin There haven't been many studies looking at negative long-term side effects associated with taking a turmeric or curcumin supplement. But there is some evidence of potential interactions, as well as a few small studies showing short-term side effects. Turmeric May Limit Iron Absorption If you have an iron deficiency, be aware that turmeric may further limit absorption of this nutrient. A past study found that turmeric, along with chili pepper, [garlic](/drugs/garlic), shallot, and pak kyheng (a Thai leafy vegetable), reduced iron availability, or the amount of iron your body can absorb, by 20 to 90 percent. ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18651292/)) Turmeric May Interact With Blood Thinners Turmeric may strengthen the effects of blood-thinning medications, which raises your risk of bleeding. ( [13](https://www.stlukes-stl.com/health-content/medicine/33/000932.htm)) If you're currently taking [blood thinners](/news/need-know-side-effect-blood-thinners/) (including [warfarin [Coumadin]](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/coumadin), [clopidogrel [Plavix]](//www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/plavix), and aspirin), talk to your doctor before trying a turmeric or curcumin supplement. Turmeric May Lower Blood Sugar Too Much On the one hand, some research (mostly in animals) suggests that turmeric may help treat and prevent diabetes. ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3857752/)) That said, turmeric may magnify the effects of [diabetes medications](/diabetes/guide/) that lower blood sugar, increasing your risk of low blood sugar (also known as [hypoglycemia](/hypoglycemia/guide/)). More research in humans is needed. Don't take [turmeric supplements for diabetes](//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/can-turmeric-help-prevent-treat-diabetes/) without first checking with your doctor. Turmeric May Cause Kidney Stones Turmeric is high in oxalate, a chemical that's released from the body through urine. In high doses, excess oxalate can combine with calcium to form [kidney stones](/kidney-stones/guide/), according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. ( [15](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid=oxalate_urine)) A past study found that turmeric supplements significantly increased levels of oxalate in urine, and may increase the [risk of kidney stones](/kidney-stones/guide/causes/). ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18469248)) Turmeric May Lead to Nausea, Diarrhea, and Headaches Although research suggests turmeric is mostly safe, some studies have reported side effects. For example, subjects in a dose-response study reported a range of adverse events from taking 500 to 12,000 mg of curcumin. ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1434783/)) Seven of the 24 subjects reported side effects, including diarrhea, headache, skin rash, and yellow stool. Meanwhile, some patients with advanced [colorectal cancer](/colon-cancer/) reported nausea and diarrhea from taking 0.45 to 3.6 g per day of curcumin for one to four months, according to a clinical trial. ( [18](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/10/20/6847/96368/Phase-I-Clinical-Trial-of-Oral-CurcuminBiomarkers)) For reference, the Joint United Nations and World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the European Safety Authority (EFSA) place the allowable daily intake of curcumin at 0 to 3 mg per kg of body weight. (10) So, if you weigh 150 pounds (that's 68.18 kg), the maximum amount of curcumin you should take per day is approximately 205 mg, or 0.2 g. At least, according to the JECFA and EFSA. That said, the dosage used in research studies is usually higher. For example, a 2016 review of the efficacy of turmeric and curcumin in treating symptoms of arthritis found that dosages ranged from 100 to 2,000 mg per day, and doses were often taken up to 500 mg at a time. ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003001/)) How to Find a Quality Turmeric Supplement Dana Angelo White, RD, the owner of [Dana White Nutrition](https://danawhitenutrition.com/) in Fairfield, Connecticut, recommends opting for food sources over supplements whenever possible. This way, you'll ingest a wide variety of healthy nutrients \u2014 not just a single one. That said, turmeric doesn't absorb well in the body, and what it does absorb is rapidly metabolized and eliminated, [according to a review](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/6/10/92) published in 2017. (Pairing [turmeric with black pepper](/diet-nutrition/why-you-should-combine-turmeric-and-black-pepper/) can help the body properly absorb turmeric.) What's more, the unique flavor of the spice means it may not go with many dishes. \"That's where the supplement may be more desirable, or allow for a more regular consumption,\" White says. If you want to try a turmeric supplement, make sure you shop around to find one that's been third-party tested for safety. Why? The FDA doesn't require dietary supplement manufacturers to prove their products are safe or effective before sale. ( [20](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements)) Choosing a product that's been third-party tested will ensure you're getting the real deal. These are a few of the top third-party testing companies to look for on any supplement label: [NSF International](https://www.nsf.org/), [ConsumerLab](https://www.consumerlab.com/), and [USP](https://www.usp.org/). To help narrow your search, [ConsumerLab provided a roundup of its top recommendations](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/turmeric-curcumin-supplements-spice-review/turmeric/). To boost absorption, look for a turmeric supplement with piperine in it. Piperine is a compound in black pepper that's been shown to help your body absorb turmeric. In fact, piperine may increase absorption by as much as 2,000 percent, according to one study. ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9619120)) Bottom Line: Turmeric Is Mostly Safe, but Be Sure to Check With Your Doctor As a spice, turmeric can add tons of flavor to your cooking \u2014 along with anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidants to protect you against free radicals. But you may be able to reap greater benefits by taking turmeric in supplement form. Though turmeric is generally recognized as safe, it's always smart to talk with your doctor before adding a supplement to your diet, especially if you're already taking other medications. Or at the very least, make sure to mention you're taking it the next time you go in for a checkup. \"People don't necessarily tell their doctor they're taking a supplement, but it's always important to disclose that to make sure there aren't any contraindications,\" White says. Your doctor may even be able to help you figure out the ideal dosage for your health goals. Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking - Al-Suhaimi EA, Al-Riziza NA, Al-Essa RA.
