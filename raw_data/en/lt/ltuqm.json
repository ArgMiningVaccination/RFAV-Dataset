This blog post will discuss how meditation can improve energy levels and make you feel more present and alert. It will also provide some tips for getting started with meditation. Meditation is an ancient practice used by many cultures for centuries to promote physical and mental well-being. Meditation has its origins in the ancient Vedic times of India and is one of the modalities used in Ayurvedic medicine. Meditation has evolved to include various techniques and has become a tool for achieving relaxation and other desired outcomes. However, at its roots, the purpose of meditation is to connect with [one's true Self](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4895748/). Meditation can be done anywhere, at any time, and doesn't require special equipment. All you need is a quiet place to sit comfortably. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4895748/) on meditation have shown improvement in energy, mental clarity, and [physical ailments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5368208/) such as pain, blood pressure, and heart rate. It has also been helpful for gaining [energy](https://thewellnesscabinet.co/best-energy-supplements-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome) when suffering from chronic conditions. However, it is essential to note that these outcomes are only a product of the practice and focusing on energy is a powerful aspect of meditation. Meditation has evolved to include various approaches. All of them involve supporting calmness and you should choose the one that fits you best. The important thing is that you are starting, and starting IS doing. Let's go over some of the basics. Through meditation, you will provide your body and mind with an opportunity to rest and be at peace. This is naturally rejuvenating. By focusing on your breathing, the rest of the world will let go, and your body and mind will relax. You will come out of meditation with more energy and focus than you had in your session. Let's go over a beginning meditation. When you first start meditating, it is essential to keep it simple. Don't try to do too much at once or force yourself into a long session. Instead, starting with a shorter session is best. Here is an essential meditation practice to get you started: Sit comfortably with your spine straight. You can sit in a chair with your feet on the ground or cross-legged on a cushion. Focus your attention on your breath. As you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving into your lungs. Feel the air go in through your nose, down through your chest, and into your belly. As you breathe out, notice the sensation of the air moving out of your lungs. This should be rhythmic, effortless, and gentle. A good visual is to think of waves lapping on the shore as your breath moves in and out. When your mind wanders (and it will), return your focus to your breath and allow those words to live in a space. Remember that they are just thoughts and words, not material to your practice. Set a timer for your meditation. Start with five minutes and gradually increase your practice. The key to successful meditation is consistency. The more you meditate, the better the results. So, find a time that works for you and make it part of your daily routine. Meditation is powerful and can improve energy levels and help create space for peace and calmness in an otherwise chaotic world. However, finding a practice that works for you and being consistent with it is essential. By following these tips, you will be well on your way to improved energy levels.
