Acupressure treats the body as an energy system and works to relieve a person's individual symptoms by identifying and releasing 'blocked', or 'congested' energy centres in the body. Acupressure is believed to have developed in Asia over 5000 years ago and is considered to be the mother of acupuncture, in that it predates the use of needles to stimulate Chi.

The acupressure points are where vital energy commonly gets blocked on the meridians, and where you can most effectively apply the pressure to release the resulting tension, numbness or pain. As healing energy flows through the meridians, it improves blood circulation and attempts to harmonise all functions of the organs of the body. Acupressure points have a high electrical conductivity at the surface of the skin, and thus conduct and channel healing energy most effectively. This is why the most potent healing energy work uses acupressure points.
