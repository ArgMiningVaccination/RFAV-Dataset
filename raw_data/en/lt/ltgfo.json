Filter -feeding bivalve molluscs, which accumulate noroviruses in their digestive tissues, are a typical vector for human infection. RT -qPCR, the established method for human norovirus detection in food, does not allow discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viruses and can overestimate potentially infectious viral loads. To develop a more accurate method of infectious norovirus load estimation, we combined -cultivable murine norovirus. Three primer sets targeting different genome regions and diverse amplicon sizes were used to compare one-step amplification of a short genome fragment to three two -step long -range RT -qPCRs (7 kbp, 3.6 kbp and 2.3 kbp am plicons). Following initial assays performed on untreated infectious, heat -, or ultraviolet -inactivated murine noroviruses in PBS suspension, PMAxx RT -qPCRs were implemented to detect murine noroviruses subsequent to their extraction from mussel digestive tissues; virus extraction via anionic polymer -coated magnetic beads was compared with the proteinase K -dependent ISO norm. The long -range RT -qPCR process detecting fragments of more than 2.3 kbp allowed accurate estimation of the infectivity of UV -damaged murine noroviruses. While proteinase K extraction limited later estimation of PMAxx pre -treatment effects and was found to be unsuited to the assay, magnetic bead -captured murine noroviruses retained their infectivity. Genome copies of heat -inactivated m urine noroviruses differed by 2.3 log10 between RT and analysis in the -treatment allowing a closer approximation of infectious titres. The combination of bead - based virus extraction and PMAxx RT -qPCR thus p rovides a more accurate model for the estimation of noroviral bivalve mollusc contamination than the conjunction of proteinase K extraction and RT -qPCR and has the potential (once validated utilising infectious human norovirus) to provide an added measure of security to food safety authorities in the hazard assessment of potential bivalve mollusc contamination. 2 Please note that this is an author -produced PDF of an article accepted for publication following peer review.

HuNoV s 59 are also the primary cause of viral foodborne gastroenteritis worl dwide (Atmar et al. 2016) . 60 HuNoV s are frequently detected in environmental water s, contamination bein g mainly due to improperely -treated 61 sewage, floods and waste discharge (Richards, 2001) and typically contaminate raw foods such as fruit (red berries), 62 vegetables (salads) (Cook et al. 2019) , and shellfish (molluscs) (Mathijs et al. 2012; Razafimahe fa al. 63 Filter -feeding b ivalve molluscs typically bioaccumulate 100 times more pathogens than their harvesting area 64 (Burkhardt and Calci, 2000) and are frequently contaminated with noroviruses since they bind viral particles 65 contaminat ing the waters they f ilter (Le Guyader et al. 2006) . Even after 48h of depuration, noroviruses persist in 66 shellfish tissues (stomach, digestive tissues, adductor muscles, haemolymph cells) (McLeod et al. 2017) . Bivalve 67 molluscs , which are often eaten raw or only slightly cooked , are consequently often notified as contaminated with 68 HuNoVs through the European Food Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) . The genus Norovirus belongs to 69 the family Caliciviridae . According to their polymerase and complete capsid protein sequences, noroviruses 70 comprise 10 genogroups (GI to GX) and (Chhabra et al. . GI, , the new GVIII 71 (previous GII.15) and GIX are found primarily in humans (de Graaf et al. 2016) . A standardised method to extract 72 HuNoVs from bivalve molluscs consists of an enzymatic method based proteinase K -assisted extraction (ISO 73 152161: 2017) . Since the proteinase K enzymatic digestion has been shown to have an impact on the infectivity 74 of extracted virus particles (Langlet et al. 2018) , other methods have been proposed and are in use to improve the 75 recovery of infe ctious virus particles. The elution -concentration approach is commonly applied (Polo et al. 2018; 76 Stals et al. 2012) . The development of the HuNoV B cell culture system as well as the advent of human organoid 77 cultures have allowed success ful in vitro propagation of HuNoV strains (Costantini et al. 2018; Ettayebi et al. 2016; 78 Jones et al. 2014, 2015) . However, both approach es are yet too labour-intensive and complex for routine analysis . 79 3 The use of HuNoV surrogate s, such as the closely related murine norovirus ( MNV ), has thus been found useful 80 mimick HuNoV behavior (Cromeans et al. 2014) . While molecular techniques for virus detection, such as the ISO 81 15216 -1 (2017), are highly sensitive , the detection of viral genomes b y RT -qPCR is not directly correlated with 82 the presence of potentially infectious virus in a sample . Indeed this approach allow s the detection of all virus 83 particles, rendering a true infectious viral hazard assessment i mpossible. Different treatments and/or environmental 84 conditions (also food or biological variations) may impact the integrity of virus particles ; heat mainly affects the 85 viral capsid (denaturation of capsid proteins) , UV light and chlorine target the viral capsid and also the genome 86 (Nuanualsuwan and Kohn 2012) . The establishment of methods 87 that reliably detect only infectious viruses and allow the distinction between infectious and non -infectious particles 88 is needed for accurate hazard assessment of food contamination. 89 90 Focusing on both the integrity and the function of the capsid, and also the integrity of the genome provides 91 complete information on the infectivity of virus particles. Detection methods which investigate capsid integrity 92 include enzymatic pre -treatments e .g. the use of RNase prior to RT -PCR (Li et al. 2012; Nuanualsuwan and Cliver 93 2002; Topping et al. 2009) . In the case of pre -existing capsid damage, the enzyme can enter the virion and disrupt 94 internal nucleic acids, render ing particles with damaged capsids (i.e. non -infectious particles) undetectable by RT - 95 PCR. Recently, intercalating dyes have been used to differentiate potentially infectious particles with intact capsids 96 from non -infectious particles with damaged capsids. The method consists of a pre -treatment with an intercalating 97 dye, such as ethidium monoazide (EMA) or propidium monoazide (PMA), followed by RT EMA and PMA 98 are DNA - intercalating dyes with a photo -inducible azide group that covalently cross -links to DNA through 99 visible -light photoactivation. If a viral capsid is intact, EMA or PMA cannot penetrate into virus particles; damaged 100 particles, however, become permeable. Once EMA or PMA has entered the virus particle, the photo -inducible 101 azide group can cova lently cross -link the viral genome; in the case of RNA viruses, PMA is postulated to 102 intercalate secondary structures produced by genome folding. The RNA -PMA complex cannot be amplified during 103 the subsequent RT -PCR assay. PMA has of norovirus genome copies by 104 approximately a 1 log 10 reduction after five -minute heat treatments of 72\u00b0C (Karim et al. 2015) , by a log 10 reduction 105 factor of 3.6 after one -minute-treatments of 90\u00b0C (Lee et al. 2015) , and by a log 10 reduction factor of 0.67 after 106 exposure to 65\u00b0C for ten minutes (Leifels et al. 2015) . Differences i n PMA treatment efficacy and poor 107 repeatability of assays are probably due to the fact that different subsets of primers (differing amplicon lengths 108 and positions on the viral genome) amplify fragments with varying complexities of RNA secondary structures that 109 present differently potent targets to the intercalating agent (Manuel et al. 2018) . Recently, the enhanced version of 110 PMA, PMAxx , has been demonstrated to have the same spectral properties as PMA and to be more effective 111 than PMA at infectious versus non-infectious discrimination by viability PCR (Randazzo et al. 2016, 2018) . 112 113 Here, the objective is to determine whether the use of different primer set s in otherwise comparab le assays yields 114 varying results as regards the effect of an intercalating pre -treatment and whether PMAxx pre-treatment before 115 RT-qPCR analysis can improve the accuracy of the assay in predicting viral infectivity . We compared the detection 116 of short MNV genome fragment s in a simple Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) matrix by one-step RT-qPCR with 117 long fragment analysis using a poly(T) primer for RT subsequent to PMAxx treatment . We further performed a 118 one-step RT-qPCR in conjunction with a primer set target ing a 159 bp long amplicon. This RT -qPCR process was 119 4 then implemented to detect MNV extracted from a complex matrix (mussels' digestive tissues (DTs)). An 120 extraction method based on using magnetic beads coated with an anionic polymer was proposed and was compared 121 to the gold standard to recover a higher quantity of infectious particles from the complex matrix (fig. 1) . 122 123 Material s and method s 124 Cells and viruses 125 Cell culture 126 RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB -71) and HeLa cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% of CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified (BioWhittaker), 128 2% of an association of penicillin (5000 SI units/ml) and streptomycin (5 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) and 1% HEPES 129 buffer (pH 7. 6) Viruses 132 MNV isolate MNV -1 CW1 (Thackray et al., 2007) in RAW 264.7 cells. Mengovirus (MgV) 133 vMC 0, a mutant strain deleted for the poly(C) tract of its 5' non -coding region was propagated in HeLa cells 134 (Martin et al. 1996) . The initial MOI used for propagations was 0.05; following a 3 -day incubation, flasks were 135 subjected to three freeze -thaw cycles. To remove cell debris, cultured MNV and MgV suspensions were 136 centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 x g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and were purified over 137 a 5 mL sucrose cushion for 1.5 h at 23000 x g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were then discarded and virus pellet s were 138 suspended in PBS and kept at -80\u00b0C. 139 140 Titration of viruses (TCID 50 assay) 141 Infectivity of virus samples was determined via TCID 50 assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96 -well plate at a 142 concentration of 4.104 cells per well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for at least 2 h before infection. 143 Serial ten-fold virus dilutions were prepared and added to the wells (50 \u00b5L/well) . After 2 -3 days of incubation, 144 cytopathic effects (CPE) were evaluated under a microscop e. Infectious titres were calculated according to the 145 method by Reed and Muench (1938) and were express ed as TCID 50/mL. Each sample was analy zed three times 146 (technical replicate s). 147 148 Reagents 149 20mM propidium monoazide viability dye ) was purchased from Biotium (Biotium Inc., 150 Hayward, CA, USA). The s urfactant Triton X -100 (Triton) was purchased from Sigma -Aldrich. 151 152 Inactivation treatment s 153 Heat inactivation 154 For heat treatment, sealed tubes containing 400-500 \u00b5L of virus suspension were immersed in a 90\u00b0C hot water 155 bath for 2 min and were directly cooled on ice. 156 157 UV light inactivation 158 For UV -treatment, MNV aliquots (400-500 \u00b5L) were irradiated for 1 h with an R -52 Grid Lamp (UVP) which 159 emits a uniform 254 nm UV source of high -intens ity (200 -250 V, 50/60 Hz, 45 AMPS). 160 5 161 Processing of mussels 162 Bioaccumulation 163 Fresh mussels ( Mytilus edulis ) were purchased at a local fish shop. Once arrived in the laboratory, mussels were 164 directly immersed in a tank containing 4 -5 L of natural sea water with continuous aeration using a bubble stone 165 fixed to an air pump (Shega Prima). The room temperature was kept at 18\u00b0C. Dead mussels were discarded ; 166 mussels were considered dead if they floated in the tank, if they did not open within minutes after immers ion in 167 sea water, or if they did not close their valve as a response to manual pressure when outside the water. Mussels 168 were kept for 24 h in their new environment before addition of a suspension of infectious or UV -inactivated MNV 169 at a final concentration of ~107 TCID 50/mL or zero TCID 50/mL respectively of mL of live 170 phytoplankton ( Nannochloropsis ; Colombo, Netherlands) were added simultaneously to stimulate the 171 bioaccumulation process . 172 173 Dissection 174 Mussels dissected before bioaccumulation were used as negative control s; the remaining mussels were dissected 175 after 24 h of bioaccumulation. The adductor muscle was first cut to open the mussels, then digestive tissues (DTs) 176 were removed, finely chopped, aliquoted (1 g/tube) , and stored at -80\u00b0C before virus extraction. 177 178 Optimisation of virus extraction 179 A bead -based virus extraction approach was compared to the proteinase K -dependent method described in ISO 180 standard 15216 -2. Virus extraction experiments were performed in triplicate. MgV was used t o validate extraction 181 method efficiency. MgV CM 0 (107 TCID 50/mL) were seeded per aliquot of mussel DT before extraction with 182 proteinase K . The latter approach consist ed of incubating the mixture of DT and proteinase K (100 \u00b5g/mL) for 60 183 min at 37 \u00b0C, follo wed by 15 min at 60 \u00b0C. The mixture was then centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 x g. 184 185 The magnetic bead assay was developed using 300 nm diameter viro-adembeads coated with were in 1 mL of 187 PBS using a TissueLyser system ; DTs were shaken together for 2 min with a 5 mm stainless steel bead at 30 Hz 188 (QIAGEN) , homogenates were subsequently centrifuged (5 min at 3000 x g). Simultaneously, 50 \u00b5L of viro- 189 adembeads were washed twice with binding buffer and once with PBS . The supernatant was then incubated with 190 50 \u00b5L of washed viro-adembeads for 20 min at room temperature (RT) with slow rotation. The virus -bead 191 conjugates were washed once with 200 \u00b5L PB S and resuspended in 750 \u00b5L PBS. 192 193 PMAxx -treatment prior to RT -qPCR 194 Initially, three concentrations of PMAxx , 200, 300 and 400 \u00b5M, were tested. PMAxx was added at a selected 195 final concentration into each virus suspension, followed by 15 min of incubation in a dark room and activation 196 using a PhAST blue Photo -Activation System for Tubes (GenIUL) for 15 min. 197 Triton was added to PMAxx at 0.5% to enhance the entry of PMAxx into virus particl es with only partially 198 compromised capsid s. The performance s of PMAxx and PMAxx -triton were compared. Reduction of genome 199 6 copies obtained after PMAxx (-triton) treatment was compared with untreated -PMAxx samples . Infectivity 200 and genome copies were determined as described above. 201 202 Detection limit of the magnetic beads assay 203 The determination of the detection limit of the magnetic beads assay was performed using tenfold serial dilutions 204 of the homogenates obtained after homogeni sation and centrifugation in PBS prior to the magnetic beads capture 205 and followed by RNA extraction and RT -qPCR analysis as described below . 206 207 Optimisation of PCR conditions 208 Viral RNA extraction 209 RNA was extracted from 140 \u00b5 L purified viral suspension using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen , 210 Valencia, CA , USA ) following manufacturer's The nucleic acid was eluted in 60 \u00b5L elution buffer 211 and stored at -20\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. 212 213 Quantitative RT -PCR and rational e for primer design 214 Of the t hree primer sets used for comparison , two primer sets were selected from MNV PMA studies in the 215 literature according to their target region localisation , size and minimum free energy (Supplementary Table 1). 216 Both 159 and 70 primer sets target the open reading fram e 1 (ORF1 R1 primer set , previously implemented by Mathijs et al. (2010) , target s the 218 ORF1 to the 5' genome end (389 -472). According to RNAfold secondary structure predictions 219 (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi -bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi ), the minimum free energy of the three targe ted 220 regions is between -38.09 and -21.80 kcal/mol . Since the primer sets target three different regions, the RT -qPCR 221 with a long -range RT allows the detection of different product sizes. 222 The RT -qPCR was performed using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with TaqMan 223 probes . For two -step reaction s, cDNA was generated using a poly -A primer starting at the 3'end of the genome 224 using the Superscript III (Invitrogen) kit with 7.5 \u00b5L of RNA and 12. 5 \u00b5L of reaction mix. The qPCR was then 225 performed with 3 L of cDNA and 7 L of reaction mix containing the iScript Supermix (Bio -Rad) and 0.2 \u00b5M 226 of each primers and probe. The RT -qPCR one-step reaction was performed with a n iTaq Universal Probes One - 227 Step Kit (BioRad) in a 10 \u00b5L reaction volume containing 3 \u00b5L of RNA template, 0. 2 \u00b5M each of forward and 228 reverse primer and 0.2 \u00b5M of probe ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Each sample was amplified in triplicate. 229 Genomic detection of MgV MC 0 for extraction efficiency was carried out with an iTaq Universal Probes One - 230 Step Kit (BioRad) (Supplementary Table 1 ). The Ct valu e of each sam ples was compared with the Ct value of the 231 positive control used during the extraction experiment. The efficiency was calculated using the formula E= 10( ) 232 where E is the efficiency, with an acceptable limit of 1% (ISO 15216_1, 2017) . 233 The cycling conditions for the one-step reaction were as follow s: 55\u00b0C for 10 min, 95\u00b0C for 1 min, and 35 cycles 234 of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 40 s . Two-step cycling was performed as follow s: RT 1st step: 65\u00b0C for 5 min; RT 235 2nd step: 55\u00b0C for 1 h and 70\u00b0C for 15 min and PCR: 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 236 40 s. 237 7 The standard curves for the molecular detection of MNV with different primer set s were performed using MNV 238 RNA of known concentration (Quant -iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit; Molecular Probes, Inc., Invitrogen ). All 239 standard curve assays were performed using Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Instrument . 240 PCR inhibitors , that might either underestimate or prevent detection of viruses, were detected by amplifying the 241 external control (EC or in vitro transcribed RNA). Partial MNV ORF 1 (nucleotides 3727 to 3885 ) was cloned in to 242 a pGMT easy vector (Promega). Following vector t ransfor mation into and recovery from Escherichia coli DH5 243 competent cells, in vitro transcr iption of linearized plasmid samples was performed using the HiScribe T7 Q uick 244 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (BioLabs). After DNase treatment, RNA was purified and quantified using the 245 Quant -iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). 246 An equal volume of EC of 105 copies and sample were mixed and amplified in a one -step reaction. The difference 247 of Ct was obtained by subtracting the Ct value of sample mixed with EC to Ct value of EC. The inhibition was 248 calculated using the formula I= 110( ) where I is the inhibition ; an inhibition superior to 75% was not 249 accepted. 250 251 Data analysis 252 Means and standard deviations were calculated for each sample group, and were represented graphically using 253 GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 software. The number of genomic copies were analysed using a two -way ANOVA for 254 repeated measurements (after norma lization of the data using a log 10 transformation), the two factors being 255 PMAxx treatment or extraction method and RT -qPCR process. P -values < 0.05 were considered significant. 256 257 Results 258 Optimisation of PMAxx -RT-qPCR assay for the selective detection of infectious MNV in PBS 259 Standard curves were performed using three primer sets . The detection limits (LoD) of the respective assays were 260 196 copies/mL for primers, 208 copies/mL for 159 primers, and 112 copies/mL for 70 prim ers (Supplementary 261 fig. 1 ). 262 The performance of different concentrations of PMAxx (200, 300 and 400 \u00b5M), a viability PCR dye known to 263 be more efficient than PMA, was compared on PBS suspension samples of untreated MNV , MNV inactivated with 264 temperatures of min , and MNV inactivated via 1h exposition to UV light. A subsequent RT -qPCR 265 analysis was performed with the three different primer sets to compare a one -step RT -qPCR to a two -step RT - 266 qPCR with long range RT. The efficiency of PMAxx intercalat ion was demonstrated with naked MNV RNA, 267 extracted from whole virus suspension (fig. 2A). 268 For non -inactivated MNV, the genomic copy values obtained via the two -step approach with primer R1 of 269 infectious MNV without PMAxx were the most similar to the infectious titre of 107 TCID 50/mL (fig . 2B). With 270 two -step RT -qPCR with long -range RT, genome copy numbers declined gradually the further the primer set 271 was localised from the 3' genome end; this difference was significant for PMAxx -untreated samples and those 272 treated with PMAxx at 200 \u00b5M and 300 \u00b5M (fig. 2B). the two -step RT -qPCR assay, genome cop y 273 values were constant in the one -step RT -qPCR assay performed with R1 and 159 primer s; a log 10 reduction factor 274 of 0.5 was observed with primer set 70 as compared to primer set 159 (fig. 2B). The difference between the one - 275 step assay and the long -range -RT-linked two -step approach was greater the further the primers were located 276 8 upstream of the 5' end. This was significant for all assays, with a log 10 reduction factor of 2 .7 to 3 for the R1 primer 277 set (fig. 2B). 278 279 Genome copies of heat -inactivated MNV r emained detectable by both RT -qPCR approaches. While h eat- 280 inactivation had no significant effect on genome detection via one -step RT -qPCR , it significan tly influenced 281 detection two-step -qPCR assays (fig. 2B & 2C). Genome copy number s as quantified by one -step approach 282 with primer sets R1 and 159 were significantly higher compared with the two -step approach for almost all assays; 283 genome copy numbers decreased when the primer set was close to the 3' end. In contrast, for the RT -qPCR with 284 long-range RT approach, genome copy numbers progressed inversely (fig. 2C). However, no significant difference 285 was observed between the three primer sets in the one -step approach or in the two -step approach for all assays, 286 except for a log 10 reduction factor of 0.5 of primer set 70 in comparison with primer set 159 in the one -step process. 287 Genomic copy numbers decreased significantly in conjunction with PMAxx treatment for all PMAxx 288 concentrations in all RT -qPCR processes (2 to 2.5 log 10 reduction with one-step process and 2.5 to 3.5 log 10 289 reduction with two-step process ) (fig. 2C). 290 291 UV-inactivated MNV genome s were detectable by long-range RT -linked qPCR using primers R1 and 159, 292 which allowed the reverse transcription of 7 kbp and 3 .6 kbp of RNA respectively, with or without PMAxx 293 treatment (fig . 2D). PCR -positive signal s were obtained with all three primers in the one-step process and with 294 primer set 70 in the two-step process ; a significant reduction of genome copies ( 3 log 10) was observed compared 295 with non -inactivated MNV (fig. 2D). The difference between R1 and 159 and also between 159 and 70 primers 296 utilised in the one-step process without PMAxx was significant. After PMAxx treatment, the same level of 297 genome cop ies was observed for all PMAxx concentrations with the one-step RT -qPCR using the t hree primer 298 pairs and the two-step RT -qPCR with primer set 70. However, reductions of genome copy value s after PMAxx 299 treatment in conjunction with the one-step process and primer sets R1 and 70 were significant (fig. 2D). 300 301 In summation, v ariation s in PMAxxTM concentration had no significant effect on detection of MNV in PBS 302 suspension. Genome quantifi processes . While PMAxx pre -treatment did not completely remove RT -qPCR signal s of heat-inactivated 304 MNV in either the one -step or two -step assay (absence of infectious particles was confirmed via TCID 50), the 305 decrease in genome copies was higher for the two-step process . The long -range RT -qPCR capable of detecting 306 fragments of more than 2.3 kbp allowed accurate estimation of infectivity of UV -damaged MNV. Although 307 PMAxxTM pre-treatment affect s detection of UV -inactivated MNV when quantified with one -step RT -qPCR 308 process using R1 and 70 primer sets, this is not the case for primer set 159. 309 310 Performance of beads assay for the recover y of MNV in PBS 311 The efficiency of the magnetic beads -based recovery was first test ed in a preliminary assay on infectious MNV in 312 PBS. The three test conditions allowed detection of infectious MNV in PBS without significant d ifference of 313 genome copy values ( Supplementary fig. 2). Subsequent exp eriment s on infectious and inactivated MNV in PBS 314 demonstrated that the anionic beads captured either infectious or heat- and UV -inactivated MNV in PBS 315 (Supplementary fig. 3). 316 9 317 Performance of beads assay for the recover y of MNV bioaccumulated in mussel DT s compared with 318 proteinase K approach 319 After the performance of anionic beads was demonstrated in PBS, this method was compared with the proteinase 320 K approach for MNV extraction fr om mussel DTs . It was tested in conjunction with t wo RT -qPCR approaches 321 and three different primer sets. All s amples extracted following the p roteinase K method showed valid extraction 322 efficiencies between 2% and 10% . Prior to virus capture, a homogenisation step based on grinding in a bead beating 323 system was performed. Th e homogen isation step did not cause an y detriment to virus infectivity, as tested on MNV 324 in PBS (data not shown) . Genome copies quantified subsequent to proteinase K extraction via one-step RT-qPCR 325 with primer sets 159 and 70 were significantly higher (1.2 log 10) than those measured subsequent to bead -based 326 extraction . However, contrary to proteinase K extraction, the bead -based assay allowed detection of infectious 327 particles (fig. 3). Genome copies could be quantified by two -step process with primer set 70 in all assays. 328 Unexpectedly , detection with primer sets 159 and 70 via two-step process with long -range RT was no t effective 329 (fig. 3). The difference between the one-step and two -step processes was significa nt for almost all assays (fig. 3). 330 331 Regarding the two conditions of the beads assay (50 \u00b5L beads - 20 min and 25 \u00b5L - 40 min) , there was no 332 significant difference between two different assays. According to these results, the beads assay condition of 50 \u00b5L 333 and incubation of 20 min at RT followed by a o ne-step RT -qPCR process with the 159 primer set (which per its 334 design yields the longest amplicon ) were applied to detection of MNV extracted from mussel DTs. The one-step 335 RT-qPCR process with primer set 159 was implemented to determine the detection li mit of the magnetic beads 336 assay. The assay was performed on homogenates of bioaccumulated virus to simulate the binding of virus particles 337 to DT tissues. Tenfold serial dilution s realised in PBS showed the lowest detectable concentration of virus captured 338 by the beads to be 300 genome copies per gram (gc/g) DTs. The first dilutions in the series showed the beads to 339 be saturated, this most probably by impurities from the homogenates (Supplementary fig. 4). 340 341 In summary, more efficient extraction of intact infective MNV was achieved implementing the novel bead -based 342 assay than the proteinase K -based ISO norm protocols. The bead -based virus extraction and subsequent one -step 343 RT-qPCR with primer set 159 were applied to test the efficacy of PMAxx to selectively detect infectious MNV. 344 345 Efficacy of PMAxx -RT-qPCR assay for the selective detecti on of infectious MNV bioaccumulated in 346 mussel DTs 347 The first step for the detection of MNV bioaccumulated in mussel DTs was UV-inactivated MNV were inoculated in seawater during bioaccumulation experiments, then heat -inactivation 349 were performed on supernatants of mussel DTs during extraction. Treatments with PMAxx (300 \u00b5M) and 350 PMAxx (300\u00b5M) combined with 0.5% Triton were performed. Results for non -inactivated MNV showed that 351 PMAxx assays did not significantly affect the signal for both extraction methods (fig. 4A). Either PMAxx or 352 PMAxx combined with Triton did not allow a signal reduction of heat - and UV - inactivated MNV after 353 proteinase K extraction (fig. 4B & 4C). However, a pre -treatment with PMAxx or PMAxx combined with 354 Triton significantly reduced (2 .3 log 10) the signal of heat -inactivated MNV after magnetic beads assay (fig. 4B). 355 No difference in signals was observed between PMAxx alone or PMAxx combined with Triton for heat- 356 10 inactivated MNV (fig. 4B). All signals observed for UV -inactivated MNV extracted by magnetic beads assay were 357 very close to the limit of detection (fig. 4C). 358 359 In conclusion, bead -based MNV extraction prior to PMAxxTM -RT-qPCR analysis permitted a 2.3 log 10 genome 360 reduction of heat -inactivated MNV; no such reduction was observed with proteinase K extraction. 361 362 Discussion 363 The assessment of public health risks with regard to the detection o f norovirus particles from food is hampered 364 both by the lack of a method allowing either the detection of exclusively intact virus particles and/or the 365 discrimination between infectious and non -infectious viruses, as well as the la ck of a standardised method 366 permitting the extraction of intact virus particles from food matrices (a prerequisite to subsequent determination 367 of infectivity) . 368 369 Here we determine improved experimental conditions for a molecular method permitting an as accurate as possible 370 distinction between infectious and non -infectious (inactivated) norovirus particles and, in a second step, present a 371 novel assay f or the extraction of infectious noroviruses from bival ve mollusc matrices , 374 Pre-treatments with intercalating agents PMA/PMAxx , tested in conjunction with different PCR kits, different 375 primer sets, and varying concentrations of intercalating dye, have previously r endered significantly deviant 376 estimations of norovirus genom e copy numbers (Karim et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2015; Leifels et al. 2015; Randazzo 377 et al. 2018) . To investigate the impact of the different assay conditions and to develop a standardised method of 378 norovirus genome copy estimation , we tested three different primer set s (selected from pertinent literature) in 379 conjunction with two RT -qPCR processes (one-step versus two-step with long range RT ), and three PMAxx 380 concentrations to detect MNV in PBS. To model capsid and genome damage (which may occur during treatment 381 at var ious stages of the food chain) and their respective effect on detection efficacy, capsid -damaging heat- and 382 genome -damaging UV treatments were applied to MNV samples prior to the various RT-qPCR 385 permitted a closer approximation of genome copy numbers and true infectious virus MNV titres than a simple RT- 386 qPCR; heat-treated and untreated MNV copy numbers were identical without PMAxx pre-treatment, heat- 387 treated MNV copy numbers showed a log 10 reduction factor of 2 to 3.5 compared with those of untreated MNV 388 with PMAxx pre-treatment . While the PMAxx -RT-qPCR assays were not completely able to distinguish 389 infectious from non -infectious particles (TCID 50 assays showed heat treatment to have completely inactivated 390 MNV suspended in PBS ), the PMAxx pre-treatment thus presented a significant improvement to a simple RT- 391 qPCR assay by eliminating 2 to 3 .5 log 10 MNV particles with damaged capsids from the equati on and rendering 392 them undetectable by RT-qPCR. Varying concentrations of PMAxx had no significant effect on genome copy 393 numbers , a concentration of 200 \u00b5M being sufficient for the pre -treatment of MNV prior to RT -qPCR. However, 394 the RT -qPCR process following PM AxxTM can influence genome reduction. Differing genome copy reductions 395 repor ted in the current literature are consequently probably not attributable to fluctuations in intercalating dye 396 11 concentrations (a range of PMA concentrations of 100 to 348 \u00b5M has previously been tested (Karim et al. 2015; 397 Kim and Ko 2012; Lee et al. 2015; Leifels et al. 2015) , but are due to the use of differing primer sets and RT - 398 qPCR assay conditions. 399 400 In contrast to heat -treatment, which acts upon the viral capsi d, UV -inactivation typically affects the virus genome 401 more strongly . Consequently, it is unsurprising that viral genome copy numbers of UV -treate d viruses are typically 402 not affected by PMA treatment ; UV -treated viruses, while remaining impermeable to PMA, are nevertheless 403 rendered non -infectious (Karim et al. 2015; Leifels et al. 2015) . No g enome copies were detected post UV 404 treatment when the assay was performed with primer pairs R1 (7kbp) and 159 (3.6kbp), in which the RT step 405 served to reverse transcribe a cDNA fragment of 7kbp and 3.6kbp, respectively. However, when primer set 70 (2.3 406 kb cDNA) was implemented, 104 genome copies were detected as quantified via one-step RT -qPCR with primer 407 set 159. The one-step approach with primer sets R1 and 70 led to the detection of ~106 genome copies of UV - 408 inactivated MNV ; meanwhile MNV was rendered non-infectious (as measured by TCID 50 assay). T he differences 409 in detection of UV-damaged RNA becam e more pronounced with the increase of fragment size during the two- 410 step process , this is in line with Li et al. (2014) and Wolf et al. (2009) . To distinguish between non-infectious and 411 potentially infectious virus particles, a RT-qPCR assay can thus not rely on interacting -pre-treatments but must 412 inher ently allow for such a distinction; l onger fragment size , permitting a better estimation of genome integrity 413 may be utilised towards this end. Here, w e showed that the pri mer pair 159, targeting a 159 bp long genome 414 fragment , was able to more accurately predict RNA degradation than either primer pair 70 (amplicon length: 70 415 bp) or R1 (amplicon PMAxx pre-treatment in one-step RT -qPCR . We attribute this to 416 the fact that amplification between forward and reverse 159 primers (covering more genome at approximately 417 double the amplicon length of the other primer sets), was more likely to be interrupted at UV -mediated genome 418 breakages. Surprisingly, the observed differences were not conserved in combination with PMAxx treatment; 419 the genome copy overestimation of primer pairs 70 and R1 was levelled out subsequent to PMAxx treatment 420 and found to be at the same level as 159 primer set genom e copy values. We suggest that this effect may be due to 421 the fact that UV -treated viruses were , in fact, not only damaged at the level of their genome ( genome damage was 422 not picked up on using small amplicon sizes in a RT-qPCR), but were also compromised a t the level of their 423 capsids. PMAxx pre-treatment , additionally investigating capsid integrity thus permitted an estimation of MNV 424 copy numbers that more closely corresponded to true infectivity values . 425 426 To allow for an estimation of viral infectivity of viruses transmitted via food matrices, extraction of these viruses 427 from their vector must proceed in a way that does not damage the virus before it can be analysed. Proteinase K 428 extraction, the current ISO norm for the extraction of noroviruses from food (ISO 15216 1: 2017) , is known to 429 impact the infectivity of extracted viruses (Langlet et al. 2018) . Here, we confirm that bioaccumulated MNV 430 extracted from mussel DTs via proteinase K extraction is indeed inactivated by the extraction p rocedure itself. To 431 address this issue, a novel assay for the extraction of infectious MNV from bivalve mollusc matrices was developed; 432 this method, based on magnetic beads coated with anionic polymer , permits extraction of intact virus particles, 433 representing a significant advantage over current proteinase -K based -extraction methods , which damage viral 434 capsids, thus precluding downstream assays t o determine viral infectivity. Anionic polymer -coated bea ds have 435 previously been demonstrated to capture different enveloped and non -enveloped from a range of matrices , 436 12 including cell culture media, PBS, water, oyster homogenate , and seawater (Hatano et al. Onodera 2012; Toldr\u00e0 et al. 2018) . Here, we demonstrate the capacity of anionic beads to 438 capture infectious or inactivated MNV in PBS and from mussel DT s. While fewer genom e copies were detected 439 following magnetic bead -based extraction than proteinase K extraction (1 .2 log 10), the infectivity of captured 440 virus es was retained , a prerequisite for the assessment of public health risks due to infectious virus burdens . The 441 detection limit of the assay was determined to lie around 300 gc/g DTs , coinciding with virus quantities typically 442 contained in shellfish samples (102 to 104 gc/g DTs (Stals et al. 2012) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the 443 first report using anionic magnetic beads to extract noroviruses from bivalve surrogate . Polymer -coated magnetic beads are negatively charged, rendering them, in theory , 445 ineligible for the binding of negatively charged MNV particles with an isoelectric point between 3 and 4 (Bri\u00e9 et 446 al. 2017) . While other parameters must be involved in the successful interaction with MNV , these are as yet 447 unknown. Similar genome copy values were obtained with all the three primer sets in conjunction with in the one - 448 step process following both proteinase K - and bead -based virus extraction; no genome copies were detected with 449 primer sets R1 and 159 in the long -range RT a nd qPCR following magnetic bead -based virus extraction. Overall, 450 we judge a one -step PMAxx RT -qPCR utilising primer set 159 to amplify a large genome section to be the assay 451 most suitable to provide an improved estimation of genome copy numbers correspond ing to potentially infectious 452 virus loads. While a further augmentation of amplicon sizes might increase assay precision and permit a closer 453 approximation of true infectious virus titres, this is limited by restrictions inherent to RT -qPCR protocols. A mor e 454 pronounced RT -qPCR signal decrease, as achievable in a two -step process , may make for a more closer 455 approximation of infectious titres, however two -step RT -qPCRs are typically time -consuming and may increase 456 the risk of contamination during a routine analysis. These observations may serve as a benchmark for the 457 development of similar assays for HuNoV de tection; we propose that magnetic bead -based virus extraction should 458 be succeeded by a one -step PMAxx RT -qPCR amplifying an as large as possible (within the confines of qPCR 459 design) amplicon. 460 461 Since infectivity of extracted viruses was retained via magnet ic bead extraction , the distinction of infectious and 462 non-infectious virus particles was investigated with PMAxx pre-treatment in downstream assays . To account 463 for possible difficulties associated with a more complex matrix, PMAxx treatments post MNV extraction were 464 supplemented by the addition of surfactant Titron X -100, as previously described for rotavirus and hepatitis A 465 virus analyses (Coudray -Meunier et al. 2013; Moreno et al. 2015) . To further account for increased sample 466 complexity and density (likely presence of debris remaining in virus suspension and possibility o f interference 467 with PMAxx intercalation) the PMAxx concentration was augmented to 300 \u00b5M. 468 469 Discrimination between untreated or heat -inactivated MNV extracted from bioaccumulated mussels was not 470 possible either via PMAxx or PMAxx -triton RT-qPCR after proteinase K extraction , however genome copies 471 were detected at high levels simple line with Randazzo et al. (2018) . In contrast, t he bead -based extraction method and subsequent PMAxx 473 or PMAxx -triton RT-qPCR indicated heat -treatment effects by a loss of 2 .3 log 10 genome copies of heat -treated 474 MNV in comparison to untreated samples . Thus, ~105 gc/g DTs were detected both in untreated and heat -treated 475 samples in a simple RT-qPCR, meanwhile ~104 and ~103 gc/g DTs , were detected in untreated and heat -treated 476 13 sample, respectively, in a PMAxx RT-qPCR. Addition of PMAxx or PMAxx -triton, did not make a 477 difference to the detection of UV-inactivated non-infectious MNV following proteinase K extraction , further 478 suggesting that viral capsids are no so significantly affected by proteinase K as to render viruses permeable to 479 PMAxx post extraction. We attribute the loss of viral infectivity observed post proteinase K extraction to a 480 change in capsid surface conformation ( attachment factors, receptors , e.g. ) rather than complete capsid damage in 481 terms of permeability. The advantage of b ead-based method may thus not be only attributable to the fact that it is 482 not a damaging approach, but rather a more stringently purifying one, removing traces of cellular debris from later 483 RT-qPCR reactions. This is supported by recent studies by (Sarmento et al. 2020) which demonstrated that 484 proteinase K HuNoV extraction from naturally contaminated biva lve molluscs, followed by PMAxx treatment, 485 and then magnetic bead RNA extraction, allowed discrimination of infectious and non -infectious HuNoV particles 486 via RT-qPCR (genom e copy numbers reduced by up to 3 log 10 in a PMAxx qPCR assay as opposed to a simp le . The present study utilises the murine norovirus model, which, albeit long considered suitable surrogate to 488 model human norovirus tenacity (Cannon et al. 2006; Cromeans et al. 2014) , remains a model and as such may 489 present inherent fallacies. T he true ability of the bead -based extraction method combined with PMAxxTM-RT- 490 qPCR to distinguish infectious and non -infectious human noroviruses is yet unknown and remains to be tested 491 against potentially infectious human noroviruses particles in conjunction with a system able to measure their 492 infectivity or lack thereof . 493 494 Conclusion 495 In conclusion , the detection of viral genome s via one-step or two -step RT-qPCR with long -range RT process es 496 may highly differ depending on sample treatment. We show that assays aiming at detecti on of the entire genome 497 allow a better assessment of RNA integrity post UV treatment . We describe the development of an improved one - 498 step PMAxx RT-qPCR for discrimination between heat -treated, UV -treated, and untreated viruses. Furthermore, 499 we demonstrate a novel magnetic bead -based method for MNV extraction from bivalve mollusc s matrices, 500 permitting better downstream discrimination between heat -treated and untreated viruses. This extracti on method, 501 combined with the described PMAxx RT-qPCR assay, has the potential be a valuable tool for future detection 502 of infectious noroviruses , permitting more accurate assessment of viral hazards from bivalve molluscs, and other 503 food matrices. In futur e steps, the magnetic bead -based method may further be improved by coating with anti - 504 norovirus antibodies - or porcine gastric mucin, which have a high affinity with HuNoV. 505 506 References 507 Atmar, R.
