Personally, I've adopted an extensive regime of taking >30 supplements daily over the last couple of years to improve health, sleep, hormone levels, looks and mental performance. It has helped me to become a better version of myself and perform better in many aspects of life. With this article I hope to inspire some of you to follow my path. Introduction If you have seen the movie Limitless, you'll know it's about a struggling writer, played by Bradley Cooper, who experiments with a new drug allowing him to use 100% of his brain. He becomes superhuman, so to speak, and can solve any task with mind-blowing ease. What if I told you it's possible to do that yourself \u2014 in real life? This summer, I've partied 12 days in a row in Mykonos with barely any signs of hang-overs, like someone in his late teens. Medically, I have the body of someone in his early 20s, similar to the physically younger body elite athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo [have](https://www.thesportsman.com/features/sleep-squats-small-meals-the-secrets-of-ronaldo-s-age-defying-fitness-regime). For example, I constantly get compliments on my skin, which has no signs of ageing and which looks very healthy overall. This is to a large extent driven by my extensive supplements regime that I'm sharing with you in this article. Then, you too, can uncover the exact reasons and methods I've tested myself to become a \"more energetic, more intelligent, healthier and happier\" version of myself. How did I get there: Over the past couple of years, with my venture capitalist DNA, I've spent 100s of hours researching biohacking, talking to experts and going beyond the mere traditional supplements. Most supplements are fairly cheap with some degree of scientific backing on their efficacy, while it is fairly certain that they are not harmful. As such, I have chosen a portfolio approach, taking 20-30 pills daily without knowing exactly which ones are working, but trusting in the impact of the overall supplement mix. I'm sure that in 10 years, research will be more advanced and we will know more about which supplements really work, but I prefer to see the benefits already today with a higher degree of uncertainty. Now, I'm no Bradley Cooper, but I've learned a lot in that time about what seems to work for me, and what doesn't. What Exactly is Biohacking? Biohacking is the practice of using technology and science to improve your body's health, performance, and overall well-being. But what specifically does that mean? Well, with biohacking you can: - Improve your physical health (strength, stamina, or energy levels). - Improve your mental health (focus, memory, or creativity). - Even change your appearance (losing weight, growing taller, or changing their hair or eye colour). No matter what your goals are, I'm a firm believer that there's a biohacking method that can help you achieve them. Now, let's explore that a little bit further. 5 Types of Bodyhacking When it comes to bodyhacking, there are 5 main types you can explore. 1. Diet: This is perhaps the most common biohack out there. It can involve anything from eating more vegetables to cutting out processed foods to switching to a keto diet. 2. Sleep: We all know getting those 8 hours is essential for good health, and many people do not get enough of it. Biohacking can involve changing your sleep habits using technology such as Whoop or Aura rings to track your sleep patterns. 3. Exercise: This is another important part of a healthy lifestyle and can be used as a biohack. This can involve anything from changing your workout routine to using technology to help you track your progress. 4. Supplements: The proper way to think about supplements is that they are low-risk and quite affordable. Additionally, they can vary in their potential to be impactful, and as a portfolio, similar to a marketing mix, can have a powerful overall impact (with some having no impact at all). Some supplements have solid scientific evidence, such as Vitamin D and Creatine; two supplements that are lacking in a modern diet. In contrast, others are more rooted in anecdotal evidence or Eastern, traditional medicine. For myself, I've found that combining different approaches brings the strongest overall impact. I'm rarely sick, never get hangovers, and my body's overall performance is far better. 5. Biochemistry: Beyond supplements, some choose to permanently or temporarily alter their biochemistry. While I haven't personally explored this, I've read plenty of accounts showing a range of promising benefits. a) Hormone therapy: This is a popular anti-aging treatment that can help to improve a person's energy levels, mood, and sex drive. It can also help to reduce wrinkles, as well as increase muscle mass and bone density. b) Nootropics: The most common Nootropics used are Adderall, Modafinil and Ritalin. Typically, they're prescribed for attention deficit, hyperactivity problems or narcolepsy. That being said, they're widely used to boost mental performance. Academic research also shows that Nootropics can help improve working memory, executive function, and reaction time in older adults. Other smart drugs in the market are Noopept, Piracetam and Phenotropil. But some people want more natural options. In that case, some natural stimulants that have similar MDMA, psilocybin and LSD have been used for centuries for their mind-altering effects. But in more modern times, these drugs are gaining traction for other uses as well. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in psychedelics for their potential therapeutic benefits. Microdosing psychedelics is consuming shallow, sub-hallucinogenic doses of a psychedelic substance, such as LSD or psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Despite microdosing growing in popularity, there is little scientific literature on the practice. While full-dose therapies include perception-distorting properties, microdosing may provide complementary clinical benefits using lower-risk, non-hallucinogenic doses. \"Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin, and you can't remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important \u2014 creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and human consciousness as much as possible.\" \u2014 [Steve Jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-steve-jobs-quotes-from-biography-2011-10#on-why-you-should-take-lsd-1) (Biography, 2011). But it's not just those tech CEOs who you should listen to. In several small studies, like this one from [Toronto Univeristy](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychedelics/psychedelic-studies-research-program), researchers found that psychedelics can help treat various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and addiction, as well as enhance meditation and spiritual growth. Most of the benefits concern mental health and personality benefits, as well as lower dysfunctional attitudes and negative emotionality, higher wisdom and open-mindedness, and higher creativity and affect-valence. \"Any new businesses populated in pinnacle by young people who are not doing microdosing are going to be at a competitive disadvantage.\" \u2014 [Paul Stamets](https://bigthink.com/health/paul-stamets-microdosing/) So, now that we covered a bit about what biohacking is and the common therapy options out there, I want to share my own supplement routine with you. That way, you can better understand how it works in practice. My Supplement Regime Now, before I go any further, I need to make a quick disclaimer. You should not rely on this information as a substitute, nor does it replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a physician or other healthcare professional regarding your health. Also, if you plan on taking such an extensive supplement regime as I have, it is important to monitor your kidney function. This is because there is the potential for these supplements to put strain on the kidneys. Furthermore, it's advisable to measure your blood levels for a number of bio-markers on an ongoing basis (I suggest every 6 or 12 months) to see the impact of the supplements and to avoid using too much. Dosage is driven by body weight, i.e. someone weighing 120kg needs twice as much compared to someone weighing 60kg. This is something important to pay attention to and what many supplement companies don't tell you. Do your own online research to find the right dosage for you. With regard to brand, pick a mainstream brand that is likely to have a high turn-over of inventory as freshness is the biggest driver of supplement efficacy and pills that were sitting in a warehouse for 1 year plus loose most of it. For every nutrient we will add icons to emphasise the impact: - Cognition - Health - Beauty - Hormones - Sleep Quality Now, let's get right into it. Morning Smoothie (aka my \"I'll never get cancer\" drink): First, here's the recipe in its short form: - 250g Frozen Blueberries - 20g Dried Goji Berries - 5g of Creatine - 2 tsp of Cacao - 1 tsp of Matcha - 1 tsp of Curcuma Powder - 1 tsp of Chia Seeds - 30g of Protein Powder rich in BCCAs - 1 tsp of Manuka Honey But before you get to making that for yourself, you need to understand the why behind it. That way, you can adjust it to your own needs. Here's the reasoning behind each of those ingredients: - Blueberries: The antioxidant and anthocyanin in blueberries make them effective at reducing cognitive decline, supporting cardiovascular health, protecting the liver, reducing liver fat buildup, and preventing cells from causing cancer-related damage. Blueberries may also have a potential [Nootropic](https://examine.com/supplements/nootropic/)effect and can improve cognition for older adults experiencing cognitive decline. Still, there is also evidence suggesting blueberries can improve cognition in healthy, young people as well. This is due to the fact they may promote the growth of nervous tissue and reduce neurological inflammation. - Goji Berries: In traditional medicine, Goji berries help ward off illness and infection, as well as [naturally enhance immunity](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-boost-immune-health). Promising research suggests that Goji berries may [enhance eye health](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-nutrients-for-eyes)and protect against disorders like macular degeneration, an eye condition that can cause vision loss. Moreover, the berries are a source of polyphenols which have been shown to have anti-cancer effects. - Creatine: Creatine primarily improves strength and [power output](https://examine.com/topics/power-output/)during resistance exercise. Creatine is well researched for this purpose, and the effects are quite notable for a supplement. Although creatine has less research on [cognitive performance](https://examine.com/supplements/cognitive-function/)than physical performance, it may have cognitive benefits. Creatine reduces mental [fatigue](https://examine.com/topics/fatigue/)as demanding mental activity and sleep deprivation scenarios. Plus, some evidence suggests it improves working memory. That said, it is likely only in someone with below-average creatine levels, like vegetarians and older adults. Lastly, creatine can help cells protect from damage and inflations, preventing cancer. - Cacao: The fibre in cacao powder promotes healthy digestion and can reduce the risk and symptoms of [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/default.htm)and other [digestive problems](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips). Cacao powder is packed with [flavonoids](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/qa/what-are-flavonoids-and-do-they-help-if-you-are-sick), nutrients that can help lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and prevent blood clots. The flavonoids can also help increase insulin sensitivity, reducing the risk of diabetes. The flavonoids in cacao powder can even help to reduce inflammation throughout your body which may lessen your risk of some cancers, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and [Alzheimer's disease](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/understanding-alzheimers-disease-basics). - Matcha: The [high content of catechins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14518774/)brings high levels of antioxidants therefore helping to fight free radicals, potentially agents of cells damage and chronic disease. Moreover it [may](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19735169/)protect liver health given the central role in fluishing out toxins, metabolizing drugs and processing nutrients. It has been also [showed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28784536/)the help that brings to brain functions, in particular seems to improve attention, reaction time and memory. The high levels of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) makes it also helpful in [preventing cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11500915/)and [heart diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958723/). A small amount of research suggests matcha can increase libido significantly and slightly [improve sexual function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2585648/). Matcha may also improve the symptoms of menopause, especially those related to [mood](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19828710/)(such as anxiety and depression). However, the research is still in its infancy. - Curcuma Powder: Supplementation with curcumin reliably reduces markers of [inflammation](https://examine.com/topics/inflammation/)and increases the levels of endogenous antioxidants in the body. While more research is needed, the available research supports small to moderate improvements in the symptoms of [depression](https://examine.com/topics/depression/), anxiety, pain, and function in [osteoarthritis](https://examine.com/topics/symptoms-of-osteoarthritis/). We're also seeing some reductions in [LDL cholesterol](https://examine.com/topics/ldl/), [blood glucose](https://examine.com/topics/blood-glucose/), and [blood pressure](https://examine.com/topics/blood-pressure/), but this research is limited and less consistent. Being rich in antioxidants also decreases the risk of cancer, decreasing the damage to cells. - Chia Seeds: Chia seeds contain quercetin, an antioxidant that can reduce your risk of developing several health conditions, including heart disease. The seeds are also high in fibre, which can help to lower [high blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/understanding-high-blood-pressure-basics#1)and, in turn, reduce your risk of developing heart disease. Just a single ounce serving of chia seeds has 39% of your recommended daily allowance of fibre. The [soluble](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/qa/what-is-soluble-fiber)fibre in the seeds absorbs water, causing them to expand and increase the feeling of fullness. Because of that, chia seeds can also help you maintain a healthy weight. Finally, being rich also in Omega-3, they also have anticancer protection. - Protein Powder rich in BCCAs: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) refers to three essential amino acids: [leucine](https://examine.com/supplements/leucine/), [isoleucine](https://examine.com/supplements/isoleucine/), and [valine](https://examine.com/supplements/valine/). Leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis; meanwhile, isoleucine induces glucose uptake into cells. Supplementation with BCAAs shows some promise for delaying mental and physical fatigue during prolonged exercise. Supplementation has also been found to reduce markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and muscle soreness 24 to 48 hours after exercise, but may not speed up the recovery of [muscle performance](https://examine.com/supplements/branched-chain-amino-acids/research/#ref5). - Manuka Honey:: As a good source of antioxidants, this honey has been linked with reducing the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer as well as having powerful antibacterial properties. One of the major antibacterial components of Manuka honey is a compound called methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO comes from the conversion of another compound in Manuka honey known as dihydroxyacetone (DHA), a high concentration of which is found in the nectar of Manuka flowers. Essentially, the higher the concentration of MGO, the stronger the antibacterial effect. Moreover, it has an anti-inflammatory action that can help ease [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm)and [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation). With Lunch These are supplements I like to mix with foods and improve absorption. - Basic Multivitamin Mix: In general, it's better to have a diet balanced enough to supply for all the vitamins needs but cultural culinary dynamics, as well as social moments, makes that difficult. A general integration of these will constitute for our body a secure supply of the minimum required for a healthy life. Some studies suggest that multivitamins are correlated to a reduced risk of heart attacks and death, while others show no effects. However, several small studies examining specific populations have found that multivitamins can [improve memory](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-improve-memory)in older adults. Multivitamins may also affect your mood. Research has revealed links between poor mood and [nutrient deficiencies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies)and between nutritional supplements and reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. One study found that taking [antioxidant](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-antioxidants)vitamins and minerals may slow its progression and help prevent it. - Vitamin D3 drops: Supplemental vitamin D is associated with a range of benefits, including improved [immune health](https://examine.com/topics/immune-health/), [bone health](https://examine.com/topics/bone-health/), and well-being. Supplementation mortality risk, [diabetes](https://examine.com/topics/diabetes/), and [multiple sclerosis](https://examine.com/topics/risk-of-multiple-sclerosis/). Vitamin D is often taken for [depression](https://examine.com/topics/depression/)and similar mental health issues. The effects of vitamin D likely depend on a person's circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a form of vitamin D that is measured in blood samples to determine vitamin D status). And, in fact, many of its benefits will only be seen when a deficiency is reversed. Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. Even with recent medical advances, vitamin D deficiency is still an epidemic. Over a [billion people worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068797/#b1-ijhs-4-1-005a)are vitamin D deficient or insufficient. Yet, no international health organisation or governmental body has declared a health emergency warning the public about how to address low vitamin D levels. - Vitamin K2 drops: These help to prevent calcium deposits in arteries and other tissues. Sufficient Vitamin K2 is essential to absorb Vitamin D3. Vitamin K may have a role to play in cancer therapy. It may also help regulate [insulin sensitivity](https://examine.com/topics/insulin-sensitivity/)and (in topical form) may help reduce skin reddening. - Chrysin helps to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality as well as Chrysin is most well known for being a testosterone-boosting plant compound. - Beta carotene: An antioxidant that helps to protect cells from damage. Vitamin A is essential for good vision and eye health, a strong immune system, and healthy skin and mucous membranes. It also increases the ability to produce melanin, making it easier to get a nice tan. - Ubiquinol: A powerful antioxidant that helps to reduce inflammation and improve heart health. It's also a strong antioxidant that protects cell membranes and keeps them stable. Ubiquinol offers a wide range of health benefits: supporting heart health, the production of cellular energy, male fertility, healthy cholesterol and general health and wellbeing in aging individuals (being a precursor of coenzyme [Q10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807419/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807419/)). CoQ10 acts as an [antioxidant](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/how-antioxidants-work1), which protects cells from damage and plays an important part in the [metabolism](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/how-to-boost-your-metabolism). - Bacopa Monierri: This herb is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to help improve memory and cognitive function. It is a [nootropic](https://examine.com/supplements/nootropic/)herb that has been used in traditional medicine for longevity and cognitive enhancement. Supplementation can improve memory, at least in the short-term, and there may be some mental health benefits. - R Alpha Lipoic Acid: This nutrient is considered an \"antioxidant powerhouse\" and has been shown to help improve insulin sensitivity, cognitive function, and nerve function. Alpha Lipoic Acid is a true energy plant that provides our cells with new strength. With R-alpha lipoic acid you can finally keep your blood sugar and cholesterol levels under control. Painful nerves in polyneuropathy are also sustainably reduced by taking it. Keep your brain active by preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with the help of alpha lipoic acid. - Spirulina: This blue-green algae is a rich source of nutrients, including protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It has been shown to boost immunity, improve cognitive function, and protect against certain chronic diseases. It seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount and may have some meaningful effects on liver enzymes and overall liver health. Although, more research is needed on that. It also seems to improve general antioxidant status and reduce markers of oxidative stress, as well as some inflammatory markers. When people take spirulina, they tend to lose a small amount of weight, even if they're not trying to. Some evidence even suggests it can help regulate appetite. Because of its potentially potent immunomodulating properties, spirulina may be used to prevent allergic reactions and treat asthma. - Chlorella: Like spirulina, this green algae is also a rich source of nutrients, including protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It has been shown to improve gut health, boost immunity, and protect against cancer. - Indol 3 Carbinol: Found in vegetables like broccoli and cabbage, this nutrient been shown to help protect against cancer, reduce the risk of hormone-related cancers, and reduce the symptoms of menopause. It can also be used for naturally lowering estrogen and tilting the balance of free testosterone to estrogen in the blood. - Nattokinase: This enzyme, derived from natto (fermented soybeans), has been shown to help improve cardiovascular health by reducing blood clotting and inflammation. It is a blood thinner that can prevent thrombosis (blot clot formations) by essentially devouring arterial plaque, natto significantly reduces the risk of suffering a pulmonary embolism (arterial blockage) that could lead to a heart attack or stroke. - OPC Grape Extract: This extract is rich in antioxidants and has been shown to help improve cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and joint health. Grape Seed Extract is a mixture of tannins and procyanidins (chains of catechins) that appears to exert anti-estrogenic effects and may enhance blood flow. More related to [green tea catechins](https://examine.com/supplements/green-tea-catechins/)than to [resveratrol](https://examine.com/supplements/resveratrol/)mechanistically. - Black Garlic: This particular type of garlic is a rich source of antioxidants and has been shown to boost immunity, improve cardiovascular health, and protect against cancer. - L-Glycine: This amino acid is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and has been shown to help improve sleep quality, cognitive function, and wound healing. Glycine is one of the amino acids essential to the body's synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. Cells produce glutathione in order to fight free radicals that can otherwise cause oxidative stress and damage cells, proteins, and DNA. Glycine plays a role in the synthesis of creatine as well, another amino acid that can also be consumed independently. Glycine supplements stimulate a gut hormone that increases the ability of insulin to remove glucose from the bloodstream. - Rhodiola Rosea: This herb is traditionally used in Russian folk medicine to help improve physical and mental performance. It has also been shown to help reduce stress and improve cognitive function. - NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine): N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an acetylated form of the acid L-cysteine which has [antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mucolytic properties](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/research/#ref1). NAC is converted to L-cysteine after ingestion, which, in turn, is converted into glutathione, a powerful antioxidant. NAC also reduces levels of proinflammatory [cytokines](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/research/#ref5)and [oxidative stress](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/research/#ref6). Because NAC increases glutathione levels in the body, which are rapidly depleted by stress, disease, or drug toxicity, it has applications in clinical settings, in addition to general health and wellness. NAC has been used for the treatment of [cystic fibrosis](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/research/#ref7)(due to its mucolytic properties), acute [acetaminophen toxicity](https://examine.com/supplements/n-acetylcysteine/research/#ref8), and chronic obstructive lung disease. NAC might be an effective treatment option for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. The FDA tweeted that IV glutathione was being used as a skin lightener. It restores the skin to the colour of early childhood. - Milk Thistle: Evidence suggests that silymarin protects liver cells, reduces liver-related deaths, and improves markers of liver function in people with [chronic liver disease](https://examine.com/supplements/milk-thistle/research/#ref1). These effects are primarily attributed to silymarin's role as a free radical scavenger, which helps in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Silymarin also seems to have antifibrotic properties. When taken orally, it flushes toxins from the liver, helping to clear and purify the skin. - Olive Leaf Extract: This extract is rich in antioxidants and has been shown to help improve cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and joint health. - Boron: This mineral is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and has been shown to help improve bone health, cognitive function, and muscle mass by boosting natural testosterone. - Saw Palmetto: Saw palmetto seems to lower the amount of pressure on the tubes that carry urine in males. Saw palmetto also might prevent testosterone from being converted to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Reduced levels of DHT might help prevent some types of [hair loss](http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics). - Tongkat Ali: This herb has been traditionally used in Southeast Asian countries to help improve sexual function and libido. It has also been shown to help improve cognitive function and reduce the symptoms of stress. Studies show that tongkat ali may boost testosterone levels and help treat infertility in men, relieve stress, and possibly increase muscle mass. Still, more research is needed. - Cordyceps: A mushroom used in traditional chinese medicine that is touted to be anti-aging and pro-vitality, this one given the regulation of testicular testosterone production, but also showed to [improve aerobic performance](https://examine.com/summaries/study/89g3R9/), as well as [lessening insomnia](https://examine.com/summaries/study/1PQxZ0/). - BPL1-HT: This is a vegan postbiotic, scientifically proven to aid in weight management and support metabolic health. Studies have shown this powerful ingredient reduces [visceral fat and cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30262813/), whilst containing strong [anti-inflammatory properties](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05934#) - Resveratrol: This is part of a group of compounds called polyphenols. They're thought to act like antioxidants, protecting the body against damage that can put you at higher risk for things like [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/)and heart disease. It's gained a lot of attention for its reported anti-aging and disease-fighting powers. It also may protect nerve cells from damage and fight the plaque buildup that can lead to the diseas. Researchers believe that resveratrol activates the SIRT1 gene. That gene is believed to protect the body against the effects of [obesity and the diseases of aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122246/). - Lactospore: It's a probiotic used to [improve digestion and restore normal intestinal bacteria/yeast flora](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/probiotics-beyond-digestion-new-research-frontiers). It has been used in alternative medicine as a likely effective aid in preventing bowel syndrome, bacterial infection, colic, lung infection and skin problems. - Maca powder: It is known scientifically as Lepidium meyenii, is sometimes referred to as Peruvian ginseng. Some evidence suggests that taking concentrated maca supplements may benefit those with [low libido](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/antidepressant-sexual-side-effects)but also increase the [fertility](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/normal-sperm-count). But also, limited evidence suggests that maca may help improve energy levels and enhance [mood](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27548190/)in some populations. - Selenium: This is an essential mineral, being rich of [antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cancer-and-diet)helps in fighting cell damage, but also helps boosting the immune system and lowering oxidative stress. Given the important role in reducing such stress, it is considered useful for preventing the [mental decline](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24668390/)of [Alzheimer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147716/). - Scutell'up: This is a patented formulation extract from the [Scutellaria baicalensis plant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5031759/), it's rich in flavones and has been shown to have impressive anti-stress properties. Used for centuries as an ancient medicinal remedy, Scutell'Up has been shown to hold powerful benefits to help support mental health. Before Bed Finally, to improve sleep quality and regeneration, here's what I like to take just before I head to bed. - 3g of Omega3 fatty acids (2g of DHA and 1g of EPA): Some potential benefits of omega 3s include reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. They may also help reduce inflammation and improve joint health. I take vegan Omega3 as their source in fish oil is the algae that fish eat, so why not go directly to the source? I take them at night when the stomach is full to avoid burning those healthy fatty acids for fuel. - Magnesium: Magnesium is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body and is essential for many functions, including energy production, muscle contraction, and nerve function. It may also help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. - Zinc: Zinc is essential for immune function, wound healing, and growth and development. It may also help reduce the risk of age-related diseases such as macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease and improve sleep quality. - Ashwagandha: Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine. It is thought to help reduce stress and anxiety, improve sleep quality, and boost immunity. Ashwagandha's ability to improve reproductive health is attributed to its antioxidative effects and ability to [increase testosterone levels](https://examine.com/supplements/ashwagandha/research/#ref17). This effect is more notable in men with infertility and low testosterone levels, but early evidence suggests [ashwagandha](https://examine.com/supplements/ashwagandha/research/#ref5)may also boost testosterone levels in [healthy men](https://examine.com/supplements/ashwagandha/research/#ref19). - 5HTP: As a precursor to serotonin, this neurotransmitter plays a role in mood, anxiety, and sleep. Plus, 5HTP may help reduce anxiety and depression and improve sleep quality. Beginner Guidelines for Biohacking Now, of course, I'm aware that all of these supplements can't be introduced into the daily life of everyone. You need to make sure you're working with a medical professional before stocking your cupboards full of supplements you don't fully understand. For me, I personally integrate supplements that have the biggest impact when introduced with constancy in my diet. For you, it could be a completely different regime based on your lifestyle and vitamin needs. Now, I'll admit that was an info dump, so here's what I recommend if you're just getting started in biohacking. These are the best basic supplements that almost anyone and everyone can benefit from. Take all the following right after a good meal, doesn't matter if breakfast or lunch: - Creatine: The energy booster sensation both in endurance as well as immediate efforts, less fatigue sensibility and an increased muscle-mind connection during physical exercises. It is very well researched and can benefit anyone, not just athletes. - Vitamin D3: With all the medical advances of the century, vitamin D deficiency is still epidemic.
