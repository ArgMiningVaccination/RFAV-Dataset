Available for patients aged 65 and over, the Fluad trivalent influenza vaccine [has been confirmed](http://www.tga.gov.au/alert/fluad-trivalent-influenza-vaccine) by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to contain natural rubber latex in the sheath covering the needle. Although reactions to latex are rare, the TGA advises that anyone who has a latex allergy should not receive Fluad. Patients aged 65 and over with a latex allergy can safely receive the alternative trivalent influenza vaccine, Fluzone High-Dose, also available through the [National Immunisation Program](http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/) (NIP). Australian Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy has recommended healthcare professionals administering the Fluad vaccine be aware of any patients with a latex allergy to avoid potential adverse outcomes. 'If you are vaccinating patients with Fluad, please be aware of this issue and advise patients accordingly. Reassure patients that reactions to latex are rare,' he said. 'As with all vaccinations, be prepared to treat immediate allergic reactions, including potential anaphylaxis.' The TGA has confirmed there are no safety concerns regarding the Fluad vaccine itself.
