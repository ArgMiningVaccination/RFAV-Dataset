Sun Weidong presented his Letter of Credence to India's President Ram Nath Kovind at an elegant ceremony at the stately Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on August 28. In his cordial interaction with President Kovind, the Chinese Ambassador conveyed warm greetings of Chinese President Xi Jinping to him. Welcoming the envoy, President Kovind also conveyed his sincere greetings to President Xi. Recalling centuries-old friendly exchanges between people of the two countries, the Chinese Ambassador said: \"China attaches great importance to the development of relations with India, and sincerely welcomes India's development.\" He underlined that the two sides should highlight the crucial role of the leaders in guiding the progress of bilateral relations, and jointly push for healthy growth of the China-India relations.

SUN WEIDONG China's Ambassador to India Rainy season is always a wonderful time to be in India, kindling green foliage and fresh hopes for blossoming of China-India relations. Personally, it's delightful for me to present my credentials to Honorable President of India Ram Nath Kovind at this time amid high hopes for bilateral relations. It's reassuring to see that the Wuhan consensus of widening convergences and building trust continues to shine forth as we prepare for the second informal summit between our two leaders and explore new areas of collaboration between our two countries. The second meeting of High-Level People- to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism in Beijing (August 12) reaffirmed the primacy of P2P relations in the burgeoning China- India partnership. The meeting, co-chaired by China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, was held barely eight months after the inaugural edition, which suggests that the support for enhanced P2P contacts is widening in both countries. The meeting reinforced several positive trends in bilateral relations. First and foremost, it's time for both countries to move beyond G2G and B2B interactions to bolster the P2P pillar of the relationship. In this regard, it was energizing to note that both foreign ministers stressed on expanding and consolidating the popular and social foundation for healthy and harmonious development of China-India relations. Secondly, the media has a critical role to play in promoting the win-win trajectory of the China-India partnership through positive and balanced stories about developments in each other's country. In this regard, the wide-ranging discussions between senior journalists at the 4th China-India Media Forum in Beijing were quite fruitful and forward-looking. Third, as two big emerging countries with a population of over a billion people, there may be differences on some issues from time to time, but areas of cooperation outweigh these differences. Last but not the least, there is strong political will on part of the top leaderships in both countries to take the China-India partnership to new heights. Both sides should earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders, take the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and India next year as an opportunity, enhance exchanges and cooperation, and continue to inject new impetus into our multi-faceted partnership. I am pleased to present the latest edition of our embassy magazine, which encapsulates myriad facets of mutually beneficial partnership between China and India. It's nice to note that our efforts to balance bilateral trade are set to get an impetus with China revising its drug laws, which will facilitate import of legal generic drugs from India to China. It's also worth pointing out that China and India are becoming true friends in need as they help each other in good times as well as bad. The timely data provided by Chinese satellites helped India to plan its rescue efforts effectively. Similarly, the Chinese government has provided many additional facilities to Indian pilgrims, making the Kailash Mansarovar yatra easier and an experience to cherish. In the days to come, I am confident that such gestures will open new pathways of friendship between people of China and India.

Such exchanges are especially important because both our countries have each their own system of governance. Another area to look at would be to examine the role and impact of social media,\" he said. Since 2013, the China-India Media Forum, as the largest institutionalized platform between the two countries for media exchanges, has paved the way for mutual understanding and become an important link for China-India cultural cooperation. The forum, organized by the China Public Diplomacy Association and sponsored by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and India's Ministry of External Affairs this year, had three sub-forums, focusing on promoting mutual trust in political and economic cooperation, people- to-people exchanges and cooperation through new media platforms. Media personnel, experts, scholars and diplomats from both countries took part in the exchanges. Liu Zhonghua, a senior editor of People's Daily , said there should be more exchanges among journalists from the two countries and they should report on each other's articles in a faithful and objective manner. The forms of media exchanges should be innovated with more attention given to new media platforms as China has 800 million Internet users and India has 500 million, he said. \"President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attach great importance to the media exchanges between the two countries and encourage the media to make more coverage on the positive aspects of China-India relations and create an objective and friendly public opinion environment.\" \"The Media Forum provides a very good platform to discuss and explore ways as to how our respective media can contribute towards the objective of Closer Developmental Partnership between our two countries by enhancing appreciation and understanding of each other's standpoints and core interests,\" said India's external affairs minister. 12 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 The China-India relationship got a renewed push with the recent visit of India's Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to Beijing (August 11 to 13). This was his first visit to the country as India's external affairs minister since he assumed office in May. He served as India's ambassador to China from 2009 to 2013, making him the country's longest- serving envoy in Beijing.

The primary lesson is that it is important for India and China to cooperate closely if we are to realize the Asian century,\" he said. \"A lot of people, including young people of both countries, really don't have a good understanding of how much our two cultures of civilizations have affected each other,\" said Mr Jaishankar. Promoting a greater awareness of that history through more cultural exchanges is an important task for the two countries, he said. Alluding to the inaugural meeting of the High- Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism in New Delhi in December 2018, Mr Jaishankar said he considers the mechanism as \"taking the bilateral relationship from the narrow diplomatic field to a larger societal interaction,\" and added that the more people see each other first hand, the more their sense of relating to each other will grow. Senior Indian officials from sports, tourism, and culture sectors accompanied Mr Jaishankar to China. \"It's important for our relationship to build popular support.

NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 15 Wang Yi States Clear Position on the Kashmir Issue In the wake of the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir by the Indian government early August and escalating India-Pakistan tensions, China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has expressed concern and urged India to play a constructive role in maintaining regional peace. China's concern over India's unilateral move in the India-administered Kashmir was conveyed by Wang Yi to India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in Beijing on August 12. Wang Yi said that the Chinese side follows closely the current situation in Kashmir and the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. He expressed concerns that the constitutional amendment by the Indian side will change the current situation in Kashmir and give rise to tensions in the region. He made it clear to his Indian counterpart that the Chinese side opposed any unilateral action that complicates the situation. It is hoped that both India and Pakistan will resolve disputes through peaceful means and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region. Mr Wang Yi pointed out that the Indian side's measures also challenge the sovereign rights and interests of the Chinese side and go against the agreements between the two countries on safeguarding peace and stability in border areas, about which the Chinese side is seriously concerned. Such practice of the Indian side is neither valid in relation to the Chinese side nor will it change the status quo that the Chinese side exercises sovereignty and effective administrative jurisdiction over the territory, he said. It is hoped that the Indian side will make more efforts to promote mutual trust and contribute to safeguarding peace and stability in border areas, so as to avoid unnecessary disturbances in China- India relations. India's Response Responding to Mr Wang Yi's concerns, Mr Jaishankar explained the position of the Indian side. He stressed that the amendment to the Indian constitution will not result in a new claim of sovereignty, will not change the Line of Control, and will not change the Line of Actual Control along the China-India border. India hopes to improve its relations with Pakistan, and is willing to exercise restraint and safeguard regional peace and stability, he said. In the meantime, the Indian side stands ready to, together with the Chinese side, continue to properly address the China- India boundary questions through consultations and abide by the consensus reached by the two countries on safeguarding peace and stability in border areas. Such practice of the Indian side is neither valid in relation to the Chinese side nor will it change the status quo that the Chinese side exercises sovereignty and effective administrative jurisdiction over the territory. It is hoped that both India and Pakistan will resolve disputes through peaceful means and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.16 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 China has approved a revision in drug laws that will no longer treat foreign drugs unapproved by the drug administration law, including generic drugs from India, as \"fake medicines,\" allowing for greater leniency to people importing such drugs in small amount. China's top legislature, the Standing Committee of National People's Congress, on August 26 adopted the revised drug administration law, which will come into effect from December 1, 2019. The revised law removes drugs that are unapproved in China, but sold legally overseas from the category of fake medicines. According to previous laws, people caught importing unapproved medicines were considered \"drug smugglers\" and faced heavy penalties. The latest revision states that people who take these drugs without an official approval into China can be granted leniency if the amount of the drug is small. They will be exempt from punishment if the drug does not cause health problems or delay anyone's treatment. Welcoming the revision in the law, Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong termed it as \"a move which will help facilitate import of legal generic drugs from India to China.\" \"Hope to see more Chinese patients and Indian exporters benefit from it,\" he tweeted. Advantage India The move is seen by some analysts as a sign of China opening up its market to cheaper generic medicines, especially from India, following the immense popularity of the movie Dying to Survive last year which highlighted the need for affordable medicines in China. The Xu Zheng-starrer Chinese black comedy is based on the real-life case of a Chinese leukemia patient-turned-drug dealer who was jailed for smuggling a cheaper alternative from India and selling it to fellow Chinese patients who couldn't afford the exorbitantly priced official medication. Dying to Survive went on to become China's third highest-grossing movie in 2018 with a box office collection of over $453 million. More importantly, the movie prompted intense online debate about the cost of medical care in China and called for action from the leadership. \"I think it is definitely a response to society's concern over the issue,\" Reuters quoted Yuan Jie, an official at the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress, as telling a press conference when asked about the change in the law. Echoing Yuan's remarks, Liu Changqiu, a health law expert and research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told CHINA REVISES LAW,OPENS DOOR TO CHEAP GENERIC INDIAN MEDICINES Welcoming the revision in the law, Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong termed it as \"a move which will help facilitate import of legal generic drugs from India to China.\" \"Hope to see more Chinese patients and Indian exporters benefit from it,\" he tweeted. NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 17 the Global Times that the revised clause addresses patients' needs. \"Different countries may apply different standards to drugs, but patients should be allowed the right to buy legal foreign drugs as long as they are effective,\" he said. Liu added, however, that the revision does not mean that China is ready to relax management on imported generic medicine. People who want to import generic drugs for business and profit would still require to register and get a pre-approval under the current laws. Experts warned, however, that legal risks still remained for distributors who buy drugs abroad. Besides tightening supervision to ensure drug safety, the newly revised law also encourages innovation in the research and development of new drugs, reported Xinhua news agency. \"The law underscored China's commitment to pharmaceutical research and development in the general rules section, and added or improved over 10 clauses to encourage innovation,\" the agency quoted Liu Pei, a senior official with the National Medical Products Administration, as saying. Reducing Trade Deficit The intense public reaction to Dying to Survive coincided with China eliminating tariffs on 28 drugs including anti-cancer drugs from India, which have a substantial demand in China due to cheaper pricing than their Western variants. Former Chinese ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui (and currently China's Vice Foreign Minister) said it would \"help reduce trade imbalance\" between the two countries. In a message to the first-ever meeting of drug regulators from China and India in Shanghai on June 21, India's Ambassador to China Vikram Misri called for a \"clear roadmap\" for increasing the share of Indian medicines in the Chinese market. He also called for regular interactions between Chinese and Indian officials on the matter. India supplies 20% of global generic medicines in terms of volume, making the country the largest provider of generic medicines globally. Most generic medicines which applied for registration in China from 2016 to 2018 were reportedly from India and Switzerland. New Delhi has been pressing Beijing to open its huge pharmaceutical market for Indian pharma exports to address a widening trade deficit which rose to $57.8 billion in 2018 from $51.7 billion in 2017, according to official Chinese customs data. The latest figures available from India's Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (PHARMEXCIL) show the country exported drugs and pharmaceuticals worth $230 million in the 2018-19 financial year, a 15% jump over the $200 million it posted in the previous fiscal year.

Some Indian friends may have heard about Dunhuang, but not many know about its unique beauty, history and culture. Here I wish to share with you stories about Dunhuang that I know. Dunhuang is a land that has gone through vicissitudes of history with ancient legacies and magic beauty. Around 2,000 years ago, a Chinese geographer of the Eastern Han dynasty Ying Shao said: \"Dun, means grand; Huang, means splendid.\" So Dunhuang means the land of grand splendor. Historical changes over the millennium shaped the magnificent landscape of this frontier region, west of China's Gansu province, and left colorful and gorgeous cultural treasures. A Treasure Trove The Mogao Grottoes, located in a desert oasis surrounded by water and mountain, have stood quietly for over 1,650 years, and is the most exquisite Buddhist art relics in China and beyond. Mogao Grottoes are a treasure house of art, architecture, sculpture and painting, with 735 grottoes, over 45,000 square meters of murals and 2,000 painted sculptures. These works of art are exquisitely crafted, with unique craftsmanship, vivid charm, and combination of form and spirit. Like an amazing and colorful movement, they tell a beautiful and touching legend of magic charm lasting a thousand years. A Testimony of Friendship Dunhuang is a witness to interactions and learning between China and India, two ancient civilizations.

Other than being world-famous, the murals and Buddha figures in these caves tell the historical and cultural ties between Chinese and Indian civilizations, and witness the light of inter-civilizational exchanges and mutual learning. Indian-style sculptures can be seen in the Mogao Grottoes built during the 4th to 6th centuries. The moves of the most commonly seen Apsara figure in Dunhuang murals are similar to those in Indian classical dances. Dunhuang also keeps many ancient Buddhist sutras written in Sanskrit and Pattra-Leaf Scripture, a wealth of information for China-India cultural exchanges. Cultural Hub Dunhuang is a classic example of convergence of oriental and western civilizations. President Xi Jinping said that Dunhuang is an important hub where the Orient met the West in history, and different cultures met and mingled here, shaping the unique charm of the Dunhuang culture.The rich and colorful painted sculptures and murals at the Mogao Grottoes absorb the strength of ancient Eastern and Western art. The splendid Dunhuang culture is a fusion of the best of cultures of various nations. Ji Xianlin, a master scholar on culture in China, said that there are only four cultural systems in the world with long history, vast territory, self-contained system and far- reaching influence, i.e. Chinese, Indian, Greek and Islamic, and these four cultural systems converge in Dunhuang and Xinjiang of China. The Silk Road Being an important hub city, Dunhuang is known as the \"Pearl on the Silk Road\". For thousands of years, envoys and officials, merchants and caravans, monks and scholars, capital and technology, integrated and communicated through this road, nourishing the development and prosperity of countries along the route. China and India have also developed close economic, trade and cultural exchanges along the ancient Silk Road of both land and sea.

In August, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar co-chaired the second meeting of China-India High Level People-to-People (P2P) and Cultural Exchanges Mechanism in Beijing. The mechanism was set up under the joint initiative of President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Since the first meeting, bilateral people-to- people and cultural exchanges and cooperation have seen a fresh boom. At this meeting, China and India agreed to host more colorful P2P and cultural events, work for new progress in P2P and cultural exchanges and consolidate the popular support for the sound development of China-India relations. Build Common Ground In the long course of history, China and India, two ancient oriental civilizations, have engaged in exchanges and mutual learning, created two vigorous and charming civilizations, and made great contributions to the development of human civilization. In the new era, China and India should also adhere to inclusiveness and resolve differences through building common ground. We should transcend civilizational barriers through exchanges, rise above \"civilization conflicts\" by mutual learning, and overcome the sense of superiority by promoting coexistence of civilizations. Let's polish the ancient \"Pearl on the Silk Road\" Dunhuang, paint a new picture of dialogue and harmony and write a new chapter of mutual respect and harmonious coexistence between Chinese and Indian civilizations.

Accommodation facilities, called reception centres, have been built at various points of the pilgrimage, thanks to an initiative by the Chinese government to improve the material comforts of the pilgrims undertaking the arduous journey. The reception centres, each with about 150 beds, have rooms with charging points, a common kitchen and a common washroom, and provide food for the yatris. According to Awang Chering, Director-General of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Ali Prefecture, all the four new reception centres have similar facilities. \"The Chinese government has spent 36.8 million RMBs ($5.21 million) in building these centres,\" he said. While two are open this year, the other two will be open to yatris from 2020. Jitendra Singh Rautala, 43, a pilgrim from Uttarakhand who has been on the yatra several times, said the new facilities are great. \"They have ensured that a difficult trek has been made easier and comfortable,\" he said. A private tour operator, who did not wish to be named, credited both the Indian and Chinese governments for this change. \"Earlier yatris used to stay in tents; now they stay in buildings with attached bathrooms,\" he said. \"Even those aged 70 can now go on the yatra,\" he said.

In the first two weeks (beginning July 15), 40 people, including a minor, died in this district out of the 130 in the state due to raging floods. The main cause of floods in the low-lying areas of Bihar is the overflowing of several rivers that originate in the neighbouring country of Nepal. A Xinhua correspondent, who travelled to the areas devastated by floods in Sitamarhi, reached Dhaaptola village in a rescue boat and found the village had 200 houses. Most of the houses, which are built with mud and have thatched roofs, had been submerged by the overflowing Bagmati river for eight to 10 days, beginning the night of July 14-15. The inhabitants had to spend several days on roof-tops or places above the water-level, even as it rained, sometimes heavily. Flood waters also inundated agricultural fields, and boats provided by rescue teams, belonging to the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), were the only mode of transport for them to go to the nearby markets to buy daily necessities. Similar rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Indian Army were also pressed into service in nearby areas to extend relief and work to the flood victims.TIMELY SATELLITE DATA FROM CHINA HELPS INDIA COMBAT FLOODS CHINA'S DATA HELPED INDIA TO PLAN ITS RESCUE EFFORTS. 26 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 The only pathway, a 100-meter-long bridge built with bamboo sticks, was washed away in flash floods, and the village had remained cut- off from the rest of the state for at least five days before the relief and rescue teams arrived with rescue boats, relief material and medicines.

Meanwhile, the quality of the FDI inflow was optimized with more capital flowing into the high-tech sector. Investment in high-tech industries climbed 43.1% year on year to account for 29.3% of the total FDI. The FDI in the high-tech service sector surged 63.2% year on year between January and July, while that in the high-tech manufacturing sector rose by 19% year on year.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a critical gauge of inflation, was at a 17-month high of 2.8% in July, up from an increase of 2.7% registered in June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The increase was mainly attributed to higher food prices, which accounted for a large proportion in the CPI calculation. This happened because of high pork prices due to the African swine fever, and the impact of adverse weather on vegetable supplies. The government aims to keep the CPI increase at around 3% this year. The country's overall consumer prices would remain stable as the impact of structural factors would gradually fade with rising supplies, said Yue Xiuhu, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission. With the outbreak of the African swine fever being effectively controlled, quarantine has been lifted in the most-affected regions, and cross-region transportation of pigs has gradually resumed, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Measures that the government had put in place would gradually take effect and help ensure market supply and stabilize pork prices, said Wang Zuli, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. As the low base effect passes, the upside risk of the CPI may lessen in the third quarter, and the overall CPI may hold flat or edge down in Q3, according to analysts of the China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC). The CICC expected the central bank to loosen monetary policy on the margins, further inject liquidity via open market operation instruments, and lower the open market operation rates, and reserve requirement ratio during the rest of the year.

Besides, he is a recipient of \"China Reform Friendship Medal,\" China's highest international honor awarded to only 10 foreigners in four decades. As the host of over 400 hours of in-depth television interviews, Mr Kuhn is known for his dry, self- deprecating humor, and for asking deep and probing questions that cut straight to the heart of the matter. \"To truly understand China, one has to recognize their genuine commitment to eradicate poverty,\" Mr Kuhn told Xinhua after the premiere.\"Today, in the Western world, especially in the United States, there is concern about China's actions and suspicion of China's motives,\" Mr Kuhn explained. \"But one of the things I wanted this film to do was to undermine the stereotype of China as a ruthless giant out to dominate the world. It's just not the case. Their focus is still inward on eradicating poverty, something the U.S. has yet to do.\" He explained that while China's economic stimulus package was an unprecedented success, it had become clear by 2013 when President Xi Jinping took office, that there were still millions of intractably poor that no amount of economic stimulus could reach such as those in extremely remote mountain villages and with no education. Unique Plan Mr Kuhn was fascinated that China's solution was to create a massive, highly targeted, individual poverty alleviation program. Like no other nation, China's program was based on crafting an individual plan for every single family below the poverty line, then having them visited every month by a young party member who helps them implement new strategies to increase their income. Mr Kuhn was impressed by the sheer scope and determination of China's poverty alleviation program, and the humanitarian intention behind it. \"Since China's targeted poverty initiative began, three million cadre officials have been mobilized and, today, 775,000 are still hard at work.

We are serious about getting results,\" he said. China's poverty level has dropped to less than 20 million,\" he affirmed. Different Perspectives The film's director Getzels, an award-winning documentary filmmaker and two-time Emmy nominee, found shooting the film a profound experience. \"What you learn as a documentary filmmaker is that there are so many different ways to understand things. Everyone has their own fascinating perspective,\" he told Xinhua. \"For the film, we decided to take a more observational approach, not a journalistic one that would be mired in journalist arguments,\" he explained. \"We wanted to tell the story from the different perspectives of everyone we met, from high- ranking officials all the way down to the families of the poor themselves.\" \"It turned out to be much more personal and nuanced,\" he added with satisfaction. The film's striking cinema- tography, with its images of steep mountain passes shrouded in mist, flickering cookfires, steaming tea kettles, and slanting sunsets over tranquil ponds, was an arresting counterpoint to the fierce struggle it takes to survive in rural poverty in China. Mr Getzels concurred with Mr Kuhn's assessment that China's genuine desire to address poverty has prompted it to come up with its current ambitious and visionary approach.

It is the 10th white paper on national defense the Chinese government has issued since 1998 CHINA'S DEFENCE PRIORITIES IN NEW ERA WHITE PAPER OUTLINES NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 39 The white paper, entitled China's National Defense in the New Era, released by the State Council Information Office on July 24, 2019, aims at helping the international community better understand China's national defense policy and priorities.and the first comprehensive one since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. A number of figures were also used in the 27,000-character white paper, and 10 tables on topics such as the breakdown of China's defense expenditure and international cooperation activities were added as appendices. Defensive Defense Policy China adheres to a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, said the white paper. This is determined by the socialist system of China, the strategic decision to follow the path of peaceful development, the independent foreign policy of peace, and the best of cultural traditions that considers peace and harmony as fundamentals, said the white paper.

Never seeking hegemony, expansion or spheres of influence is the distinctive feature of China's national defense in the new era, the strategic guidance for which is implementing the military strategic guideline for a new era, according to the white paper. The path forward for China's national defense in the new era is continuing to strengthen the military in the Chinese way, and its global significance is in the service of building a community with a shared future for mankind, it said. China pursues a nuclear strategy of self-defense, the goal of which is to maintain national strategic security by deterring other countries from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against China, said the white paper on defence. China is always committed to a nuclear policy of no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally, said the white paper. China advocates the ultimate complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China does not engage in any nuclear arms race with any other country and keeps its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security, according to the white paper.China is always committed to a nuclear policy of no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear- weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally, said the white paper.'CHINA PURSUES NUCLEAR STRATEGY OF SELF-DEFENSE' NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 41 ASIA-PACIFIC: A COMMUNITY WITH SHARED DESTINY MISSIONS AND TASKS OF CHINA'S ARMED FORCES China's armed forces endeavour to provide strategic support for consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, protecting China's overseas interests, and promoting world peace and development, said the white paper. The missions and tasks of China's armed forces were laid out in seven aspects: Safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests; Maintaining combat readiness; Carrying out military training in real combat conditions; Safeguarding interests in major security fields; Countering terrorism and maintaining stability; Protecting China's overseas interests; Participating in disaster rescue and relief.China's new paper on national defence highlights the dangers of growing hegemonism, power politics, unilateralism and constant regional conflicts and wars to the international security system. The white paper observed that the world is not yet a tranquil place and underlined that peace, development and win-win cooperation remain the irreversible trends of the times. The pursuit of peace, stability and development has become a universal aspiration of the international community with forces for peace predominating over elements of war, said the white paper. According to the white paper, Asia-Pacific countries are increasingly aware that they are members of a community with shared destiny. Addressing differences and disputes through dialogue and consultation has become a preferred policy option for regional countries, making the region a stable part of the global landscape. But as the world's economic and strategic center continues to shift towards the Asia- Pacific, the region has become a focus of major country competition, bringing uncertainties to regional security, it said. The white paper stressed that China continues to enjoy political stability, ethnic unity and social stability, adding that there has been a notable increase in China's overall national strength, global influence, and resilience to risks. China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development. Nevertheless, it also faces diverse and complex security threats and challenges, the white paper said. Peace, development and win-win cooperation remain the irreversible trends of the times.42 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 The United States is paying the price for launching a trade war, as China is forced to announce the levy of new additional tariffs on US goods. China has announced that it will slap additional tariffs on US imports worth about $75 billion, covering 5,078 US products with additional tariffs of 10 or 5%, in two batches starting on Sept 1 and Dec 15, respectively. The new tariffs will cover vehicles, auto parts and farm produce such as soybean and corn. US farmers and manufacturers will soon feel the brunt. Through more than a year of trade friction between the two countries, China never faltered. When the US side tried to intensify trade bullying and exert maximum pressure on China, it only strengthened China's resolve, making China US is paying price for launching trade war with China stand more firmly against the US bullying, and defend its legitimate rights and interests. China has always believed that cooperation is the only means of resolving trade issues with the US side, but such cooperation comes with preconditions. China strongly opposes US trade hegemony and will never compromise on its fundamental principles. The further some people in the United States go on their dangerous road of hegemony and bullying, the stronger the pushback they will encounter. Right Way Forward In terms of counter measure, China means business.There is no winner in a trade war. Companies from both sides have paid prices. Farmers in some parts of the US have suffered \"devastating impacts\" from the trade war with China, according to US media reports. Tariff escalation has put a significant strain on the US economy, raising costs, undermining investment and sending stocks plunging. The US economy will not be stronger without China. Any discussion of severing ties between US and Chinese companies is ridiculous at best. Companies from both countries have been ambassadors for positive changes to the two economies. Despite the current impasse, constructive engagement is still the right way forward. Some people in the US had imagined their trade war would be \"easy to win.\" They have been proved wrong. The only way to end the trade war is for the US to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, meet China halfway, and find a solution through consultations on the basis of equality and mutual respect.Chinese President Xi Jinping with US President Donald Trump.NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 43 China is not a currency manipulator: Central bank The Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Chen Yulu, has said that the United States Treasury's decision to label China \"a currency manipulator\" is totally wrong. The label, he added, not only violates the common sense of economics and international consensus but fails to meet the quantitative criteria for the so-called \"currency manipulator\" set by the US Department of the Treasury. China has never resorted to competitive devaluation and will not use currency as a tool for competition, Mr Chen said. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis, China was committed to keeping the currency stable, which contributed tremendously to the global economic recovery and stabilization of the international financial market, the deputy governor explained. Since China's currency reform in 2005, the yuan's nominal exchange rate and real exchange rate have appreciated around 40%. Meanwhile, the country's current account surplus declined to 0.4% of the GDP of 2018, down notably from 9.2% in 2005, he said.Market-led Devaluation The yuan's depreciation since the beginning of August should be attributed to market fluctuations caused by the changes in the global economic climate and escalation of trade frictions, Mr Chen said. He stressed that the devaluation, which is decided by market forces, is unrelated to so-called currency manipulation. The trade disputes provoked by the US have triggered fluctuations in the global financial market and at the same time brought volatility to both the US financial market and the US dollar index since 2018, Mr Chen said. \"We hope that the US side should show respect for the truth and resolve the economic and trade disputes with China in a more reasonable and pragmatic way before it goes too far on the wrong path,\" he added.Instead of unfairly labeling China, the US should resolve trade disputes, says Deputy Governor of People's Bank of China. China has never resorted to competitive devaluation and will not use currency as a tool for competition, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Chen Yulu, said.44 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 China's real effective exchange rate (REER) in 2018 is estimated to be at the same level as warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated on August 10. The average REER in 2018 appreciated by about 1.4% relative to 2017, driven by the appreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) (1.5%), the IMF said in a staff report after concluding the annual Article IV consultation to review the Chinese economy. China's current account surplus fell by around 1 percentage point to 0.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018, and it is projected to remain contained at 0.5% of the GDP in 2019, the report noted. \"The external position in 2018 was assessed to be broadly in line with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies,\" the IMF said, consistent with its earlier conclusion in its annual External Sector Report released in July. No Currency Manipulation \"The IMF report makes clear that there has been absolutely no currency manipulation and that China's external balance has been appropriate,\" Jeffrey Sachs, a senior United Nations advisor and renowned economics professor at Columbia University, told Xinhua via email. In response to the IMF estimates through May 2019 which show the REER has depreciated by about 0.2% relative to the 2018 average, Mr Sachs said the unilateral tariff action by the United States \"surely has caused some depreciation\" of the equilibrium REER. \"The US Treasury action declaring China a currency manipulator was blatantly arbitrary, capricious and political, based on Trump's tweets rather than on objective analysis,\" Mr Sachs said.The IMF praises steps taken by China to reduce the financial sector fragilities and advance the economic reform process.IMF report bats for early US-China trade deal \"The IMF report makes clear that there has been absolutely no currency manipulation and that China's external balance has been appropriate,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, a senior United Nations advisor and renowned economics professor at Columbia University. NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 45 Mark Sobel, non-resident senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and US chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, told Xinhua that the Article IV report also notes that China's current account surplus is \"small\", around half of a percent of GDP, and \"that estimates suggest China has not been intervening in the foreign exchange market.\" \"As such, the Article IV clearly rebuffs the recent US assertion that China is 'manipulating' its currency to gain unfair competitive trade advantage or prevent effective balance of payments adjustment,\" said Mr Sobel, who was the US representative at the IMF, and once served as deputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy at the US Department of the Treasury.

Support for Reforms In the IMF report, the executive directors also commended the Chinese authorities' recent reform progress in reducing financial sector fragilities and continuing opening-up of the economy, while underscoring the importance of structural fiscal reforms that can enhance medium-term growth. Welcoming the country's commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based trading system, the executive directors agreed that trade tensions between China and the US should be quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that avoids undermining the international system. The directors also concurred that greater exchange rate flexibility and deeper and better functioning foreign exchange markets would help the financial system prepare for greater capital flow volatility.46 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 In response to the US' accusations that China has not taken concrete action in purchasing US agricultural products, an official with the country's top economic planning agency said \"such accusations are groundless.\" In an interview, Cong Liang, secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said that China has displayed sincerity in cooperation and made good progress in purchasing US agricultural products after the Osaka meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. From the conclusion of the Osaka meet to the end of July, 2.27 million tonnes of US soybeans were shipped to China, and another two million tonnes of soybeans are expected to be loaded in August, said Mr Cong. Of the 14 million tonnes of US soybeans signed in the agreement by enterprises of both countries, only 300,000 tonnes are left to be loaded in September, Mr Cong added. Since July 19, Chinese companies have made enquiries about purchasing US soybeans, sorghum, wheat, corn, cotton, dairy products, hay, ethyl alcohol, soybean oil, wine, beer, fresh and processed fruits and other agricultural products.US charges on agricultural items wrong: NDRC official By the evening of August 2, a number of deals had been concluded, including 130,000 tonnes of soybeans, 120,000 tonnes of sorghum, 60,000 tonnes of wheat and 40,000 tonnes of pork and pork products, according to Mr Cong. Several Similarities \"China and the US are highly complementary in the agricultural sector and the trade of agricultural products is in line with mutual interests of both sides,\" said Mr Cong. He said the reason that some US products, including ethyl alcohol and corn, failed to enter the Chinese market is because their prices are less competitive. \"We hope the US will do more to clear obstacles and create conditions for China's purchase of US agricultural products,\" said Mr Cong.NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 47 The United States' accusation that many of its citizens have died because China failed to prevent fentanyl from entering the country is not true, a senior Chinese anti-drug official said recently. \"It is true that the US has a high death rate from the proliferation of fentanyl-related substances, but the US has only itself to blame for the fentanyl abuse crisis and China is not the main source of fentanyl in the country,\" Liu Yuejin, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission, China's leading drug enforcement body, said in an interview with the China Central Television. \"It is a complete distortion of facts and is totally unacceptable to the Chinese people\". US President Donald Trump recently claimed China had not fulfilled its promise to stop sales of fentanyl to the US, resulting in many deaths from drug abuse. Substances related to fentanyl, a potent opioid painkiller, were approved for medical use in the US in 1968. In recent years, a large number of US citizens have died from fentanyl-related substance abuse. China strictly controls fentanyl-like substances, and, from May, 25 fentanyl analogues were put on China's list of controlled substances, more than the 21 on the US list. \"The control of fentanyl in China is long-term, covering all kinds of fentanyl substances,\" Mr Liu said. \"In contrast, the regulation in the US is temporary and not as complete\". \"The international community, including the US Drug Enforcement Administration, commended China's move,\" he said. Mr Trump had also praised the measure on several occasions, he added. Strong Measures Since the control took effect, China had made unprecedented efforts in addressing the fentanyl issue in terms of issuing laws and regulations, conducting an overall market inspection, and stepping up police investigation. According to data provided by the US DEA, only four cases of fentanyl trafficking from China were reported by the US Customs and Border Protection in the second quarter of this year, Mr Liu said. \"This indicates that the measures we have taken have shown great results. However, deaths caused by fentanyl abuse in the US remain high. Thus it is impossible for China to be a major source of fentanyl in the US,\" he added. Mr Liu also said that the Chinese government has always attached great importance to drug control and maintained a zero-tolerance attitude toward drugs. \"It will keep its promise to strictly control substances related to fentanyl and promote global drug control.\"US Fentanyl Claim a 'Distortion of Facts' Since the control took effect, China had made unprecedented efforts in addressing the fentanyl issue in terms of issuing laws and regulations, conducting an overall market inspection, and stepping up police investigation.48 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 Hong Kong: Law and order must be upheld ecently, a series of protests and violent incidents took place in Hong Kong, China, drawing wide attention from the international community. I noticed that most of the news in the Indian media on the situation in Hong Kong is sourced from the West and little is from China. One can only find truth after listening to all sides of the story. To lay out the facts and tell the truth, I wish to share with Indian friends what I know about what's happening in Hong Kong and China's perspective. On the face of it, the protests were triggered by the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. The amendment was meant to solve individual criminal cases and plug legal loopholes to uphold fairness and justice. To end disputes and maintain stability, the Hong Kong government later suspended the bill. Primacy of Law However, instigated by certain forces, some people took to the streets illegally without required approval. Some protesters blocked the streets for long hours and impeded traffic; some radical ones even stormed the Hong Kong Legislative Council building, destroyed public facilities, attacked the police with petrol bombs and damaged the national flag of China. These activities are way beyond the scope of peaceful protest and seriously undermine the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong. These flagrant violent activities are by no means \"defense of democracy and freedom\". Laws must be followed and lawbreakers must be brought to justice, this is the basic norm in any society under the rule of law. The most important task for Hong Kong now is to punish the violent criminal acts according to the law, restore social stability as soon as possible and safeguard law and order. The Hong Kong government has strictly enforced the law, acted decisively, ensured the safety of life and property of Hong Kong people and upheld the sanctity of the rule OPINION Li Bijian Minister & Deputy Chief of Mission, Embassy of PRC in IndiaNEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 49 of law in Hong Kong. Their efforts should not be smeared. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have launched large-scale gatherings to safeguard Hong Kong and call for the rule of law; they represent the real mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong. Don't Destabilise Hong Kong Instigation and interference by certain external forces is a major cause for disorder in Hong Kong. Some countries sympathize with and tolerate the violent activities, but criticize the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong police for preventing violence and disorder according to law. This is equating violence to protest and law enforcement to repression. This shows that certain forces are attempting to destabilize Hong Kong and hamper China's development. What happened in Hong Kong is China's internal affair, and no country or organization has the right to interfere. China will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Some say the recent disorder in Hong Kong is a serious setback for the \"One country, Two systems\" policy. In fact, the opposite is true. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the Central Government of China and government of Hong Kong have firmly implemented the principle of \"One country, Two systems\". Hong Kong's business environment and international competitiveness have been widely recognized by the international community. Hong Kong residents enjoy unprecedented democratic rights and broad freedom. Hong Kong is a front- runner in the world's rule of law index. All facts indicate that \"One country, Two systems\" is the best institutional arrangement to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. Common Prosperity Disorder in Hong Kong not only hurts China. The favorable business environment has made Hong Kong the largest receiver of foreign direct investment. Nearly 7,000 foreign companies operate in Hong Kong and 600,000 foreigners live there. Hong Kong's prosperity is the result of its own efforts as well as contributions of all countries, including India. Tolerating the rampage of violent activities means burdening those who care for Hong Kong with the costs of violence and destruction. India and Hong Kong have close economic and trade ties. A large number of Indian citizens do business and live in Hong Kong. We believe India can understand and support the decisions made by the Chinese side and make an independent judgment. We hope that Indian friends can uphold fairness and justice, and look at the situation in Hong Kong in a rational light and come to an objective and correct conclusion. (This article was first published in Hindustan Times) What happened in Hong Kong is China's internal affair, and no country or organization has the right to interfere. China will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 50 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 Rising Violence Paralyses Asia's Financial Hub Timely end of chaos in Hong Kong holds the key to protecting its economic and social foundations. Radicalized protests and escalating violence in Hong Kong have weighed down the Asian financial hub and compromised the well-being of its seven million residents. The Hong Kong International Airport, which handles nearly 200,000 passengers a day, has been hit by unauthorized protests, leading to cancelation of flights. The illegal gathering has also caused serious traffic jams along the expressways around the airport and affected the commutes of local residents. The scenes in the city - people carrying weapons, smashing facilities, setting fires, blocking main streets and harassing passers-by, closed shops, and deserted roads - bear little resemblance to the dynamic and cosmopolitan Hong Kong.NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 51 China Urges US to Stop Interfering in Hong Kong Affairs China has urged the United States to stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs. The remarks came as Hua Chunying, a spokesperson with the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responded to a query about the \"color revolution\" label in Hong Kong. The US side has frequently made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs, which confused black from white and incited trouble, Ms Hua added. Some key politicians and diplomatic officials from the US, who have interacted with pro-democracy rioters and unjustly accused the Chinese central government, are conniving in violence and illegal acts, jeopardizing prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, the spokesperson said. With all facts, Ms Hua wondered \"what the real intention of the US is\" and \"what the US is using Hong Kong for.\" Urging the US to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations, and promptly stop meddling in China's internal affairs, Ms Hua reiterated that Hong Kong belongs to China and its affairs are purely China's internal ones.Economy Hit Hong Kong's gross domestic product in the second quarter increased by only 0.6% in real terms year on year with the three sectors of catering, tourism and retailing hit the hardest. Visitor arrivals and the hotel occupancy rate reported double-digit reductions in July and tourism business operators had their average revenue drop by almost 80% in the past two months, year on year. By taking a look at the regions around the world that underwent \"color revolutions\", instigated by the western forces, one sees case after case of civil war, social disorder, ethnic conflict and human suffering. This cannot become the future of Hong Kong. Breaking their Silence An increasing number of Hong Kong residents have broken their silence by standing against violence and voicing their support for the rule of law. They have expressed the Hong Kong people's common will that the chaos can last no longer. It is the common aspiration of the Hong Kong people to stop violence and the chaos, so that Hong Kong can restore order and return to prosperity and harmony. Anyone who harms the city will surely be severely punished by law and condemned by the people.52 | NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 We Won't Allow Anyone to Tarnish our National Image Hong Kong residents gather to express reverence to Chinese national emblem and flag.

These kinds of acts should never be tolerated,\" said a participant. To the music of Ode to the Motherland, they unfurled several Chinese national flags and waved banners that read \"safeguarding the national dignity.\" Later, they sang the national anthem of China, drawing attention and acclaim from a large crowd of passers-by in a luxury shopping district in Tsim Sha Tsui of the Kowloon Peninsula.NEWS FROM CHINA | CHINA-INDIA REVIEW | AUGUST 2019 | 53 To the music of Ode to the Motherland , they unfurled several Chinese national flags and waved banners that read \"safeguarding the national dignity.\" Later, they sang the national anthem of China, drawing attention and acclaim from passers-by.\"As Chinese, we were all saddened by recent acts of insulting the national emblem and flag,\" said the organizer of the gathering, who only gave his surname Lim. \"We won't allow anyone to tarnish our national image.\" Over the past several days, radical protesters twice removed the Chinese national flags from the flagpole at the pier and flung the flags into the water. \"A national flag represents the dignity of a country. These insulting acts drew an outpouring of anger from all Chinese,\" said an elderly participant named Hsui Kit Fan. During a demonstration in July, some radical protesters attacked the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and defaced the national emblem. \"We were all furious over the recent incidents of insulting our national emblem and flag. These kinds of acts should never be tolerated,\" said another participant surnamed Wong. Ms Wong said many of her family members are working in the police force and she felt sad to see them work day and night to keep public order. \"I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,\" she said. Punish the Protesters In a statement issued by the participants, they called on the law enforcement agencies of Hong Kong to swiftly bring the perpetrators who insulted the national emblem and flag to justice. \"The perpetrators must face severe punishment. This is the only way to prevent the situation from getting worse,\" said the statement. Over the past two months, protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, threatening social order and endangering public safety.
