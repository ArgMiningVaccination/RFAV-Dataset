This means you are required to wear a hospital provided mask. A mask must be worn when inside the hospital structure or any of the buildings that provide medical, dental, or behavioral health care . Mask -free zones include Administration, Aztec, Library, and the Warehouse. Masks must cover the nose and mouth. When masks are removed, they must be discarded and not be re -used nor can they be worn around the neck. Masks should be discarded when moist, contaminated, or when the integrity of the mask has been altered. Masks can be obtained from Central Sterile. Hand Hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and disinfection of work spaces with the hospital approved disinfectant are other important elements. The mask directive is effective throughout the influenza season ( November 1 -March 31st) and during other periods of increased influenza activity as defined by the CDC and/or health department authorities. Failure to comply with the policy is subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services, and/or IHS policy , and relevant sections of the collective bargaining agreement.
