It's often seen in teas that support sleep, upset stomach, calming, and overall de-stressing. While this delightfully sunny, little herb can certainly do these things, it has many other highly useful benefits.](https://swiha.edu/western-herbalism-program/) Have you ever accidentally over steeped a cup of chamomile tea? The longer the tea sits, the more its bitter properties will come through. Bitters are excellent to use in cases of digestive concerns such as indigestion, bloating, colic, and gas. Some bitters can be harsh and should be used with great care. Yet chamomile is very mild for a bitter. It is gentle and pleasantly flavorful, so it is often given to children suffering from colic. Some bitters are so unpalatable, many adults will avoid ingesting them, making chamomile a favorable choice. Another use for this herb is for anti-inflammatory properties. This action can be external or internal. Externally, a salve can be used for burns, insect bites, and wound healing. It's very effective and often used with calendula, which also promotes the healing process. Internally, this herb has an affinity for the digestive system. So think of chamomile for IBS, inflammation of the digestive tract, nausea, or indigestion. Another specific use is for the relief of gout and acidic buildup that some people suffer from after eating red meat. It is definitely important to buy a dried, high quality chamomile to get a therapeutic effect from drinking the tea. If you do buy pre-bagged teas, find a respectable brand and use several bags per cup. Chamomile is often thought of as a tea you only drink at night to relax or induce sleeping. There is so much more value and purpose! This herb is very effective at supporting a multitude of digestive system issues, as well as having positive effects on the nervous system. It is great for combatting insomnia, anxiety, and restlessness. It also happens to be an herb that is very effective in different forms. Salves, teas, and tinctures are all great delivery systems for chamomile. As with any herb, try to do some research in brands so you can buy the best quality available, in order to receive the most benefit from the plant remedy. Whether you are building an herbal first aid kit or stocking herbal remedies, never go without chamomile!
