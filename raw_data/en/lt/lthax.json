This is a fundamental human right. Health is one of our most precious goods and is a crucial precondition for our individual, social, economic and political development and stability. The impact of health - whether positive or negative - is heightened by the globalised nature of today's world. It follows that we should look at health from a global perspective. Therefore, health needs to be addressed globally and both ensured and improved through joint global action. 2 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentGlobal Health Strategy of the German Federal Government3Foreword: Germany's role in Global Health The topic of global health has risen sharply up the political agenda over recent years, both in Germany and at international level. Global health and the mechanisms to protect it are elements of the global order. The COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted the enormous breadth of damage that can be caused by a global health crisis. Its impact on public health and the resulting humanitarian and socio-economic consequences affect every area of our lives. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides the framework for political commitment by the German Federal Government in the area of global health and underpins its strategy: Health is crucial not only to our well-being and to social cohesion and inclusion; it is also result and indicator of the social, economic and envi - ronmental dimensions of sustainable develop - ment. Nearly all the agreed sustainability goals set out in the 2030 Agenda have important links to health. Global health illustrates the need for international and multilateral cooperation and for overarching, cross-sectoral approaches that bring together all the relevant stakeholders. One of the most important duties of any government is to promote and safeguard public health, both within its own borders and as part of its international engagement. The 2030 Agenda emphasises the conviction held by the community of states that global challenges can only be solved together. Multilateralism and strong international organisations help us to implement this approach. The Federal Government has drawn up this strategy, with a time frame from 2020-2030, in order to meet Germany's international respon - sibilities with even greater determination. The objective of this strategy is to ensure that Germany's engagement in the field of global health is effective and sustainable to make an important contribution to the health of all people worldwide by 2030. To this end, the Federal Government will continue to promote interna - tional cooperation, build and expand strategic partnerships and in particular strength en the World Health Organization (WHO). With this strategy, the German government addresses new challenges, sets new goals and contributes to coordination and cooperation between all actors. The strategy also demonstrates the Federal Government's commitment to global health policy and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that relate to health , above all SDG 3 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages'. The strategy's implementation will be under - pinned by the government's financial policy and appropriate budget allocations. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government4Germany will focus on system-oriented action and on interfaces, where - in line with the One Health approach - it can achieve the greatest possible success through joint, cross-sectoral action. We want to harness the new opportunities created by digitalisation to maximum effect. The Federal Government's priorities are to: promote health and disease prevention mitigate the health impacts of climate change strengthen health systems and facilitate the provision of universal health coverage (UHC) without discrimination safeguard public health protection, including measures to protect against epidemics and pandemics and through continued medical assistance in humanitarian contexts foster global health research and innovation.Work with partners and strengthen alliances and forums at national, international and multilateral levelPrioritise areas in which German political engagement, expertise and competencies can be used bestIn terms of global health, the German Government is pursuing the following strategic objectives: Global health challenges can only be success - fully tackled through connected, coordinated and joint approaches. The global health archi - tecture is currently undergoing a process of renewal that will require all actors to make adjustments and coordinate more effectively. Intensive consultation and close cooperation between all actors are essential to ensure that Germany can provide an effective interna - tional response to health risks. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need for a properly functioning multilateral system and effective UN organisations. To this end, the Federal Government intends to: strengthen its global health policy engagement as a member of relevant international bodies strengthen multilateralism and further develop the global health architecture, with WHO playing a leading and coordinating role expand its regional partnerships. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government5Germany needs to maintain a clear international profile so that it can help shape effective solutions to global health policy challenges. Agreed and targeted actions will be required at various levels to ensure that bilateral and multilateral cooper - ation contribute effectively to improvements in global health. The Federal Government intends to: further develop consultation mechanisms within the Federal Government promote dialogue and exchange on global health issues, also involving non-state actors, and further strengthen Germany as a hub for global health advance the further internationalisation of relevant institutions promote the deployment of German experts and young professionals in international health organisations and bodies make funding available to help shape responses to global health policy challenges review progress towards implementation of the strategy half-way through its prescribed term. The strategy was developed in a consultation process that also drew on the experience and expertise of non-state actors in Germany representing civil society, the private sector, the scientific community, young people and think tanks. In addition, advice was specifically sought from international experts through the International Advisory Board on Global Health. Germany will build on what has already been achieved and maintain its role as a reliable partner to ensure continuity and sustainability. This new strategy builds on the Federal Govern - ment's 2013 strategy paper entitled Shaping Global Health - Taking Joint Action - Embracing Responsibility , in which it first defined Germany's contribution in this policy area. Ensure coherent action at different levels and in different forums Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government 6 The impact of health - whether positive or negative - is heightened by the globalised nature of today's world. It follows that we should look at health from a global perspective. Therefore, health needs to be addressed globally and both ensured and improved through joint global action.7 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentThe impact of health - whether positive or negative - is heightened by the globalised nature of today's world. It follows that we should look at health from a global perspective. Therefore, health needs to be addressed globally and both ensured and improved through joint global action.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government8Guiding principles for German engagement Germany advocates actions that are based on values and rules. Alongside the principles of democracy and partnership, Germany's engage - ment in global health rests on the foundations of human dignity, the rule of law, stability, free dom, diversity, solidarity and respect for human rights. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in particular its health- related goals provide the framework for action by the German Federal Government at the political level and underpin its strategy. All policy matters should be considered with due regard for the social, environ mental and economic dimensions of sustainability. The specific goals of the 2030 Agenda are all consistent with a set of five guiding principles known as the 5 Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership) and with the pledge to 'leave no one behind'. Box 1: The 2030 Agenda. The Health Goal and how it links to other sustainability goals. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents a commitment by the global community to pursue economic development around the world with due regard for social justice and our planet's ecological limits. Health is one of the 17 global SDGs. SDG 3 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages' consists of 13 specific targets. The most important of these relate to UHC, a reduction in deaths and illnesses from communicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), improved mental health services, sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol, the management of global health risks and a reduction in the number of illnesses caused by exposure to environmental pollution. Progress towards 13 other sustainability goals will also contribute significantly to health outcomes in addition to those improvements achieved under SDG 3. These are often referred to as health-related SDGs . For example, SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 5 (Gender Equality - in particular the associated improvements in sexual and reproductive health) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) all play a role in delivering wider public health benefits. The aim of improving health outcomes worldwide is closely linked to other SDGs. In fact, all 17 of the individual goals set out in the 2030 Agenda interact in many ways and can be achieved only if progress is also made towards the other goals. The 2030 Agenda requires a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to implementation. Interdisciplinary cooperation and research are needed to create a robust foundation that will allow us to identify priorities and avoid negative interactions. We can also use this structure to address global health barriers in other policy areas, balance out conflicting objectives, harness synergies, maximise impacts and reduce costs.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government9 The Federal Government: is committed to protecting and promoting human rights all over the world. The right to life and to the highest attainable standard of health must be protected. The ob - jective of the Federal Government's work in the field of global health is to facilitate continuous progress in fulfilment of the human right to the highest attainable standard of health. In this context, as with all other economic, social and cultural rights, states must work towards full achievement of this right (progression impera - tive). International help and cooperation should also be available where required. In particular, the Federal Government's strategy emphasises gender equality, support for women and girls and protection of sexual and reproductive health and rights. It aims to reduce levels of physical, mental and sexual violence as well as stigma - tisation, moral prejudice and criminalisation, all of which make it harder for highly vulnerable groups to protect themselves from disease. The Federal Government is also committed to a human rights-based approach in relation to health protection. This includes a commitment to protect those providing humanitarian assistance and health services. At present, access to health facilities, medical treatment, medicines and vaccines is by no means universal and often depends on eco - nomic factors, national or social origin, skin colour, gender or other determinants. Germany is involved in international efforts to combat discrimination and gender inequality within the health sector, and to protect and promote the health of all marginalised and vulnerable groups. This involves promoting transparent, evidence- based, efficient and participatory decision- making processes, responsibility and the rule of law. The Federal Government tackles corrup - tion and promotes financial accountability in the public sector. All partners are treated as equals. They set their own priorities and benefit from long-term capacity-building measures that take account of and incorporate existing structures. The Federal Government promotes active civil society participation and strong, community-based structures with due regard for the interests of different population groups. Evidence-based assessments play a key role in ensuring that resources are allocated effectively according to needs. This maximises the benefits while avoiding harmful impacts.is committed to observing international humanitarian law and respect for humanitarian principles. is committed to non-discriminatory, gender-sensitive, inclusive and barrier-free health structures and services.is committed to good governance as a prerequisite for all efforts to protect and promote the right to the highest attainable standard of health. is committed to participation, empower - ment and a needs-based approach.10 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentHuman rights are indivisible and interdependent. It follows that all interventions in this field must adopt a holistic approach, and that health, welfare, economic development, security and stability are inextricably linked. Interactions between different policy areas and sectors must be actively managed through a 'health in all policies' approach. This involves taking steps to avoid unwanted side-effects ('do no harm') and to create or maintain resilient structures that are capable of dealing with future challenges. The most suitable course of action is the One Health approach, which is based on the cross-sec - toral, integrated management of health risks. This interdisciplinary approach focuses on the complex relationships between human and animal health and the protection of the environ - ment. It is vital to consider these human-ani - mal-environment links as they help us to under - stand where health risks originate, how climate change may affect our health and what effective mea sures we can take to prevent future pandem - ics, tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), control neglected tropical diseases associated with poverty and improve food security.considers all systems in their entirety. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government11I. Establishing strategic priorities Germany will focus on system-oriented action and on interfaces, where it can achieve the greatest possible success through joint, cross- sectoral action. Priority will be given to areas in which German political engagement, expertise and competencies can be used best. Meeting global health objectives and in particular the targets set out in the 2030 Agenda will require much more rapid and ambitious action. Germany will remain a reliable partner, ensuring continuity and building on what has already been achieved. Health emergencies can have serious conse - quences for the stability of individual states and entire regions. It follows that Germany should also be at the table helping to shape forward- looking international policies on global health. That includes improving health systems and strengthening pandemic resilience in order to mitigate the impact of future crises. This reflects the broader concept of security adopted by the Federal Government, which it is pursuing among others in the UN Security Council. 1. Promoting good health, preventing diseases and developing adequate responses Measures to promote good health, prevent illness and develop greater health literacy have a crucial influence on the incidence and clinical trajectory of both communicable diseases as well as non- communicable diseases (NCDs). Against the background of demographic change, Germany commits itself to an integrated, health-driven, holistic and 'life-course' approach to disease prevention that reflects people's individual circumstances and includes disease-specific measures. This approach includes promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing health barriers by promoting gender equality. Social determinants (e.g. poverty, origin, living conditions and education), behaviours (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity and poor diet) and environmental factors are all closely linked to NCDs and other health outcomes and need to be addressed using more innovative approaches. The Federal Government also wishes to promote education, prevent physical, mental and sexual violence and improve the social, political and economic participation of girls and women, including protecting them from child marriage, sexual violence and genital mutilation. Every year, millions of people worldwide suffer or even die from occupational diseases or due to accidents at their workplace. Against this back - ground, there is clearly a need, especially at global level, for effective occupational safety regimes to protect workers from injury and damage to their health. Through its comprehensive system of labour standards, the International Labour Organization (ILO) plays an important role in support of this approach.Germany will: promote health and disease prevention, take action to reduce the health impacts of climate change, strengthen health systems and facilitate the provision of UHC without discrimination, take comprehensive and long-term action to safeguard public health, including measures to protect against epidemics and pandemics, and continue to provide medical assistance in humanitarian contexts, foster global health research and innovation.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government12Wherever possible, key risk factors should be addressed in conjunction. This makes it possible to harness available synergies and avoid dupli - cating existing structures. The primary focus is on people and on enabling them to adopt a healthy lifestyle. The ability to find, understand and use health-related information is crucial as it helps people to remain healthy and combat disease. Individual and environmental factors also have a significant influence on how people deal with health information in digital form. Therefore, the Federal Government promotes health literacy among all age groups and sex, especially among vulnerable groups. Extensive use is made of social media and innovative digital solutions. Germany's strategy for controlling infectious diseases affords a key role to numerous global organisations, initiatives, alliances and funds with a good track record in their respective fields, in particular the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Stop TB Partnership; the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF); the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP); the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X); the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Development Hub (Global AMR R&D Hub) and various UN programmes and organisations such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). GFATM, Gavi and GPEI are among Germany's key funding partners for local development programmes in their specific areas. UNAIDS has the lead role in coordinating meas - ures to curb HIV. Its multi sectoral structure incorporates other responsible UN and civil society organisations. Efforts to treat many infectious diseases are hampered by increasing AMR. There is an urgent need for greater joint and coordinated action based on the One Health approach, for example as part of the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well- being for All. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways of protecting people against infectious diseases. In this context, the Federal Government is committed to expanding current vaccination programmes, with a focus on ensuring e quitable access to vaccines. Thanks to effective pro - grammes, the complete eradication of diseases such as polio is now within reach. Germany also supports the development of new vaccines against particularly dangerous or novel patho - gens through its engagement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). At international level, Germany will support efforts to establish conditions under which children can grow into healthy adults who can age with dignity and the right to self-determi - nation. In particular, it will support strategies designed to strengthen nutrition literacy, keep people active and promote physical activity. To facilitate effective health promotion and disease prevention, the Federal Government will strive to bring about the required cooperation between different policy areas and levels. Germany will strengthen research into motivational approaches that encourage more physical activity. It will support cooperation between UN organisations and funds on the issue of balanced diets. This is particularly important in the case of women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Global guidelines and processes designed to create sustainable food systems and therefore improve public health will also be supported. Alongside these policy-making actions, the Federal Government will implement programmes in its partner countries to increase food security, provide safe drinking water and improve sanitation. It will conduct interdiscipli - nary research both in Germany and in partner countries to identify what steps can be taken to promote healthy diets at the food production and marketing stage and through collaboration Germany will: strengthen the knowledge base and inter - national dialogue on health promotion, health literacy and disease prevention, as well as push for cross-cutting action to promote public health.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government13between policy areas. One important objective is to support implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the first-ever global treaty on health. Consideration will also be given to a range of environmental factors, e.g. the impact of air quality on health. Additionally, Germany will promote health literacy among the wider public at both individual and structural level, e.g. through national and international research initiatives. WHO plays an important role in controlling both communicable diseases and NCDs. It develops and harmonises guidelines, standards and methodologies for all actors in the health sector. Germany favours an integrated approach that reduces the number of parallel disease-specific structures. Germany will support proposals to incorporate safe and healthy working conditions into the ILO framework of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Germany will engage in international pro - grammes set up to conduct research into AMR and develop effective new antibiotics. The Federal Government will fund the implementa - tion of new multisectoral approaches based on prevention. It will work to strengthen global expertise and structures and support the efforts of multi-stakeholder partnerships to combat AMR. Partner countries will be offered multi - lateral and bilateral support to develop and implement national action plans, primarily in the areas of hygiene, diagnosis, regulation and surveillance and the prudent use of antibiotics. During interepidemic phases, the Federal Govern - ment will strengthen international capacities to respond to future health crises by further developing vaccination platforms, e.g. through the global CEPI initiative. Vaccination pro - grammes will be set up to control the spread of infection. Germany will also work to ensure equitable access to vaccines (and other essential drugs) in order to control infectious diseases, especially in countries with a weak health system. The Federal Government's key partners in this field will be Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and GPEI, which employ approaches designed to strengthen local health systems under the auspices of WHO as the coordinating body. These partnerships and funds will play a crucial role in achieving a significant reduction in the disease burden caused by communicable diseases by 2030. In this context, the Federal Government will support the development and implementation of an approach that simultaneously strengthens health systems as a whole.strengthen the leading, normative and standard-setting role of WHO in the area of communicable diseases and NCDs and advocate the pooling of expertise on curbing NCDs at WHO. push for stronger occupational safety within the ILO framework. engage more intensively with inter national efforts to reduce AMR and expand research into antibiotics.promote research into vaccines, maintain vaccine platforms and expand vaccination programmes both in Germany and around the world. support successful and coordinated global partnerships and funds set up to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government14Germany supports the WHO to play a leading role in controlling and coordinating the response to neglected and poverty-related tropical diseases.Germany will remain a key supporter of GPEI and will use its membership of relevant bodies to ensure that developed capacities are sustainable.provide targeted support for the inclusion in multilateral strategies and international forums of neglected and poverty- related tropical diseases, as well as promote research and improve treatment.work with partners to eradicate polio rapidly. Box 2: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) AMR is a growing threat to global health. It could have a far-reaching negative impact on public health and on growth and global economic stability. Germany has placed the issue of AMR as a top priority on the international agenda during its presidency of the G7 and G20 and will continue to engage with its partners on this issue. Controlling the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance will require a cross-sectoral approach, for example under the auspices of the Tripartite Collaboration on AMR, which involves WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). WHO's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance provides useful and globally relevant guidance on joint action. It contains elements like establishing surveillance systems, strengthening disease prevention, the prudent use of antibiotics, skills training for medical personnel and support for research and development. The Federal Government will firmly support the implementation of WHO's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance based on the One Health approach. Through multi - lateral and bilateral approaches such as the Global Health Protection Programme (GHPP), it will help other countries to develop and implement national action plans and to establish and expand surveillance systems that allow for greater monitoring of AMR. The Federal Government is a key WHO supporter in the field of AMR. For example, it funded work on the Priority Pathogens List (PPL), developed by WHO, which identifies the highest-risk bacterial pathogens. The PPL is now used as a reference by many researchers. To underpin research policy on antibiotics, the Federal Government has supported work on several WHO antibiotic pipeline reports. With a view to invigorating research and development, it supports existing global initiatives such as the product development partnership Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Development Hub (Global AMR R&D Hub), the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR), the Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X), the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and the TB Alliance for New Anti-Tuberculosis Medicines (TB Alliance). The Federal Government will continue to promote research and development in the field of AMR through these and other initiatives.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government152. Holistic approaches to the environment, climate change and public health Our health and well-being also depend on environmental factors. Climate change has wide-ranging and to some extent unpredictable implications for human health. Higher temper - atures, the increasing exploitation of previously undisturbed habitats and the resulting proximity to wild animals can increase the risk of trans - mission of infectious diseases from animals to humans (zoonoses) or of their emergence in new regions. Extreme weather events such as flood - ing can also increase the spread of vector-borne diseases. Equally, climate change can lead to an increase in NCDs. Heat waves can damage our health and even cause (more) deaths. More people will need medical attention. Existing health conditions may be exacerbated, and new diseases may emerge. All these scenarios have implica -tions for our health services. Climate change will also affect health systems, for example if health care facilities are inadequately protected against solar radiation, heat, heavy rain and flooding. The Federal Government will therefore strive to protect the climate and the environment with a view to protecting health. This will involve identifying and minimising environmental and climate impacts that could damage human health while also helping to adapt health care systems to climate change and mitigate the anticipated impacts. These challenges can only be addressed through an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach. At present, the health sector is still a net contri b- utor to CO2 emissions. It should instead take on a pioneer role to reduce our climate impact by becoming climate neutral. Box 3: Interactions between health, the climate and the environment require interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches The adverse impacts of climate change on health were set out in the preamble to the 2015 Paris Agreement in relation to the 'right to health'. The need to improve global health is a powerful argument in favour of ambi - tious measures to limit climate change. A 'planetary health approach' is one that spans multiple disciplines and simultaneously considers human health, political, economic and social systems and the health of the Earth's natural systems on which our civilisation depends. By contrast, the One Health approach focuses more on the interactions between people, animals and the environment to help us understand global health risks and identify appropriate responses to those risks. This interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach also stresses that the present and future health and well-being of people and animals depend on the global community taking responsibility for protecting the environment.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government16 The Federal Government is committed to the SDGs set out in the 2030 Agenda, meeting the obligations under the Paris Agreement and pro - tecting biodiversity. It will use its influence at international level to push for the implementa - tion of these goals and obligations across all sec - tors. Through partnerships, the Federal Govern - ment will help other countries to conduct health, climate and environmental research, to achieve their climate and sustainability goals and to protect vulnerable groups from the consequences of climate change. Germany will support its partner countries in the areas of safe drinking water, sanitation, wastewater management, air quality, food security, consumer protection and climate and environmental action at community level. Germany will work to ensure that potential health risks created by habitat and biodiversity loss can be identified and reduced at an early stage. Germany will support international mechanisms to share research and best practice, e.g. on clean air regulation, renewable energy use at health facilities and the preparation of heat action plans. Action will also be required to raise awareness among health workers, disaster relief personnel, teachers and members of other professions since they can play an important role as sources of information and advice and can make a signif - icant contribution towards wider efforts to ad - dress the health, economic and social challenges facing vulnerable groups as a result of changing environmental conditions and to create aware - ness among the wider public.Based on a One Health approach, Germany will engage in efforts to strengthen interdisciplinary research into the impact of environmental and climate changes on health and research into efficient prevention, adaptation and protective measures. It is particularly important to har - ness synergies (e.g. changing patterns of mobil - ity and diet) with the potential both to improve public health and protect the environment and climate. In this context, there will be a greater focus on the implications of climate change for food security and the availability of drinking water. Recognising that environmental tech - nologies such as renewable energy systems can significantly improve both human health and the health of the environment, Germany will scale up investment in their development. Implementation of the Paris Agreement will reduce the risk from invasive species, which are increasingly migrating into areas outside their natural range. The Research Initiative for the Conservation of Biodiversity aims to preserve, restore and promote the sustainable use of intact ecosystems in order to minimise direct contact between humans and wild animals. The Federal Government will intensify its engagement in the area of chemical safety and push for the effective and rapid post-2020 implementation of an international chemicals management regime and of the WHO Chemicals Road Map. Germany will also push for the implementation of further international agreements on hazardous substances (including pesticides) and work to improve the manage - ment of waste from health facilities.Germany will: take action at international level and togeth - er with its partner countries to identify and reduce health risks caused by environmental factors, climate change and global biodi - versity loss and to promote cross-sectoral cooperation on health issues. push for greater international action to counter in particular the health impact of climate change and systematically increase its engagement in this area.systematically promote and expand research into the nexus between the environment, climate change, biodiversity, health and health systems. promote a safe chemicals management regime worldwide. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government17In partnership with Europe and in cooperation with the chemical industry, Germany will test new methods. Human biomonitoring measures the concentration of chemicals in the body in order to produce knowledge and gender-disag - gregated data for use in risk-reduction strategies for specific target groups. Germany will also support monitoring and research projects for measuring levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment worldwide. In addition, Germany will support the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) to identify and address environmental risks to human health and will work to amplify the impact of the Centre's findings. To protect the environment and public health more effectively, all interna - tional action should observe the 'precautionary' principle and the 'polluter pays' principle. Box 4: European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) WHO's European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) was set up in Bonn in 1991 and acts as a centre of scientific excellence of the WHO Regional Office for Europe. ECEH provides member states with evidence of existing and newly emerging environmental risks to human health. It also develops corresponding guidelines (e.g. on air quality and noise pollution) and helps member states to draw up and implement risk control stra - tegies. The Federal Government supports WHO's mandate in the areas of health and environment and through its engagement to support ECEH underlines the importance of protecting the environment in the interests of public health. 3. Strengthening health systems UHC means that all population groups have access to all necessary, appropriate and high- quality health services, without barriers or discrimination and regardless of their financial resources. In this context, the term 'health services' includes not only treatments for illness but also health promotion, disease prevention, rehabilitation and palliative care. The goal of the global community is to achieve UHC, including protection against financial hardship, for all people by the year 2030. In the UN's 2019 Political Declaration on Universal Health Coverage member states worldwide commit to intensify their efforts to achieve universal health coverage. Measures to strength - en health systems are the key to achieving UHC. Germany is keen to develop and implement a system-oriented approach. Improving the performance and resilience of health systems will require national, regional and global measures in three interrelated policy areas: service delivery, health financing and manage - ment. Germany supports a focus on inclusive, people-centred health structures. Specialised health services should be integrated in such a way that they strengthen the entire health system. Health services designed to protect and promote reproductive and sexual health are seen as fundamental components of such essential services. They have a far-reaching impact beyond their immediate health benefits: For example, access to modern family-planning methods allows girls and women to exercise more control over their own lives. They can attend school for longer and without interruption, and there - fore access a wider range of vocational training opportunities. In turn, this improves their economic prospects and leads to greater social participation.support initiatives to generate knowledge and data for use in risk-reduction strategies.Today's health systems face new demands in response, for example, to population growth, demographic ageing and the emergence of new health risks. To ensure that people have access to adequate basic health services and protect them against financial hardship due to spending on health care, it is increasingly important to use the available resources as effectively as possible and establish sustainable, target group-specific approaches to health financing based on the principle of solidarity. In this context, it is vital to prioritize those services whose role is to prevent and identify diseases at an early stage and to those designed to prevent and control epidemics. 18 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentGlobal Health Strategy of the German Federal Government19 Germany will continue to call on multilateral and international actors in all policy areas to adopt methods that strengthen global health systems. The objective is to reduce health inequalities and to protect and promote the health of women, children and adolescents, people with disabilities and other marginalised and vulnerable groups. Together with other countries, Germany will maintain its active support - both in international processes and on the ground - for universal access to sexual and reproductive health services and the corresponding rights and for protection against physical, mental and sexual violence. In addition to the above commitments, Germany will support partner countries in other relevant policy areas, for example to help provide com - prehensive sexuality education programmes at schools. In this context, Germany will strive to bring about improvements in the quality of provision and patient safety. For example, depending on the needs of each partner country, this may involve process support for the development of national strategies, measures to reinforce systems designed to raise public awareness of health issues, advice and support for partners wishing to set up national and regional registration and super - visory agencies, help to build up administrative capacity and infrastructure, support for the initial and ongoing training of health personnel and advice on job creation in the health sector. As an integral component of its approach, Germany will support the efforts of partner countries to promote sustainable digital trans - formation processes (e.g. 'digital by default') designed to improve UHC. Germany will also promote knowledge transfers and the estab - lishment of patient safety networks within the scientific community, at policy-making level and in practice. The global patient safety summits of health ministers initiated by Germany are a cornerstone of this approach. German initiatives in this area have been strengthened by WHO's recognition of patient safety as a priority health goal and by the inclusion of patient safety in the list of issues addressed by the G20. Germany will strengthen the role of civil society organ - isations, for example by inviting them to join decision-making bodies, and will establish and support regulatory mechanisms so that patients can assert their rights. The Federal Government will adopt a system- oriented approach combining research and development, testing vaccines for safety and effectiveness, drugs, medical products, medical aids and medical technology, production and storage quality, local availability, equitable access, affordability and protection for industrial property rights with due regard for international agreements. As a special UN agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) plays an important role in matters of intellectual prop - erty rights. In this context, Germany will strive to bring about close cooperation between WHO, WIPO and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It will push for greater action against counterfeit and sub-standard medicines and for more infor - mation to be made available to patients. It will also cooperate more intensively with the respon - sible public authorities in the European Union (EU) and worldwide to ensure that people around the world have equitable access to vaccines, medicines and medical products.Germany will: intensify its international commitment to strengthen health systems. work at international level and with its part - ner countries to provide discrimination-free health services and meet agreed targets on sexual and reproductive health and rights. offer support to partner countries in their efforts to establish nationwide systems of universal, safe, high-quality, non- disease- specific, acceptable and locally available health services.work to promote equitable access to safe vaccines, drugs, medical products and medical technology.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government20In partnership with the scientific community, policy-makers and civil society, the Federal Government will work to ensure that patients are well-informed about health issues on the basis of scientific knowledge and to prevent the danger and damage to health that can be caused by false health reporting. Germany will offer its support to partner coun - tries to help them establish social protection systems covering the costs of medical treatment so that health services are available to everyone regardless of their financial resources. Germany's other priorities include supporting domestic revenue mobilisation to fund health services, strengthening inter-ministerial cooperation on health financing to ensure that funds are allocated strategically, establishing lawful, transparent, gender-sensitive and development-focused public finance systems and fighting corruption in the health sector.4. Protecting health - addressing cross-border health threats Germany will continue to step up its already strong commitment to global health protection and will deal with the humanitarian conse - quences of health crises even better and more effectively. The cholera epidemic in Yemen that has been ongoing since 2017, the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa (from 2014 to 2016) and in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (from 2018 to 2020), the Zika virus epidemic in Latin America (from 2015 to 2016), the first incidence of MERS (since 2012), numerous other outbreaks in other countries and the COVID-19 pandemic are a critical turning point for the international community. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly illustrates the mani - fold effects of a global health crisis. The impact on public health and the socio-economic conse - quences affect all areas of life. In the context of humanitarian crises, disease outbreaks can have a particularly dramatic impact on the popula - tion. All policy areas must therefore deal with combating the crisis and alleviating its conse - quences and join forces to develop overarching solutions. Particularly, the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa provided lessons for future disease outbreaks and these have already had a positive impact on the action taken to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Germany has substantially stepped up its engagement in improving the international preparedness and responsiveness and is one of the key donors among the financial supporters of the UN's Global Humanitarian Response Plan. The Federal Government will use the expertise and instruments available in the various ministries to ensure a holistic approach that is harmonised even better and to further strengthen health protection worldwide.work at national and international level for knowledge-based information for patients. help its partners, where needed, to establish sustainable health financing systems based on the principle of solidarity and to use their resources effectively.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government21Germany is internationally committed to strengthening WHO, especially in terms of its leadership role and independence, and to help in further developing WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) as the relevant set of regulations under international law. At the same time, the Federal Government is actively involved in the global development and monitoring of the IHR core capacities at country level. These core capacities are needed to be able to detect and report health risks and emergencies promptly and to respond to them appropriately. A key element of comprehensive health crisis manage - ment includes strengthening inter national coordination and training, rehearsing the rele vant procedures and evaluating the implementation status of the IHR. The goal regarding WHO is to have robust structures and capacities that enable it to support countries effectively and efficiently in preventing, detecting and responding to disease outbreaks and to coordinate interna - tional assistance. It also intends to strengthen WHO's ability and role in rapid and independent investigation of outbreaks. Box 5: The International Health Regulations (IHR) The International Health Regulations (IHR), which are binding under international law, aim to prevent and contain international health risks and mitigate their impacts, including on international traffic and trade. They specify reporting obligations for certain events that can pose a threat to public and global health. The IHR also define international standards for national surveillance systems, set minimum requirements for national public health systems and describe the required precautions to be taken at ground crossings, air ports and ports. WHO coordinates the implementation of the IHR. A rating scheme contained in the IHR also helps determine what events may constitute a 'public health emergency of international concern' that must be reported to WHO. WHO may then set up an Emergency Committee that analyses the situation, issues temporary recommendations and, if necessary, advises the Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of Interna tional Concern (PHEIC). Only the Director-General may declare such an emergency. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared to be a public health emergency of international concern. In addition to the annual reports on the implementation of the IHR, WHO recommends that governments conduct a joint external evaluation (JEE). The JEE is a process to assess the capacities of a country to prevent, detect and respond to public health risks . Local or regional disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics can have a destabilising impact due to health systems that are ineffective, oper - ating at full capacity or in some cases, over - whelmed, and they can exacerbate state fragility. Robust health systems detect disease outbreaks more quickly and can provide health care and prevent human suffering even in the event of a health crisis. It follows that functioning and resilient health systems promote stable statehood. Furthermore, in times of state fragility, only health systems that are resilient and are embed - ded in a minimum degree of statehood can maintain health care in the face of crises and conflicts. To this end, Germany pursues an ap - proach that simultaneously strengthens health systems while ensuring that infrastructure, digital monitoring and management systems, and capacity for out break prevention and r esponse are integrated into these systems.22 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentThe goal regarding WHO is to have robust structures and capacities that enable it to support countries effectively and efficiently in preventing, detecting and responding to disease outbreaks and to coordinate international assistance. 23 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentGlobal Health Strategy of the German Federal Government24 Germany promotes the further development of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, which offers countries rapid support in crises, and will expand its engagement in this area. This includes strengthening capabilities and an internationally recognised role for WHO in the rapid and inde - pendent investigation of outbreaks. The key pre - requisite for WHO's efficient crisis management is the availability of adequate funds for fighting outbreaks. For this reason, Germany is commit - ted to having the member states work towards providing WHO with more flexible funding through a higher share of non-earmarked funds. Germany is also one of the key donors to WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) and is committed to its sustainable funding.Germany has special expertise in the following areas: identifying disease outbreaks and other events that may present a public health risks, early warning and reporting, infection preven - tion, laboratory diagnosis, field epidemiology and drug and vaccine regulation. With the help of its federal institutes, implementing organisa - tions and instruments of development coopera - tion, and in collaboration with WHO, regional organisations and partner countries and repre - sentatives from the scientific com munity, civil society and faith-based communities, Germany will make greater use of these skills and pro - actively offer partner countries support and capacity development. Measures to strengthen health systems also include enhancing the infrastructure and skills for preventing and responding to outbreaks. In addition, Germany is committed to integrating the expertise and the structures developed during polio containment ('polio assets') into national health structures, in order for these to be available for containing disease outbreaks once international funding (for polio containment) has run out.Germany will: support an efficient WHO to be able to prevent health crises and provide rapid assistance to countries in health emergencies. provide more expertise to partner countries and international organisations to strengthen the prevention and the response to disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics and other events that pose a risk to public health, nationally, regionally and globally.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government25Box 6: German institutions contribute their expertise to international pandemic prevention and control To support partner countries during outbreaks and in establishing robust health systems, German institutions provide their specific expertise and long-standing experience. As part of the German Global Health Protection Programme (GHPP), German institutions operating in the field of health, such as the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM), the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM), the Research Center Borstel (FZB), the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, FLI), the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines, PEI) and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) contribute their expertise to projects for international epidemic prevention and mitigation. The measures, which are geared towards the needs of the partner countries, strengthen their ability to respond to crises and contribute to the strengthening of health systems overall. Depending on the project, the activities vary from the implementation of training programs to the building of specific capacities, for example, for laboratories on the ground. Against the backdrop of the lessons learned from the Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa, and as an additional component of Germany's commitment to an improved international response to health risks, the German Epidemic Preparedness Team (SEEG) was established in 2015. SEEG supports partner countries at short notice, flexibly and worldwide, by deploying experts. Depending on the outbreak and in line with need, the teams of experts are composed of members from the following institutions: RKI, BNITM and GIZ, and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin. As of August 2020, SEEG had success - fully conducted 25 assignments in more than 15 countries and on diverse infectious diseases such as Zika virus disease, Lassa fever and Ebola virus disease, plague, and currently on SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. As a response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Germany has supported low-resource countries through SEEG missions and as part of GHHP, including by providing materials for testing, strengthening laboratory capacities and by developing and conducting (online) training in cooperation with WHO-AFRO/-EMRO. About two thirds of all new health risks arise from diseases that are transmissible from animals to humans (zoonoses). The transmission occurs via direct contact to animals, vectors (e.g. mos - quitoes) or contaminated food. For this reason, Germany will support preventive approaches in partner countries and at international level that take account of the human-animal-environment interface. Germany will also work with WHO, FAO and OIE in a cross- disciplinary and cross-sectoral way to counter act factors that contribute to the emergence and transmission of pathogens. Infor - mation exchange and networking will also be promoted to identify new pathogens and resistant bacteria early on and respond to them. Germany will also support research on zoonotic diseases. Germany will continue its consistent engagement for a principled and needs-based humani tarian health assistance. In addition to strict compli - ance with humanitarian principles ( humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence), this also means strengthening coordinating struc - tures, especially the Health Cluster led by WHO to respond to humanitarian emergencies, and stronger support for local approaches.use the One Health approach for preventing epidemics. provide rapid and effective aid in humanitarian health crises.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government26The observed increase in attacks on medical personnel and medical institutions underscores the importance of health care protection and resilience. For health system access to be main - tained, also in times of crisis, conflict or war, cross-policy engagement must be strengthened that takes into account the interrelation between the health and security sectors.Germany will continue to participate in the European Medical Corps (EMC) and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and promote mobile emergency teams. In non- outbreak periods, measures will be implemented that prevent epidemics and/or prepare for them and that strengthen health systems. In order to be able to provide rapid emergency support worldwide, Germany will continue to improve its coordinating mechanisms. Box 7: Humanitarian health assistance Humanitarian crises have severe consequences for the health of the population in question. Prolonged crises impair even well-functioning health systems and constantly lead to a partial if not total collapse of the health care system. For this reason, health is an integral part and focus of German humanitarian assistance. The goal is to enable people in acute emergency situations and long-lasting crises to survive in dignity thanks to medical measures and support services. Humanitarian health assistance is geared towards the context-specific humanitarian needs of the population affected by a crisis. Particularly in long-lasting crises, this increasingly includes the treatment of chronic diseases and NCDs. Owing to their particular importance, special attention is given to primary and basic medical care, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, as well as infection prevention and control. The humanitarian health assistance financed by the Federal Government is provided such that it helps to cover existing and urgent needs, prevents other needs from arising, or reduces the likelihood of their occur - rence, without causing harm ('do no harm'). At the same time, humanitarian health assistance contributes to the resilience of affected individuals, strengthens the capacities of humanitarian partners for the future and, wherever possible, creates new openings for development cooperation measures. 5. Advancing research and innovation for global health Health research is a central element to tackle current and future global health challenges. As a highly innovative research hub, Germany can make a substantial contribution to answering key global health questions. Greater interaction between the various disciplines of the research communities can help to trigger new solutions. This was demonstrated, for example, by the interdisciplinary research of human and veteri - nary medicine, health, nursing and rehabilita - tion sciences, agriculture and environmental protection (One Health approach) for fighting AMR. Close collaboration with international partners and international cooperation among researchers and/or research funders have visible provide support for safeguarding the humanitarian space, including the protec - tion of humanitarian and medical personnel and their institutions in all forums.strengthen its own forces in order to be able to further provide rapid emergency response worldwide.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government27added value and are also promoted at EU level. African countries are also key partners for Germany in global health research. The strength - ening of global health sought by the international community depends to a great extent on making progress on the African continent. The principle of the 2030 Agenda to 'leave no one behind' is also of central importance in promoting global health research. Germany supports research that focuses particularly on disadvantaged and vulnerable people and groups. The fight against neglected and poverty-related tropical diseases, usually associated with high burden of disease, particu - larly in the world's economically weakest coun - tries, will continue to be of particular concern for Germany. In addition, Germany will work with its partners to examine and further develop approaches for preventing and treating NCDs in selected areas. Global health needs both new approaches in digitalisation as well as a more effective exploita - tion of potential already in place. Digitalisation is changing the world we all live in. The Federal Government would like to make digitalisation the engine for sustainability and harness it to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda. In the health care sector, digitalisation offers huge potential for strengthening health systems and for provid - ing decentralised care for individuals independent of time and location. To this end, digitalisation contributes in particular to achieving UHC. Digitalised and interrelated health and social systems can boost their efficiency and create more transparency, improve the quality of and access to health services and information and promote person-centred services. It is, however, essential to handle sensitive health-related data responsibly and to obtain informed consent to its use (data protection and data security). Therefore, digital innovations must be effective, feasible, secure and affordable. The great oppor - tunities that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) provides to the health sector are also very important for diagnostics and the development of drugs and vaccines. AI offers huge opportu - nities for addressing the shortage of specialised drugs in the Global South. Germany commits itself to the development of a 'digital ecosystem' in the health sector that addresses the different positions of society and businesses. Yet it must be borne in mind that per - sonal health data is highly sensitive and deserve adequate protection from unauthorised inspection and abuse.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government28 Global health research should be viewed as a holistic approach. The German Alliance for Global Health Research is already a first step in this direction. The Federal Government will channel the knowledge and research potential available in Germany to European and international pro - cesses in an even more focused manner. To this end, it will enter into partnerships and become actively involved in networks and platforms. Promoting not-for-profit product development partnerships has proved to be a success ful instru - ment, because the aspect of equitable access is included from the very beginning. It is also important that newly developed health products can be used in low- resource settings. Germany supports the systemic research on the effective - ness of measures under real conditions. The sustainable development of (research) capacities and cooperation structures on site will be supported with tailored funding ini - tiatives. This will strengthen regional health systems and establish South-South cooperation. By promoting research and engaging in national and international initiatives such as CEPI, Germany will aim to ensure that vaccines against infectious diseases with high pandemic potential are available promptly, and in the event of a pandemic, enable them to be developed and made available without delay. Germany will: promote interdisciplinary collaboration and stimulate structural improvement in global health research. strengthen European and international cooperation on global health research. consistently support product-oriented research and development for fighting neglected and poverty-related tropical diseases.support partner countries in strengthening their global health research. advance vaccine development and promote equitable access worldwide. Box 8: German Alliance for Global Health Research The German Alliance for Global Health Research is a research platform that aims to support interdisciplinary, international and cross-sectoral research in global health in and outside Germany. Researchers from all over Germany collaborate across disciplines and sites. The Alliance focuses on the new generation of researchers. The platform aims to build an interdisciplinary German global health research community, strengthen the German contribution to global health research and makes its findings available.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government29The alliance \"National Decade Against Cancer\" sustainably strengthens Germany's role as a leading cancer research hub, thus aiming to achieve ground-breaking progress in the fight against cancer together with partners. The alliance's work will also have an international impact and will achieve new findings for Germany in the global context. Collaboration between international and leading German research institutions will be intensified. Health care researchers and actors should be given the opportunity to use comprehensive, up-to- date and high-quality data, share these data and view findings promptly. Shared digital platforms or registries are one option for reaching this goal. In this way, new scientific insights and recommendations for action can be shared more promptly and can also be directly taken up in health policy and health care. Moreover, relevant health data are to be made accessible for research and development - while fully protecting the personal rights of the people to which the data are related and bearing in mind the data protec - tion rules to offer effective protection from de-anonymisation, stigmatisation, discrimination and disadvantage - and be made available to the general public after appropriate evaluation.The Federal Government will strengthen research on and development of effective, secure, barrier- free and compatible digital technologies in order to facilitate their use for improving inclusive health systems worldwide. The effective exchange of information within the health system and between medical research and patient care is a key factor here; always in compliance with the relevant legal conditions. The application of international standards is important in this context. The EU, as a joint research, economic and data space, can set standards worldwide through innovation-friendly regulations and can develop infrastructure for shared and responsible use of health data. To this end, a joint code of conduct and additional regulatory and organ - isational measures are to be developed in order to facilitate value-based data exchange in the EU and with third countries - taking the legal conditions into account, particularly the pre - vailing data protection regulations and guar - anteeing data security. Based on national digital health strategies, Germany will support partner countries in developing and expanding integrated, evidence-based and scalable digital systems in the health sector for which it will follow global guidelines. Flanked by advice on health reporting and strategic use of funds, partner governments will be supported in the targeted and transparent management of investments in health based on digital health data. Software systems integrated in the national health system have also proven themselves for early detection and the manage - ment of outbreaks of infectious diseases and will be supported by Germany. set a clear signal in the international fight against cancer. actively promote access to and sharing of knowledge and research findings.specifically promote digitalisation and its beneficial use to improve health systems. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government30Building on its engagement at European level, the Federal Government will support inter - national initiatives: Together with the European Commission, European experiences, data privacy, data security and data-use standards and ethical discourse on the potential uses, risks and limits of new technologies will be shared at global level.be actively involved at national, European and international level in support of prudent digital transformation in the health sector that takes individual and public welfare into account and safeguards privacy. Box 9: Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) The Federal Government supports the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which aims to contain epidemics before they lead to large-scale health crises. CEPI is a public-private partnership comprising states, foundations and pharmaceutical companies. It develops vaccines against pathogens that can cause dangerous epidemics. The vaccines should be ready for use quickly and available worldwide. CEPI focuses on diseases identified by WHO as possible future pandemics or for which WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. For pharmaceutical companies these diseases often do not offer economic incentives required for the companies to agree to bear the high costs involved in developing a vaccine. Public funding by the international community is intended to close this gap. In the event of an outbreak, established mechanisms and technology platforms can be used to provide a rapid response. Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government31II. Tackling challenges together, exploring new avenues Germany - like all states ultimately - benefits from a rule-based international order. For Germany, peace, prosperity, rule of law and an open society are inextricably linked with global coexistence. Global health policy can also only be implemented in close and cooperative collaboration, coordination, and in coordination with partners. The global health architecture is characterised by a number of different actors. Multilateral organisations, global and regional initiatives and partnerships, state and non-state actors are working to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda. This diversity is a particular strength, but it also poses challenges. To jointly address the inter - relationships between health, economic and social development and the environment and to harness the potential of all actors in the best possible way, increased coordination is required at all levels. 1. Strengthening political engagement for the benefit of global health The G7 and G20 comprise the economically strongest states. Some two thirds of the world's population live in the G20 states. Voluntary commitments made by these communities set political signals and are important milestones for implementing global health goals. The EU can make a key contribution to coping with global health problems. As an EU member state, Germany campaigns in the international context for the shared European values, interests and positions. Today, the member states and the EU together are already key donors in the area of global health. Consolidating the expertise available within the EU can allow this financial contribution to have an even higher impact on global health. As part of the groups of industrialised and emerging countries (G formats), Germany prior - itizes the commitments to improve overall health care and strengthen health systems, including strengthening of prevention, expanding digital technologies, improving health protection and combating AMR, with due regard to the One Health approach. Moreover, in these formats the Federal Government promotes joint initiatives for strengthening WHO. Here, too, the Federal Government will continue its intensive collab - oration with civil society, science and the private sector.Germany will: actively promote global health in relevant international organisations and processes, stand up to support constructive multilateralism with WHO playing a central role, expand regional partnerships.Germany will: commit to making global health a priority for the most important industrialised and emerging countries.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government32This also applies to curbing and preventing health crises, and equally to the area of noncommuni - cable and chronic diseases, in which the EU and its member states have a great deal of expertise. Germany is actively committed to a strong Euro - pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) which can effectively counteract pan - demics at EU level. When shaping the digital trans - formation, and in view of its high data protection and security level, the EU can also set worldwide standards for responsible use of digital applications that are geared towards people and their diverse needs and towards data privacy rights - based on Big Data or AI. Safeguarding drug availability and European collaboration in the production of critical agents is also important. To this end, the policy area of global health must be strengthened at European level and by the European institutions. At the same time, the coordination of the member states among themselves and the targeted exchange among all relevant European actors must be strengthened. Germany will work with other member states to attempt to strengthen the EU's role in WHO. The goal is to achieve prominent, coherent and better coordinated visibility and representation of European interests in global health. 2. Strengthening multilateralism - further developing global health architecture One of the key tasks of German global health policy is to contribute to preserving and strengthening the rule-based international order, working with like-minded partners to further develop it and promoting multilateral cooperation. Germany's membership in the UN is and continues to be the central and universal framework for Germany's multilateral policy. The UN is the only international institution that enjoys universal political legitimacy due to its worldwide membership. In the UN system, WHO plays a key role as the specialized agency for health. It provides normative guidance and guide - lines for improving public health in the member states and for global health, and thus points the way for the work of the other health actors who finance and implement programmes for improv - ing global health. German engagement in and for multi-actor partnerships is aligned with the basic orientation of German global health policy and with the aim of strengthening WHO's role as a leader and coordinator. International organisations, institu - tions and initiatives such as GFATM, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and GFF play a pioneering role with their innovative approaches. With their focus on specific mandates and results orientation, they have contributed significantly to the progress made in terms of the health of countless people. As the health pro - grammes shift from vertical to more horizontal structures and away from fragmentation, the funds' disease-specific programmes and special - ised health services should be integrated more strongly into national health systems as a whole and support the partner countries accordingly. In these efforts, the Global Action Plan headed by WHO plays a key role. Multi-actor partnerships build on innovative co - operation models involving governments, health facilities (e.g. hospitals) and civil society, as well as community-based organisations, and use their partnerships with the private sector to change the drug and vaccine market for the benefit of devel - oping countries. These partnerships are a valuable addition to the multilateral organisations.push for a more active role for the EU in coping with global health challenges. advocate that the EU pursues a coherent policy in the area of global health and uses its potential in the best possible way.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government33In international forums, Germany will campaign for effective, efficient, cooperative and equitable action for the benefit of a global health policy and will make a comprehensive programmatic and financial contribution in multilateral and inter - national organisations in the health sector.To help multilateralism and international organ - isations to become even more effective, also through reform, as needed, is an important goal. In these efforts, Germany will aim at a coordi - nated division of labour between global health policy actors. Based on their respective core competencies, tasks will complement each other, and synergies will be used to achieve the goal of a healthy life for all. The Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All will play an important role in this regard. Germany will: promote a multilateral and globally oriented health policy based on legitimised, effective and efficient international institutions. support further development of the global health architecture. Box 10: The Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All Through the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All, twelve international organisations from the areas of health and development assistance have pledged to join forces to support countries in advancing the implementation of the health-related SDGs. These organisations have nearly one third of the total annual inter national funding for health at their disposal. Through harmonisation of procedures and improved coordination, the recipient countries will benefit from targeted, transparent and coordinated cooperation. The coordinating capacities of the organisations and partner systems involved have a reduced burden which makes for more efficient support in achieving the national goals. The joint measures focus on essential areas such as comprehensive basic health care and sustainable health financing, gender equality and the provision of global public goods for health. In 2018, German Chancellor Merkel, together with the leaders of Norway and Ghana, requested WHO to guide the development of a Global Action Plan on health. WHO coordinates the implementation of the Global Action Plan among the international organisations and supports governments with coordinating the health actors at country level as needed.34 Global Health Strategy of the German Federal GovernmentGermany's objective is to adapt WHO to the new challenges and strengthen it as an effective, transparent, efficient and responsible interna - tional organisation in cooperation with other global actors. Germany will campaign for a stronger and more independent role for WHO. Germany promotes appropriate reforms of this organization, paying attention to funding as well as to core tasks. In this context, the Federal Government will advocate to bring about a sub - stantial increase in WHO contributions, also for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.strengthen international coordination of global health policy by strengthening WHO's leading and coordinating role.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government353. Expanding regional partnerships Germany will continue to build and strengthen partnerships in the area of global health. It is important for Germany to work with its part - ners to develop tailored solutions. The existing cooperation and exchange of expertise is to be intensified further. Partnerships should not only be lived on the ground but should also lead to closer collaboration in international forums. A particular focus is on African countries as important partners of Germany. A further focus of Germany's global health policy is on collabo - ration with East European partners in view of the geographical proximity. The emerging and developing countries on the road to pros perity are additional strategic partners for coping with global health policy challenges. Key priorities for cooperation will be the strengthening of health systems, especially to achieve UHC without financial hardship, improving health protection, issues related to population development, the fight against neglected diseases, the use of digital technol - ogies and joint research and development. In addition, Germany will increasingly seek close collaboration with other donors on the ground and with the UN country teams in order to establish measures and partnerships that advance economic development and promote public health. Germany will in particular support WHO's Regional Office for Africa, the African Union and the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). This will be done, above all, by networking with the EU and WHO's European Region, and by involving civil society. One goal is to encourage joint engagement and the acceptance of responsibility in mutual dialogue, also within the multilateral frame - work. To this end, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) will play a particular role.Germany will: intensify existing cooperation at many levels with African actors to strengthen global health and establish new approaches to partnership in the mutual interest. support the transformation process in health systems in countries of the Eastern Partnership by exchanging knowledge and experience. further intensify the dialogue and coopera - tion on the major challenges facing global health with emerging and developing countries.Global Health Strategy of the German Federal Government36III. Ensuring coherent action The Federal Government's Global Health Strategy complements Germany's National Sustainable Development Strategy and represents an inte - grated government approach with joint long- term objectives. In order to jointly implement the global health strategy, the Federal Govern - ment will promote coordination, review instru - ments, dialogue and exchange. To this end, civil society involvement will play a particularly important role. A particular advantage is the number of non- state actors in Germany which are committed to resolving global health problems and who make their own contributions. The Federal Government will therefore continue to promote exchange with actors representing young people, non-governmental organisations, health pro - fessions, think tanks, the scientific community and the private sector. In view of the need for cross-sectoral approaches, it is important to have formats and platforms that deepen interdisci - plinary exchange of experiences, activities and solutions. Germany already has internationally recognised formats such as the World Health Summit. To strengthen the German contribution to global health, the Federal Government will be even more strategic in contributing German expertise to international processes, forums and organisations. The health-related expertise in the ministries' research institutions, which has a good reputation internationally, plays an especially important role here.The regular meeting initiated by the State Secre - taries' Committee for Sustainable Development on questions of global health ensures the overar - ching coherence of Germany's contribution to the health-related sustainability agenda. It is supplemented by a quarterly coordinating meeting at working level. This meeting serves the continuous cooperation between all relevant ministries on global health issues. The particular goals include exchange and coordination regard - ing the positioning of Germany in the various global health forums, such as the multilateral and interna tional organisations and alliances in which Germany participates. As needed, cross-ministerial working groups will be set up to enhance inter-ministerial collaboration in selected thematic areas, and to optimise and further develop the coordination of projects and measures as well as early crisis detection. To this end, including non-state actors can pro - vide a major impetus for implementation and for resolving current issues. The Federal Government seeks dialogue on implementing the strategy and will include contributions by non-state actors.
