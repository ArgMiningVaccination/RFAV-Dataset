From decluttering your household and refrigerator to rejuvenating your mind and menu choices, spring cleaning comes in many forms to promote healthy living for a bright, fresh season ahead. It's time to roll up your sleeves, put your best self forward, and learn four ways to inspire healthy living this spring. 1. Refrigerator Clean Out Your kitchen is the most important part of your house when it comes to staying on track to achieve weight loss goals, so a good [refrigerator cleaning](https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works/library/articles/spring-clean-your-kitchen-low-carb-tips-for-an-atkins-friendly-kitchen) is essential this spring. First, grab a garbage bag and take a hard look at your refrigerator and pantry, tossing anything that's expired or just looks questionable. This is also a good time to get rid of: - Freezer-burned veggies and meats. - Spices and herbs that have lost their color or smell. - Any other temptations that are not Atkins-friendly. Once you've cleared the shelves, wipe everything down and arrange the foods you have left by type. 2. Refresh Your Diet Once you've completed your refrigerator clean out, it's time to restock with fresh spring foods. Make a list of everything you will need at the store, depending on which Atkins Phase you are in. Once you're done shopping, arrange your food so that it's easily accessible, as this can help you make smarter choices when the food cravings hit. Some organization ideas include: - Wash and cut up all your vegetables and put them in clear plastic or glass containers. That way your fresh food choices are front and center instead of wilting away in a vegetable drawer. - If you bought meat in bulk, portion it out into zip-top, freezer-safe plastic bags so that defrosting a portion or two is also a fast option. - Keep some hard-boiled eggs handy, either to eat as-is, make egg salad or deviled eggs, or garnish with cooked spinach. - Pre-measure snacks and keep them in a handy place in the refrigerator so you can grab them quickly and you won't be tempted to eat the whole package or jar. 3. Healthy Menu Ideas To simplify shopping and cooking, it's always a good idea to plan out a week's worth of meals and snacks in advance. One way to do this is to take some time each Sunday to write down your menu for the week. Do it after you've had a meal, too, so you aren't hungry when you plan. Consider at least three or four main dishes that you can double, and then you can freeze the other half for another meal.
