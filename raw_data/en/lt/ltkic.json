sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection - Eosinophilia is often present; because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved - Early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident; if such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue therapy and evaluate the patient immediately Heart Failure (HF) risk - NSAIDS have the potential to trigger HF by prostaglandin inhibition that leads to sodium and water retention, increased systemic vascular resistance, and blunted response to diuretics - NSAIDS should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible - AHA/ACC Heart Failure Guidelines; Circulation. 2016; 134 Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive Animal studies - Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization - In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (eg, ibuprofen), resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss - Advise pregnant women of potential fetal risk Clinical considerations - There are no studies on effects during labor or delivery - In animal studies, NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth Fetal toxicity - Use of NSAIDs can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment - Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation and avoid use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy - Use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases risk of premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus - Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment - There are no available data with use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage; however, there are published studies with each individual component of the drug combination - Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive - In animal reproduction studies, there were no clear developmental effects at doses up to 0.4-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in the rabbit and 0.5-times in the MRHD rat when dosed throughout gestation - In contrast, an increase in membranous ventricular septal defects was reported in rats treated on gestation days 9 & 10 with 0.8-times the MRHD - Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as ibuprofen, resulted in increased pre-and post-implantation loss - Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development; in published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses - Unless definitely directed to do so by a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery; if an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit use to lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible - If treatment is needed for a pregnant woman, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios; if oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue therapy and follow up according to clinical practice Labor or Delivery - There are no studies on the effects of drug combination during labor or delivery; in animal studies, NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth Lactation No lactation studies have been conducted; however, limited published literature reports that, following oral administration, ibuprofen is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 0.06-0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose; no information is available on effects of ibuprofen on milk production or on a breastfed infant Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable. Either animal studies show no risk but human studies not available or animal studies showed minor risks and human studies done and showed no risk. C: Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins in body tissues by inhibiting at least 2 cyclo-oxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2 May inhibit chemotaxis, proinflammatory cytokine activity, and inhibit neutrophil aggregation; these effects may contribute to anti-inflammatory activity (85%) Bioavailability: 80-100% Onset: 30-60 min Duration: 4-6 hr Peak (adults) - Conventional tablet: 120 min - Chewable tablet: 62 min - Oral suspension: 47 min Peak plasma time (febrile children) - Chewable tablet: 86 min - Oral suspension: 58 min Peak plasma concentration - Conventional tablet: 20 mcg/mL - Chewable tablet: 15 in liver CYP2C9; CYP2C19 substrate) 2-4 hr (children 3 mon to 1 year; 35-51 hr (day 3), 20-33 hr (day 5) Excretion: Urine (50-60%; <10% unchanged); remainder in feces within 24 hr Administration Instructions Take with food or 8-12 oz of water to avoid GI effects Images Inc. Patient Handout ibuprofen anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) may rarely increase the risk for a heart attack or stroke. This effect can happen at any time while using this drug but is more likely if you use it for a long time. The risk may be greater in older adults or if you have heart disease or increased risk for heart disease (for example, due to smoking, family history of heart disease, or conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes). Do not use this drug right before or after heart bypass surgery (CABG).Also, this drug may rarely cause serious (rarely fatal) bleeding from the stomach or intestines. This effect can occur without warning symptoms at any time while taking this drug. Older adults may be at higher risk for this effect.Stop using ibuprofen and get medical help right away if you notice any of these rare but serious side effects: stomach/abdominal pain that doesn't go away, black/tarry stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, chest/jaw/left arm pain, shortness of breath, unusual sweating, confusion, weakness on one side of the body, trouble speaking, sudden vision changes.
