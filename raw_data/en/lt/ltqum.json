Probiotics, dietary phenolics, and omega-3-fatty acids are just a few of the types of nutraceuticals that can potentially assist medical management of dermatologic conditions. Omega-3-fatty acids reduce ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced inflammatory responses in the skin. The dietary phenolics caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and rutin are ultraviolet A (UV A) absorbing antioxidants with indirect regulatory effect on the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2-antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway. Probiotics have been atopic dermatitis amelioration. Intact rhamnosus Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) scores in comparison to heat inactivated LGG or placebo, p = 0.02. LGG also improves SCORAD scores in IgE-sensitized atopic dermatitis patients, p = 0.036. Forearm and facial skin hydration has been significantly increased by orally ingested 2.1% L. plantarum K8 lysates which decrease horny layer thickness of the forearm and face at 4- and 8-weeks, and also decrease transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of the forearm and face at 8-weeks, p = 0.002 and p = 0.008 respectively. L. reuteri use prior to or concurrently with Staphylococcus aureus infection can increase epidermal keratinocyte survival, p < 0.01, presumably via competitive binding at keratinocyte 51 integrin receptors. Thus, oral and topical probiotics may have potential for further development with atopic dermatitis amelioration and skin infection prevention indications.

Materials & Methods: 20 obese subjects served as volunteers in a crossover trial. A test meal composed of 104 g white bread was administered with or without administration of either kale or apple extract or mixtures of these extracts. Results: The ingestion of curly kale or apple extracts alone did not affect basal glucose levels in humans. Administration of apple extract together with curly kale extract significantly decreased blood glucose responses in mice as well as in humans. Conclusion: Although the administration of individual flavonoid extracts from apple as well as curly kale alone failed to lower venous blood glucose in humans, the ingestion of apple extract in combination with curly kale extract showed significant anti-hyperglycemic activities in the obese subjects. In vitro data indicate that phlorizin is a potent SGLT-1 inhibitor, whereas kaempferol flavonoids may inhibit the hydrolases degrading phlorizin and therefore, creating a synergistic effect of phlorizin and kale flavonoids. Effects of a curly kale extract on the antioxidant status & collagen-index of the skin Aim: Numerous studies showed that a supplementation with a single Antioxidant (AO) in a high- dose shows only limited or even undesired effects. Recent studies demonstrated that a combination of various AOs in a low dose have a positive effect on the AO-system. Carotenoids are main components of the exogenous AO-system. To investigate their effect on the AO-status of the skin, 2 independent double-blind placebo controlled in vivo-studies were performed. Methods: Healthy volunteers were supplemented with a natural curly kale extract at physiological concentration. In vivo electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the radical scavenging capacity of the skin. The cutaneous carotenoids were measured using resonance Raman spectroscopy, the collagen/elastin content was identified by two-photon tomography. Results: A successive improvement of the entire AO network after 8 weeks of supplementation was demonstrated: A significant reduction in the radical formation after moderate stress induction by irradiation was shown, in comparison to a placebo group. Furthermore, a significant increase in the bioavailability of cutaneous carotenoids was indicated. In a second study, the intake of the same extract was extended to 10 months, showing significant increases in the concentration of the skin carotenoids and the collagen/elastin index of the dermis compared to the baseline measurements. Conclusions: A supplementation with a mixture of several low-dose AOs including carotenoids at physiological concentration significantly reduce the amount of free radicals and improved the AO capacity of the skin, resulting in a better radical defense, thus counteracting an age-related collagen I degradation in the dermis in vivo.

This occurs every day, and some people who are still alive and are only in a state of apparent death are buried under the ground. Except some limited and random cases, no exact statistics exist of people who come back to life from the death. This descriptive cross-sectional research study was conducted in 2017. Research samples consist of people whose coming back to life after death has been broadcasted all around the world. A checklist was prepared through consultation with experts. The checklist includes age, gender, the cause of the death, duration of death, cause of coming back to life, the place of coming back to life, awareness after death, death confirmation, and country. The most important reason of medical errors in diagnosing definite death is failure to diagnose temporary death from real one. The death of 85 cases (73.9%) of those who came back to life had been confirmed by doctor. The duration of death ranged from 3 minutes to 240 hours. The place of coming back to life from dead were as 27 cases (23.5%) in hospital, 23 cases (20%) in refrigerator, six cases (5.2%) in autopsy room, and 31 cases (21%) in the grave. 17 cases (14.8%) of people were aware of their death before coming back to life. Getting familiar with Chinese acupuncture theories on correct diagnosis of temporary death from real death can reduce misdiagnosis and lead to a yearly saving of 1100000 lives of people who are in a state of apparent death. The following acupuncture points have a desirable effect on resuscitation and gaining confidence of definite death: GV26 (Shui (Y ong PC9 (Zhong Chong). Biography Nadali Esmaeili received his PhD degree in Acupuncture in 1994 from Peili University of Beijing, China.

According to World Health Organization, about 75% of humans are under sub-health conditions. This number is significant and the problem needs to be treated properly. Acupuncture and moxibustion were found effective for the treatment. Through the research and literature review, this dissertation attempts to analyse the optimal treatment of sub-health and evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion. Acupuncture and moxibustion in sub-health treatment is found effective with the diagnostic method in the Chinese medical thinking. Positive indications are lacking in Western medical inspections while Chinese clinical theory could support this deficiency. The diagnostic method adopted by Chinese medical practitioners such as 'inspect, smell, ask and touch' combining with factors like seasons, weather, areas and mood can accurately assess the activity state of life. After scanning these articles, suitable detailed reports on sub-health treatments through acupuncture were selected for analysis. The results indicate that there are various methods of applying acupuncture treatment for sub-health, including pure acupuncture, acupuncture combined with other methods (such as acupuncture combined with ear-press, massage, or Chinese herbs etc.) and pure moxibustion. 57 acupoints were used in the treatment of sub-health. The most three most frequently used meridians are bladder meridian, stomach meridian and ren meridian. With regard to moxibustion, the major purpose is to strengthen the digestive system and the body as a whole. Biography Yanmun Yiu completed her PhD at Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She is currently a Principal Lecturer in School of Chinese Medicine, University of Hong Kong. She has published more than 10 papers in reputed journals. yoyo@hku.hkYanmun Yiu, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-041Page 46 Notes:conferenceseries .com Volume 7 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: 2327-5162 Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureAcupuncture enlightened by the immune system Maria Lucia S G Jorge Federal University of Parana, Brazil The knowledge about immune system is one of main basis of western modern medicine, which is abundant in diagnostic technology, scientific rationality, research and development. However, the study of the relationship of the individual, his own body and the environment where he lives, is still recent. Despite the demand of patients of chronic, metabolic, psychiatric, neurological and autoimmune diseases which seek out therapies that integrated the physical aspect of the disease and the quality of life of the individual. Acupuncture is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine, and it is based on corresponded meridians to the main peripheral nerves trajectory, most of acupoints are located near to a nerve trunk or branches. It has been confirmed that needle inserted in an acupoint releases a large sort of substance in the skin, muscles and connective tissue at the local and near areas. Histologically, it was observed a dense concentration of neuro and immune active components in those points, when compared to others. The autonomous and sensory nerve fibers of the skin have trophic and immune modulating properties, and cells of the skin depend on the integrity of those innervations. It is shown acupuncture as effective treatment and control in cases of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Looking forward, acupuncture and integrative medicine shall become an indispensable component of mainstream medicine and that health care practitioners will become increasingly amenable to embrace it as a more natural, humanistic and holistic approach therapy with their patients. Biography Maria Lucia S G Jorge holds a PhD and MSc degree from S\u00e3o Paulo University. She is working as an Acupuncturist and Researcher on the relationship between acupuncture and immunology, with case studies and experimental studies. Currently, she is leading specific researches at Federal University of Parana and Editorial Board Member of scientific journal. mluciajorge@gmail.comMaria Lucia S G Jorge, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-041Page 47 conferenceseries .com Volume 7 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: 2327-5162 Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureDifferences between laserpuncture and electro puncture with neuroimaging the stimulation in auriculotherapy Lirane Carneiro-Suliano Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Brazil Statement of the Problem: Researchers have long researched the results of acupuncture, including the use of modern techniques such as a neuroimaging. There are few neuroimaging studies performed on microsystems such as auriculotherapy. There are points in auricular acupuncture with recommendations for soothing and other revitalizing effects, which are more conspicuous for practical practice than based on scientific research. Find good results in different sources of stimuli, such as electrotropuntura and laserpuncture, however, studies on these actions are timid. A functional autonomic nervous system (ANS) performance analysis is based on heart rate variability, vascular compensation response (HR min/HR max), obtaining autonomous amplitude and frequency. The individual and physiological variability associated with acupuncture have also been reported in the literature. Objective: To evaluate an influence on the central nervous system by stimulating between laser and electro in auriculotherapy, through neuroimaging, anxiety control and heart rate. Method: Equipment with brain and peripheral sensors was used to capture changes in brain images, anxiety control and real- time heart rate with different stimuli used at auricular points. Result: It was observed with the data captured in the images that the stimulation with laserpuncture and electro puncture has an effective and differentiated response. Conclusion: A neuroimaging allows to intensify the investigations with microsystems, to investigate its main points, different sources of stimuli and provoked neurophysiological reactions. Thus, it will direct an update and an evolution of auriculotherapy. Recent Publications Zhang et al.

Four case studies of adults who suffered from tinnitus are used to illustrate the benefits of the approach. Each subject completed a three-week self-help programme combining toning, colour and energetic alignment. The clinician researcher evaluates the methodology of the approach and cause of symptoms from both physiological and metaphysical perspectives. Biography Jennifer Warters' extensive experience as a speech and language therapist, working in hospitals, schools and community settings led to twenty years as a Speech and Language Generic Consultant within the National Health Trust in the UK, coordinating and delivering an area wide service to adults with learning disabilities and children with complex needs. Post Graduate training in counselling and holistic therapies inspired her look for alternative ways of addressing communication and hearing impairment. Leaving her profession, to establish a voice consultancy, Jennifer developed an innovative approach to adults and children with 'special needs' drawing on her deep understanding of the subtle energy field and the energetic imprints which can indicate underlying causative factors in physical conditions and behavioural problems. Her interest in the links between consciousness, communication and hearing impairment prompted her current tinnitus research programme validating the positive effect of Toning and energy alignment to eradicate the condition. jennifer.warters@lightvoice.org.ukJennifer Warters, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-041Page 1558th Conference conferenceseries .com Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureDay 2WorkshopVolume 7 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: March 12-13, 2018Page 56 Notes: conferenceseries .com March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureNick Kostovic, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-041 Cancer cured by bio electron's laser acupuncture The author, for the first time in recorded history have eliminated magnetic from regular electromagnetic electricity. He also created the next six steps described below. He did this by developing a proprietary way of reversed current RC to create what is bioelectricity. The device, he created is called the Kostovic Biotechnological Energizer, K-BTE Medical Laser Device. His center has successfully developed special current circuit and canceled magnetic from electromagnetic. This device extracts bio electron photons from H 2O electric fluid by wire and wirelessly. While using the K-BTE device therapist has absolute control of speed/ frequency of these released and enriched bio electron photons. Bio electrons photons are converted into the strength of micro or nano amperes allowing the bio electricity to softly penetrate into the brain or any other physical organ with zero harm to the healthy cells. In the process of extracting bio electron photons from the electric fluid, it can include transference of hundreds of different natural acids as well as amino acids. Each biological agent BA is capable to transfer three to six different natural and amino acids, by enriched bio electron photons. These enriched bio electrons photons are wirelessly transferred through and olive oil coating on the skin enabling the bioelectricity to softly penetrate/bio electron photons always penetrate softly on the skin surface/deeply and efficiently targeting the specific ailing human tissue. This process is always skillfully directed into the body with the very gentle frequencies of micro and nano amperes allowing zero risk of negative consequences. Biography Nick Kostovic was graduated from the Split Gymnasium in 1969 with an Associate of Art's degree in Humanities and Science. He has combined Quantum Mechanics Physics and Electromagnetic Science and created K-BTE Medical Laser Device. He has canceled magnetic from industrial electromagnetic electricity and converted this into his discovery bioelectricity which has the ability to release bio electron's photons which become most efficient tool in healing process of any of human physical organs. nick@kbhealthcenter.com Nick Kostovic President, Kostovic Acupuncture by Bio Electron' s Laser , Corp, USA Page 57 1558th Conference conferenceseries .com Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureDay 2Scientific Tracks & AbstractsPage 58Day 2 March 13, 2018 Sessions: Integrative Medicine | Traditional Chinese Medicine | Acupuncture and Neurology | Acupuncture Techniques Session Chair Professor and Director of Center, University of Panama Title: Role of Iranian traditional medicine in treatment of addiction Issa Khodadadi, G.P.& Traditional medicine Researcher, Iran Title: Acupuncture effects in cloning Djahancshid lashgari, Doctor of acupuncture, Iran Title: Acupuncture West from Chronobiology to Neuroscience Agn\u00e8s Mazic-de Sonis, Pain Leopold, Belgium Session IntroductionPage 59 conferenceseries .com Volume 7 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: 2327-5162 Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureRole of Iranian traditional medicine in treatment of addiction Issa Khodadadi G.P.& Traditional medicine Researcher in Iran Background: The use of opium and its derivatives as a safe drug has been a concern for human societies. With the advancement of pharmaceutical science and development of new forms of drugs; and on the other hand, the rising mental and psychological problems of human been, we see increasing consumption of opiates which in turn, causes a variety of psychical illnesses and the trouble socioeconomic outcome that result from it. Aim: Although in the last few decades, numerous research and therapeutic center have been built in various countries at great expense, and therapists are treating addicts, but little success has been achieved. Our goals in the way we chose are to achieve effective treatment for addicts with least cost and the greatest success. Methods: An analytical interventional study is based on clinical trials that individuals are randomly assigned to under certain therapeutic interventions which applied in Iranian traditional medicine such as: cupping, massages, herbal drugs and special nutritional orders. Result: In seven years of study, 600 addicts between ages of 20-45 (85% of men & 15% of women) are evaluated in two questionnaires of emotional intelligence, and self-competence leaving addiction significantly predict the success of Iranian traditional medicine in the treatment of addictions. Conclusion: In case of Iranian traditional medicine, the addicted person due to continuous use of an opiates substance and sever physical-psychological abuse, and increasing desire to add the amount and quality of the substance consumed, lead to dominance of soda temperament (dry and coldness) in the body and soul. On the other hand, with the weakening of immune system and intelligent response of body, in this state, however, he is compelled to use drugs. In fact, the addicted person fluctuates between warmth and happiness (perkiness) and coldness and severs pain (hangover). Its reason is suppression of stimulation and secretion of endorphin (natural morphine) from the pituitary gland and the brain cortex. Biography Issa Khodadadi completed his PhD from Tehran Shahid Beheshti Medical University in 2007 and Post-doctoral studies in Iranian Traditional Medicine at Iran Hejamat Research Institute in 2010. dissa1345@gmail.comIssa Khodadadi, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-041Page .com Volume 7 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: 2327-5162 Chinese Medicine 2018 March 12-13, 2018 March 12-13, 2018 | Barcelona, Spain 9th International Conference and Exhibition on Chinese Medicine Ayurveda & AcupunctureAcupuncture effects in cloning Djahancshid lashgari Doctor of acupuncture, Iran Acupuncture and Sam & cloning Simulation, for which it is said cloning is from clone root. In biology science cloning is to duplicate a creature without having sexual relations that refers to embryo cultivation in the uterus, already that has been produced in the lab first. The cultivated cells or animal organs can be used as human organs, or we can convert the leftover healthy cells from a damaged organ to a complete organ through a genetic surgery. We can use the materials that the animals produce in their body in drug treatment, or in help of animal cloning we can save the animals which are going to be extinct. The use of duplicating process especially in animal can be endless. The cloning effect because of its negative consequences especially about the human has caused controversy which covers a variety of things including: ethical implications, the implications of identity, physical consequences, emotional outcomes, psychological consequences. Experiences have shown that even deviation from natural ducts will be having many problems. In fact, there are many danger effects in cloning that threats mammal. The percentage of break is still high. The animal that stay alive and new born also face the lack of immune system, hurt problems, breathing problems, and other problems, defected body and this problems causes early death. Now the acupuncture abilities are done to anyone, in order to prevent and cure many diseases. This study is subjected to prove its ability to the cloning science, with help of medicine in three levels. First level : In this level we are reinforcing and adjusting the energy channels of mother animals and its temperament and taking into the account for all the fundamentals of acupuncture including Yin and yang and charred and we make it ready for acceptance of fertilized cells. Second level : In this level the pregnant animal is being cared to pass through pregnancy period with success of the medicine. Third level: This level starts with new born simulator baby and care of its unique characteristic that has been said before, will be subjected under care and with acupuncture, the needed coordination will be passed with vital force, thus energy channels of new born will be preventing from many possible diseases.

For patients with chronic pain and/or chronic pain refractory to conservative treatment, it is important to assess all factors involved with chronicity. The principles of traditional Chinese medicine link three major themes: nutrition and microbiome, neuroplasticity, and homeostasis while considering the side effects of medication. The improved biological, genetic and epigenetic knowledge has contributed to a better understanding of the acupuncture mechanism. Neuroimaging demonstrate the brain regions activated by acupuncture and also illustrates the differences with sham or placebo. These brain areas are associated with a pain matrix. In the field of acupuncture research, there is a need for a bidirectional approach to acupuncture research, where basic science studies and clinical trials each inform the other. From the recently published case reports on the management of chronic refractory pain management, we highlight, the diagnostic steps, the reasoning of the traditional Chinese medicine that is integrated with the chronobiology purpose and the epigenetics factors involved, thus allowing a strategy for acupuncture that addresses the chronicity and the modified parameters such as sleep, nutrition, reactive depression and the different vicious circles induced by chronic pain (peripheral and central sensitization). A strategy integrating pharmaco-nutritional and acupuncture approach shows as described in literature a better response and tolerance of the treatment, a dose reduction and a significant improvement of the parameters involved with the chronicity. Biography A Mazic de Sonis MD., is specialized in pain medicine since 30years. First trained in France, after a specialization in gynecology and obstetrics, the interest in the bio psychosocial management of chronic disease and pain treatment allowed a multidisciplinary training involving TCM acupuncture pharmaconutritional and pain medicine. In 1990 a pain clinic project has been created in CHIREC Brussels involving all processes in pain treatment and integrative approach. a clinical research on refractory pain treatment, drug tolerance or side effect ,efficacy close to acupuncture has been performed since the field of acupuncture research there is a need for a bidirectional approach, where basic science studies and clinical trials each inform the other. She is involved as pain medicine professor and acupuncture in Brussels and Paris. In charge of a special interest group integrative pain medicine supported by Belgian pain society(IASP) the project is evaluation and systematization in a translational way. a_mazic@yahoo.comAgn\u00e8s "}
