The molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these effects have not yet been sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha extracts and their major withanolides (withaferin A and withanone) on muscle cell differentiation using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that withaferin A and withanone and Ashwagandha extracts possessing different ratios of these active ingredients have different effects on the differentiation of C2C12. Withanone and withanone-rich extracts caused stronger differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, deaggregation of heat- and metal-stress-induced aggregated proteins, and activation of hypoxia and autophagy pathways. Of note, the Parkinson's disease model of Drosophila that possess a neuromuscular disorder showed improvement in their flight and climbing activity, suggesting the potential of Ashwagandha withanolides for the management of muscle repair and activity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-04", "cleaned_text": "Effect of Ashwagandha Withanolides on Muscle Cell [2](#B2-biomolecules-11-01454), [3](#B3-biomolecules-11-01454), [4](#B4-biomolecules-11-01454), [5](#B5-biomolecules-11-01454)]. In spite of its extensive use, there are limited studies on the extraction of bioactive components from different parts of the plant that describe their mechanism(s) of action for the recognized/trusted bioactivities of Ashwagandha. Several recent studies (Wi-A), withanolide-A (Wid-A), and withanone (Wi-N) are active ingredients in extracts prepared from the root, stem, and leaves of Ashwagandha. Wi-A was the first member of the withanolide (Wid) family to be isolated from the roots and is the most studied (in animal as well as cell culture experimental models) amongst several others including Wi-N, Wid-A, Wid-B, [10](#B10-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Wi-A has also been shown to possess a variety of health-promoting effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects [ Wi-A caused inhibition of OVA-induced lung injury and fibrosis [ [15](#B15-biomolecules-11-01454)]. A study on the effects of Wi-A on experimentally induced cerebral infarction demonstrated a significant reduction in the infarct area and intimal hyperplasia. Molecular analysis revealed that it exerted neuroprotective effects by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and inhibiting the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [ [16](#B16-biomolecules-11-01454)]. A large number of in vitro and in vivo studies have supported the anticancer activity of Wi-A and Wi-N and have also defined several molecular pathways targets, the bioavailability, and the efficacy profiles for different cancer types and pharmacokinetics are yet to be resolved, in order to develop Wi-A as an anticancer drug. The anti-stress and anti-aging activities of Wi-N have been documented in [33](#B33-biomolecules-11-01454), [34](#B34-biomolecules-11-01454), [35](#B35-biomolecules-11-01454), [36](#B36-biomolecules-11-01454), [37](#B37-biomolecules-11-01454), [38](#B38-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Studies on the models have also supported the anti-stress activity of Ashwagandha extracts. In a physical working capacity test of rats, Ashwagandha-extract-fed rats showed a significant increase in swimming endurance, relative heart weight, and glycogen content in the myocardium and the liver [ [39](#B39-biomolecules-11-01454)]. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to impairment of balance and coordination, Wi-N-rich Ashwagandha-extract-treated mice showed an increase in the level of antioxidative enzymes and better performance of the treated group in all the physiological tests including grooming, rearing, narrow-beam walking, and foot slippery [ [40](#B40-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Thirunavukkarasu et al. [ [41](#B41-biomolecules-11-01454)] made an energy formula (EF) that contained Ashwagandha, caffeine and D-ribose and investigated its safety, cardioprotective ability, and energy impact in ischemic-reperfused myocardium model rats. They showed that EF-treated rats gained less body weight as compared to their corresponding control groups. Significant improvements in heart rate, coronary flow, aortic flow, left ventricular developed pressure and infarct size, creatine phosphate, and phospho-adenosine monophosphate kinase levels were detected in rats subjected to global ischemia. Li et al. [ [42](#B42-biomolecules-11-01454)] showed the anti-obesity effect of Ashwagandha extract in a rat model. It was associated with improvement in the mitochondrial function of adipocytes and skeletal muscle. The study also showed that Wi-A promoted differentiation of pre-adipocytes into beige adipocytes and enhanced oxygen consumption in a C2C12 murine myoblast model. Azeemuddin et al. [ [43](#B43-biomolecules-11-01454)] investigated the effect of a herbal combination of Boswellia serrata, Cissus quadrangularis, and Withania somnifera on sarcopenia, which is the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength as a result of aging. The evaluation of muscle mass, grip strength, motor coordination, gait, locomotor activity, and endurance in the control and test rat groups revealed a significant improvement in all the parameters. It was found that the herbal combination caused a reduction in the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and myostatin while increasing the IGF-1 levels, suggesting that the active components in the combination have the potential to treat pathophysiological changes associated with sarcopenia. Maccioni et al. [ [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-01454)] recruited the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model of Drosophila to investigate the effect of Mucuna pruriens (Mp) and Withania somnifera (Ws). By electrophysiological and behavioral analyses, TDP-43 mutant flies were seen to have impaired climbing with unexpected hyperactivity and sleep dysregulation. Feeding the flies with Mp and Ws was shown to rescue these features, at least in part. Furthermore, flies exposed to the volatile anesthetics showed paradoxical responses that were partially normalized upon Mp or Ws treatment. De Rose et al. [ [45](#B45-biomolecules-11-01454)] characterized the effects of Mp and Ws on ALS-Drosophila and reported that Ws treatment significantly increased their lifespan and rescued climbing impairment. Similar studies using a Parkinson's disease model of Drosophila also demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of Ws extract [ [46](#B46-biomolecules-11-01454)]. [47](#B47-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Ziegenfuss et al. [ [48](#B48-biomolecules-11-01454)] reported that an aqueous extract of Ashwagandha improved upper- and lower-body strength, supported a favorable distribution of body mass, and was well-tolerated clinically in recreationally active men during the 12-week resistance and supplementation period. A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigated the effects of Ashwagandha on fatigue, vigor, and steroid hormones in aging men (40-70 years old and overweight with mild fatigue) and reported increased levels of DHEA-S and testosterone [ [49](#B49-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The effect of Ashwagandha root extract consumption on muscle mass and strength in healthy young men engaged in resistance training was investigated in an eight-week, randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study wherein muscle strength was kept as the primary efficacy and muscle size, body composition, serum testosterone levels, and muscle recovery were determined as the secondary efficacy measures. Interestingly, compared to the placebo subjects, the group treated with Ashwagandha had a significantly greater increase in muscle strength on the bench-press and the leg-extension exercises. Furthermore, a significant increase in muscle size at the arms and chest was observed in test groups that also showed a significant reduction in exercise-induced muscle damage and body fat percentage [ [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-01454)]. These studies have suggested the potential of Ashwagandha as a sports supplement/medicine and hence warrant molecular studies in muscle differentiation and stress pathways. Skeletal muscle differentiation is characterized by the expression of muscle-specific proteins, the withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, and their fusion into multinucleated cells (myotubes) [ [51](#B51-biomolecules-11-01454), [52](#B52-biomolecules-11-01454), [53](#B53-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The characterization of proteins involved in muscle differentiation and their modulation by natural/synthetic drugs is valuable for understanding the biology of muscle disorders (including myopathies, muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy) and their interventional therapies [ [51](#B51-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Here, we used C2C12 myoblasts (an easy and convenient system to study myocyte differentiation) and investigated their differentiation potential and stress tolerance in response to the treatment with Ashwagandha extracts, Wi-A, and Wi-N. 2. Materials and of Withanolides [7](#B7-biomolecules-11-01454), S1](#app1-biomolecules-11-01454)). The IC10 concentration was considered nontoxic and was used for the induction of differentiation. 2.3.

The climbing activity assay was performed on three age groups (2-, 3-, and 4-weeks-old) treated with the control and the Ashwagandha leaf water extract (WEX) [ [7](#B7-biomolecules-11-01454)] (1% and 10%, respectively). Cohorts of 30 flies from each experimental group were subjected to the assay. The tested flies were placed individually in a vertically positioned plastic tube (length = 10 cm; diameter = 1.5 cm) and taped to the bottom. The climbing time (s) was recorded upon crossing a line drawn at 6 cm from the bottom. The number of flies that could climb up to, or above, this line within 10 s was recorded and expressed as a percentage of the total flies. 2.11. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Isolation of C2C12 Clones with Weak and Uniform Differentiation Characteristics [Supplementary Figure S1](#app1-biomolecules-11-01454)). 3.2. Effect of Ashwagandha Leaf Extracts and Purified Withanolides on C2C12 Differentiation [6](#B6-biomolecules-11-01454)]/Wi-N/Wi-A) at their nontoxic concentrations as determined by cell viability assays. As shown in [Figure 1](#biomolecules-11-01454-f001)A, C3 clones showed negligible differentiation during 48-72 h culturation. On the other hand, i-Extract (0.5 \u00b5g/mL) and Wi-N (5 \u00b5g/mL) were well tolerated and exhibited some alignment of cells to multinucleated myotubes. Wi-A (0.5 \u00b5g/mL) showed cytotoxicity. Upon extended incubation for 5-6 days, we observed myotubes in the control and Wi-N-supplemented cultures ( [Figure 1](#biomolecules-11-01454-f001)B). The control and test cultures were subjected to myogenin (master regulator and biomarker for muscle cell differentiation) immunostaining. We found remarkable upregulation of myogenin expression by 96 h of treatment in the control culture. Whereas i-Extract and Wi-A were marked by cytotoxicity and poor expression of myogenin, the Wi-N-supplemented culture showed clear upregulation that initiated at 72 h post-treatment. Based on our earlier findings on the cytotoxicity of Wi-A and the anti-stress effect of Wi-N on human normal [6](#B6-biomolecules-11-01454), [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-01454), [18](#B18-biomolecules-11-01454), [32](#B32-biomolecules-11-01454), myoblasts. Indeed, the immunostaining of stress protein (CARF) in control and treated cells revealed its increase, signifying growth arrest in Wi-A-treated cells ( [Figure 1](#biomolecules-11-01454-f001)C) [ [56](#B56-biomolecules-11-01454), [57](#B57-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Similarly, a shift in the mortalin staining pattern from perinuclear (control cells) to pancytoplasmic in i-Extract- and Wi-A-treated cells, signifying senescence-like growth arrest in these cells, as non-toxic concentration of i-Extract and Wi-A to perform time lapse observations on differentiation. [Figure 2](#biomolecules-11-01454-f002), the C3 clone showed poor differentiation in the eight-day-old control culture. On the other hand, the i-Extract and Wi-A cultures showed a ~30% differentiation and remained unchanged for the next two days examined. The Wi-N-treated culture showed about 50% differentiation by day 8 and remarkably increased to 70-80% by day 11. The results were confirmed with two concentrations (i-Extract: 0.01 and 0.05 g/mL, Wi-A: 0.001 and 0.005 g/mL, and Wi-N: 0.01 and 0.05 g/mL) of each of the compounds. Based on these data, it was concluded that whereas i-Extract and Wi-A caused mild growth arrest in C2C12 cells, their low concentrations induced the withdrawal of cells from proliferation and triggered differentiation. Wi-N, on the other hand, was relatively safe and caused strong differentiation to myotubes. [7](#B7-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The content of Wi-A and Wi-N has also been shown to vary in different parts of the Ashwagandha plant; Wi-N seemed to be present in a high ratio in stems than in leaves [ [65](#B65-biomolecules-11-01454)]. In light of this information, we generated extracts from Ashwagandha leaves and stems using cyclodextrin. The insoluble fractions were dissolved in DMSO. The extracts were analyzed for the content of Wi-A and Wi-N by HPLC ( [Figure 3](#biomolecules-11-01454-f003)) and their effect on in the C3 clone cultured in a 2% HS-supplemented medium. The cells were treated with nontoxic doses (determined by independent dose-dependent cytotoxicity assays, [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-biomolecules-11-01454)). We found that the extracts with a low content of major withanolides (Wi-A+Wi-N; 0.05 to 0.1 M) and a high ratio of Wi-N:Wi-A (3 to 5) resulted in strong differentiation of the C3 clone as determined by the formation of myotubes observed under the microscope ( [Figure 4](#biomolecules-11-01454-f004)A). We also subjected the control and the treated cells to Western blotting analysis to examine the myogenin. As shown in [Figure 4](#biomolecules-11-01454-f004)B, samples #12 caused higher induction of myogenin expression than the rest, in agreement with the stronger differentiation (observed under the microscope) in cells treated with these samples. These data indicated that the extracts with a high Wi-N:Wi-A ratio resulted in a stronger differentiation phenotype. On the other hand, extracts with a high Wi-A showed poor differentiation when used at the IC10 or even the IC1 concentration. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the treatment of C2C12 cells with the extracts containing a lower amount of total withanolides and a high ratio of Wi-N, in particular, promoted their differentiation to myotubes. [Figure 5](#biomolecules-11-01454-f005), it was revealed that the stem extracts that possessed a relatively high Wi-N:Wi-A ratio that caused strong induction of myogenin expression and differentiation. 3.3. Effect of Ashwagandha Extracts and Purified Withanolides on Metal and Heat-Shock-Induced Protein [66](#B66-biomolecules-11-01454), [67](#B67-biomolecules-11-01454), [68](#B68-biomolecules-11-01454), [69](#B69-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Therefore, we examined if Ashwagandha extracts could recover or reverse some of such damages by using two-model assay systems: (i) metal (NaAsO2)-induced aggregation of GFP heat-induced folding of luciferase protein. Cells transfected with GFP and luciferase reporters were subjected to stress and subsequent recovery either in the control or Ashwagandha extracts/bioactive compounds-supplemented medium. As shown in [Figure 6](#biomolecules-11-01454-f006)A, NaAsO2 caused the aggregation of GFP. Cells treated with the extracts and purified withanolides showed significant deaggregation of GFP. Of note, Wi-N and the extracts that contained a high amount of Wi-N as compared to Wi-A caused maximum deaggregation. Intriguingly, these effects matched with the differentiation potential of extracts. The quantitative measure of luciferase activity in cells subjected to heat shock revealed heat-induced misfolding/aggregation of luciferase protein. As shown in [Figure 6](#biomolecules-11-01454-f006)B, heat shock caused a ~20-30% decrease in luciferase activity in the control cells. On the other hand, the treated cells showed an increase in luciferase activity. In contrast to the GFP aggregation assay, luciferase activity was increased in extracts #3, #7, and #11 that possessed relatively high levels of Wi-A. These data demonstrated that the bioactive compounds of Ashwagandha extracts protected the cells against stress-induced aggregation of proteins. 3.4. Effect of Ashwagandha Extracts and Purified Withanolides on Hypoxia and Autophagy [70](#B70-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1) is the master regulator of hypoxia signaling. Deregulated HIF-1 signaling has been associated with several pathological conditions including cancers and brain- and muscle-disorders. Whereas under normoxia conditions, HIF-1 undergoes hydroxylation and degradation by the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway, hypoxia prevents HIF-1 hydroxylation and degradation [ [71](#B71-biomolecules-11-01454)]. As a result, HIF-1 accumulates, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-1, and transactivates several effector proteins involved [Figure 7](#biomolecules-11-01454-f007)A, HRE promoter-driven luciferase assay showed cells treated with extracts #3, #7, and #11, which contained a relatively high content of Wi-A as compared to other extracts and Wi-N. This result was in line with the data obtained from the recovery of heat-induced folding of luciferase. Detection of HIF-1 protein by Western blotting using anti-HIF-1 antibody also exhibited an increase in cells treated with #3, #7, and #11 and #12 that were marked by a high Wi-N content also showed an increase in HIF-1. Consistently, the expression of HIF-1 protein, as detected by immunostaining, showed an increase increased demand of contractile myotubes and shifts from a glycolytic state to oxidative phosphorylation. This process requires dramatic remodeling of the mitochondrial network involving both mitochondrial clearance and biogenesis that is achieved by autophagy. It was reported that the autophagy inhibitors disrupt myogenic differentiation, suggesting the essential role of autophagy and mitophagy in the process [ [73](#B73-biomolecules-11-01454)]. In view of this, we investigated the effect of Ashwagandha extracts and the purified withanolides on autophagy by examining the marker LC3B-II. Western blotting analysis of the control and treated cells revealed an increase in LC3B-II ( [Figure 7](#biomolecules-11-01454-f007)B). The result was also confirmed by a specific anti-LC3B-II antibody ( [Figure ATG16L1, and the activation of autophagy ( [Supplementary Figure S2](#app1-biomolecules-11-01454)). These data suggested that Ashwagandha extracts/bioactive compounds could promote muscle differentiation by regulating hypoxia and autophagy. [Figure 9](#biomolecules-11-01454-f009)), suggesting the potential of Ashwagandha withanolides for the management of muscle repair and activity. 4. Discussion [2](#B2-biomolecules-11-01454), [47](#B47-biomolecules-11-01454), [49](#B49-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Wi-A, Wid-A, and Wid-N are considered as major bioactive compounds obtained from the root, stem, and leaves of Ashwagandha extracts. Wi-A isolated from roots has been shown to possess a variety of health benefits such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities, an inhibition of OVA-induced lung injury and fibrosis, and a reduction in the documented in in vitro and in vivo models for its anti-stress reported that Wi-N possesses multifunctional neuroprotective effects in alleviating cognitive dysfunction by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the modification of A processing, and protection against oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effect of Ashwagandha extracts has also been evident by studies on the biological model of animals [ [39](#B39-biomolecules-11-01454), [40](#B40-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The dose-related reversal of the stress effects evident by the augmentation of SOD and LPO activities and enhanced activities of CAT and GPX supported the clinical use of Ashwagandha as an antistress adaptogen [ [74](#B74-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Sarcopenia is a type of the loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength that occurs with aging. The herbal combination of Boswellia serrata, Cissus quadrangularis, and Withania somnifera on Sarcopenia has shown a significant improvement in muscle mass, grip strength, motor coordination, gait, locomotor activity, and endurance, suggesting the potential of the herbal combination to treat pathophysiological changes associated with Sarcopenia [ [43](#B43-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Treatment with Withania somnifera has shown a significant increase in lifespan, has rescued climbing impairment of ALS-Drosophila, and has exhibited neuroprotective effects on the Parkinson's disease model of Drosophila [ [45](#B45-biomolecules-11-01454), [46](#B46-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Several studies have reported that Ashwagandha may improve body composition and increase strength [ [47](#B47-biomolecules-11-01454), [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-01454), [75](#B75-biomolecules-11-01454)]. In another study, it was reported that the people who consumed Ashwagandha regularly acquired significantly higher muscle strength and size [ [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The studies suggested the potential of Ashwagandha for increasing muscle mass and strength. [76](#B76-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Wi-A has been shown to induce the accumulation of heat-shock proteins by inhibition of proteasome-mediated [79](#B79-biomolecules-11-01454), [80](#B80-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Generally, HIF-1 activation has been described as beneficial for the cell during hypoxic stress. Hypoxia plays a fundamental role in activating myogenesis [ [81](#B81-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The activation of HIF-1 promotes myogenesis through noncanonical Wnt/-catenin pathway [ [81](#B81-biomolecules-11-01454)]. The induction of myoblast differentiation requires the activation of several signaling kinases that are associated with the regulation of autophagy in skeletal muscle [ [82](#B82-biomolecules-11-01454), [83](#B83-biomolecules-11-01454), [84](#B84-biomolecules-11-01454)]. An increase in catabolic processes is required for the execution of the differentiation process and the formation of mature myotubes [ [85](#B85-biomolecules-11-01454), [86](#B86-biomolecules-11-01454), [87](#B87-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Autophagy may be rapidly induced upon myoblast differentiation to facilitate the elimination of pre-existing structures and proteins in order to promote differentiation and remodeling [ [72](#B72-biomolecules-11-01454)]. Consistently, our data showed that the level of expression of HIF-1, LC3B-II, Beclin1, ATG5, and ATG16L1 that Ashwagandha extract Wi-A- and Wi-N-treated myoblasts during myoblast differentiation. On the other hand, p62 showed a decrease. These data were consistent with the previous reports showing an increase in HIF-1 [ [81](#B81-biomolecules-11-01454)] and LC3B-II [ [88](#B88-biomolecules-11-01454)] during myoblast differentiation. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that the treatment with Ashwagandha withanolides could promote muscle cell differentiation. 5.
