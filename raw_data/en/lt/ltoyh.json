Introduction Painisatypeofphysicalexperiencedefinedasanunpleasant sensory and mental problem resulting from actual or poten-tial tissue damage, or something that makes people uncom-fortable (International Association for the Study of Pain)[1]. Thus, pain is a multidimensional and subjective expe-rience. Peripheral tissue injury or inflammation can cause reversible adaptive changes in the sensory nervous system, such as hyperalgesia, that provide a protective role againstfurther nociceptive stimuli, leading to the promotion of woundhealingandthesubsidenceofinflammation[2],while neuropathicpain(NPP)isintolerable,persistent,andspecific typeoflong-termpain.NPPisconsideredtobeadirectcon- sequence of pathological changes affecting the somatosen- sory system and can be debilitating in affected patients [3, 4]. NPP is relatively common, occurring in about 8% ofthe population, and can impact on the patient's health and many aspects of their quality of life [5, 6]. In the USA, painseverity in patients suffering from NPP significantly corre-lated with NPP-related issues such as health care resourceutilization,personalproductivity,andcosts[7]. NPP is not a disease, but a syndrome manifested by commonandlesscommonsignsandsymptoms[8].NPPmayoriginatefromthecentralnervoussystem(CNS)orperipheryandischaracterizedbybothspontaneousandprovokedpain,as well as by paresthesia, dysesthesia, and deficits in nor-mal sensation reflecting nerve damage [9]. An innocuousirritation can lead to pain, but it has been determined thatthe duration and the extent of the response to stimuli canmagnify the pain, indicating that the threshold of NPP fallsdramaticallywithpainprogression[10].Ingeneral,NPPhasa peripheral origin, arising as a consequence of peripheralnerve injury or as a consequence of a metabolic diseaseHindawi Publishing Corporation Journal of Immunology Research Volume 2016, Article ID 6430423, 9 However, NPP can also be caused by infectiousdiseasessuchaspostherpeticneuralgiaandcanbemanifested in disorders of various etiologies such as spinalcord injury, local poststroke ischemia, cancer, and complexregionalpainsyndrome[1,4,12,13](Table1). Accumulating evidence indicates that NPP is not merely aconcept,orasingledisorder,orneuraltissuedamagecausedby a simple nociception. Indeed NPP is considered to be anevolving collection of established clinical and experimentalconditions that share the prolongation of manifested painsymptoms or pain-related behaviors [24]. Abnormalitiesin neural activity predictably play essential roles in thespontaneous pain typical of NPP states [24]. Although thepathogenesis of NPP has been intensively studied in recent decades, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified and currently there are no effective therapies for NPP. Thus,identification of the novel molecular machinery involved inNPP may lead to the development of promising analgesicsandisthereforeeagerlyanticipated. Recently,highmobilitygroupproteinbox1(HMGB1)was identifiedasanimportantinflammatorymediatorinvariousdiseases caused by an abnormally enhanced inflammatoryimmune response [25]. Furthermore, mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that HMGB1 plays an essential role in the pathology of NPP progression. Here, we discuss the evidence from studies that address the role of HMGB1 inNPP.WefirstlyreviewstudiesconcerningtheroleofHMGB1 in NPP and discuss the possible mechanisms underlying HMGB1-mediated NPP progression. Then, we review the evidence indicating that HMGB1 is a potential therapeutictargetforNPP. 2. HMGB1 In 1973, Goodwin discovered a group of nonhistone nuclear p r o t e i n st h a tw e r ec h a r a c t e r i z e db yh i g he l e c t r o p h o r e t i c mobility and called them high mobility group (HMG) pro- teins. These proteins include three superfamilies designated as HMGB, HMGN, and HMGA [26-28]. HMGB1 (also k n o w na sa m p h o t e r i n )i st h em o s ta b u n d a n ta n dw e l l - studied HMG protein, which has been highly conserved in evolution and is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types [29-31]. HMGB1 consists of 215 amino acids encoded by a gene on human chromosome 13q12-13. HMGB1 has two positively charged domains (box A and box B) that are involved in binding to the nucleosome structure and governgeneexpressionviacombinationwithtranscriptionelements (Figure1(a)). InvestigationsrevealedthatHMGB1isoformsindifferent redoxstatesareinvolvedinactivatingimmunecells[32,33].Theseredoxstatesresultfromposttranslationalmodificationsdependent on three positions 23, 45, and 106(C23, C45, and C106, as shown in Figure 1(a)). HMGB1interactswithTLR4viathedisulfidebondatC23andC45andthe free thiol at C106 [33] and in doing so induces cytokineproduction. In contrast to its inactive form, which containsdisulfide bonds at all three sites, HMGB1 does not interactwithTLR4butinteractswithCXCL12topromotechemotaxis[32]. Therefore, the redox modification of HMGB1 is criticalininductionofimmuneresponses. HMGB1 also has a major role as a nonhistone nucle- osomal regulatory nuclear protein that is pivotal in DNA rehabilitation and replication [29, 34]. Under physiologicalconditions, HMGB1 is located in the nucleus where it actsas a DNA chaperone with a role in repair, recombination,regulationoftranscription,replication,andgenomestability[35]. HMGB1 also has important extracellular functionseither through passive release by necrotic cells following celldisruption and nuclear breach or by spontaneous secretionfrom monocytes and macrophages, where HMGB1 acts asan amplifier of proinflammatory signals originating frominnate immune cells [29, 36, 37]. Once located extracel-lularly, HMGB1 acts as a prototypical damage-associatedmolecular pattern molecule (DAMP) and promotes inflam-masome activation [32]. This particular DAMP cooperateswith other factors such as chemokines, growth factors, andcytokines and orchestrates the inflammatory and immuneresponse [38]. Similarly in the immune system, activatedimmunocytes release HMGB1 into extracellular locationsand the details surrounding this process are starting toemerge [39]. However, the mechanism of how other cells,including sensory neurons and spinal glial cells, regulateHMGB1 release in response to different signals remainslargely unknown [40] (Figure 1(b)). HMGB1 released byimmune cells is highly proinflammatory via cooperation with several definitive receptors that are involved in the inflammatory reaction. These receptors include the receptorfor advanced glycation end products evidence shows that itsrole as an \"alarmin\" is a pivotal biological role for 3 201-205 Antibacterial activity domainNLS2 Acidic tail COOH79 RAGE binding domain89-108 TLR binding domainCytokine activity domain autophagy inhibits mitochondrial morphology function Nucleus DNA chaperone, DNA binding/bending activity Sustains nucleosome dynamics and chromosomal stability Modulates gene transcription Participates in DNA repair and telomere maintenanceCell surface Promotes axonal sprouting and neurite outgrowth Extracellular fluid DAMP signaling Interacts with multiple receptorsForms heterocomplexes with other immune coactivators Regulates inflammation, immunity, migration, proliferation, metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis HMGB1 (b) Figure1:MultiplerolesofHMGB-1incellresponse. (APC), such as dendritic HMGB1 is alarm signal that denotes endogenous danger and reportscell damage/necrosis as well as the necessity for repair and induction of a \"sterile\" immune response by boosting both innate and adaptive immune responses [29, 36, 51]. More importantly, HMGB1 in the cytoplasm plays a role as a cytokinewhenitissecretedbymacrophagesincaseofinjury,inflammation,ordisease[52]. 3. HMGB1 in NPP The first study that revealed the proinflammatory propertiesof HMGB1 was conducted more than 10 years ago [53], but given the potentially important implications of the study, there are fewer than expected reports on the relationship between NPP and HMGB1. HMGB1 applied to the sciatic nerve in rats via a preimplanted, indwelling perisciaticcatheter induced a dose-dependent reduction in mechanical thresholds against von Frey filament stimulation but no apparent thermal hyperalgesia over a period of 24h afterapplication [53]. Subsequently, a similar result was observed after the application of HMGB1 to the sciatic nerve after b l un tdis sectio nt oexposethenerv e[54].M o r eim po rta n tl y , HMGB1 induced pain-like behavior without prior surgery [54].SubcutaneousinjectionofHMGB1totheplantarsideofthepaw,aswellasintra-articularinjectionofHMGB1tothe anklejointofmice,drivesmechanicalhypersensitivity[54]. Recently, HMGB1 was shown to be secreted not only b yl e u k o c y t e sb u ta l s ob yi r r i t a t e do rd a m a g e dn e u r o n s ,whichreleaseHMGB1intotheextracellularspace[55].Accu-mulating evidence indicates that HMGB1 is also involvedin the pathology of NPP disease model, HMGB1 expressionwas detected in Schwann cells in the spinal nerve, in theprimary afferent neurons, and in satellite glial the a damage thenucleus to the cytoplasm. HMGB1 forms complexes withotherfactorsandenhancestheeffectofitspartnermolecules(e.g., IL-1 or LPS), and one unexplored possibility is thatHMGB1 directly or indirectly facilitates neuronal activity byalso potentiating the actions of RAGE or an HMGB1 neutralizing antibody inhibits painonsetinNPPmodels[57,61].InaDRGstudy,treatmentwithananti-HMGB1neutralizingantibodysignificantlydepressedTNF-expression [61]. Furthermore, behavioral tests to investigate the mechanical withdrawal threshold revealed thattheadministrationofanti-HMGB1neutralizingantibodyimprovedthepain-relatedbehavior[61]. Nuclear HMGB1 immunoreactivity has been detected in various cells such as neurons, satellite cells, Schwann cells,4 JournalofImmunologyResearch microglia, and astrocytes from naive rodents [57, 62, 63]. I n c r e a s e dl e v e l so fb o t hH M G B 1m R N Aa n dp r o t e i nh a v ebeendetectedinseveralpainstudies,andthishasbeeninter-preted as HMGB1 release and involvement in nociception,sincetheselev easedf ollo win gtheadministra tio nofanHMGB1neutralizingantibody[42,64].Inastudyonthe type 2 diabetes, the development of mechanical allodynia intherodentwasassociatedwithupregulationofHMGB1pro-teininthespinalcord[65].AnintrathecalinjectionHMGB1neutralizing antibody inhibited mechanical allodynia [65].The mRNA fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) the spinal dorsal horn in this model and theseeffectswereattenuatedbyapplicationoftheHMGB1neutral-izing antibody [65]. In another study, intravenous thatthe synthesis and secretion of HMGB1 from spinal neuronsincrease in nerve injury, facilitating the activity of multipletypecellsincludingmicroglia,astrocytes,andneurons,whichin turn results in the symptoms of NPP and suggests thatHMGB1couldbeapotentialtherapeutictargetforNPP. 4. Receptors for HMGB1 in NPP receptors [66, 67]. Mounting evidencereveals that RAGE is a potential contributor to the patho-genesis of many diseases, such as diabetic complications,atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation, cancer, and neurode-generation[37,66,68].RAGEiswidelyexpressedinhumanimmunocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and neuron andglial cells, but its basal expression is low except in the lungs[37, 69, 70]. RAGE expression leads to the upregulationof proinflammatory factor and cytokines [71]. RAGE wasoriginally identified as a receptor for advanced glycationend products (AGEs). However, RAGE also binds to otherstructurally multiform ligands, including all-thiol HMGB1,S100 family members, and it regulates multiple physiological and pathological processes[66, 67]. By virtue of its multidomain structure and ability to recognize different classes of ligands, RAGE behaves as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), analogous to innateimmune receptors such as TLRs, and plays a role in orches-tratingtheimmuneresponse[72].IncontrasttootherPRRs,RAGE not only binds to exogenous ligands but also inter-acts with endogenous DAMPs, such HMGB1 RAGE was the firstidentified receptor for HMGB1 in neuritis and macrophages[73]. Mounting evidence suggests that RAGE is required forHMGB1-induced injury, inflammation, and immunity andthat RAGE activationis essential for this pathology [74-76].Moreover,HMGB1locatedintheextracellularspacecanleadtotheupregulationofRA GEinmultiplecelltypes[77,78].Recent studies show that the HMGB1/RAGE signaling axis might be a potential target for diseases such as diabetes[79], neurodegeneration [80], inflammation [81], and NPP[42]. dorsal root weresubstantially increased when compared with sham injuredrodents [42]. To distinguish the possible roles of RAGE inNPP, a neutralizing antibody against RAGE (RAGE Ab) wasadministered. RAGE Ab treatment did not abrogate painbehavior at postinjury day (PID) 7, 14, or 21, but it resultedin the reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia on PID28 [64]. Tanaka et al.found that blocking HMGB1 or RAGE, using neutralizingantibodies, prevented cyclophosphamide-induced bladderpainandreferredhyperalgesia[64].Thus,thesedatasuggestthataRAGE-triggereddamagesignalisinvolvedinHMGB1activation and may be responsible for sensory neuron sen-sitization and mechanical hyperalgesia associated with NPP.Furthermore, these data suggest that targeting HMGB1 orblocking RAGE might serve as a novel therapeutic strategyforthemanagementofNPP. 4.2. TLR. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a type I trans- membrane superfamily, which is highly evolutionarily con-served in diverse species. TLRs consist of extracellularleucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, by which pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition is evokedunderconditionsofcytopathology[82].TLRsareextensivelyexpressed in innate immune cells such as macrophages andDCs, as well as in nonimmune cells such as epithelial cellsa n dfi b r o b l a s t s .B a s e do nl o c a t i o n ,T L R sa r es o r t e di n t ot w osubfamilies including cell surface its strikingrole was focused on TLRs in the CNS. TLRs are expressed in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the CNS and contribute to both infectious and noninfectious disordersi nt h eC N S .F o l l o w i n gt i s s u ei n s u l ta n dn e r v ei n j u r y ,T L R s(suchasTLR-2andTLR-4)inducetheactivationofmicrogliaand astrocytes and the production of proinflammatorycytokinesinthespinalcord,whichleadstothedevelopmentand maintenance of inflammatory pain and NPP [86, 87].Emerging evidence suggests that TLRs and their associatedsignalingcomponentscontributetopainhypersensitivityandblockading of TLR signaling reduces pathological pain [88].Since some members of the TLR subfamily TLR-9 antagonistblockstumor-inducedthermalhyperalgesia[91]. In an arthritis induced murine pain model, both the levels of HMGB1m R N Aa n de n d o c h y l e m ap r o t e i ni nt h e lumbarspinalcordweresignificantlyincreased[62].Further investigations indicated that the pronociceptive effect ofintrathecal (i.t.) injection of HMGB1 was absent in TLR-4 deficient mice [62] .In a SNL model of NPP, Ma et al. found that HMGB1 and TLR-4 were increased at both the proteinand mRNA levels [44]. Furthermore, mechanical hypersen-sitivity in collagen antibody-induced (CAIA) canbe by administration of a [62]. When using the inhibition ofinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 ,I L - 6 ,a n dT N F -,th e levelsofHMGB1andTLR-4weredownregulatedandthepawmechanicalwithdrawalthreshold(PWT)dataindicatedthatt h eN P Pw a sa l l e v i a t e da ft e rt r e a t m e n t[ 4 4 ,8 7 ] .I na n o t h e rstudy,NPPwasinducedinratsbychroniccompactinginjuryof the sciatic nerve (CCI) [19]. In the CCI rat spinal cord,t h em R N Aa n dp r o t e i nl e v e l so fH M G B 1a n dT L R - 4 ,a swell as the levels of TNF-and IL-1, were upregulated, and the expression of NF-B in the spinal dorsal horn was significantly increased [19]. Furthermore, the abovemen-tioned effects were reversed by inhibition of the TLR-4,whichwasaccompaniedbyadramaticimprovementinpainbehaviors[19,44].ThesedatasuggestthattheHMGB1/TLR - 4signalingpathwayplaysacentralroleintheoccurrenceand developmentofNPP,andatherapytargetingHMGB1/TLR-4 mightbeanovelstrategyforthetreatmentofNPP. However, very recently, the interaction of HMGB1 with TLRs was identified in another NPP model induced by TNI[42]. HMGB1 activation of nociceptive neurons was shownnot to be dependent on TLR-2 and TLR-4 since incubationwith small molecule inhibitors of TLR-2 or TLR-4 failedto alter repeated current pulse induced action potential int h ep r e s e n c eo fH M G B 1[ 4 2 ] .A l t h o u g ht h er e s u l t so ft h i sstudy are different from previous work, there are currentlyno additional reports on how NPP is affected by HMGB1-induced activation. More detailed studies are thus requiredto confirm the HMGB1/TLR interaction and to reveal itspotentialroleinthepathogenesisofNPP. 4.3. Other Receptors. Besides RAGE and TLR4, NMDA receptor and CXCR4 are also involved in the HMGB1-activated inflammatory response. The disulfide forms ofHMGB1donotbindtoTLR4butcanpromotecytokinepro-duction through cooperation with the chemokine CXCL12f o ra c t i v a t i o no fC X C R 4[ 3 2 ] .C X C L 1 2i si n d i s p e n s a b l efor HMGB1-induced inflammation via CXCR4 signaling. Cooperation of HMGB1 and CXCL12 leads to stimulation of CXCR4 and recruitment of inflammatory cells arounddamaged cells [92]. Investigations also revealed that theNMDA as Ca 2+ influx and nitric oxide synthase, which leads to cell death[49].Furthermore,usingMK-801,aNMDAchannelblocking agent, the effect of HMGB1 was abolished [94]. These datasuggestthatNMDAreceptoriscriticalforHMGB1-mediatedcell responses and might be independent of other signalingpathwaysintheHMGB1-activatedinflammatoryresponse. 5. HMGB1 as a Potential Therapeutic Target for NPP Our recent understanding of the mechanisms and, con- sequently, the diagnosis of NPP has become progressivelyclearer in clinical practice. However, the treatment of thiscondition remains challenging [95]. One of the reasons forthis difficulty is the diversity of mechanisms involved inNPP and its persistence [95]. Growing evidence supports aroleforHMGB1asanessentialinflammatorypronociceptivefactor that acts alone or cooperates with other mediatorsincludingRAGE,TLRs,TNF-,andIL-1andsupportsthat HMGB1 is involved in the pathology of NPP [32, 44, 62, 72,74]. As shown by many studies, (e.g., HMGB1 neu-tralizing antibody, HMGB1 inhibitor, and HMGB1 hypersensitivity in animal models ofNPP [44, 72, 75, 78]. Additionally, the level of HMGB1 insamplessuchasserum,plasma,andcerebrospinalfluid(CSF)has been determined using Western blot or ELISA. Theresults indicate that HMB1 might be a promising biomarkerfor human disease diagnosis and therapeutic outcome [27].However,morestudiesareneededtoelucidatetheunderlyingmechanisms in order to use these agents as pain-relievingdrugsinhumansubjects. 6. Concluding Remarks and Future Directions NPP still presents as a major diagnostic and therapeuticchallengedespiteconsiderableprogressintheunderstandingof its mechanisms and the publication of a number ofstudiesthatassessedtheefficacyandsafetyofdrugsusedforsymptomatictreatment.HMGB1playsanessentialroleinthepathogenesis of a large number of inflammatory conditionsand has also been identified as a mediator of neuroinflam-mation.

Moreover, the mechanisms of RAGE-TLR crosstalk in6 JournalofImmunologyResearch response to HMGB1 are still unclear. Given the important role of these pathways in NPP, targeting them may offernew treatments for debilitating and refractory pain. Thus,further investigations are needed to better understand thepathogenesisofNPP. Competing Interests The authors declare that they have no conflict of interestsregardingthepublicationofthispaper.
