Researchers with the [Center for Economic and Social Research](https://cesr.usc.edu/) (CESR) at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences found that more than 3 out of 4 U.S. adults with at least a bachelor's degree have already been vaccinated or plan to be, compared to just over half of those without a college degree. That's a change from earlier in the pandemic, when level of education played less of a role in people's willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. \"Results of our surveys earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 before vaccines were approved \u2014 indicated that race and ethnicity would play a greater role than education level in people's willingness to get the vaccine,\" said [Jill Darling](https://cesr.usc.edu/people/staff/jilldarl), survey director for CESR's Understanding America Study. \"But one year into this pandemic, with vaccines now being rolled out across the U.S., education level has become a greater factor than race.\" Racial differences in vaccine hesitancy persist While gaps between college-educated and non-college-educated U.S. residents are found across racial and ethnic groups, some differences in willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccination persist. The share of adults without a college degree who say they are unlikely to get vaccinated is about the same among Black and white people. But the share of adults without a college degree who are not sure about their likelihood of getting vaccinated is much higher among Blacks than whites. There's only a small gap in willingness to get the vaccine between Asian Americans with and without a college degree. \"What we find driving the educational differences, along with racial and ethnic differences, in vaccine hesitancy is lack of trust in the vaccine development and approval process,\" said [Kyla Thomas](https://cesr.usc.edu/people/staff/kylathom), associate sociologist at CESR. \"Our findings indicate that, in addition to tailoring vaccine awareness campaigns to high-risk groups, policymakers should emphasize the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines particularly to those without college degrees.\" Education level plays a role in estimating vaccine effectiveness and risks On a range of measures related to vaccine experiences and attitudes, including assessing both effectiveness and the risk of serious side effects, people's level of education plays a large role. U.S. adults with at least a bachelor's degree view the vaccine as much safer and more effective than those with less education. About the survey The data was collected from participants in the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative, probability-based online panel of adults who answer tracking survey questions every two weeks.
