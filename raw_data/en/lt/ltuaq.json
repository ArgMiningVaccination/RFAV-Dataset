James h. davis, phd, Jd chairman of the Board louis J. deGennaro, phd president & ceo James h. davis, phd, Jd chairman of the Boardthanks to you, the leukemia & l ymphoma society (lls) is a driving force in making someday today for the more than 1.2 million people in the united states living with a blood cancer. From the strong science and advances in research you are helping us to spearhead, to wins in advocating for patients with legislators and policymakers, to helping newly diagnosed patients navigate their treatment, we continue to earn our leadership mantle as the voice for all blood cancer patients. patients, caregivers and donors continually inspire us to keep investing in lifesaving breakthroughs. We raised awareness about blood cancers and the lls mission through a wide array of media and communications channels in Fiscal y ear 2015. you'll see this, for example, in our support of the pBs documentary, \"Ken Burns Presents Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies,\" which allowed lls to showcase our historic role in advancing blood cancer treatments. our therapy acceleration program continues to bridge the gap between discoveries in the laboratory and drug development, and this past year we entered into partnerships with even more biotechnology companies working on cutting-edge drug discovery and development programs. We continue to lead the charge against acute myeloid leukemia (aMl) - now the most frequently diagnosed leukemia in adults - through the harry t. Mangurian, Jr. Foundation Beat aMl collaboration, changing the paradigm of how patients with aMl are treated. Fiscal y ear 2015 also saw advances in therapies for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), and a first-ever therapy indicated specifically for patients diagnosed with the rare Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. We continued to help patients when they were diagnosed by providing critical support and information through our information resource center, which received more than 60,000 calls from patients, families, and caregivers this past year alone. and, our advocacy efforts paid off this year with five additional states adopting oral parity legislation and the near unanimous passage in the u.s. house of representatives of the 21st century cures act, designed to reform and accelerate the drug discovery and development process. as lls's impact grows we see our important work not just helping patients with blood cancers, but reaching well beyond to help patients with other cancers and serious diseases as well. t reatments originally designed and tested in blood cancer patients are now being tested in other patients with diseases as diverse as pancreatic cancer and parkinson's disease. We have made much progress, but there is more work to be done. We are inspired every day by the researchers who are in a hurry to find cures, by thousands of volunteers across the country raising funds and supporting patients, by our dedicated staff across our 55 chapters on the frontlines with patients and families, and, most of all, by blood cancer patients waging heroic battles against these diseases. With your continued support, we will make someday today for more blood cancer patients and pave the way for treatments and cures across the cancer landscape.2therapy acceleration proGraM LLS celebrated milestones achieved by several partners in our Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP), and introduced two new companies into the TAP portfolio in Fiscal Year 2015. We supported a total of 24 TAP partnerships in Fiscal Year 2015. university oF MichiGan A promising University of Michigan research project, supported through TAP and focused on developing new treatments for patients with a rare and lethal subtype of leukemia, received a significant boost from a licensing agreement with a new biotechnology company, Kura Oncology. LLS has been funding this work, led by Assistant Professor Jolanta Grembecka, PhD, in collaboration with Tomasz Cierpicki, PhD, at the University of Michigan, since 2009. The research aims to develop new treatments for patients with leukemia associated with abnormalities in the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. These patients have a very poor prognosis with current therapies.celator pharMaceuticals LLS has been supporting the development of Celator Pharmaceuticals' CPX-351, a special formulation of two standard chemotherapy drugs, to treat patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The therapy received a Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and interim data released from a Phase 3 clinical trial showed that CPX-351 performed better than standard therapy. LLS looks forward to seeing the overall survival data within the coming year. oncopep LLS entered into a partnership with OncoPep to advance an experimental cancer vaccine that is designed to activate the immune system and control smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), an asymptomatic stage of myeloma. advancing innovation in research the lls research agenda is focused on finding cures. lls drives research in areas of unmet medical need. 3 The LeUKeMiA & L YMPhOMA SOCieTYThe vaccine, PVX-410, was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013. LLS has committed to an equity investment of $690,000 in the effort. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is currently under way. kite pharMa LLS and Kite Pharma entered into a partnership to support a clinical trial for KTe-C19, a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor) immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with refractory non-hodgkin lymphoma (NhL). KTe-C19 is an investigational therapy that genetically modifies patients' T cells to target a specific protein, CD19, on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Once activated, the T cells home in on and eliminate the cancer cells.lls's venture philanthropy in the Media LLS's venture philanthropy leadership in the cancer space garnered significant visibility in the October 2014 issue of Health Affairs, a leading peer- reviewed journal on health policy, thought and research. The article, \"New Players Join the Drug Development Game,\" features our TAP prominently throughout. in developing TAP , LLS recognized the need to take a more proactive role in order to accelerate the development of treatments and cures. The Health Affairs article noted that five of the small companies that LLS invested in later benefited from investment and licensing deals from large pharmaceutical companies. Jolanta GreMBecka, phd, proFessor and researcher at university oF MichiGanTAP Partnerships supported in FY15244 Beat aMl LLS continued to lead the charge against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Fiscal Year 2015, with its groundbreaking harry T. Mangurian, Jr. Foundation Beat AML collaboration. LLS teamed up with Brian Druker, MD, and his research team at Oregon health & Science University's Knight Cancer institute in 2013 to accelerate the development of treatments for patients with AML. The researchers are deploying cutting-edge technology to create a profile of genetic defects in AML cells, and testing different drugs and drug combinations to determine the most effective treatments based on individual patients' particular genetic mutations. As we look to the next phase of the groundbreaking Beat AML initiative in the coming year, LLS anticipates that the innovative collaboration will prove to be a model for other cancer research and discovery programs. Generous donors have contributed more than $8 million to support this initiative, including more than $4 million from the harry T. Mangurian, Jr., Foundation and more than $300,000 raised through an online spring campaign. ThE EMPEror of All MAlAdiEs LLS was a proud supporter of the PBS documentary, Ken Burns Presents \"Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies,\" a film by Barak Goodman. The film showcased a number of key treatment advances pioneered by LLS, including groundbreaking work in targeted therapies for certain forms of leukemia. This brilliant history of cancer, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Siddhartha Mukherjee, MD, is really the story of LLS and blood cancers, and shows we are truly at a unique moment in our ability to treat and cure patients. aMerican society oF heMatoloGy At the 56th american society of hematology (ash) annual meeting, more than 20,000 researchers from around the world converged in San Francisco to learn about the latest exciting advances in treating blood cancers. The LLS- funded team from University of Pennsylvania academic grants funded in FY15277 The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocieTy5 and The Children's hospital of Philadelphia continued to demonstrate more evidence of the durability of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). During the treatment, the patient's immune T cells are engineered and then injected back into the patient to hunt and destroy cancer cells. After receiving the experimental treatment, 36 of 39 children (92%) with treatment-resistant ALL achieved a complete response. Six months after treatment, more than two-thirds (70%) of children enrolled in the study remained cancer free, and 75% have survived. Only five children have required subsequent treatment. The CAR-T approach, first pioneered in the blood cancers, is now being tested in other types of cancers, including breast, colon and pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma. Other therapies showing promise are for patients with relapsed hodgkin lymphoma (hL) and AML. The data with immune checkpoint inhibitors showed encouraging outcomes for patients with relapsed hL, which typically has a very poor prognosis. LLS is supporting this research as well. An experimental approach to a therapy called iDh inhibitors showed promising, durable responses in patients with a subset of AML. This is encouraging news for a disease that has not seen a change in the standard of therapy in the past 40 years. Researchers reported response rates of between 50% and 60% in refractory AML patients. in addition, two research teams, one from italy and one from the U.S., both supported by LLS, reported a high response rate in two separate studies of a precision medicine approach to treating patients diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia. Patients in both trials were treated with vemurafenib, a therapy that inhibits the BRAF gene mutation present in 95% of these patients.lls's satellite syMposiuM at ash LLS featured immunotherapy at its satellite symposium in advance of the 56th ASh Annual Meeting. The symposium, \"emerging immunotherapies for hematologic Malignancies: improving Patient Outcomes by harnessing the immune System,\" featured renowned researchers and highlighted multiple approaches to stimulating the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. The standing-room-only crowd of more than 700 attendees was evidence of the overwhelming interest in this subject. Blood cancer druG approvals in Fiscal year 2015 ibrutinib for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia Breaking new ground, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of ibrutinib (imbruvica\u00ae) for all patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) marked the first time a therapy was indicated specifically for patients with this rare diagnosis. Despite the numerous invested in research in FY15 $67.2 million lls president and ceo louis J. deGennaro attends the 56th ash annual Meeting 6 currently utilized therapies to treat WM, until now there has been no standard of care for the disease and the current treatments are not curative. The approval of ibrutinib, which is given as an oral pill, as both a first-line therapy and for those who have relapsed after other therapies, is a promising development, as recurrence is common. ibrutinib had been approved for patients with CLL and mantle cell lymphoma the previous year, and is now being tested for patients with pancreatic cancer. idelalisib approved for cll The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of idelalisib to treat patients with lymphoma (FL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was a significant advance for patients, as the number of treatment options for patients continues to expand.idelalisib, an oral therapy indicated in combination with rituximab, is a first-in-class inhibitor of Pi3K delta, a protein that is highly expressed in many B-cell malignancies and plays a critical role in the proliferation of these cancer cells. LLS- funded research helped pave the way to such inhibitors of the Pi3K pathway. in another example of how blood cancer research continues to lead the way for other cancers, other Pi3K inhibitors are also being tested for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. dana-FarBer celeBrates 40 years/$60M investMent Dana-Farber Cancer institute recognized LLS's $60 million investment in its blood cancer research programs over 40 years at a special event in April. At the event, some of the world's most accomplished physicians and scientists said that LLS's investment in their work from the earliest days of their careers through the present allowed them to pursue with success areas of research for which they might not otherwise have had the resources. clinical trial searches for patients in FY15conducted 6,000The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocieTy7 oral parity Bills There are now 40 states with oral parity legislation on the books. Since 2012, LLS has helped to pass \"oral parity\" legislation in 20 of these states, removing barriers for patients who rely on prescription drugs to treat their cancer. LLS played a role in helping bills get passed in 5 states this past year alone: North Dakota, South Dakota, Mississippi, Wyoming and West Virginia. 21st century cures LLS worked with Congress over the past year to help lawmakers develop the 21st Century Cures bill, a bipartisan Congressional initiative to invest in medical research and remove outdated impediments that slow the discovery and development of new therapies. in addition to LLS President and CeO Louis J. DeGennaro's testimony during a house committee roundtable on personalized medicine, LLS advocates engaged their elected officials in Washington, D.C., and in their home states. The house approved the act with an overwhelming majority in July. Similar legislation is now being developed in the Senate for consideration this coming year. MilliMan report and out-oF-pocket costs For patients LLS commissioned a study from Milliman inc., which found that placing limits on out-of-pocket costs for patients would relieve their financial burden without imposing a significant impact on insurers. The study, which used examples of insurance plans available on health insurance exchanges across the country established by the Affordable Care Act, reinforces LLS's efforts to advocate for state and federal legislation that helps to control patient out-of-pocket costs.driving policy agenda: Federal and state priorities lls recognizes that finding cures is not enough; we must ensure that patients have access to the treatments they need to live longer, better, healthier lives. lls's policy and advocacy t eam is dedicated to removing barriers to care. lls advocacy leaders caMe to d.c. and helped the 21st century cures act pass in the house8 co-p ay assistance LLS's Co-Pay Assistance Program helps eligible patients with qualifying diagnoses pay their insurance premiums and meet co-pay obligations. LLS provided $41.8 million for patients in Fiscal Year 2015 to help them afford these costs. patti roBinson kauFMann First connection proGraM The Patti Robinson Kaufmann First Connection Program is a peer-to-peer program that matches newly diagnosed patients and their families with trained volunteers who have been touched firsthand by a blood cancer and share similar experiences. in Fiscal Year 2015, the free service matched well over 1,000 patients with trained volunteers.inForMation resource center LLS's information Resource Center (iRC) is a toll-free call center staffed by master's level healthcare professionals equipped with the latest information on all of the blood cancers. iRC specialists responded to approximately 60,000 inquiries in Fiscal Year 2015, more than half related to financial hardship. information specialists can be reached at (800) 955-4572 from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. eT Monday through Friday. helping patients Gain access to care lls is the leading source of free, highly specialized blood cancer information, education and support for patients, survivors, families and healthcare professionals.

Actor and musician Charles esten joined LLS as the National Light The Night Walk honorary chair. Thankful for his daughter Addie's recovery from childhood leukemia, esten aimed to inspire other individuals, families and teams with his and Addie's appearances in national public service announcements, radio segments and extensive educational materials promoting the Light The Night campaign. The esten family also participated in the Light The Night Walk in their hometown of Nashville. Addie is living proof of LLS's impact on blood cancer patients and their families. her experience demonstrates that funds raised for research can result in lifesaving treatments and cures.liGht the niGht Walk / BurlinGton Burlington Stores has been supporting LLS's Light The Night Walk campaign for the past 13 years. And in Fall 2014, for the 11th consecutive year, Burlington Stores was the largest national partner for Light The Night Walk. With a 15-week, in-store promotion, Burlington raised more than $3 million. Since the partnership began, Burlington, a national off-price retailer, has collected more than $22 million to help LLS advance therapies for blood cancer research and ensure patients have access to lifesaving treatments. leukeMia cup reGatta and tiMex in Fiscal Year 2015, sailing enthusiasts who participated in LLS's Leukemia Cup Regatta raised nearly $3.8 million for the LLS mission, culminating with a Fantasy Sail with Gary Jobson to take place in Bermuda in October 2015. Timex \u00ae, the world's leading global watch manufacturer, joined LLS as a national sponsor of the Leukemia Cup Regatta. Throughout calendar year 2015, Timex had a presence at events in support of LLS in the fight against cancer. The company also donated to LLS a percentage of the sales of its Yacht Racer watch. advancing innovation in Fundraising as a nonprofit, lls relies on the generosity of individuals, corporations and foundations.10 teaM in traininG Team in Training\u00ae (TNT) continues to deliver a meaningful fundraising and training experience to individuals who have a desire to move the LLS mission forward. in Fiscal Year 2015, more than 12,500 TNT participants came together to raise $41.8 million to support blood cancer research and patient services. TNT means corporate teams, community teams, passionate athletes, dedicated mission-minded fundraisers, online and social teams and more under one big TNT tent. The $1.4 billion dollars raised by TNT participants over 27 years has helped drive blood cancer survival rates to new heights. Go TeAM!student series in Fiscal Year 2015, the combined Student Series (formerly known as School & Youth Programs) Pennies for Patients and Pasta for Pennies presented by Olive Garden raised a total of $27.7 million. Nearly 14.5 million students in 28,000 schools learned about service, leadership and philanthropy, and saw firsthand how their involvement made a difference in helping save the lives of blood cancer patients. suja rock 'n' roll san diego Marathon & 1/2 Marathon team in t raining participantsMan & WoMan oF the year The 2015 Man & Woman of the Year campaign broke yet another record, with candidates raising more than $32.5 million to help end blood cancer. in the 25th year of this prestigious program, more than 900 participants from across the country competed for the coveted national title. Man of the Year Jason Fleischer of New York used creative techniques such as a cornhole tournament and a date auction to raise $302,045. The Woman of the Year, erin ragsdale of Texas, used her personal connections to elicit large donations that propelled her to a record-setting $469,159. Campaign donations totaled $1.7 million more than the previous year. We also recognized our \"All Star\" alumni this year. This year the \"All Star\" winners were Summer hall, from Davidson, NC, and Gary Cohen, from hillsdale, NJ. hall is a longtime LLS volunteer and mother who raised an \"All Star\" record of $167,000 for a world without blood cancers. Gary Cohen, a TNT alumnus, raised $62,335 to help eradicate blood cancers worldwide.The LeUKeMiA & L YMPhOMA SOCieTYMan & WoMan oF the year Winners Jason Fleischer and erin raGsdale 1112 online FundraisinG and launch oF neW WeBsite Charitable giving continued its migration online during Fiscal Year 2015, growing by 9% as compared to an industry overall growth rate of 2%. LLS was well ahead of that trend, with online donations growing 22% year over year, as we focused our digital strategy on streamlining our digital donation path and adapting our platforms to increasingly mobile-focused consumer behavior. LLS.org relaunched in May with a new design and new technology that allows patients, professionals and supporters easier access to the wealth of content and support offered, whether they're working at their desk, or have just left their doctor's office and are urgently seeking information on their mobile phone. The new site has improved functionality and clearer navigation to discussion, support and research pages. Visitors also see stories and photos of survivors, caregivers and volunteers, and have a chance to submit their own. The migration of all our campaign sites to a similar platform is under way and will be complete by the middle of our next fiscal year.Blood cancer aWareness Month During Blood Cancer Awareness Month, LLS continued to ramp up its efforts to reach new audiences of participants and donors, as well as patients. The integrated marketing and communications campaign, featuring LLS President and CeO Louis J. DeGennaro, launched across TV, radio and digital channels, including our website, and created the strongest awareness yet for LLS. Our targeted call to action garnered donations of $433,000 through our website. The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocieTy13 united Food and coMMercial Workers union (uFcW) The UFCW continued to grow its 32-year partnership with LLS, by connecting its Locals to our chapters in 20 markets to support LLS's Light The Night Walk. it was a banner year for the UFCW's commitment to LLS with an astounding $4,350,000 raised through Light The Night and the myriad other fundraising events the union holds to benefit LLS, including golf tournaments, dinners, auctions, clay shoots and more. UFCW members affiliated with The Beer Store supported a bottle drive for LLSC in Ontario. This initiative alone raised more than $1.7 million. The UFCW has raised close to $77 million since 1983, and all funds raised by its more than 120 Locals in the U.S. and Canada are restricted to fund lifesaving research.We salute new UFCW President Marc Perrone and the more than 1.3 million UFCW members for their tireless support and extraordinary commitment. donor developMent - FundinG the Mission Donors were exceptionally generous with direct gifts of $27.9 million. A highlight was the completion of the $8.3 million fundraising campaign to Beat AML. This pioneering effort was sparked by a lead gift of $4 million from the harry T. Mangurian, Jr. Foundation, and further advanced by long-time LLS volunteer Michael Copley, who served as National Chair. Under his leadership, generous donors across the country recognized the value of this effort and brought us to the fundraising finish line in two years, a full year earlier than expected. Major Gift donors of $10,000 or more, who are listed in the pages of this report, funded many other mission-critical programs, ranging from new research in pediatric blood cancers to patient support through a Transportation Assistance Fund. And forward-looking individuals who chose to shape the future through their estate plans provided $10.2 million in resources this year with thoughtful bequests. liGht the niGht BurlinGton's retail in-store caMpaiGn Models - cancer survivors shayne and chase14 research grants specialized center of research The Specialized Center of Research Program funds multi-disciplinary research by teams of leading-edge academic investigators that hasten the discovery and development of better treatments for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma patients.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the organization's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2015, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.report on s ummarized c omparative information We have previously audited LLS's consolidated financial statements, and we expressed an unmodified opinion on those audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated October 15, 2014.

financial statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2015 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014) 1] organization and summary of significant accounting policies a] organization The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to finding cures for blood cancers. LLS's mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS research grants have funded many of today's most promising advances for the treatment of blood cancer patients, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. LLS is a leading source of publicly available information for blood cancer, education and support, and influences policies that accelerate the development and approval of new blood cancer therapies. LLS advocates for blood cancer patients and their families, helping patients navigate their cancer treatments and ensuring they have access to quality, affordable and coordinated care. LLS is dedicated to removing barriers to care by representing the healthcare and medical research interests of patients and families to policy makers at all levels of government. B] tax-exempt status LLS qualifies as a charitable organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, is exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since LLS is publicly supported, contributions to LLS qualify for the maximum charitable contribution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (LLSC) is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is, therefore, not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. LLS recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Income generated from activities unrelated to LLS's exempt purpose is subject to tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 511. LLS did not recognize any unrelated business income tax liability for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. c] principles of consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LLS, which encompasses the National Office of LLS and its fifty-four chapters in the United States, and LLS's not-for-profit affiliates, LLSC and its five chapters in Canada, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Programs, Inc., and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation. All significant intercompany and intra-LLS accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. d] estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires LLS's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the fair value of alternative investments, allowance for uncollectible accounts, allocation of expenses, and valuation of donated services and media. Actual results could differ from those estimates. e] risks and uncertainties LLS invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate risks, fluctuations in market values, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.LLS's principal source of revenue is amounts contributed by the general public. Accordingly, LLS's operations are affected by individual contributions, which are affected by general economic conditions, employment levels, and other factors over which LLS has little or no control. By contrast to the granularity of the general public donations, the co-pay program in 2015 and 2014 was funded by eight and six donors, respectively. f] summarized financial information The consolidated financial statements are presented with 2014 summarized or comparative information. With respect to the consolidated statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the consolidated statement of functional expenses, 2014 expenses by object are presented in total rather than by functional category. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with LLS's 2014 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized information was derived. g] suBseQuent events LLS evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2015 through October 21, 2015, which was the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and noted one additional required disclosure. On September 15, 2015, LLS entered into a 15 year lease for 41,868 square feet of space for its National Office beginning no earlier than April 1, 2016. The lease terms provide for one year of rent abatement. Future minimum rental lease commitments under the lease are approximately $1,005,000 annually for the next five years. h] net asset classifications To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to LLS, funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into three net asset categories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors, for LLS to utilize in any of its programs or supporting services. Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period and/or purpose. Permanently restricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor-imposed restrictions requiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity. Income earned on these funds are recorded as temporarily restricted net assets and are released from restriction when the donor stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the amount has been appropriated in compliance with the Board-approved spending policy (note 4). i] foreign currencY translation LLSC uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the currency translation of the financial statements of LLSC to U.S. dollars is included as a translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of activities. J] fair v alue measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.32 LLS follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement, for its alternative investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, including hedge funds, limited partnerships, and other funds. This guidance allows, as a practical expedient, for the estimation of the fair value of investments in investment companies for which the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, using net asset value per share or its equivalent, as reported by the investment managers. The classification of investments in the fair value hierarchy is not necessarily an indication of the risks, liquidity, or degree of difficulty in estimating the fair value of each investment's underlying assets and liabilities. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and grants payable approximates fair value because of their short term nature. In 2015, LLS early adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. LLS applied the provision of the update retrospectively to 2014. k] contriButions, grants and deferred revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributions received with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Certain grants are accounted for as exchange transactions whereby revenue is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Amounts received under these arrangements but not yet expended are reported as deferred revenue. l] donated services LLS has determined that certain of the donated services it receives meet the criteria for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The value of contributed services was determined for volunteers that possess specialized skills, and would otherwise need to be purchased. These services are recognized as revenue and expense. m] donated media LLS has conducted national public service announcements (PSA) media campaigns and benefited from donated media time that was aired on television and radio. The value of contributed media, which is recognized in the financial statements, was estimated based on the placement, audience, and demographics of the PSAs. n] cash eQuivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, except for amounts held in investments. o] investments Investments are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices, except for the fair values of alternative investments which are based on net asset values provided by the fund managers or general partners, based upon the underlying net assets of the funds consistent with the concepts of ASC 820. These values are reviewed and evaluated by management.p] fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment, software, and leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter, ranging 2 to 10 years (leasehold improvements 7 years; furniture, fixtures, and office equipment 7 to 10 years, and computer equipment and software 2 to 5 years). Q] professional fees Professional fees included in the consolidated financial statements principally include professional fund-raising fees, contracted software development, and legal and auditing fees. r] reclassifications Certain reclassifications of 2014 amounts have been made to conform to the 2015 presentation. 2] research and co-pay assistance program LLS has various activities that are utilized to carry out its mission as presented below: research Awards and Grants: Awards and grants for research are approved by LLS's Board of Directors and are recognized as expense when contractual conditions have been satisfied. The budgets for multi-year grants, which are generally two to five years in length, are approved on an annual basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has multi-year grant commitments of $51,612,000 at June 30, 2015 which are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. LLS has unconditional grants payable of $69,335,000 and $84,201,000 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are anticipated to be paid in the next year. Grant refunds of approximately $3,104,000 and $821,000 as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, have been netted against awards and grants expense. Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP): TAP is LLS's strategic initiative to speed the development of blood-cancer treatments and supportive diagnostics by creating business alliances with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. TAP provides funding for investigational new drug-enabling studies and clinical-stage projects. TAP contracts are recognized as an expense in the year program milestones are achieved. Multi-year contracts, which are generally two to three years in length, are reviewed against milestones on a quarterly basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has contract commitments of $20,842,000 and $28,575,000 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. Commitments for the awards and grants and TAP programs are contingent upon the satisfactory completion of milestones and/or other conditions in the grant and contract agreements. If such conditions are satisfied, the amounts are estimated to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year ending June 30: 2016 $ 40,749 2017 22,279 2018 and therafter 9,426 Total $ 72,454 notes to consolidated financial statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2015 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014)The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocieTy33 co-p aY assistance program Co-Pay Assistance Program: The Co-Pay Assistance program offers financial assistance to patients in meeting their insurance co-pay obligations for prescription medications or private/ public health insurance premiums. Amounts awarded under the program are expensed in the year approved based on the available funding in the program. Revenue is recognized when the grants are received while expenses are recognized as patients are approved for participation according to program criteria. Accordingly, LLS has recognized $7,254,000 and $11,707,000 in temporarily restricted revenue as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for which the corresponding expense is not recognized until the subsequent fiscal year as patients are approved in the program. The Co-Pay Assistance payable of $14,465,000 and $16,698,000 has been established based on approved patient applications received through June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At June 30, 2015, temporarily restricted net assets include $7,254,000 received in 2015 which are available for expenditure and are intended to be awarded in fiscal 2016. The following summarizes the activities of the Co-Pay Assistance program in 2015 and 2014. Beginning balance Grant commitmentsAmount expended during the year: Direct assistance to patients Other expenses incurred and reimbursed under the contract Amounts available for expenditures in the next year 3] investments The following tables present LLS's fair value hierarchy of investments measured at fair value on an annual basis as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands): Money market funds and cash Fixed income: Long duration fixed income (mutual fund) Short duration fixed income (mutual fund) Government securites and other Equities: Large cap equity International equity Small/mid cap equity Investments report at net asset value: U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Security fund Multistrategy hedge funds Long/short equities Real assets Total investments report at net asset valueMoney market funds and cash Fixed income: Long duration fixed income (mutual fund) Short duration fixed income (mutual fund) Government securites Equities: Large cap equity International equity Small/mid cap equity Investments report at net asset value: U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Security fund Multistrategy hedge funds Long/short equities Real assets Limited partnership equity indices Total investments report at net asset value In 2015, LLS liquidated approximately $50,000,000 of its investment portfolio in anticipation of funding grant commitments in fiscal 2016 as discussed in note 2. Such amount is included in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015. Investment expenses of $866,000 and $1,338,000 have been netted against the net (decrease) increase in fair value of investments for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unrealized (losses) gains were $(4,851,000) and $6,573,000 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. LLS's alternative investments are diversified across four investment strategies, as follows: 1. Multi strategy hedge funds - represent investments in a broad range of investment strategies that seek to exploit opportunities as they occur in the markets due to temporary dislocations or structural inefficiencies and include event driven strategies, distressed debt, merger and other arbitrage, and value investing. 2. Long/short equities - primarily investments in funds that, in turn, invest in liquid, marketable securities, attempting to realize gains through the identification of mispriced securities. 3. Real asset strategy - passively managed real asset portfolios comprise Real Estate Investment Trust Index, commodities, and global natural resource stocks. 4. Limited partnership equity indices - the underlying holdings of the limited partnership equity indices are principally domestic and international marketable securities. 2015 $ 11,707 43,000 (41,804) (5,649) $ 7,254 2014 - 67,100 (49,246) (6,147) 11,707 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ 18,544 18,544 - - 27,599 27,599 - - 30,222 30,222 - - 958 958 - - 7,577 7,577 - - 5,355 5,355 - - 223 233 - 1,327 38,075 2,423 5,638 47,463 $137,941 Level 1 Level 3 $ 25,633 25,633 - - 55,513 55,513 - to consolidated financial statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2015 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014)34 These strategies create indirect exposure to LLS through short sales of securities, trading in future and forward contracts, and other derivative products. Derivatives are investment contracts used to hedge risk. While these financial instruments may contain varying degrees of risk, LLS's risk with respect to such transactions is limited to its capital balance in each investment. LLS's alternative investments contain various redemption restrictions with required written notice ranging from 1 to 90 days. By contrast, all of LLS's nonalternative investments are highly liquid and can be redeemed daily without restriction. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the following table summarizes the composition of such alternative investments at fair value by the various redemption provisions (in thousands): As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, LLS has no unfunded commitments on its alternative investments. 4] temporarily and permanently restricted net assets Temporarily restricted net assets and the income earned on permanently restricted net assets are available for the following purposes at June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands): LLS follows the provisions of the New York Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (NYPMIFA), which imposes guidelines on the management and investment of endowment funds. LLS has interpreted the relevant law as allowing LLS to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as LLS determines is prudent considering the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established, subject to the intent of the donor as expressed in the gift instrument. LLS has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment funds while seeking to protect the original value of the gift. The spending rate policy at June 30, 2015 and 2014 was 4%, plus any additional amounts advised by donors. Under this policy, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results consistent with LLS's overall investment strategy.The following table presents changes in the donor restricted endowment funds for the year ended June 30, 2015 (in thousands): The following table presents changes in the donor restricted endowment funds for the year ended June 30, 2014 (in thousands): 5] legacies and contributions receivable LLS's legacies and contributions receivable at June 30, 2015 and 2014 consist of unconditional promises to give and legacies for which the underlying wills have been declared valid by the probate court and no other conditions are required to be met. Contributions receivables are originally recorded based on discounted cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate which is considered a Level 3 input in the fair value hierarchy. Amounts are scheduled to be received as follows (in thousands): In 2014, a foundation notified LLS that it intended to cancel a grant commitment that was made in the previous year due to a change in the foundation's objectives. Accordingly, LLS wrote off the balance of the contribution receivable in the amount of $3,507,000.notes to consolidated financial statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2015 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014) 2015 Temporarily Permanently restricted restricted $ 607 - 11,738 3,543 4,432 - 7,254 - 115 147 $ 24,146 3,690 2014 Temporarily Permanently restricted restricted $ 1,295 - 2,802 - ResearchPatient serviceCo-pay assistanceOther TotalEndowment net assets at July 1 Investment income Net appreciationAppropriation for expenditure Endowment net assets at June 30 2015 Temporarily Permanently restricted restricted Total $ 3,164 3,575 6,739 61 43 104 82 72 154 (221) - (221) $ 3,086 3,690 6,776 Endowment net assets at July 1 Investment incomeNet appreciationAppropriation for expenditure Endowment net assets at June 30 2014 Temporarily Permanently restricted restricted Total $ 3,122 3,443 6,565 44 79 123 213 53 266 (215) - (215) $ 3,164 3,575 6,739 Redemption period 2015 2014 Daily $ - 2,869 Total $ 47,463 58,543 Less than one year 1 to 5 years After 5 years Subtotal Less: Allowance for uncollectible accounts Discount to present value (1.5% to 5.0%) Total 2015 $ 7,111 2,413 575 Leukemia & Lymphoma SocieTy35 6] deferred revenue, donated services and media During 2013, LLS received a $20,000,000 grant with the contractual agreement to be utilized on research which is jointly identified by the grantor and LLS. At June 30, 2015 and 2014, the unexpended balance of the grant of $4,504,000 and $13,700,000, respectively, are included in deferred revenue. Revenue under this grant is expected to be recognized over the next year, as expenses are incurred. The remaining balance of deferred revenue includes amounts received for special events that will be held subsequent to the fiscal year end. The value of donated services for family support group facilitators and research grant reviewers, as well as donated media are included in both revenue and expense as shown below (in thousands): 7] fixed assets, net Fixed assets at June 30, 2015 and 2014 consist of the following (in thousands): 8] retirement plans LLS has a defined contribution 403(b) pension plan covering all employees meeting age and service requirements. Contributions are based on a percentage of each eligible employee's salary and years of service. Expenses under this plan aggregated $1,858,000 and $4,214,000 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. LLS has 457 deferred compensation plans (the 457 Plans) for its executive staff. The 457 Plans are nonqualified deferred compensation plans subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 457. Expenses under the 457 Plans approximated $10,000 and $296,000 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The assets and liabilities of the 457 Plans are included in investments and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and amounted to approximately $1,380,000 and $1,589,000 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.9] lease commitments The leases for premises, which LLS's National Office and chapters occupy, expire on various dates through September 30, 2023 and provide for certain payments subject to escalation and periodic rate increases relating to real estate taxes, operating expenses, and utilities.
