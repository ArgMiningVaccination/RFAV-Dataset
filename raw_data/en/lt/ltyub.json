This is done by finding the underlying causes of a person's illness with a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan. Your initial visit is very comprehensive and thorough sometimes taking as long as 90 minutes and more common 60 minutes. During this time, the naturopathic doctor will review your medical history, whether you are stressed, and other important lifestyle choices that help determine the best individualized treatment plan moving forward. Your individualized treatment plan may consist of various therapies, such as herbal medicine, homeopathy, dry needling (much like acupuncture), as well as other naturopathic modalities. \"The natural system for curing disease is based on a return to nature in regulating the diet, breathing, exercising, bathing and the employment of various forces to eliminate the poisonous products in the system, and so raise the vitality of the patient to a proper standard of health.\"Benedict Lust Founder of Modern Naturopathic Medicine Will Naturopathic Medicine Help with my Condition?

To this end, it was the self-healing processes found in nature that was critical as was diet, certain select non-toxic drugs, and those things that would achieve balance in the body. The word 'naturopathy' is said to be coined by John Scheel in 1895. It was later adopted by Benedict Lust who is considered the 'Father of Naturopathy' in the U.S. \"Naturopathy\" originates from for birth) and \"pathos\" (the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) root for suffering) to suggest natural healing.
