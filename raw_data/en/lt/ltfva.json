They'll take into consideration the [recommendations from the independent advisory group](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-risk-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-treatments-independent-advisory-group-report/defining-the-highest-risk-clinical-subgroups-upon-community-infection-with-sars-cov-2-when-considering-the-use-of-neutralising-monoclonal-antibodies), which determined the list of potentially eligible patient groups. Treatments for coronavirus The treatments available for people at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill from medicines. Sotrovimab is a biological medicine. It is also known as a neutralising monoclonal antibody (nMAb). Sotrovimab may be given to people if antiviral medicines are unsuitable for them to take. Some treatments come as capsules or tablets that you swallow. Others are given to you through a drip in your arm (infusion), usually in a hospital or local health centre. These treatments can help some people manage their coronavirus symptoms and reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill. The NHS will advise which treatment, if any, is right for you. If you need to go into hospital for coronavirus, you may get other treatments. Accessing testing If you're eligible for coronavirus treatments, you should keep a pack of lateral flow device (LFD) tests at home. You can [order a free pack for home delivery online](https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests) or by phoning 119. When you enter a Scottish postcode, the online order form will say 'Most people in Scotland can no longer get free rapid lateral flow tests.' Click 'Continue' if you're eligible and you'll be able to order. If you develop symptoms, take a test to check if you have coronavirus. Your LFD test is not complete until you [report your result](https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result), either online or by phone, and receive a result confirmation notification. Positive test result If your test result is positive, you should: - Contact your NHS health board on the number on this page. They'll check if treatment is right for you. - Follow [stay at home](/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19/)advice. Negative test result If your test result is negative, but you still have symptoms, you should take another test on each of the next 2 days. So take 3 tests in total over 3 days. If any of these tests is positive, follow the steps for a positive test result. Accessing treatment If you're eligible, contact the health board where you live to access treatment. If you test positive while you're away from home (for example on holiday), contact your home Scottish health board where you permanently live. This is because your home health board (in Scotland) will have access to more information about you. They'll then help you to access the closest treatment service to where you currently are. You may reach an answering machine and be asked to leave a message. When you phone, have a list of medicines you're taking handy, including: - medicines prescribed by your GP practice or hospital - medicines prescribed privately outside of the NHS - any medicines bought from a pharmacy or shop without a prescription - herbal remedies and vitamin supplements - medicines that come in patches, inhalers, suppositories, lozenges, gels, ointments, or creams Do not phone these numbers if you're seeking urgent medical advice or have a general health query. | | Health board | | Phone number |NHS 151](tel:+44-1851-601-151) PANORAMIC Research Study Coronavirus oral antiviral treatments are also being evaluated through a study called PANORAMIC, run by the University of Oxford. The current stage of the study is evaluating a medicine called Paxlovid. This stage is taking place through localised study sites. This is because the health professionals recruiting participants into the study need access to medical record data to see if the medicine is suitable for individuals before they can enter the study. Health boards taking part in this study are NHS Grampian, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and NHS Lothian.
