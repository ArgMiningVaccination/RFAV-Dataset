The prevalence of COVID -19 within the maternity population in B .C. reflects that of the general population .1 The current recommendations are based on our current understanding of local epidemiology, transmission of the virus and prevention of spread of COVID -19 in both the adult, pediatric and maternity populations . The protection of health -care workers must continue to be foremost as B.C. moves forward and in keeping with the ethical guidelines established for the management of the pandemic. Health -care facilities should continue to ensure that they meet all public health and infec tion prevention and contr ol (IP C) recommendations. This applies to all staff, patients, relatives, and visitors. The recommendations in this updated guidance are intended as the minimum requirements for the duration of the pandemic and are meant to be implemented as a part of the hierarchy of controls (see Figure 1) to limit exposure to COVID -19 in health -care facilities . Health a uthorities, under the guidance of public h ealth, may choose to implement additional controls in select hospitals (e.g. , management of surgical volumes, testing of certain high -risk patient populations) based on local or regional COVID -19 epidemiology. When COVID -19 prevalence is low, universal testing offers limited additional value, with downsides including the detection of false positives and recovered COVID -19 positives with inactive virus. 3 Figure 1: Hierarchy for Infection Prevention and Exposure Control Measures for Communicable Disease Based on the current epidemiology of COVID -19 in B.C. 0Fi, the percentage of positive tests has varied from 3 to 15% across different health authorities since November 2020. People who are scheduled for surgery and do not have risk factors for, or symptoms of COVID -19 ca n still be considered low risk for having COVID -19. The maternity population is no different and appears to mirror the general population in B .C. Given the role of support persons during birth, all patients and support persons arriving to a maternity or b irthing unit must be assessed for risk factors and symptoms of COVID -19 in the context of the household within which they live . Most acquisition of COVID -19 is from close contacts so screening of the household members and planned support person is important. Testing should be performed according to the most up -to-date BCCDC testing criteria and recomm endations and may be modified regionally where appropriate. Careful, consistent risk assessment is key to identifying and mitigating risk for both patients and providers. Regardless of the presence of risk factors, symptoms or testing , providers must follo w PPE requirements with careful attention to appropriate and diligent donning and doffing practices. Unique to obstetrics patients is the potential for the evolution of their condition during their hospital stay. Although initial screening should be performed during every admission, a second risk assessment should be performed prior to i Epidemiologic considerations: daily case counts; test positivity rate; incidence rate; point prevalence. Public Health Measures Environmental Measures Administrative Measures Includes changes in scheduling and work practices, and decreased density of individu als. Personal Protective Equipment More protective Less protective Personal Measures Includes staying home when sick, maintaining physical distance/minimizing physical contact, and hand hygiene 4 any surgical procedure (e .g., emergency caesarean section) to ensure ther e are no new risks or symptoms for COVID -19. Given that the obstetric patient's initially screening status may change, the pre -surgical huddle is very important . The entire surgical team, including anesthesiologist, surgeon, assistant, nurses, etc., is res ponsible for deciding the patient risk category together and the expectation is that obstetrical surgery (regardless of it being emergency or elective) will not be delayed waiting for testing results . Scope This protocol applies to all obstetrical patients undergoing a surgical procedure in B .C. during the COVID -19 pandemic. Individual patient risk assessment should be applied to every surgical patient when time permits. See the provincial point-of-care risk assessment tool for more information. Adult non -obstetric surgery and pediatric populations have additional considerations and hospitals should refer to these guidance documen ts for specific recommendations: o IPC protocol for pediatric s urgical procedures during COVID -19 o IPC protocol for adult s urgical procedures during COVID -19 When to P roceed with S urgery in P atients with Confirmed , Suspected, or Recovered COVID - 19? In the adult and pediatric surgical populations , there exists the ability to define procedures as elective, urgent or emergent. However , the nature of obstetrical care makes all obstetrical- related procedures as non -elective. In adult populations , there is an increased risk of perioperative morbidity within the first four weeks of diagnosis .2,3 The same has not been studied in the obstetri cal population. Regardless, due to the nature of obstetrical procedures, surgery should not be delayed while waiting for testing results for any patient, including patients with COVID -19 within their infectious window or patients recovered from their infec tion. When is a patient with COVID - 19 no longer infectious? Refer to the BCCDC's Interim Guidance: Public Health Management of Cases and Contacts Associated with Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) in the Community for information about COVID -19 incubation and communicability period. Live viral shedding may occur for longer in those with COVID -19 illness of greater severity and tho se who are immunocompromised. Rates of re -infection are low within 60 days of COVID -19. H owever , if more than 60 days , the 5 patients should be treated as per the health authority protocols. The following were derived for the adult non -pregnant population and not specifically stu died in o bstetrical populations. H owever , the physiology of pregnancy is unlikely to impact these key concepts greatly. As data evolves , pregnancy -specific data may become available. For fu rther information on discontinu ation of isolation and other disease transmi ssion -based precautions see Discontinuing Additional Precautions Related to COVID -19 for Admitted Patients in Acute Care . Should Testing for COVID -19 be P erformed for Asymptomatic Patients Prior to E lective Surgery? Universal testing for COVID -19 in labour and delivery settings has been reported. Patients presenting in the asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic phase of infection are an exposure risk for health -care workers ( HCWs ) and other patients, particularly when patients are admitted to hospital during delivery. Adding to the complexity of the obstetrical population is the longer stay with labour prior to an obstetrical proce dure. The role of p re-operative screening of asymptomatic patients to mitigate this risk is unknown. Although this may aid in disposition of obstetrical patients, there is a possibility of the detection of false positives and recovered COVID -19 positives w ith inactive virus. However, t he risks of testing asymptomatic patients may be outweighed by the benefits when population prevalence is high. Therefore , the addition of pre -operative testing to symptom -based screening may be of value in certain patient pop ulations in areas where SARS -CoV-2 transmission risk is high. Patient populations and the needs of each facility are unique, therefore, pre -operative testing will vary across health authorities or institutions . When prevalence is high in a given area, there is an opportunity for local multidisciplinary discussion ( facilitated through the emergency operations centre level or equivalent) that considers all of the administrative, environmental and public health meas ures to reduce transmission risk. In addition to the individual patient risk assessment already in place, this includes pre -operative testing of asymptomatic individuals undergoing high risk procedures. The rates of COVID -19 infection in pregnancy in B.C . match those of the general population and would be expected to be comparable with the rates of asymptomatic infection in the general population. When the decision is made to offer pre - operative testing for asymptomatic surgical patients, consideration fo r patients admitted for labour and delivery to undergo testing given the likelihood of requiring an operative delivery should occur. Data are limited and each metric has unique limitations. Recent experience in Fraser Health provides one definition o f what triggered testing- based screening for high prevalence. In that instance, testing -based screening was initiated and continued when community testing positivity rate exceeded 5% and there were two or more COVID -19 outbreaks within an acute care facili ty in the health authority. 6 Guidance for W hich Patients Should Be Tested for COVID -19 Pre-operatively Clinical decision -making needs to guide testing decisions. The following pre -operative patients should be tested: 1) Patients with any sign or symptom consistent with COVID -19 infection (any symptom on the list in appendix 1), even if that symptom is one that can be explained by another diagnosis ( e.g., fever in labour) ; or 2) Asymptomatic patients from units or facilities with an active COVID -19 outbreak (or units/facilities with enhanced surveillance); or 3) Asymptomatic patients who have been instructed by public health to self- isolate as a close contact of a positive COVID -19 case or symptoms consistent with COVID -19; or 4) Asymptomatic patients whose support person or household members have symptoms of COVID -19 or are a close contact of COVID -19. Confirmation of the exposure with public health is not necessary ; or 5) Asymptomatic patients who reside in an area with a high prevalence of COVID -19. The health -care team should consider the addition of test -based screening when the following criteria are met: community test positivity rate exceeds 5% for a sustained period of time, incidence rate is greater than 10.1/100 ,000, and two or more COVID - 19 acute care outbreaks. When this criterion is triggered, consideration of testing for COVID -19 in all pat ients admitted to labour and delivery should occur due to the high rates of operative intervention. The final decision around proceeding with test- based screening should be based on local criteria that meet the needs of patient care, providers, IPC and public health. It should be noted that regardless of test results, patients with a recent COVID -19 cont act would be cared for using droplet/contact and airborne precautions during the 14 -day incubation period (i.e., yellow risk category as per the Patient Risk Category Table ). COVID -19 Immunization The continued roll -out of B.C.' s COVID -19 immunization plan is likely to have a pivotal effect on pre-surgical patient assessment . More evidence is needed on the impact COVID -19 vaccines have on patient s' risk of transmission, perioperative risk and long -term immunity. Therefore, a ll patients, reg ardless of their immunization status, should continue to be screened based on the current patient risk assessment (Appendix 1) . 7 Support Persons During Labour and Delivery Most of the time, obstetrical patients have support person s during their labour and delivery. Determination of the support person as an essential visitor will be made by each health authority or facility staff, in collaboration with the patient/or substitute decision -maker and health -care team . If the support person has symptom s of COVID -19 they should undergo testing; if they have a confirmed infection and are within their infectious window, they are generally excluded from the delivery suite and operating room. The decision to allow the support person to return if symptomatic, or during their quarantine or infectious window, should be in conjunction with local infection prevention and control teams and based on the infection risk of their presence compared to the harm of their absence. For support persons under quarantine or in a unique circumstance where they are symptomatic or within their infectious window but must be present, contact the local IPC teams for guidance on the presence or exclusion, as the degree of risk is determined on a case -by-case basis. Neuraxial Anesthesi a Many obstetrical procedures are performed under neuraxial anesthesia with low risk of conversion to general anesthesia. For patients in red/yellow risk categories, the team may choose to wear either an N95 respirator or surgical mask, taking into consideration the risk of conversion to general anesthesia, the ease and rapidity with which a mask may be changed, mask availability , and the COVID -19 risk to providers should the patient urgently require an aerosol generating medical procedure. This should be discus sed at the pre- operative huddle. Risk Factor Assessment and Symptom Screening A. Urgent and Emergent Surgical Procedures Urgent or emergent surgical procedures should proceed as medically indicated regardless of the patient's COVID -19 status and should not be delayed for testing or test results. Patients reporting any symptoms consistent with COVID - 19 or other d iagnoses (e.g. , fever in labour) should be tested and treated as possible COVID -19 infection. B. Planned Obstetric Surgery Surgical patients should self- monitor for COVID -19 symptoms prior to surgery. Obstetrical patients who develop symptoms , are in self-isolation as advised by public health or are a close contact with a confirmed case should be tested and contact their ob stetrics care provider. Procedures should continue without delay. C. Pre-Surgical Patient Assessment For patients presenting for scheduled obstetric surgery, the COVID -19 Surgical Patient Assessment Form (see Appendix 1) should be completed 24 to 72 hours prior to scheduled surgery, by the pre -admission unit (nurse, medical office assistant or anesthesiologist) over the phone and then again in person when the patient arrives at the 8 hospital on the day of surgery 1Fii. This will allow testing (if required ) to be complete d prior to scheduled procedures . The patient's assessment form should be placed on the patient 's chart. If a patient has signs and symptoms consistent with COVID -19 screening questionnaire , they should be tested. Analysis of Canadian symptom data shows the current community -based testing criteria misses up to 10% of pregnant women with COVID -19 in B.C.1 For urgent or emergent procedures, the patient assessment form sh ould be completed upon arrival to the perioperative area or in the operating room ( OR) (if required in emergent situations). Do not delay an OR procedure if the pre -surgical form has not been completed due to the time -sensitive nature of obstetrical care. IPC risk categories have been developed to guide PPE use before, during and after a surgical procedure. Risk categories are designated as green (low risk), yellow (unknown or moderate risk), and red (highest risk). For the Code OB/Code Pink patient with obta ined history where an appropriate history has been obtained and has not changed ( e.g., development of fever in labour), during the admission, patients can continue as originally classified. For Code OB/Code Pink patients where a history cannot be obtained due to the emergent nature of care, classify them as yellow. D. Pre-surgical Procedure Huddle The pre -surgical huddle with the full surgical team (anesthetist, surgeon, maternity care provider, pediatricians, assistants, nurses, etc.), is one of the stron gest determinants for achieving the highest levels of safety and quality. All other standard elements of a surgical safety checklist should be discussed at this time. The patient r isk category is determined based on information gathered from the patient assessment form, including COVID -19 testing results if applicable and should be agreed upon by the entire surgical team (see Appendix 1). For operative procedures during the course of labour or postpartum care, the team needs to consider if the patient's clinical status has changed to warrant a change in patient risk category , such as new onset of fever in labour. Despite an alternative diagnosis, these patients should be tested and the procedure should proceed in the appropriate risk category (generally y ellow). Recommended PPE during the surgical procedure is provided in Section E: Algorithm for Management of Obstetrical Surgical Patients . ii Every e ffort should be made to assess th e pati ent in their preferred language. 9 E.
