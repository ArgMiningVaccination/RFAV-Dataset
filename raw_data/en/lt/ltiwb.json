HFMD typically affects infants, children, the elderly, and those with a weakened immune system. It is caused by coxsackievirus, a type of enterovirusi [X]A group of viruses that usually cause mild illness and spread through the oral or fecal route that is highly contagious. A mother's immunity is naturally suppressed during pregnancy to prevent fetal rejection; hence, it is possible to contract HFMD, especially in the later stages of gestation ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339891012_Hand_foot_and_mouth_disease_in_late_3rd_trimester_of_pregnancy_A_case_report)). Read on to learn about the symptoms, treatments, and prevention of HFMD during pregnancy. Symptoms Of Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease Some pregnant women may have mild symptoms, while many are asymptomatic. The symptoms begin to appear after a few days of exposure to the virus. However, the symptoms of this infection in pregnancy are similar to signs in a non-pregnant state and include the following ( [2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11129-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease)) ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431082/)). - Low-grade fever - Mouth or throat pain (sore throat) - Painful ulcers in the mouth and on the tongue - Malaisei [X]A general sense of not feeling well, which can be indicative of a medical condition or a side effect of medications and uneasiness [Loss of appetite](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/pregnancy-loss-of-appetite-causes-tips_00781625/) - Small blister-like rashes or lesions on hands, fingers, soles, and genitals [(12)](https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/signs-symptoms.html). Complications Of Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease In Pregnancy There is no clear evidence of hand, foot, and mouth disease complications in pregnant women, the fetus, or newborns. A pregnant mother could pass the virus to the baby, but there is no evidence to demonstrate the involvement of the virus in causing birth defects ( [4](https://www.womens-health-center.org/obstetrics/pregnancy/infections/)). Also, few studies state that having this infection in pregnancy may expose your newborn to mild to severe infection. However, in rare cases, having a fever during the first months of pregnancy, such as due to HFMD, may lead to [miscarriage ](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/miscarriage-causes-symptoms-and-how-to-prevent_00386196/)( [5](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-mouth-disease/)). A few research studies also suggest that this infection in pregnancy rarely increases the risk of complications such as spontaneous abortionsi [X]Unexpected and unintended loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks of pregnancy , intrauterine deathi [X]Demise of a fetus in the womb, typically occurring at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy , myocarditisi [X]Inflammatory condition affecting the muscles of the heart , respiratory failures, and neurodevelopmental delays in infants ( [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25826430/)) ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11755547/)). However, there is conflicting data in this regard, and literature supporting adverse effects of this viral disease on fetuses is limited. [(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6498765/). Transmission Of Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease' Hand, foot, and mouth disease can occur anytime, but more frequently during the summer and fall months ( [4](https://www.womens-health-center.org/obstetrics/pregnancy/infections/)). The regular mode of transmission is through the fecal-oral route. The disease is communicable and also occurs due to ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5902830/pdf/12985_2018_Article_978.pdf)): - Consumption of contaminated water - Inhalation of respiratory droplets from an infected person (cough or sneeze) - Direct contact with an infected person (hand to hand) and touching nose, eyes, or mouth (close contact, kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils) - Contact with contaminated mouth or throat secretions (including saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) or fluids from blisters Young children exposed to the virus at daycare may spread it to their pregnant mothers. The postnatal transmission of this virus from a pregnant mother to her baby is common and may occur through respiratory secretions, blood, and maternal secretions during vaginal delivery. The intrauterine transmission route is seen with a little frequency and is not well-documented ( [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2837356/)). Diagnosis Of Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease The diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease is based on the clinical features and symptoms. Additional laboratory tests are usually not needed. However, stool or blister samples or throat swabs might be taken for analysis in some cases ( [10](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease#diagnosis-of-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease)). Treatment For Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease In Pregnancy There is no specific treatment for HFMD. Most people reportedly see a spontaneous improvement in [their symptoms](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/weird-early-pregnancy-symptoms_00603666/) within a week or two without any medical intervention. However, if you feel you have contracted the virus in pregnancy and need treatment, contact your doctor, who may suggest the following treatments ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431082/)). - Acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve pain or soreness - Gels, sprays, or mouthwashes for mouth ulcers Additionally, you might be advised to stay hydrated and avoid certain foods and drinks, such as spicy or acidic foods, to avoid irritation in the ulcers and recover faster. Prevention Of Hand, Foot, And Mouth Disease In Pregnancy The best way to prevent hand, foot, and mouth disease during pregnancy is to maintain good hygiene throughout your gestation period. You may observe the following good hygiene practices ( [11](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/handfootmouth.aspx)). - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap after using the toilet, changing diapers, wiping your nose, coughing and sneezing, before and after caring for a sick person, and before eating (if you don't have soap and water available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) - Avoid sharing utensils, personal care items, such as towels, and clothes with any family member, including your children, during pregnancy. - Make sure to disinfect any soiled items and contaminated surfaces periodically (e.g., toys and doorknobs). - Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and discard the tissue in a bin. Wash your hands immediately. You may wear a face mask when outdoors. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. - Avoid close contact with anyone who is infected with the illness. - Drink plenty of water and take proper diet and rest to maintain good overall maternal health and immunity. Frequently Asked Questions 1. What is the gestation period for hand, foot, and mouth disease? Research states that the time between infection with the virus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and the appearance of symptoms is typically 3 to 7 days. However, more studies are needed to confirm this ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705633/)). 2. What is the most contagious period for hand, foot, and mouth disease? Hand, foot, and mouth disease is most contagious during the first week of viral exposure. However, it is possible to spread the virus to others even after symptoms have disappeared or if an individual never had any symptoms ( [16](https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/transmission.html#:~:text=People%20with%20hand%2C%20foot%2C%20and,have%20no%20symptoms%20at%20all.)). 3. How long does HFMD live on surfaces? The causative virus of HFMD can survive on surfaces for several days. Hence, to prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease, always clean the contaminated surfaces with disinfectant cleaners ( [17](https://www.flushinghospital.org/newsletter/the-facts-about-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/)). 4. What disinfectant kills HFMD? Most disinfecting wipes or alcoholic cleansers and cleaners containing bleach will do the job. However, cleaners that contain a chemical (check on the label), \"Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride,\" are known to be the most effective ( [18](https://emergency.princeton.edu/what-to-do/public-health-alerts/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease#:~:text=that%20list%20%E2%80%9CAlkyl%20dimethyl%20benzyl,and%20Clorox%20disinfecting%20spray%2Fwipes.)). Mostly, the symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease during pregnancy are mild, and the infection rarely causes complications for either the mother or the baby. Even so, it is critical to take all safety precautions to avoid infection, especially during the summer and fall seasons when the infection is most prevalent. Also, avoid close contact with an infected individual and practice hand hygiene. If you notice any HFMD symptoms when pregnant, contact your healthcare provider immediately to make sure you have a healthy pregnancy and safe delivery.
