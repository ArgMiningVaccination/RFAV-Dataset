QIO review will be governed by provisions of the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If a review identifies that an admission or co ntinued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Section 402 of these rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amen ded, will result in the QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically necessary, Medicaid will assess a late review IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 42 penalty to the hospital as outlined in this rule.

Total inpatient and outpatient covered charges are more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the fiscal year; or (3-17-22) ii. When less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) of covered charges are billed to the state by the provider, and a probable significant underpayment or overpayment is identifiable, and the amount makes it administratively economical and efficient for cost settlement to be requested by either the provider or the state, a cost settlement will be made between the hospital and the Department. (3-17-22) b. Payment for Hospitals Without Cost Settlement. Those out-of-state hospitals not cost settling with the state will have annually adjusted rates of payment no greater than seventy-five percent (75%) for inpatient covered charges and no greater than eighty percent ( 80%) of outpatient covered charges or, the Department's established fee schedule for certain outpatient services. These rates represent average inpatient and outpatient reimbursement rates paid to Idaho hospitals. (3-17-22) 08. Audit Function .

Cost information as developed by the provider must be current, accurate, and in sufficient detail and in such form as n eeded to support payments made for services rendered to participants. This includes all ledgers, books, reports, reco rds and original evidences of cost (purchase requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, requisitions for materials, inventories, labor time cards, payrolls, bases for apportioning costs, etc.), which pertain to the determination of reasona ble costs, leaving an audit tr ail capable of being audited. Financial and statistical records will be maintained in a c onsistent manner from one (1) settlement period to another. (3-17-22) 10. Availability of Records of Hospital Providers . A participating hospital provider of services must make available to the Department in the state in which the facility is licensed, the provider's fiscal and other necessary records for the purpose of determining its ongoing record keeping capability and to ascertain information pertinent to the determination of the proper amount of program payments due the provider.

(3-17-22) 12. Notice of Program Reimbursement . Following receipt of the finalized Medicare cost report and the timely receipt of any other information requested by the Department to fairly cost settle with the provider, a certified letter with the return receipt requested will be sent to the provider that sets forth the amounts of underpayment or overpayment made to the provider. The noti ce of the results of the final retroactive adjustment will be sent even though the provider intends to request a h earing on the determination, or has appealed the Medicare Intermediary's determination of cost settlement. Where the determination shows that the provider is indebted to the Medicaid program because total interim and other payments exceed cost limits, the st ate will take the necessary action to recover overpayment, including the suspension of interim payments sixty (60) days after the provider's receipt of the notice. Such action of recovery or suspension will continue even after a request for an informal conference or hearing is filed with the state. If the hearing results in a revise d determination, appropriate adjustments will be made to the settlement amount. (3-17-22) a. Timing of Notice. The Department will make every effort to issue a notice of program reimbursement within twelve (12) months of receipt of the cost report. (3-17-22) b. Reopening of Completed Settlements. A Medicaid completed cost settlement may be reopened by the provider or the state within a three (3) year period from the date of the letter of notice of program reimbursement. The issues must have been raised, appealed and resolved through the reopening of the cost report by the Medicare Intermediary. Issues previously addressed and resolved by the Department's appeal process are not cause for reopening of the finalized cost settlement. (3-17-22) 13. Non Appealable Items . The formula for the determination of the hospital inflation index, the principles of reimbursement that define allowable cost, non-Medicaid program issues, interim rates that are in compliance with state and federal rules, and the preliminary adjustments prior to final cost settlement determinations as supported by properly completed cost reports and audits are not acceptable as appealable items. (3-17-22) 14. Interim Reimbursement Rates for Providers Subject to Cost Settlement . The interim reimbursement rates must be reasonable and adequate to meet the necessary costs that are incurred by economically and efficiently operated providers that provide services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws, rules, and quality and safety standards. (3-17-22) a. Annual Adjustments. Interim rates will be adjusted at least annually based on the best information available to the Department. (3-17-22) b. Retrospective Adjustments. Interim rates will not be adjusted retrospectively upon request for rate review by the provider. (3-17-22) c. Basis for Adjustments. The Department may make an adjustment based on the Medicare cost report as submitted and accepted by the Intermediary after the provider's reporting year to bring interim payments made during the period into agreement with the tentative reimbursable amount due the provider at final settlement. If the settlement amount is equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of the payments received or paid and equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the inte rim rate will be adjusted to account for half (\u00bd) of the difference. (3-17-22) d. Unadjusted Rate. The Medicaid interim reimbursement rate on file is synonymous with the term una djusted rate used by other payors. (3-17-22) 15. Audits .
