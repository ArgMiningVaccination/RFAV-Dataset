The fundamental theories of acupuncture are rooted in holistic ideas that developed over the course of approximately 2500 years in China. Acupuncture promotes health, and is used to treat acute and chronic illness, mainly through the insertion of filiform needles to establish a healthy balance of the individual's energy and body functions. The Acupuncture program prepares you to become a professional acupuncturist, subject to successful completion of the national and provincial registration examinations. Students receive the instruction needed to practice acupuncture competently based on the most recent national standards.
