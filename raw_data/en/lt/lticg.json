Even those who have prescription coverage can face co-pays that put medication out of reach. While U.S. health insurance plans must cover people living with hepatitis B, many plans place hepatitis B medications in a category that dramatically increases the co-pays for those drugs. Although current laws protect individuals with pre-existing conditions including hepatitis B, from discriminatory practices by health insurance companies, these prescription pricing practices have effectively made many insurance plans unaffordable for people living with hepatitis B. When health insurers design plans, they assign each prescription drug to a price \"tier.\" A low-cost generic antibiotic may be a Tier 1 while a new, brand-name drug is assigned to a pricier Tier 4 or 5. The Hepatitis B Foundation recently reviewed hepatitis B prescription coverage for Silver-Level Qualified Health Plans sold through Florida's 2018 healthcare marketplace. Our research revealed that common hepatitis B medications were placed on the highest two tiers in the majority of the plans. These tiers typically required patients to meet deductibles between $2,500 and $6,750 before allowing cost-sharing benefits for any hepatitis B drugs, even generics. This over-pricing of certain drugs by placing them in a higher tier, called \"adverse tiering,\" acts as a deterrent for people with chronic conditions from buying a health plan, and can be considered discriminatory against pre-existing conditions. To fight these practices, The AIDS Institute and the National Health Law Program (NHeLP) filed complaints in Florida against insurance companies that inflated their HIV drug prices through \"adverse tiering\" to discourage people living with HIV from buying their plans. The complaint was based on Florida Qualified Health Plans available in 2014 and 2015, and found that four of the insurance plans they reviewed placed all HIV drugs on the highest tier, leading to inordinately high co-payments and co-insurance for medications used in the treatment of HIV and AIDS. The practice was found to be discriminatory by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office for Civil Rights. The insurers were fined and the drug tiers for HIV drugs were revised to be more affordable, but this \"adverse tiering\" persists nationwide for hepatitis B and C drugs.

In addition to these financial barriers, when hepatitis B treatments and other drugs are placed on high tiers, this often requires prior authorization, quantity limits, or the use of specialty pharmacies, which further discourage users from accessing treatment. In the case of Florida, area coverage also poses an issue. In 21 of the 67 counties in Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only carrier offering coverage. In an additional 22 counties, only two carriers offer coverage. Thus, while some plans offer better coverage and cost-sharing for specific medications, patients have a limited ability to choose the best plan for their needs. The Hepatitis B Foundation is working to change these practices for hepatitis B medications, but we need your help to gather data and document cases to identify areas where we can be most effective at changing policy. Patients who are having difficulty affording their hepatitis B medication are encouraged to contact the Foundation at 215-489-4900 or via email at info@hepb.org to share their story. In addition, there are federal consumer protection laws that apply to insurance plans purchased on the marketplace, as well as Medicare and Medicaid. We encourage patients with one of these insurance plans, who are facing high costs for medication, to file complaints with their state's Health Insurance Commissioner. The Foundation, in collaboration with NHeLP , has created instructions and a template for consumers and organizations to use to file complaints, which can be found at hepb.org/overpricing. Consumers will have to do some research on the marketplace's website to discover the drug prices in their region, but they can help end discrimination and bring down the rapidly-escalating drug prices found in many health plans. The Foundation can also assist you in filing. Even if you don't file a complaint, if you shop for health insurance on the marketplace, take time to thoroughly research how much the plan will charge for antivirals to protect your rights and your wallet.Improved p atient Access, continued... Ju-Tao Guo, MD Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH Hep B Cure Campaign Grows Momentum In 2016, the Hepatitis B Foundation launched the Hepatitis B Cure Campaign to capitalize on the increased national and international momentum around hepatitis B and to sharpen the focus on finding a cure. Our goal is to make the elimination of hepatitis B by 2030 a national health priority. Since the program was launched two years ago, substantial progress has been made, with several major accomplishments that are moving us closer to our goal. We established a presence in Washington DC, which has helped us to develop new HBV champions and leadership on Capitol Hill, conduct advocacy training and meetings with 38 congressional offices, secure strong appropriations report language from National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Department of Defense (DOD), and meet with NIH leaders to identify ways to accelerate the pace of discoveries related to hepatitis B and liver cancer. Our Roadmap for a Cure provided a detailed research agenda for curing hepatitis B, developed by 35 of the world's leading scientists and clinicians in the fields of hepatitis B and liver cancer convened by the Hepatitis B Foundation for this purpose. This research agenda was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Hepatology in 2017. Our Professional Judgment Budget identified the most critical projects from the research agenda, aligning them with existing NIH funding mechanisms, and calculating the increased investment needed over the next six years to follow the scientific roadmap to cure hepatitis B. ($232 million additional investment per year or $526 million total over six years) In October 2018, the Liver Illness Visibility, Education, and Research (LIVER) Act was introduced by Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) to direct the National Cancer Institute to create new funding opportunities for liver cancer and to make hospitals and healthcare facilities eligible to receive new funding for experimental treatment and prevention programs. The bill also creates two new HHS grant programs: one for liver cancer prevention activities and another for awareness activities targeted to Americans in communities at higher risk. To help the program continue to build momentum, the Hepatitis B Foundation has established the Hep B Cure Campaign (HBCC) Partnership program t o promote increased public-sector investment in hepatitis B and liver cancer research. With increased partnerships and expansion of advocacy efforts to secure research funding, we believe that the elimination of hepatitis B is within our reach.Filing a Hepatitis B Drug Pricing Complaint Who can file a complaint? Anyone can file a complaint at any time. You do not have to be a hepatitis B patient or a purchaser/ holder of the insurance plan to file an administrative complaint with your state Bureau of Insurance or the federal civil rights office. How do I file the complaint? Each state's Bureau of Insurance website should have a portal for filing a complaint. Usually you can copy and paste the completed complaint into a form on the website, or you can email the complaint to the Bureau of Insurance. For detailed instructions on researching pricing and filing a complaint, visit www.hepb.org/ overpricing or email info@hepb.org.

In 2016, a routine colonoscopy and subsequent blood testing revealed Dave had serious liver disease. We were blindsided. In the beginning, we faced insensitive and ignorant doctors who told Dave there was nothing they could do. They even refused him treatment for his hepatitis B and never referred him to a transplant clinic. During this time, Dave's liver was getting worse and we couldn't afford to waste any more time. Eventually, he found a knowledgeable doctor who put him on antivirals and knew to test him for hepatitis D, a dangerous coinfection of hepatitis B. \"It won't be good if you have it,\" he said. He did.Due to changes in our health insurance, we were sent to a highly respected liver center in California, who helped save Dave's life. He now had liver cancer and was taking interferon treatment for his hepatitis D. Still, he was doing poorly and although he was on the transplant list, didn't qualify for an organ yet. After many months, hundreds of office and emergency room visits, he qualified, and we got the call - on Thanksgiving night 2017! There was a healthy liver available, and we took it. As a caregiver, it was tough. No one prepares you for the physical and mental toll it takes to support someone who is in pain, incapacitated, and often, down-right nasty. It was an enormous stress on me; driving, paying bills, our construction business: you name it, I did it all. But the good we took away is his health! Dave still doesn't feel it was real. We went through so much and are so grateful to be on the other side. \" KarenHepatitis B Foundation to Provide Resources for African Immigrant Communities The Hepatitis B Foundation, in collaboration with the CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis, is excited to announce the creation of a collection of hepatitis B educational resources for African immigrant communities that will be released in early 2019. These will be the first nationally available resources created for African immigrants and will serve an unmet need to raise awareness and promote testing for hepatitis B, which is estimated to affect 5-18% of African immigrant communities in the U.S. Working with an expert advisory board of community health workers, clinicians, scholars and community members, HBF conducted an assessment of current hepatitis B knowledge, barriers to accessing testing and care, and strategies to address current gaps. The data we collected was used to inform the creation of culturally-relevant resources. The materials will be pilot-tested in multiple communities and will include a self-teach audio-visual module for educators, a picture-based flipchart for direct community education, and a comprehensive resource toolkit. Future expansion for the project will focus on dissemination of the materials, media advertising and community outreach. Subscribe to our e-newsletter for news and updates on these materials! Focus on Hepatitis Delta Karen and Dave: One Couple's Journey through Hepatitis B, Hepatitis D, Liver Cancer and a Successful Transplant Hepatitis Delta Connect is a dedicated program of the Hepatitis B Foundation to increase awareness about this serious virus that co-infects hepatitis B patients, promote screening and testing, and provide information and support for those affected.

Approximately 80 people from 50 organizations, campaigns, and coalitions from around the United States joined Hep B United (HBU) to learn more about the current state of hepatitis B and to advocate for increased support and prioritization from the federal government. The Summit provides federal, state, and community- based organizations with the opportunity to join forces and share their expertise and knowledge. The collaborative work that is done at the Summit provides momentum for the hepatitis B community and allows for the growth of new ideas and plans of action on both a community and organizational level. Each annual Summit advances our movement to effectively address hepatitis B, reflect on recent successes, and move the community one step closer to eliminating hepatitis B. The 2018 summit theme was Achieving Health Equity to End Hepatitis B, with sessions that addressed expanding hepatitis B screenings in high-risk communities, combating stigma and discrimination, disparities in hepatitis B medication pricing, and preventing perinatal transmission. The day before the Summit began, attendees participated in a hepatitis B advocacy day on Capitol Hill. More than 65 participants were able to meet with 61 Congressional offices in just under four hours! Advocates shared their personal experiences with hepatitis B and asked their representatives to support funding for expanded hepatitis B surveillance and prevention programs, funding towards accelerating research to find a cure for hepatitis B and improving treatment options, and improved resources to increase vaccination rates among adults. On Wednesday, July 25, Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii, and Representatives Judy Chu from California's 27 th district, Hank Johnson from Georgia's 4th district, and Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania's 8th district joined a Congressional reception hosted by the Hepatitis B Foundation to recognize community and Congressional Hep B Champions. Dr. Matthew Lin , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health, shared remarks on the Department of Health and Human Services' commitment to eliminating hepatitis B. Senator Hirono was presented with the first annual Hepatitis B Congressional Champion Award for her dedication to elevating hepatitis B research at a national level; Arman Altug from the Hepatitis Education Project, the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, and Kenson and Rensely Alik from Hep Free Hawaii and the #justB storytelling campaign were also recognized for the work that they've done to address hepatitis B in their communities. Established by the Hepatitis B Foundation and AAPCHO in 2012, Hep B United now has more than 30 local coalitions across 26 cities in 19 states and the District of Columbia, all with the goal of promoting screening, vaccination and linkage to care to eliminate hepatitis B.When Dr. Su Wang moved to New Jersey from New York City, she noticed something unusual about the way local patients sought care. \"After living [in northern New Jersey] for three years, I noticed that there was a very strong Asian community here, but people were not accessing health care locally. They would go into New York, into Flushing, into Chinatown to see a doctor once a year, but then they wouldn't have anybody nearby to see. Some of it was the language barrier, the cultural barrier. When it comes to medical stuff, they still prefer to speak to somebody in their own language. And that is enough of a barrier where they just won't go.\" Dr. Wang's vision was to fill that void. She approached the Saint Barnabas Health System with her idea. \"They had great services, and I wanted to be the bridge between those services and the community,\" she says. They agreed, and in 2013, the Center for Asian Health at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Florham Park was born. Dr. Wang, who is fluent in both English and Mandarin, also recruited other bilingual physicians to join her practice. \"New Jersey just hadn't been tapped into as much and yet it is so diverse. It's the fourth highest Asian population in the US,\" she says. \"My passion was hepatitis B, so I got grants to do some screenings. We're really trying to do prevention and true population health, which means not just treating people who are sick, but really trying to keep people from getting sick. That's where I think the public health thing that I do is helpful,\" she says. \"Because for hep B, the screening and early treatment all helps keep people healthy.\" Dr. Wang's interest in public health began during her medical training at University of Miami. After her residency, she did a two year public health fellowship with Centers for Disease Control, then began searching for a clinical position. That search landed her a job at the Charles B Wang Community Health Center in New York City (CBWCHC). The Center's patient population had a high prevalence of hepatitis B, and Dr. Wang quickly learned how to treat the patients who came to her. \"Treating hepatitis B was not something I learned during residency, but CBWCHC was one of the pioneers to start training [primary care] doctors to treat hep B. It is especially important training for doctors who treat a population of people with high prevalence,\" she continued. \"It's a way for a physician to respond to a need in their own community. Sometimes seeing a specialist is a barrier, and primary care doctors who see high risk patients should be able to offer care.\"Sixth Annual Hep B United Summit Focuses on Achieving Health Equity n YES!

The 2018 Hep B United Summit attracted over 80 attendees from 50 organizations to the event in Washington, DC. The Hepatitis B Foundation recorded six new stories this summer for our #justB campaign, for a total of 30 unique stories available as part of our national, multilingual hepatitis B storytelling campaign. Their stories include messages of hope and encouragement despite difficult situations such as facing discrimination due to having chronic hepatitis B, recovering from an emergency liver transplant surgery, learning to take control of one's health after being diagnosed and losing a family member to the disease, or working with limited resources to fill the gaps in hepatitis B education and access to care for your community. These stories were created to provide information and raise awareness about hepatitis B issues in the United States and globally. We invite others to use the videos as a tool to educate audiences about screening and prevention, and advocate for increased attention to the virus within the health professions and broader medical community.
