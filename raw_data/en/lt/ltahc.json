Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccination on the Symptoms of Patients With Long COVID: A Target Trial Emulation Using Data From the ComPaRe e-Cohort in France 17 Pages Posted: 29 Sep 2021 [More...](javascript:void(0);) Abstract Background: Long COVID is a complex multiorgan disorder that can affect patients' lives severely. Recent reports suggest that symptoms improve after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We used data from the ComPaRe long COVID cohort to emulate a target trial evaluating the effect of vaccination among patients with long COVID who still had persistent symptoms at baseline. Vaccinated patients were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio by their propensity scores. Outcomes, all measured at 120 days after baseline, include disease severity (long COVID ST, range 0-53), rate of complete remission (ie, disappearance of all symptoms), disease impact on patients' lives (long covid IT, range 0-60), and the proportion of patients reporting an unacceptable symptom state. Vaccinated patients reported all adverse events occurring after vaccination in free text. Findings: In total, 455 patients were allocated to the vaccination group and 455 to the control group; 545 (60\u00b71%) had confirmed infections, and 81 (8\u00b79%) had been hospitalized during their acute COVID-19. By 120 days, vaccination reduced the long COVID symptoms (mean (SD) ST score in the vaccination group 13\u00b70 (9\u00b74) vs. 14\u00b78 (9\u00b78) 95% CI -2\u00b75 to -1\u00b70) and doubled the rate of patients in complete remission (remission rate 16\u00b76% vs 7\u00b75%, HR: 1\u00b797, 95% CI 1\u00b723 to 3\u00b715). Furthermore, vaccination reduced both disease impact on patients' lives (mean (SD) IT score 24.3 (16\u00b77) vs mean difference: -3\u00b73, 95% CI -6\u00b72 to -0\u00b75) and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9% vs 46.4%, risk difference -7\u00b75%, 95% CI -14\u00b74 to -0\u00b75). In the vaccination group, two (0\u00b74%) patients reported serious adverse events leading to hospitalisation. Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination lowers the severity and life impact of long COVID at 120 days among patients with persistent symptoms.
