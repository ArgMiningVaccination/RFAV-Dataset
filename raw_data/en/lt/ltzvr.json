Data traditionally collected in a clinic or hospital setting is now able to be collected in everyday environments of patients and is known as patient -generated health data (PGHD). Ambulatory care practices with access to PGHD in their electronic health records (EHRs) may be able to improve patient outcomes, care coordination, quality, and cost -effectiveness. Opportuni ty and need for PGHD became apparent in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic abruptly reduced the number of primary and specialty care visits occurring face -to- face, replacing them with telehealth \u2014such as eVisits and telephone calls. Yet identifying which data are needed and supporting patients and clinicians through data capture a nd transfer into EHRs is highly complex. Effective use of PGHD in clinics poses many challenges, including clinician and patient burden, poor usability, workflow integration challenges,1 and the potential to exacerbate health inequities. The Agency for Hea lthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned an environmental scan that would serve to inform the development of a practical guide that ambulatory care settings can use as they approach the use of PGHD for patient care. Methods We s ought input from a technical expert panel (TEP) of patients, clinicians, researchers, and EHR experts experienced with integrating PGHD and sharing PGHD with clinicians. The TEP shared their experiences on how PGHD was currently being used and gave feedback on the methods and data collection plans. This environmental scan addresses knowledge and evidence gaps pertaining to use of PGHD through the following approaches: 1) a scoping review that examined the evidence of integrating PGHD into EHRs that expa nded on one conducted by Tiase et al. and update d2,3 through October 2020; 2) a review of reports produced by think tanks, government agencies, professional associations, and vendors; and 3) conversations and surveys collected from major ambulatory care EH R vendors that serve the majority of the U.S. market to collect information on how their clients are integrating PGHD into EHRs. Findings Scoping Review : Our formal scoping review (N=36) provides evidence and examples from peer-reviewed literature on th e integration of PGHD into EHRs across a variety of care delivery models in ambulatory care settings (Table 1). Types of PGHD included biometric data, questionnaires/surveys, and health history. Diabetes was the most common patient condition (27.7%). Apple HealthKit was the most common developer platform used (25%). Themes emerged concerning authentication, resource requirements, patient technical support and training, data delivery to the EHR, data management, and preferences for review. Guides & Resource s: Our search of guides and resources presents documents in Table 4 that include a variety of white papers, guides, and resources from professional organizations (e.g., American Medical Association, American Medical Informatics Association), and government agencies (e.g., FDA, ONC), among others. Topics in these documents cover a variety of aspects important to the selection and integration of PGHD in ambulatory care settings. Legislative 6 patchwork at the Federal level governing data privacy, standardization, reimbursement, and regulation is complex and evolving. EHR Vendors: The growing evidence for PGHD -EHR integration is reflected in the EHR vendor feedback (Tables 3 and 4), which describes a developing landscape in which they partner with institutions to leverage PGHD to improve health outcomes and improve care coordination. iOS HealthKit is commonly used due to its maturity, which provides data and security standardization. Few health systems and EHR vendors directly integrate with Google's Android platform. The use of interoperability standards such as Health Level Seven's (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is growing. To create value from PGHD, however, requires investment, commitment, and an understanding of many variables that influence the success and challenges of PGHD integration to improve patient outcomes, care coordination, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Conclusion/Recommendations We present a thematic summary of recommendations from the scoping review, reports, policie s, and data collection from the EHR vendors (Table 7). These recommendations are envisioned to inform the development of a practical guide for ambulatory care providers as they approach the integration of PGHD. The recommendations are as follows: 1. Develop a strategy or blueprint. 2. Identify champions and early adopters. 3. Tie PGHD to a care delivery model. 4. Design the workflow. 5. Use a patient -focused approach with a health equity lens. 6. Leverage a robust technology architecture. 7. Create data governance. 8. Create dev ice governance. 9. Provide guidance and education to stakeholders. 10. Implement and adapt through iteration. 11. Evaluate against metrics and goals. 12. Plan for maintenance and scaling. 13. Provide technical support. 7 Chapter 1. Background, Purpose Patient -generated health data (PGHD) are \"health -related data created, recorded, or gathered by or from patients (or family members or other caregivers) to help address a health concern.\"4 Enthusiasm for use of remote monitoring devices to collect PGHD is high and increasing among researchers, clinics, and health systems. Many mobile health technologies tether to smartphones, Wi-Fi, or have cellular -embedded chips, which have proliferated across socioeconomic groups in the United States.5 PGHD can be collected in near real -time from patients in their daily environments. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies6 allow manufacturers of certain FDA -cleared noninvasive, vital -sign-measuring devices that measure biometrics to expand their use so healthcare providers can use devices to monitor patients remotely. The potential for PGHD to impact health is significant. By providing insights into the day-to - day health of an individual, patients and clinicians can employ better strategies to prevent and manage acute and chronic conditions, and clinicians and scientists can use these data to generate and apply analytical techniques to improve risk prediction and diagnoses. 7 The benefits of PGHD can reach across care facilities and diverse geographic locations thr ough web-based interoperable data exchange to deliver more precise treatment and self -management assistance to broad populations. W hile these technologies are promising, the ability for ambulatory care practices to successfully collect these data in collaboration with patients, transfer data to their EHRs, and use them effectively in clinic settings poses many challenges. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) outlines multiple technical challenges related to accuracy of measurements, data provenance, interoperability, implementation, and privacy and security concerns in the data lifecycle (i.e., collection, transmission, storage, and analysis). 4 In addition, selecting valid devices from an increasing number of options, integration into new care delivery models, costs for patients, equitable access to technology, and inadequate information technology (IT) literacy are among the many challenges facing adoption of PGHD nationwide. I ntegration of PGHD into Ambulatory Car e Electronic Health Records. As healthcare moves beyond EHR implementation, the integration of PGHD from connected devices, including mobile health technologies, is gaining speed. Companies like Apple Inc. have enabled the ability for patients to aggregate their health records from multiple sources on an iPhone and integrate data via authentication into health system patient portals such as Epic's MyChart. It is also possible to integrate third-party data, such as patient -generated blood glucose levels, into the EHR via Apple HealthKit. 8 This is possible with many major EHR vendors. This capability is quickly expanding to Android platforms with Google Fit and through data aggregation companies such as Validic and Xealth.9,10 Ambulatory care practices with access to PGHD in their EHRs may be able to more efficiently and accurately perform diagnoses, manage chronic conditions, reduce repetitious lab testing, promote greater patient -centered care, and even intervene early to avoid acute episodes or prevent hospitalizations. Yet identifying which data are needed and supporting patients through data capture and transfer into EHRs is highly complex. Standardized interoperable data interfaces are quickly becoming important tools in the integration of PGHD into EHRs. These include standards such as Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) and FHIR.11 With the rollout of new ONC interoperability rules requiring healthcare providers who receive Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (C MS) payments to use FHIR -compatible apps for patient data, adoption will likely accelerate.12 8 Nascent Body of Evidence on PGHD Use. Policymakers, researchers, IT experts, patients, and providers have been building a body of evidence to (1) identify patient cohorts who can best benefit from PGHD capture, (2) accelerate adoption of IT solutions to support patient transfer of data, and (3) optimize data review by mining large quantities of PGHD to identify patterns and red flags for clinical wor kflows and care planning. Recent systematic r eviews2,13 advance knowledge about the need for data quality, interoperability, data security, and easy-to -understand clinical and patient self -management insights. Ne vertheless, our collective body of knowledge about PGHD remains inadequate, thus complicating efforts by ambulatory care practices to systematically and efficiently approach these opportunities. T he opportunity and need for PGHD became apparent in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic abruptly reduced the number of primary and specialty care visits occurring face -to- face, replacing them with eVisits and telephone calls.14 While virtual care and telehealth have the capability to facilitate patient access and increase efficiency of healthcare resources, virtual appointments make it difficult to collect patient -level data essential for diagnosis and chronic disease monitoring. Providers must now rely on patients to collect their own vitals and other health data, which was previously collected in clinic. Virtual care must be implemented strategically to be equitable across diverse populations and clinical conditions so as to not further exacerbate existing health inequities. 15 There is an urgent need to support ambulatory care practices in this complex process through the broad capture and synthesis of PGHD evidence and the translation of that evidence into a practical guide. P urpose. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned an environmental scan that would serve to inform the development of a practical guide that ambulatory care settings can use as they approach the use of PGHD for patient care. The study team engaged a technical expert panel (TEP) of patients, clinicians, research ers, and EHR experts experienced at integrating PGHD into the EHR to give input to the environmental scan methods. This input confirmed search terms, data abstraction forms, EHR vendor survey and interview questions, and input on recommendations contained in this report. This environmental scan addresses knowledge and evidence gaps pertaining to use of PGHD in ambulatory care settings through the following approaches: 1) an update to a scoping review by Tiase et al. 3 that examined the evidence of integrating PGHD into EHRs; 2) a review of reports produced by think tanks, government agencies, professional associations, and vendors; and 3) conversations and information collected from major ambulatory EHR vendors in the United States. 9 Chapter 2. Methods and Approach Scoping Review Literature Search. The scoping review expanded one conducted by Tiase et al. by updating the search dates and keywords.2,3 Databases searched from August 2019 to October 2020 (Ovid), Scopus (scopus.org), Embase (embase.com), CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost), Web Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCOhost), Dissertations IEEE Xplore (IEEE.org), and INSPEC (Elsevier.com). No filters, such as language or study type, were applied. The final search strategies are presented in Appendix A (Tiase orginial search2) and Appendix B (updated search). To search unpublished studies and grey literature, we used the Google search engine, limited to the firs t 50 results, using terms including patient -generated health data, user - generated health data, mobile health, self -tracking, integration, and electronic medical record. Two reviewers (GP, SB) searched Google simultaneously at different locations to account for differences in results. Stud y Selection. Search results were imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, n.d.) systematic -review software for screening. Researchers (MB, GP, JW , VT) conducted title, abstract, and full -text screening. Each researcher tested the screening criteria on a sample of titles and abstracts to ensure that the criteria were robust enough to capture eligible articles. If an article abstract was not accompan ied by the full text of the article, we contacted the authors by email. If there was no response, we excluded the abstract. In the second level of screening, the researchers independently assessed the full text to determine eligibility. We held regularmeetings to achieve consensus and conflicts were resolved with input from two other researchers (RS, RD). We recorded the reason for full -text exclusion in Covidence. Data Abstraction and Analysis. Using the themes and details from the Tiase r eview,2,3 we created a form in Qualtrics for the data abstraction of articles included from the full -text review. One researcher (MB, GP, or JW) completed the first abstraction, and the results were over -read by a second researcher (VT). Any conflicts were resolved with input from two other researchers (RS, RD). The articles were categorized in the same themes, and we used frequency analyses to describe the data. EHR Vendor Survey and Interview Survey and Interview Guide Development and Approach. We contacted ambulatory EHR vendors (N=9) that serve 95% of the U.S. market to collect information on how their clients are integrating PGHD into EHRs. We assessed what PGHD their clients are using or plan to integrate into their EHR, including PGHD type ( e.g., biometric, patient activity, questionnaires, health history), PGHD transfer (e.g., active, passive), and technical approaches (e.g., HL7, APIs, Bluetooth). We asked about interoperability standards (e.g., SMART, FHIR, HL7v2, web services, extensible markup language [XML], and consolidated-clinical document architecture [C-CDA]); whether design schemas such as Open mHealth and standardized medical coding terms are leveraged (e. g., SNOMED, LOINC, RxNORM); and what developer platforms (e.g., Apple Health Kit, Google Fit) and which tools, products, and 3rd-party companies (e.g., Fitbit, Garmin) integrate data into their EHRs. To collect this information, we invited vendor representatives (from November 2020 to February 2021) to complete an online survey, and then participate in a followup interview. Vendor representatives were familiar with the processes involved and the state of PGHD integration into their company's EHR. The survey and interview guide were developed by our team with feedback and expert opinion from the TEP. Through iteration we refined the question 10 set with approval from AHRQ (See Appendices C and D). We contacted vendors at least twice in attempt to have them complete an online survey in Qualtrics. Data were analyzed using descriptive stati stics. Fol lowing completion of the survey, we invited vendors to a 45-minute video interview. Vendors were asked 10 questions exploring factors contributing to the successes and challenges of integrating PGHD into EHRs. Interviewers took notes during the i nterview and asked permission to record interviews. Data regarding the successes, challenges, and resources of PGHD were analyzed using content analysis to identify recurring themes in the interviews. 16 We described other feedback from vendors as a summary narrative. Reports, Guides, and Policy Review of Reports and Guides. We searched reports produced by think tanks, professional organizations, government agency (e.g., AHRQ, ASPE, ONC, FDA, FTC), EHR vendors, and healthcare facilities. We used Google as t he search tool using terms, \"patient generated health data, PGHD, digital health, electronic health record, white paper, report, guide.\" Relevant reports and guides were cataloged. These documents were reviewed and key findings were described. Polic y, Reg ulation, and Reimbursement. Similarly, we searched reports by think tanks, professional organizations, and government agencies (e.g., Congressional Research Service; HHS, including MLN Matters; the federal register; AHRQ, ASPE, ONC, FDA, FTC). Google was t he primary search tool using terms that included, \"security, privacy, law, rule, patient generated health data, PGHD, digital health, electronic health record, white paper, report, guide.\" Key findings were described. Technical Expert Panel (TEP) Expert I nput. The TEP provided real -world experience with PGHD by offering guidance on inclusion criteria, identifying articles of materials that may have been missed, and helping us refine data abstraction elements. The TEP provided feedback on survey and intervi ew questions posed to EHR vendors. The TEP's diverse background provides the perspectives of patients, clinicians, researchers, and health IT experts who are experienced at integrating PGHD into the EHR. After TEP revision and approval of the inclusion cri teria and data abstraction elements, we screened relevant articles and other grey literature. The TEP provided feedback to the environmental scan and assisted with curated recommendations and information learned so that it could be used in the development of the practical guide. 11 Chapter 3. Results Scoping Review Search Results. The search identified 3,086 citations, of which 1,353 were duplicates , thus leaving 1,733 new citations for title and abstract screening since the Tiase review. Figure 1 shows the combined number of studies from the previous and updated literature searches. Together, the search parameters identified 17,790 studies. Of these , 6,594 duplicates were removed, 10,871 were excluded after title and abstract screening, and 325 underwent full -text screening. In total, 36 articles were included in our review \u201416 from the original Tiase review and 20 from the updated search (Figure 1). All selected articles were published between 2013 and 2020. The majority were published in 2020 (n=15; 38.8%) and 2019 (n=10; 27.7%). Most of the articles were published in North America (n=28; 77.8%), followed by Europe (n=4; 11.1%), Asia (n=2; 5.6%), and Australia (n=2; 5.6%). The majority of studies were either in the non- academic ambulatory care setting (n=17; 47.2%) or academic ambulatory care setting (n=15; 41.6%); the remaining studies were in cancer centers (n=4; 11.1%) (see Figure 1). Figur e 1. Flow diagram for study selection proce ss Study designs varied with the largest design being observational (n=8; 22.2%), followed 19.4%). As shown below in Table 1, included studies report on the use of PGHD tools with patients living with diabetes (including type 1, type 2, and gestational, n=10; 27.7%), cancer 12 (n=8; r (n=12; 33.3%) conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease). PGH D Characteristics and Integration. Selected studies reported on integrated biometric data such as heart rate or blood glucose, patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures/surveys, or health history data. Half of the studies (n=18; 50.0%) reported on integrated biometric data alone, and the remaining studies were split between questionnaires (n=15; 41.6%), biometric data and questionnaires (n=2; 5.5%), and health history (n=1; 2.7%). We evaluated the specific devices and questionnaires used for data capture. Within the biometric data studies, multiple groups captured more than one biometric data element. Bi ometric data included blood pressure (n= 8; 22.2%), blood of skin (n=1; 2.8%). Devices used for capture of biometric data were all commercially available and included the Fitbit, Apple watch, Accu -check Aviva Connect, DexcomG4 ITBP, and the A&D UC -352BLE digital weight scale. Within studies that reported utilizing questionnaires, data captured focused on disease severity or symptoms (n=14; 38.9%), quality of life or function (n=6; 16.7%), medication utilization (n=5; 13.9%), or emergency room visits (n=1; 2.8%). Fi nally, within studies utilizing PROs, only two studies (5.6%) utiliz ed adaptive PROs. The majority of selected studies reported on data integration in the Epic EHR system (n=23; 63.8%), 2.7%). Some reports did not report the linked EHR system (n=8; 22.2%). A large subset of studies did not provide information on the developer platform utilized for their PGHD (n=12; 33.3%). Some used commercially available platforms including (n=9; 25.0%), of included articles (n=25; 69.4%) did not report information on the approach to data transfer or integration. The remaining reported utilizing Bluetooth for data transfer (n=2, 5.5%), and HL7 (n=6; 16.7%) or APIs (n=3; 8.3%) for data integration into the EHR. In many instances (n=12; 33.3%), PGHD data were manually entered by the patient into the EHR's native patient portal, which reduced the complexity of PGHD -EHR integration. Thematic Analysis Consistent with the scoping review conducted by Tiase et al.,3 we categorized content integration into three primary categories: data capture, data transfer, and data review. Dat a Capture. We broadly evaluated studies for their reports in relation to data authentication, technical support, training resources, and device expenses. Data authentication was unclear or not reported in most of the studies (n=19; 55.6%). In the remainder, authentication was either conducted in the patient portal (n=14; 38.9%), via an API wrapper linked to the patient portal (n=1; 2.8%), by email (n=1; 2.8%), or via text messaging (n=1; 2.8%). To ensure purity of captured data and improve the patient experience, multiple studies (n=13; 36.1%) for patients. One study (2.8%) reported training patients but did not report the method used, and another study (n=1; 2.8%) utilized telehealth training for patients. Fi nally, while many studies utilized project -specific staff to train patients on device usage, two studies (5.6%) required that clinicians conduct the patient training at the clinic encounter. 13 Technical support resources were offered to patients by some studies (n=6; 16.7%). Patient responsibility for the device expense was not reported in many instances (n=16; 44.4%). Of those who did report device expense (n=20; 55.6%), the majority of them (n=18; 50%) reported making devices freely available to patient s, and two studies stated that the patient device expense was less than $50 (n=1; 2.8) or between $50-$250 (n=1; 2.8%). Dat a Transfer. To examine data transfer, we specifically addressed four elements: EHR delivery, data collection and transfer frequency, connectivity, and development time. Regarding delivery, studies were evaluated for whether data transfer was passive (n=14; 38.9%), active (n=13; 36.1%), or both (n=5; 13.9%). Early studies reported that mode of data transfer did extend to not just the patient but, in some instances, provider involvement in ensuring appropriate data transfer (n=6; 16.7%). One group reported that providers were required to file data to the appropriate patient record. 17 Provider arbitration of data transfer was not required in more recent studies. Frequency of data collection and transfer varied by study and the type of PGHD collected. Data collection varied across groups. For those utilizing biometric data, collection ranged from every 1-10 seconds for heart rate measures to three times a week for a group collecting blood glucose and activity. For those utilizing PROs or patient histories, some studies only required data input prior to clinical appointments (n=3; 8.3%), via the provider's formal order for col lection (n=1; 2.8%), or allowed for patient autonomy over frequency of data collection (n= 2; 5.6%). The remaining studies had set time frames ranging from daily to monthly (n=9; 25.0%). In some studies, once the PGHD was collected, it was then transferred to the EHR in real time (n=12; 36.1%). One study required that patients review and approve their collected health data prior to upload into the EHR. Conne ctivity was an issue reported in some studies (n=6; 16.7%), which were secondary to software updates , operating system compatibility, and/or internet browser compatibility. In some studies, device compatibility problems were reported. One study reported having challenges related to a device recall. 18 Few studies reported on the development time of their product (n=9; 25.0%), which ranged from less than 1 year (n=7; 19.4%) or over 1 year (n=2; 5.6%]. One study reported developing infrastructure within 2 days,19 which occurred during the global COVID -19 pandemic and was facilitated by significant organizati onal buy-in, stakeholder motivation, and financial/human resource availability. Da ta Review. We evaluated articles for information on provider training and technical support, provider notifications, and data display options. Few studies (n=4; 11.1%) repor ted providing clinician training. Of these, three (8.3%) conducted in-person training with providers, and one (2.8%) utilized manualized training. A minority reported having technical support available for providers (n=4; 11.1%). St udies did utilize alert systems to produce a notification when captured data exceeded certain thresholds. The approach to notifications included: 1) utilizing a triaging coordinator or dedicated staff (n=3; 8.3%) who alerted providers after data review and contact with patients when appropriate; and 2) directly notifying providers in the EHR (n=9; 25.0%), either via EHR in-basket activity (n=3; 8.3%), or by email (n=2; 5.6%). Where alert thresholds were set, four studies (11.1%) reported that alert thresholds were set by providers. Three studies reported that notifications were not used (8.3%). There was limited information on how the PGHD were displayed within the EHR. Data were displayed either in dashboards (8; 22.2%), directly in the 5.4%), in synopsis web app 2.7%). Pra gmatics of PGHD. Many studies (n=15; 41.7%) reported outcome measures for patients and providers regarding PGHD utilization. In studies where patients were required to manually 14 input data into the EHR, completion rates ranged from 10% to 100%. The completion rate varied by data upload frequency. One study reported that surveys requiring more frequent (weekly) uploads had higher completion rates (61%) compared to thos e requiring less frequent (monthly) uploads (54%). 20 Although patient survey completions varied, patient satisfaction was generally high. Six studies reported satisfaction metrics and perception of ease of use ranging from 72% to 94%; patients reported tha t PRO use increased reassurance around care, and in one study 70% of patients reported that using the system aided their self-management. 21 Table 1.

Eight studies (22.2%) provided content on provider PRO usage. The lowest provider usage of PRO review tools was reported to be 6.4%.22 Interesti ngly, even in instances where alerts were generated, provider usage was occasionally low with one study reporting alert reviews were conducted by 44% of clinicians.23 However, one study utilizing patient -generated weight data to evaluate ascites volume in cirrhotic patients found that clinician alert response rates from clinicians were as high as 84%.24 Finally, of those studies that reported on health-specific outcomes (n=7; 19.4%), five studies (13.9%) found improvement while two found the use of PGHD to have no impact on outcomes. One of these studies had used PGHD to improve patient utilization of aromatase inhibitors.25 Exemplars from the L iterature We identified resources from the literature that may serve as exemplars in the integration of PGHD into ambulatory care settings. We present on a number of frameworks, case studies, and more. P erspectives, frameworks, barriers, and facilitators. Lavallee et al.26 report stakeholder perspectives on a broad range of PGHD types (including biometric and PRO data) and describe six themes and a number of values and barriers. These themes include: 1) PGHD tracking supports many healthcare goals and behaviors, 2) people ar e intentional about timing and types of data they share with their providers, 3) the value of PGHD increases with alignment to measurement -based care, 4) data provide a common framework that facilitates patient engagement, 5) the promise of PGHD is tempere d by lack of standards, and 6) unintended consequences of PGHD need further exploration. They describe value as providing access to care, accountability, awareness of health, goal tracking, improved communication, improved recall, increased motivation, pat ient engagement, and quantifying health. However, barriers include deficiencies in accessibility, accountability, actionality, buy -in, data integration, evidence for use, incentive for use, and standards, as well as burden of tracking, feasibility, limited resources, suitability of use, and unknown accuracy of data. 26 Abdolkhani et al.27 described data management and quality challenges with using PGHD for remote monitoring. Challenges included digital health literacy, wearable accuracy, data interpretation, and lack of PGHD integration with the EHR. They stressed the importance of developing quality guidelines with all relevant stakeholders that must include patients. 27 Other important articles include a review on converging and diverging needs between patie nts and providers who are collecting and using PGHD.13 Austin et al.28 evaluated stakeholder experiences of PGHD integration into clinical care at the University of Washington Medicine System. The group found that stakeholders utilized PGHD to improve symptom monitoring, personalize 17 interventions, monitor care plans, assess clinical outcomes, promote self -management and behavior change support, prevent illness, and improve care delivery and quality assurance. The study team reported that 71 different PGHD t ypes were being used at their institution, including physical activity, mood, and sleep data. Over half of the PGHD reported were used to track daily activities or symptoms. They further described a number of barriers to institution-w ide scaling, with the two most significant being PGHD integration into clinical records and organizational infrastructure or policies to support PGHD. 28 Similar ly, Adler -Milstein and Nong29 interviewed leaders from health systems, EHR and PGHD solutions, and patients. They ide ntified three approaches to the use of PGHD, including health history, validated questionnaires and surveys, and biometric and health activity. They noted patient concerns about data security and value of reporting PGHD. Health systems reported reimburseme nt, data quality, and clinical usefulness challenges. Uncertainty around value for stakeholders, patients, and providers was the primary inhibitor.29 A meta -synthesis of five studies from Project HealthDesign that developed, tested, and implemented technol ogies for collecting observations of daily living is reported by Cohen et al.30 They describe a model with six factors that motivate patients to collect these data. These factors include: 1) usability, 2) illness experience, 3) relevance of observations of daily living, 4) information technology infrastructure, 5) degree of burden, and 6) emotional activation. These factors may act as facilitators and barriers that influence data collection, health -related awareness, and behavior change. 30 Their team also r eported on barriers and facilitators to the use of PGHD among five additional studies from Project HealthDesign Round 2.31 Healthcare professionals interviewed identified three benefits and three barriers. The benefits reported were that PGHD provides deeper insight into a patient's condition, more accurate patient information of clinical relevance, and insight into a patient's health between clinic visits. Barriers to use of PGHD in clinics include: developing practice workflows and protocols; data storage , accessibility at the point of care, and privacy concerns; and ease of using PGHD. 31 C ase studies. Bachmann et al.32 present an implementation strategy for systematic measurement of PGHD. They describe a three-phase approach that begins with an exploration phase focused on engaging leadership and conducting an inventory of current efforts to collect PGHD. The second phase is preparatory, with steps including pilot implementation site selection, and development of needs assessment and timeline. The third phase adapts technology platforms and the EHR to implement PGHD into clinical sites. They note the complexity involved necessitates change management at the enterprise level. 32 An example of implementing PROs in oncology rehabilitation by Winter et al.33 describes a similar yet four -step process that entails a fourth maintenance and evolution phase and emphasizes the importance of technical support and training across phases. Stover et al. 34 described the importance of stakeholder engagement to overcome barri ers to implementing PROs in oncology care delivery. Clinician and patient input were critical to identifying symptoms and PRO measures for implementation success. A case study by Shaw et al.35 describes a method guided by a telehealth model to evaluate the selection of mobile health technologies for EHR integration. Their case study stresses the importance of a multidisciplinary assessment, including elements of health equity and socioeconomics. Pevnick et al. 36 describe a quality improvement project where patients allowed PGHD from wearable heart monitors to be uploaded into the EHR. They describe a framework to address these PGHD, including data visualization and protocols identifying concerning heart rates to trigger a cardiologist review. A recent AHRQ -funded study assessed the feasibility of using commercial health technologies to collect and report PGHD and PROs from diverse, disadvantaged patients in an urban safety net healthcare system. They found patients preferred 18 providers to recommend technology to rather than self -selection. Providers preferred to receive a summary of PGHD and PRO data closer to clinic visits versus a stream of data over time.37 FHIR. There were no studies from the scoping review that met our strict inclusion criteria that discus sed the use of FHIR to support the integration of PGHD. Amongst our excluded studies, two studies provide examples from inpatient settings that could be transferred to remote monitoring outpatient and home settings. Ploner and P rokosch38 present a systems architecture and FHIR -based data model that includes security measures and application flow from patients' smartphones and a public cloud infrastructure at the University Hospital of Elrangen, Germany. A relevant approach by a team in South Korea describes a FHIR -based mobile alert system using 12-lead electrocardiograms. 39 Quality metrics and cost-effectiveness. PROs may be useful for reporting quality metrics. One study demonstrates using electronic PROs as an effective way to screen for pain and depressi on, for symptom monitoring and physician-patient communication, and for providing an audit trail for Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) metric reporting .40 Guides, Reports, and Resources on the Integration of PGHD into EHRs Table 4 pre sents 14 documents that include a variety of white papers, guides, and resources from the FDA, AHRQ, ONC, American Medical Association (AMA), American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and the Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), amo ng others. Topics covered include a variety of aspects important to the selection, integration, and use of PGHD for clinical care in ambulatory care settings. These include: 1) the use of PGHD in telehealth care delivery models; 2) strategic planning on cr eating a team, targeting patient populations, and creating value from PGHD; 3) selecting, integrating, and visualizing data; 4) frameworks for understanding standards and criteria for interoperability; 5) design principles for diverse patient populations; 6) guidance on which PGHD and associated devices fall under FDA oversight; and 7) social, ethical, and legal considerations.19 Table 4.

Vendors interviewed serve approximately 80% of the US ambulatory care market.55 EHR vendors described factors that contribute to integration of P GHD into EHRs. Table 5 shows results from the survey. Table 6 describes themes that arose around success, challenges, and resources needed. E HR vendor survey. Of the six vendors who responded, nearly all ( n=5, 83%) stated they allow for PGHD to be integrated (ingested). The timeline since integration began ranges between 2-10+ years. The five that allow for PGHD to be ingested are further described. All (n=5, 100%) provide pre -built and custom -built functionality to process and manage PGHD, and PGHD is part of the original contract for some (n=3, 60%) and an add-on for others (n=2, 40%). Nearly 80%) allow for a own device' (BYOD) model, and most (n=3, 60%) allow for PGHD to be received out of the patient portal. S ome have functionality to notify providers and patients (n=3, 60%) if PGHD need action or are out of range. Vendors provided further details as comments to these questions. It is an implementation decision to select what type of notifications the client (clinic) may want based on the PGHD. PGHD may appear in a dashboard for clinicians to review to identify patients with high risk in need for outreach. Triggers can automatically send messages to providers or page a nurse pool based on incoming data. Notifications can also be developed that remind patients to complete PROs, submit data, or perform action based on data received. A ll (n=5, 100%) stated their EHR has the capability to send patient data from the EHR to mobile health apps. All use iOS HealthKit (n=5, 100%), some use Android's Google Fit (n=2, partner platforms (n=2, 40%) to integrate PGHD. HealthKit is easier for vendors to leverage due to the maturity of the Health App which provides data and security standardization. Three vendors (60%) responded their t ool provided these data from mobile health apps in graphical format for clinicians within the EHR. The variety of data that could be ingested varied by the aggregator source. iOS HealthKit allows for a variety of data to be tethered to the Apple Health App. Thus, any data integrated with HealthKit could be pulled in. Similarly, partnering with a data aggregator company like Validic or Raziel Health allows for additional types of data to be pulled into an EHR. Other partner vendors reported included Livongo, TytoCare, Withings. While it may be technically possible to pull in dozens if not hundreds of data types from remote health monitors and PRO surveys, the need or value to do so must be ti ed to a care delivery model. W ith regard to the transfer of data, all (n=5, 100%) allow for passive transfer while most (n=4, 80%) allow for push, active, and pull. The technical approach by vendors varies with FHIR (n=4, 80%) standard APIs (n=3, 60%), and web services (n=3, 60%). The use of standardized medical coding terminologies (e.g., SNOMED, LOINC) varied across vendors. Leveraging FHIR was recommended and encouraged to create data standards across the industry to facilitate integrating mobile health app data into EHRs. None of the vendors use design schemas such as Open mHealth or IEEE P1752 standards process. O nly one vendor (20%) stated they were able to consume or translate incoming PGHD into another language, which was Spanish. Though it was state d that clients that work with this vendor have the ability to translate data into other languages, it was unclear if anyone has done this yet. Three (60%) provide PGHD resources through their patient portal. These resources may include instructions for connecting devices, collecting and uploading data, and what to do if results are out of normal range. Some vendor systems allow patients to connect to supported 22devices without practice assistance or tech support (n=3, 60%), and some require a clinic to activate prescribed devices (n=3, 60%).

Table 6 describes themes and descriptions from EHR vendors on the successes, challenges, and resources needed to make the integration of PGHD actionable. Organizational support and readiness to use PGHD in a meaningful way are needed for success. A variety of factors influence the success of PGHD to improve health outcomes and create value. This includes clinical champions, a patient -focused approach, and data and device governance in which PGHD are part of a targeted care delivery model. Other factors incl ude interoperability and economic viability. Challenges arise when a well-resourced plan with all stakeholders is not the approach. Resources such as educational support for clinicians and patients, and technica l support for patients are key. Tab le 6. EHR vendor inter view themes PGHD Successes and Challenges The me Description Successes: Factors that contribute to the success of making integration of PGHD actionable Organizational support and readiness Organizations need to invest and prepare for the use of PGHD. This requires consistent organization- wide processes on how to leverage PGHD, marketing representation to create value for patients, and buy -in across the enterprise. Clinical champions Physicians, nurses, case managers, social workers, and other roles need to advocate and champion the use of PGHD for patient care. Champions must be maintained over time, or interest may fade. Robust care delivery model PGHD need to be tied to clinical f ocus (e.g., congestive heart failure [CHF], hypertension). This allows for data and devices to be selected that are appropriate for specific clinical outcomes and targeted to the care delivery model allow ing patient self - management and clinical decision- making. This permits data governance and protocol development to understand how to act upon the data by patients and providers. Processes need to create value and not increase burden on the care team. 24 PGHD Successes and Challenges The me Description Data governance PGHD need to be valid, accurate, and well managed with rules to make them useful, timely, interpretable, and effective. Collection and interpretation must be tailored to the clinical focus and population. Protocols and triggers need to be incorporated into the EHR to encourage patient self - management and clinician decision making. Data analytics are needed to discern signal from noise. Decisions need to be made as to how data will be analyzed over time and in a tailored time window. Data density, when data are missing or too frequent, requires protocols for how to deal with changes in data frequency over time. Data need to be aggregated across sources and visualized in a dashboard with clinical decision support tools. Device governance Devices could be a B YOD model, managed by clinics or by a vendor. Devices could be delivered as a kit that collects data specific to the clinical focus. Multiple devices may be needed but can contribute to complexity. The approach may be influenced by the type of EHR vendor the clinic or health system contracts with. Interoperability Data need to be exchanged seamlessly across geographic boundaries between disparate organizations, systems, and sources. Consistent standards are critical and may include HL7 and FHIR. Patient -focused approach Data and devices need to be useable and appropriate for the target population. The demographics of the patient population need to be considered (e.g., use of iOS or Android, technical literacy, broadband access, physical dexterity) . Technical support A fundamental requirement is to provide support for patients across the lifespan in diverse environments. Support ought to be provided by a technical person from the clinic or organization, the device manufacturer, or outsourced. Clinical staff, such as RNs, are not the best fit for this role. Economic viability The use of PGHD needs to be incorporated into the business model of the organization to demonstrate revenue generation or cost savings. Challenges: Factors that contribute to challenges of making integration of PGHD actionable Lack of regulations and industry standards Data need to be standardized across the industry. There are disparities in EHRs, devices, and applications. Not all EHR vendors use consistent standards, such as FHIR. Standards for some EHR vendor platforms are not as mature as others. Poor data governance Protocols are needed to create value from PGHD. Analysis of disparate data sources and determining how and when to act upon data are critical. Organizations may struggle with the legality of PGHD. 25 PGHD Successes and Challenges The me Description Patient technology hurdles Technical and data literacy must be considered for the target population. Access to broadband internet, particularly in rural locations, may be a hurdle. Patients need to be proficient with how to use devices, particularly multiple devices, which can be amplified for patients who have multiple chronic illnesses and who are often older. Manual data entry and lack of analytics Automated data entry is needed when possible. Resources should be dedicated so that data are programmed to be automatically ingested by software to create meaning and value for patients and clinicians. No care delivery model PGHD cannot live in a vacuum. Responsibility for the data is needed and it needs to be tied to health outcomes to select the most appropriate data type and device in order to create value. There remains a lack of national standards around care models for PGHD. Resources needed to support PGHD Clinical application and data processes Organizational investment is needed to develop use cases for PGHD in a variety of care models. Data procedures include governance, protocols, and processes that guide the use of PGHD for clinical decision making and patient self - monitoring that meet patient outcome, regulatory, and legality needs. Clinical work flow capacity Clinicians need dedicated time to incorporate PGHD into their clinical w orkflow . Educational support for patients and providers Education and training need to be provided to all end users to understand the benefits and limitations to PGHD. Technical support Technical support to patients across the lifespan in diverse environments provided by a technical person. Vendors described that most clients collect PGHD through s urveys that are offered through their patient portal. This may include information being collected before or between clinic visits. COVID-19 has increased use of surveys to collect information on symptoms, exposure, and testing. Less common is the use of remote monitoring devices. T he use of remote monitoring devices is offered in a variety of ways, depending on the relationship between ambulatory care clinics and the EHR vendor. The vendor may offer devices in a 'kit model,' where the patient receives a suite of devices tethered toward a clinical target area. For example, patients with hypertension may receive a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure monitor and in-home wireless scale. Similar kits for COVID -19 symptoms are on the rise for temperature, blood pres sure, and pulse oximetry remote monitoring. The rise of the Hospital at Home model is a similar and quickly growing care delivery model that is accelerating the use of PGHD integration. Third-party vendors may offer device kits and provide tech support. These are negotiations between the clinic or health system, EHR vendor, and device vendor. 26 Decisions to implement are driven by the clinical side, while the EHR and device vendor provide development support. Development, implementation, and testing usually takes 6-12 months, though prioritized topics can have accelerated timelines. Development and development costs are unique t o the EHR vendor and their relationship with the clinics. This influences the way in which PGHD is financed, which could be by per -patient transaction. EH R vendors stated their systems undergo full security assessments. Data are more protected once they come into the EHR ecosystem, which could be through a patient portal or via API from a device company. Security with devices and their associated apps needs to be worked out with the respective device companies. Risk is held on the patient's side before data cross into the EHR, and data may not fall under privacy and security regulations. Patients should be encouraged to use standard security approaches, such as user authentication, and to limit health information exchange with third-party apps. Limited regul ations around PGHD and consumer - based devices makes this an ongoing challenge. Policy, Regulation, and Reimbursement Even though Americans are now transmitting their personal data via the internet at an exponentially higher rate than in the past, the legis lative patchwork at the Federal level governing data privacy is complex and incomplete. While some Federal laws and regulations address aspects of data privacy and reimbursement related to the use of PGHD, significant gaps remain. Policymakers may want to consider supportive policies pertaining to cybersecurity in the transfer of data from devices into EHRs, and a comprehensive payment policy that incentivizes clinicians to use PGHD to facilitate actionable clinical decision -making. An effective payment policy will need to help ambulatory care settings overcome the technical and workflow challenges associated with integration of PGHD into their EHRs as well as optimize best practices in patient engagement and chronic care management. D ata Privacy and Securit y. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) includes the most relevant provisions for healthcare providers governed by HIPAA. Under HIPAA, healthcare providers must treat protected health information (PHI) according to rules set forth in several HHS regulations known as the \"Privacy Rule,\" the \"Security Rule,\" and the \"Breach Notification Rule.\" 56 The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes safeguards to protect PHI and patient rights to understand how their data may be used and shared. With respect to sharing, HIPAA's privacy rules generally prohibit covered entities from using or sharing PHI with third parties without patient consent, unless such information is being used or shared for treatment or payment, among other exceptions. 57 Additional Federal guidance is needed to determine whether these provisions would require ambulatory care settings to obtain a patient waiver before integrating PGHD into a patient's EHR. Distinct requirements concerning consent forms may also pertain to children who participate in an ambulatory care setting's PGHD program. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) may require providers to obtain parental or guardian permission to collect identifiable information from patients under the age 13.58 Data sharing with vendors. Ambulatory care settings may want to pay particular attention to data security when working with third-party vendors who capture and analyze a patient's data before providing patient summary reports to providers. The ONC reports that before reaching the EHR, PGHD \"may be at risk for security breaches because they are not subject to the same security regulatory framework as providers who are regulated by HIPAA. Concerns include insecure points of data collection and insecure data movement that potentially expose the device or the clinician's information system to pollutants, such as malware. There is growing potential for risks related to unauthorized access, including cyber threats.\" 59 The Security Rule requires 27 covered entities to maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent threats or hazards to the security of electronic PHI. The technical safeguards must include transmission security measures designed to \"guard against unauthorized access to electronic PHI that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.\" These measures must have \"integrity controls\" to ensure the electronically transmitted PHI is \"not improperly modified without detection until disposed of\" and mechanisms \"to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate.\" 60 Ambulatory care settings intending to support the movement of patient data into their EHRs should work with their information technology and security experts to ensure safe movement of these data. P GHD, like all PHI, is at risk for security breaches. These data can be at particular risk during transfer using devices connected to the internet.4 Ambulatory care settings should have robust practices in place that minimize risk of data security threats. For support in establishing robust organization-wide cybersecurity practices, the Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC), in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, produced \"Health Industry Cybersecurity Practi ces (HICP): Managing Threats and Protecting Patients.\" This practical guide includes volumes, resources, and toolkits to support small, medium, and large healthcare organizations establish robust cybersecurity practices. 61 Patients engaging in PGHD may have a limited or incorrect understanding of when data about their health is protected by law, and when it is not. For example, they may incorrectly think HIPAA provides standards for privacy and security in all contexts, where no such universal protections e xist. The more information collected and transferred, the greater the cybersecurity threat. Thus, individual users may make avoidable mistakes that could increase cybersecurity threats related to PGHD. When selecting vendors with whom to partner, ambulator y care settings should consider which can ensure the data security and privacy for their patients and their settings. P roposed CMS rule regarding the exchange of health data with patients and payers.62 CMS' proposed rule, December 10, 2020, strives to impr ove the electronic exchange of health data among payers, providers, and patients, and streamline processes related to prior authorization. In addition to proposing new requirements on payers regarding prior authorization and the exchange of health data, the proposed rule would impose new methods for enabling patients and providers to control sharing of health information, place new requirements on the exchange of behavioral health information, reduce the use of fax machines for healthcare data exchange, and accelerate the adoption of standards related to social risk data. Ambulatory care settings will want to look for the forthcoming Final Rule to ensure that their programs align with any new requirements. R eimbursement for PGHD. Public and private payers ar e increasingly using payment to support use of PGHD for remote patient monitoring. However, what is covered and for what amount varies significantly by payer and geography. M edicare, our Nation's Federal program covering healthcare services for individuals 65 and older and certain individuals with permanent disabilities, covers certain activities related to PGHD. As of 2018, Medicare -qualifying clinicians can seek reimbursement using CPT Code 99091 for time spent on collection and interpretation of health data generated by a patient remotely, digitally stored, and transmitted to the provider, at a minimum of 30 minutes of time in a 30-day period per patient. 63 Since 2015, qualifying clinicians can seek Medicare reimbursement for Chronic Care Management Servi ces conducted on behalf of certain Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and for transitional care programs.64 Incentive payments that can be applied to PGHD review are also available through Medicare's Physician Payment System64 28that rew ards clinicians who meet certain performance metrics under the Quality Payment Program (created by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 [MACRA]).65 Medicaid, a joint Federal -State program that finances the delivery of primary and acut e medical services and long -term services and supports to diverse low -income populations, provides coverage for remote patient monitoring in many States. According to the Center for Connected Health Policy (CCHP), the federally designated National Teleheal th Policy Resource Center under the Federal Telehealth Resource Center Program, 21 State Medicaid programs offer reimbursement for remote patient monitoring as of fall 2020.66 Because reimbursement policies vary significantly by State, ambulatory care sett ings eager to obtain Medicaid reimbursement should check with their State Medicaid representatives and review CCHP's State Telehealth Laws and Reimbursement Policies, which is updated periodically.66 Many private payer insurance plans also reimburse for PG HD used for remote patient monitoring services; however, Federal law does not require these payers to do so. As a result, significant variation in coverage rules are also found with these payers. Any reimbursement program established by an ambulatory care setting will need to navigate significant variation across these payers to compile its unique patchwork reimbursement program. New val ue-based payment models create incentives for use of PGHD. New reimbursement models, such as alternative payment models, are shifting from payment for individual services to payment for episodes of care, overall care, and patient outcomes. These new payment models can provide clinicians with great flexibility in care delivery, enabling them to establish remote patient monitoring initiatives to minimize the need for face -to-face encounters and emergency room visits. As participation among ambulatory care settings in value -based payment models grows, so too will opportunities for ambulatory care settings to engage in PGHD initiatives. Chapter 4. Summary of Results Scoping Review - the Evidence Consistent with previously reported findings by Tiase et al., there are limited studies on the integration of PGHD in ambulatory care practices. Nevertheless, the rate of expansion of thes e studies in recent years is promising [Table 1]. In one year, through October 2020, 14 additional studies that met similar inclusion criteria reported on the usage of PGHD that integrated into the EHR. Gi ven that few studies have been published on the topic of PGHD integration, much work remains to be done. First, only three studies focused on the integration process of PGHD in the EHR. This left us having to glean information from the remaining studies that were deemed relevant. Furthermore, few studies t ruly evaluated patient healthcare outcomes in a randomized controlled fashion. This, too, represents an important gap in the literature. While we may intuit the benefits of PGHD collection and integration in the EHR, much remains to be evaluated with respe ct to the costs/benefits of source of data collection, the influence of PGHD alert systems on provider adherence to guidelines, and the specific role that PGHD types have on patient outcomes. Our findings also demonstrated a balance of studies on the use of biometric data and survey questionnaires. Only one group reported on the use of free -text histories.67 Patients had a positive experience with this approach. Nevertheless, there was limited information on the providers' utilization of data collected from free-text reports. As the success of PGHD use is highly dependent on provider adoption, the data need to be formulated in a manner that maximizes the ease of use for providers. As such, while we believe free -text patient reports will invariably have a spa ce in PGHD, likely provider adoption will be higher for discrete data elements. 29Dis crete data elements are collected for biometric data and PRO measures. Of the 18 studies that reported capturing biometric data, we found that many involved patient self -documentation of biometric data. For instance, Moore et al. had patients manually input home -measured blood glucose, blood pressure, or pedometer recordings.68 Others collected the data passively from the patients' devices. These instances required the use o f third -party applications to collect device data (predominantly Apple HealthKit), which integrated data into the EHR. While there has been general sentiment on the benefits of passive data collection, it is unknown whether a patient's active input of PGHD could contribute to improving health outcomes. Such questions around the psychological implications of increased patient awareness of collected biometric data due to manual collection of the data still needs exploration. Passive data collection also raises the question of data collection and transfer frequency. There seemed to be stark variation in biometric data collection frequency from the order of seconds36 to daily or less f requent.24,69,70 There seems to be a need for evaluation of the clinically meaningful needs for data collection compared to potential operational and research interest in more data. Such a discussion needs to consider the ethics of appropriate patient consent for data collection and communication of the data use. As PGHD tools are developed and utilized in healthcare, the field needs to consider protections that ensure that collected PGHD are necessary for clinical care. Certainly, any alteration to data type and collection frequency for research purposes needs patient consent with a lternatives to participation offered. Fre quency of data transfer raises its own challenges. One study reported that high-volume data transfer resulted in patient portal app errors, solved by batched data upload.71 This raises security concerns around data storage on user device or third-party cloud platforms.The use of PROs was also high amongst our included studies. PROs are excellent sources for patient healthcare information. While studies evaluated different PROs, we were able to extract general PRO the mes. Studies focused on quality of life/function measures, symptom severity measures, and medication utilization. We did not directly assess findings on differential patient or provider usage in one study as compared to another, but such information needs to be assessed in future analysis. Understanding whether patients or providers underutilize particular data metrics, and why they underutilize such metrics, could help support the selection and adaptation of the most appropriate PRO measures. Selection con siderations may include PRO length or completion time. From a user -centered design, survey lengths have previously been noted to significantly impact survey completion rates. 72 One proposed method to improving survey completion time is the utilizat ion of c omputerized adaptive testing (CAT). However, only two studies, stemming from the same institution, reported utilizing CAT.73,74 We suspect that CAT utilization remains low because of the lack of validated CAT PROs. This means that groups such as the aforem entioned would need to also face the challenge of developing and validating their own CATs. 73,74 While we did not directly assess whether the PROs utilized were validated, we believe it is vital to use validated instruments to avoid group data underreprese nting, overrepresenting, or not reporting the communicated outcome. Further, use of unvalidated tools can reduce clinician buy-in for the use of PGHD in the augmentation of clinical care. Best Practices There were several themes that appeared to contribute to group success within our review. Amongst these, early stakeholder involvement contributes to project success and clinician adoption. Some clinicians reported skepticism and concern around the use of PGHD, with many focusing on the impact of PGHD integration on increasing workload. Early inclusion of clinician 30 stakeholders, however, mediates these concerns by ensuring system selection of relevant PGHD tools that improves care outcomes and efficiency. Furthermore, early inclusion of clinician stakeholders increases data usage. In part, this means the assignment of a clinician champion who serves to interface between the project build team and clinicians. Stakeholder involvement should extend to the care team, management, quality impr ovement specialists, and patients. Di rect integration of PGHD in the patient portal is a common approach used by many of the evaluated studies. Collection of PGHD through the patient portal limits multiple elements of data collection complexity, including user authentication of input data, given that only patients input their data directly into the patient portal. Furthermore, this limits the build complexity by not requiring interoperability between an external app and the EHR. Nevertheless, at present thi s approach only works for manual input of user data. In the case of passively collected biometric data, the data must still be collected on a third - party platform and secondarily integrated in the EHR. While users seemed to prefer inputting data on their phone apps, some reported preference for web apps on their computer, and others preferred pen and paper. Offering each of these as an option for data collection (particularly for PROs) takes into account not only user preference, but also user technology a ccess and digital health literacy. Op erationalizing the use of PGHD also seemed an important practice across many of the included studies. That meant the study teams needed to develop workflows for practical interventions based on the collected data. It also meant they needed project -specif ic coordinators. These coordinators functioned to evaluate PGHD input by patients, review by providers and, in some instances, arbitrators of PGHD - related alerts. Based on our review, this support role seemed important to limiting the potential increased burden of PGHD use on providers. As PGHD is incorporated in the EHR in increasing quantities, however, clarity will need to be developed about the training for such a support role and the extent to which these coordinator roles could span across different PGHD types. Fi nally, a best practice noted by our group was the review of project success and active alteration of design to meet rising challenges. Reminiscent of the Plan-Do -Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, many groups utilized this cyclic approach due to inevita ble challenges that arose during project development. For instance, Marquard et al. specifically reported that in anticipation of patient -facing technical challenges, they designed a preliminary study of 26 patients, analyzing and logging technical issues that arose, adapting their project to the noted challenges. 75 We believe that in order for integrated PGHD projects to succeed, a similar approach that evaluates project challenges and adapts to them is necessary. This requires that stakeholders develop assessments of the elements deemed necessary for project success. That includes evaluation of 1) user experience including the patient, provider, coordinator, and other stakeholders; 2) hardware function; 3) software security; 4) data integrity; and 5) evolving regulatory policies influencing the project. Concerning Gaps The majority of included studies are based out of academic medical centers and utilize the Epic EHR. Both are not representative of the standard ambulatory practice. Equipoise assessments of the integration of PGHD in group and individual private practices (which make up the majority of primary care practices in the U SA76) need to be conducted. EHR Vendor Survey and Interviews Feedback from the EHR vendors highlighted the evolution that PGHD is undergoing as tools for patient care delivery. Over the past decade, PGHD use has steadily increased as access to the internet and smartphones have proliferated. Pathways for data from devices or surveys to be 31 brought securely into the EHR are increasing. Geographic barriers are falling and allowing for PGHD to be transmitted in near real - time from environments that patients spend more of their lifetime in. There are a variety of models that can be adopted in the integration of PGHD. Ambulatory care clin ics are able to partner with EHR vendors, and other partner vendors such as data aggregators (e.g., Validic, Raziel Health) or device companies (e.g., Omron, Qardio, Withings) to build frameworks and support for PGHD to be used for a variety of clinical needs. Vendor s reported using iOS to pull in a variety of PGHD to their EHRs and largely support the Apple ecosystem. Android is not as well supported, though. This is a concern, given that approximately 38% of the U.S. market is Android. 77 Few vendors allow for multi -language support, with only one reporting to allow for data to be ingested in Spanish. These factors have the potential to contribute to disparities in healthcare access among under -served populations. Ther e are disparities in EHRs, devices, and applications. Vendors discussed the lack of regulations and enforced standards around PGHD. While standards such as FHIR are encouraged, they are not used exclusively. Fortunately, new interoperability rules from ONC will boost the exchange of data through APIs and FHIR standards. Tabl e 6 describes a variety of factors that contribute to the successes and challenges of integrating PGHD. Vendors stressed the importance of organizations investing in robust care models, secure and interoperable technology, da ta and device governance, and providing resources, technical support, and planning to bring value to the use of PGHD. Reports, Guides, and Policies A variety of implementation guides and resources are available on websites from government agencies, profess ional organizations, and nonprofits. Table 4 presents documents that cover a variety of aspects important to the selection, integration, and use of PGHD for clinical care in ambulatory care settings. Ma ny decisions and aspects are important to the use of PGHD that range from clinical to technical and legal. The policy landscape surrounding PGHD evolves quickly, and it is important for ambulatory care clinics to be familiar with topics ranging from reimbursement to FDA clearance for devices. Recommendations We present a thematic summary of recommendations (Table 7) from the scoping review (Tables 1, 2 and 3), reports (Table 4), policies, and data collected from the EHR vendors (Tables 5 and 6). Recommendations from this environmental scan were reviewed by the TEP and will inform the development of a practical guide for ambulatory care providers as they approach the integration of PGHD.

Discussion The Rise of Health at Home The U.S. healthcare system is in a transitional period. Data traditionally collected in a clinic or hospital setting are now able to be collected in everyday environments of patients. Current primary care models often revolve around series of episodes rather than functioning as a continuum.78 The ability to transition from collecting discrete episodes of data in a clinic setting where patients spend little \"life\" time, to a model to where patients collect data throughout the day where they \"live,\" provides opportunities to deliver more personalized care. Capturing these data facilitates patients and clinicians to better understand and predict illness dynamics and to develop approaches to improve health outcomes and deliver personalized care when it is m ost needed: 78 at home. Our formal scoping review provides evidence and examples from peer -reviewed literature on the integration of PGHD into EHRs across a variety of care delivery models in ambulatory care settings. This growing published evidence is refl ected in the feedback from EHR vendors. Vendors described a developing healthcare landscape in which they partner with healthcare 34 institutions to leverage PGHD to improve health outcomes and improve care coordination. To create value from PGHD, however, requires investment, commitment, and an understanding of many variables that influence the success and challenges of PGHD to improve patient outcomes, care coordination, quality, and cost -effectiveness. C OVID -19 and the Rise of Telehealth The COVID -19 pandemic accelerated the use of digital health. As social distancing measures were enforced, care providers were motivated to collect data from patients remotely. While initially focused on telehealth models of care using video visits, as the pandemic unfolded, other models of care that integrate PGHD grew. As the investment in technology infrastructure, easing of regulatory hurdles, and opportunities for reimbursement occurred, avenues to leverage PGHD as part of formal care delivery models ar e on the rise. Hospital -at-home programs are one example of a growing market where patients collect data in their home, and a team of clinicians monitor data and provide care as appropriate at a distance or in the home, if needed. While these programs bega n prior to the pandemic, pressure to collect data at a distance fueled the need for new and safe approaches to care delivery. While promising, adoption of health IT systems has its problems, including clinician and patient burden due to design and implementation issues that have resulted in poor usability and workflow integration challenges.1 The ONC Cures Act Final Rule has provided much-needed regulation, structure, and incentives to help alleviate challenges and support seamless and secure access, exchan ge, and use of electronic health information. 79 As COVID-19 tested health-system capacity, virtual care and remote monitoring grew in the spotlight to deliver care amid social distancing efforts to prevent virus spread.80 Regulatory and reimbursement barri ers fell, and investment grew for telehealth facilitating remote care delivery. The FCC COVID -19 Telehealth Program, for example, provided $200 million in funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to expand video-visit capacity. 81 This first round of the program supported the use of telehealth to 540 healthcare programs across the United States. The FCC's Connected Care Pilot Program provides up to $100 million to improve broadband connectivity in underserved parts of the country where access to care is limited or hindered. 82 While telehealth programs expanded, EHR vendors described how COVID -19 slowed implementation of projects nationally for PGHD in the beginning of the pandemic. At the same time, the rapid shift to remote care delivery promoted pockets of innovation in the use of PGHD for monitoring COVID -19- positive patients. One such example was a partnership between Cleveland Clinic and Epic. As reported by news media, they developed a 14-day interactive care plan through the patient portal where patients can enter symptoms, temperature, and oxygen at home, while clinicians monitor them from afar. 83 As we enter the next phases of the pandemic with vaccine distribution, the implementation of PGHD in ambulatory care settings is gaining speed. Healthcare systems are implementing new models of care delivery, such as hospital -at-home programs, as reimbursement for remote care delivery becomes more certain. The University of Michigan deployed a patient -monitoring at - home kit for patients positive for COVID - 19.84 The kit includes a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff, thermometer, and pulse oximeter tethered to a tablet that sends vitals and symptoms data two to four times per day to RNs and MDs for monitoring. If data a re abnormal, an RN is alerted, in which case they conduct a video visit and escalate if appropriate to an NP, PA, or MD. With a focus on CHF, cirrhosis, and other comorbid conditions, preliminary findings demonstrate a decrease in readmission rates and ED utilizat ion pre - versus post - utilizat ion. 35 PGHD and Ambulatory Care A growing number of telehealth vendors provide technology-enabled services that integrate PGHD.85 Banner Health, for example, partners with Cerner and Xealth to simplify how clinicians prescribe digital health for telehealth and remote patient monitoring. Clinicians are able to prescribe digital therapeutics, smartphone, and internet apps as tools that connect with the EHR for chronic disease management, behavioral health, maternity care, and surgery prep.86 Results from the environmental scan reflect this importance to incorporate PGHD in tailored care delivery models. A team approach across medicine, nursing, pharmacy, population health, and other health professionals is needed. In partic ular, case managers and nurses are well suited to be significant stakeholders in the management of PGHD. A team approach that uses nurse - managed protocols may have positive effects on the outpatient management of adults with a range of chronic conditions. 87 A number of studies demonstrate leveraging PGHD in patient populations, including those with CHF88, acute coronary syndrome,39 dermatology89, oncology,33 and heart rate data for cardiologist review.36 Semantic Interoperability The ability for computers to exchange data with shared meaning allows for accurate and reliable communication. When a common vocabulary is achieved (also known as interoperability), data and information can be exchanged across networks using mutually accepted protocols. This foster s a number of healthcare initiatives for quality improvement, population health management, and notably the use of PGHD for patient care delivery and clinical decision making. Given the diversity of data sources from connected devices, PRO surveys, mobile apps, and more, it is critical that standards be used across the industry that allow for interoperable data exchange. Supporting patients through data capture and transfer into EHRs is highly complex. Standardized interoperable data interfaces such as HL7' s SMART and FHIR 11 are becoming increasingly important. With the rollout of new ONC interoperability rules requiring healthcare providers who receive CMS payments to use FHIR -compatible apps for patient data, adoption will likely accelerate. Many instituti ons have demonstrated success with leveraging FHIR to integrate PGHD into their EHRs for patient care delivery.38,39 This allows for the transferability and adoption of PGHD to other health systems and ambulatory care clinics using a common framework. Inte rviews with EHR vendors stressed the importance of adopting industry-wide standards such as FHIR to prevent \"reinventing the wheel.\" Nevertheless, FHIR is not standardized across the industry, and not all vendors reported using FHIR. Fortunately, FHIR inte roperability standards are gaining traction, and frameworks continue to be developed such as SMART Markers, for example. SMART Markers is a new software framework for capturing PGHD that allows innovators to create custom versions of apps for patients and clinicians. 90 SMART Markers supports a number of data types from surveys and device -recorded platforms.90 A number of reports, including those from the AMA, PCORI, ONC, and Continua (Table 4) provide guidance on using interoperability standards such as FHI R in the selection, collection, and use of PGHD. Security and Privacy The importance of security and privacy cannot be overstated. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes \"national standards to protect individuals' electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information.\"91 Ambulatory care clinics and 36 the vendors they interface with must have in place physical, network, and process security measures and follow them in order to ensure HIPAA compliance. Ambul atory care clinics must determine when they are legally responsible for data security and privacy of PGHD. Using a kit model, where devices and tools are provided to patients, gives clinics control over the data flow and may enhance approaches to security and privacy. This is in contrast to relying on a BYOD model where patie nts use their smartphone or buy a consumer device (e.g., Garmin, iHealth) that may send data to a third -party company or share data with other apps on their phone. Patients should be encouraged to use standard security approaches such as user authenticatio n and to limit health information exchange with third-party apps. Limited regulations around PGHD and consumer -based devices makes this an ongoing challenge. Data are more protected once they come into the EHR ecosystem, which could be through a patient portal or via API from a device company. While patients should be given education to make informed decisions about data and security, their smartphone is owned by them, and data do not fall under HIPAA regulations prior to entering the clinic's electronic ec osystem. As described in Chapter 3, Ploner and Pr okosch38 present a well -described systems architecture and FHIR -based data model that includes security measures and application flow from patients' smartphones and a public cloud infrastructure. Healt h Equ ity and Health Disparities While the integration of PGHD into EHRs holds promise to improve self -management, care coordination, quality, and cost -effectiveness, these improvements may be stymied by digital divides and have unintended consequences for healt h equity.92 Poverty, poor engagement with digital health tools for some communities, low digital health literacy, and lack of access to broadband are some factors that may influence the potential impact of PGHD in ambulatory care settings. 92 PGHD selection and use require active efforts to be inclusive of diverse patient populations in design and implementation strategies. B roadband and device access. High-speed internet access, whether through broadband or a smartphone, and device access are fundamental co mponents to consider for patients to benefit from the use of PGHD. However, over 21 million Americans lack broadband access.93 Over 30% of rural Americans and 60% of healthcare facilities outside metropolitan areas lack broadband access.94 This has disproportionately affected communities of color in rural areas. Rural counties where a majority of residents are African American have few provider options and are more likely to be completely unserved.95 Device access is also critical for patient engagement wit h PGHD. While over 81% of American adults own a smartphone, many people rely solely on their phone for internet access, often in communities of color. Further, smartphone access is divided into two dominant operating systems \u2014iOS and Android. Promoting equi table access to PGHD must be inclusive of both operating systems. EHR vendors responded that they incorporate PGHD into their EHR; all reported connectivity with iOS HealthKit, yet only two reported connectivity with Android/Google Fit (Table 5). D igital h ealth literacy. Patients must be able to use PGHD and its associated tools. Digital health literacy is an extension of health literacy and is the degree to which a patient is able to obtain, process, and understand digital services and information.96 Patie nts need education and empowerment on how to collect PGHD, use devices, and interpret health data over time. Even further, patients need to be able to understand privacy and security implications of using apps and devices, and should be informed as to how their data are being used and where they are 37 going. The ONC rule notes that healthcare institutions could, for example, include a warning identifying an app as untrusted and giving patients the option to reject data access.97 Inclusive design. Many patient -facing mobile apps and portals feature inaccessible design features. Many lack focus on culture, literacy and numeracy, which limit the benefits of PGHD and may even worsen inequities. 96 Patients should be included as key stakeholders in the development of care models that incorporate PGHD. This will maximize the potential benefits of PGHD and help ensure that the use of PGHD improves patient outcomes, care coordination, quality, and cost -effectiveness. Lim itations We note a number of limitations t o this environmental scan. Our search results were limited to the English language and did not include in-press or unpublished manuscripts and reports such as technical documentation that may be useful in understanding approaches to the integration of PGHD into EHRs. Our search and review of reports and guides may have missed noteworthy reports, particularly those from government agencies outside of the United States. The scoping review built upon a review by Tiase et al. 3 in which we used a priori codes and themes that may have limited curation of new themes and knowledge generation. The grey literature search was limited to the first 50 results in the Google search engine. Whi le we attempted to collect data from vendors that serve over 95% of the U.S. am bulatory care market, we were not able to collect data and conduct interviews with all vendors contacted. Lastly, the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the U.S. healthcare industry. Policies, regulations, and the use of PGHD itself is quickly evolving, and information captured in this report is limited to the period of data capture and synthesis. Fut ure Trends The use of PGHD for remote monitoring facilitates data -driven care and allows for the development of new care delivery models that allow us to go beyond the traditional brick and mortar clinic model. E merging models of care blend telehealth with in-home and in-clinic approaches. Beyond the hospital -at- home model, companies such as Amazon are piloting new models such as Amaz on Care that brings healthcare closer to patients' everyday environment. This model allows patients to communicate with providers through a smartphone app in a variety of ways, including video visits, submitting photos, and tracking vital signs and more us ing connected devices. Moreover, an RN, NP, PA, or MD comes to the patient's home to draw labs, perform physical assessments, and provide care. Medications and supplies are shipped directly to the patient. C ompanies, including Walmart, are venturing into t he healthcare industry, which may increase healthcare access to underserved populations at lower prices than many large health systems or clinics. Other companies, like Teledoc, which recently absorbed Livongo, are growing players in the digital disease ma nagement arena. T echnology continues to mature. As in-home artificial intelligence (AI) such as Amazon Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant grow, technology-enabled care evolves. These tools, for example, may be ideal for patient populations such as older adults and those with disabilities who can interact with technology using their voice. A variety of approaches are well suited for these voice -based technologies, such as reminding patient to take their medication, report their blood pressure, and receive instructions on how to care for post -surgical wounds. Other exciting 38 opportunities such as AI -based therapy that guides patients through cognitive behavioral therapy using mental health chatbots are on the rise as well. C ritically, though, while these approaches hold promise to improve care delivery and patient outcomes, they must be designed with a health equity lens. To provide benefit to those who are most in need and reach underserved populations, we must be inclusive of diverse patients and select technol ogies and create processes that promote health equity and reduce health disparities. A range of stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, population health managers, and more are needed in the design process to create value from PGHD and pre vent unintended consequences, such as clinician burnout from technological burden. Conclusion Capturing PGHD facilitates patients and clinicians to better understand and predict illness dynamics and to develop approaches to improve health outcomes and del iver personalized care. The COVID -19 pandemic accelerated the use of PGHD, as care providers were encouraged to collect data from patients remotely. While promising, adoption of health IT systems has many ch allenges1 and the potential to exacerbate health inequities. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule has provided much-needed regulation, structure, and incentives to help alleviate challenges.79 Nevertheless, more supportive policies are needed. T his environmental scan presents a thematic summary of recommendations from the scoping review, reports, policies, and data collection from the EHR vendors. These recommendations will inform the development of a practical guide on the integration of PGHD for ambulatory care providers. 39 References 1. Gettinger A, Zayas -Cab\u00e1n T.
