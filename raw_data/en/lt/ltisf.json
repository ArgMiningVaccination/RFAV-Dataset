These areas of expertise describe the care nurses in these areas should be able to provide. They should be seen as an addition to the standard professional profile of a nurse ( Beroepsproef verpleegkundige ) (Lambregts en Grotendorst 2012) (Terpstra et al., 2015). The areas of expertise were established with help of the board and members of the relevant departments of the V&VN. In addition, a literature review was conducted, and there was also input from stakeholders and educators. In recent years, there have been numerous developments in healthcare that have a direct influence on competences of nurses with a specialisation. Of course, this also applies to anthroposophic nursing care. The last document describing the specialist knowledge and skills of this profession dates from 2007: Het \"Beroepsprofiel Antroposofische Verpleegkundige\" (Bezuijen, 2007). This document is updated within the project V&VN 'Areas of Expertise 2nd edition'. The Area of Expertise Anthroposophic nursing care was developed in close collaboration with the board and members of the V&VN Anthroposophical Care Department. The area of expertise anthroposophic nursing care describes the vision on care from anthroposophy and the specific knowledge and skills that nurses in anthroposophic care utilise. This document is intended for the anthroposophic care nurses, for teachers, employers, patients and partners of the anthroposophic nurses at local, regional and international level. The document illustrates the distinctive vision and competences of antroposophic nursing care. This document can be used, where necessary, as a guideline for the implementation of job description differentiation. The basic principles for job differentiation as described by V&VN on www.venvn.nl should be used: transparency, support, involvement of nurses and looking beyond just their qualifications. The area of expertise can also serve, for example, as a basic document for training programmes, as input for performance reviews and/or for the development of function profiles. In order to do justice to the large percentage of female nurses, in this document the female form has been chosen to indicate the nurse. Of course, this also includes male nurses. When it comes to the care recipient, this is the other way round.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202252. Anthroposophy: vision on care Anthroposophy is the vision on care that underlies the Nursing Anthroposophic Care Expertise Area. The concept of anthroposophy is composed of two Greek words, \"anthropos\" and \"sophia\", human and wisdom. Anthroposophy is a philosophy of life that was developed by the Austrian Rudolf Steiner in the early twentieth century. Anthroposophy is characterised by being a practically feasible spiritual view of humans and nature. Anthroposophy come to life by utilising this philosophy for the benefit of people and society. Rudolf Steiner's ideas and advice form a basis for many sectors in society. For example, biodynamic agriculture, animal husbandry, horticulture, pedagogy, Waldorf education (also known as Steiner education), architecture, art, banking, scientific research and organizational consultancy. This is also the case for aspects of health care such as social therapy, remedial education (including care for the disabled), medicine, pharmacy and nursing. Anthroposophic oriented medicine has its origins in the collaboration between Rudolf Steiner and the Dutch female physician Ita Wegman. Ita Wegman founded the first anthroposophic hospital close to Basel in Switzerland in 1921. Steiner visited the clinic daily, saw many patients and gave direction to the therapies. He developed medical courses in which he spoke about health and disease, about the effect of natural medicines and how to prepare them. At that time, Steiner wrote the book \"Foundations for an expansion of medicine\" together with Wegman. With the establishment of the clinic in 1921 and therefore the treatment of the first patients, the amount of nursing interventions with an anthroposophic basis increased drastically. This is when anthroposophic nursing care became a reality. In addition to medicine and nursing, anthroposophy also offers a broadening of insights to various other health care professions, for example to physiotherapists, dieticians and art therapists (therapeutic painting, sculpting, music or speaking) and biographical care providers. Eurythmy therapy (movement form) has also arisen from anthroposophy. Anthroposophic nurses work closely with all these professionals. Anthroposophy gives an extra dimension to the nursing profession and broadens the vision of anthroposophic care nurses on health and life questions with additional perspectives. Anthroposophy also broadens nursing practice when regarding personalised interventions. The nursing interventions become practical in daily care, in the transfer of knowledge and provide the opportunity for research. The integration of points of view from anthroposophy that are a substantial part of an anthroposophic nurses view and method of working are described in the 'nursing process' in chapters 2.1 and 3. For the care recipient and their environment this can also have added value. The integration of points of view from anthroposophy that are a substantial part of an anthroposophic nurses view and method of working are described in chapters 2.1 and 3.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202262.1. Vision on disease, health and development The anthroposophic philosophy combines regular scientific research with ones individual experience. The starting point is that what is measurable and tangible, is also an expression of vital, psychological and spiritual processes. Within anthroposophy, health is regarded as a dynamic equilibrium, in which contradictions are constantly overcome by means of balancing or averaging. For example, tension and relaxation, sleep and awakening, inside and outside world, absorbing and excreting food. If the balance between these opposites is disturbed, disharmony and disease can arise. The disturbance can be of biological or psychological nature, or can be related to motive or meaning. Anthroposophic health care considers illness as an opportunity for a specific learning moment: illness can provide insight into the state of the individual dynamic process and the development that is desirable in this process. An anthroposophic care nurse can support this process. Diseases can either have internal or external sources. Obviously not everyone gets sick under the same circumstances, constitution, resistance and receptivity play an important role. The functioning of the body can moreover be influenced by mood and lifestyle. According to anthroposophic philosophy, a power is hidden within every person, in which self-healing and self-regulating possibilities are present. It is of importance to care for, protect and shape this force (salutogenesis). An anthroposophic care nurse guides and supports these self-regulating, self-healing powers of the care recipient with nursing interventions. Positive healthcare, as described by Machteld Huber (Huber, 2021), fits perfectly with anthroposophic philosophy. Positive healthcare describes six pillars in which the care recipient can be supported in self-direction in order to increase their own resilience. This positive healthcare can be a tool to gain more insight into the request for care. Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202273. Assumptions of anthroposophic nurses Anthroposophic nursing care is a form of integrated nursing, in which further anthroposophic insights are used in addition to the basic principles of regular care. These are elaborated in anamnesis, nursing diagnostics and nursing interventions. The nurse observes the care recipient with regard to their physical aspects, psychological functioning, social functioning and as a spiritual being in its intrinsic form. Physically all bodily functions that can be measured and weighed are looked at. Psychologically/socially, a care recipients thoughts, feelings and wishes in regard to the care process are taken into consideration. The spiritual, intrinsic aspect is taken into account by being open to the essential question behind the request for care. The basic attitude of exact phenomenological observation on the one hand and at the same time searching for the underlying mental processes means an empathic, humane way of creating proximity in freedom. This basic school of thought is the core of the profession of anthroposophic nursing care. The mutual interaction of the three dimensions of body, psychological/social and spiritual aspects of the human being is explained within anthroposophic nursing in: Care: caring for the physical body, and all the processes that go on inside of it (for example the vital functions). It is important to be aware of the current knowledge and possibilities. Mediation: the care for the relationship between the care recipient and the care provider and the concrete environment of the care recipient. Anthroposophic nursing care is focused on acting in the NOW, as a result of this the intervention is adapted to the personal and specific situation of the care recipient. In this aspect of nursing, being interested and practicing on a human one to one level, rather than \"just doing the job\" is a development opportunity for the nurse. Guidance: the care in which you, as a nurse or carer, look for how you can support the inner (being) of the care recipient. The nurse can continuously trained in this by being in touch with the underlying question of the care recipient. The elements Care, Mediation and Guidance are the pillars of the anthroposophic nursing care profession and function as a guideline in daily work and for training. The interventions of anthroposophic nursing care can be found in: Nursing Intervention Classification. (Butcher (2012) (Moorhead (2020)): - NIC 5460 Touch - NIC 1480: massage (based on effleurage: Later (2014)) - NIC 1380: heat/cold application - NIC 2420: phytotherapy - NIC 1610: Bathing, further reading to be found in the official department guidelines developed using the Delphi method.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 20228In the human organism it is possible to discover a functional tripartite: The nervous-sensory perception area, the brain and senses, in which coolness and tranquillity predominate. The metabolic area, the limbs and abdominal organs, where a connection can be seen in warmth, digestion and movement. The rhythmic area, which rhythmically mediates between the nervous-sensory system and the metabolic area of the human being through the heartbeat, circulation and respiration. This trichotomy, which can be found in the smallest detail of the human organism, shows a dynamic interaction in which there is a constant search for equilibrium and balance. This three-part framework can be helpful when looking at the nature of a disease process. Thereafter regulating, balance-creating processes are initiated. For example by using the interventions touch, more movement, air and space or in contrast being ordered and demarcated. It is possible to apply these interventions, which are elaborated in NIC-interventions: NIC 1380: heat/cold applications; NIC 2420: phytotherapy, NIC 2860: bathing/showering. In addition to the tripartite division in the human body, anthroposophic nursing care uses a fourfold description of man. In this fourfold, a relationship is developed between nature and mankind. This concerns the four kingdoms of nature: minerals, plants, animals and human kingdoms. The mineral stands for the earth element in nature, the plants for the water element in nature, the animal kingdom for the light/air element in nature and humans for the heat element in nature. In the human body, these elements can also be distinguished and recognised in the solid, liquid, gaseous and heat element. These are seen as part of larger wholes within man themselves and surrounding them. For example, the physical body, the ether/vital body, the experience/astral body and the sense of self-body. Advice can be provided for care/nursing by working with these four elements. Florence Nightingale (Nightingale, 1859) also describes this in her 'Notes on Nursing'. To make a nursing diagnosis, an anthroposophic care nurse conducts research and tests to gain better insight into the threefold and fourfold aspects mentioned above. Besides this they also look into the life processes and the biography. Then the nursing interventions are based on these findings. Anthroposophic nursing care finds opportunities in the frameworks mentioned above to approach health and disease and to discover how self-healing abilities of the care recipient may be awakened. Many of the nursing interventions (baths, wraps, compresses and rhythmic rubbing) are based on the use of medicinal plants (NIC 2420). In order to achieve the best person-oriented intervention, the three dimensions of the plant is related to the care demand. A distinction is made in the root area, the rhythmic part of branching and leaf formation and the blooming, seed and gynoecium. Anthroposophic nurses take these three dimensions into account when choosing which part of the plant to include in the interventions. The heat processes that are required in the preparation of anthroposophic medicines, such as essences, ointments and oils, are examined during the preparation. During nursing interventions the method of application, e.g. cool or warm, also play a role in the decision of the given intervention.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 20229Development and growth is an important aspect to human life. From an anthroposophic point of view, one can distinguish three major phases in life each being 21 years. The first 21 years in a period in which growth has the main focus. The next phase, from 21 till 42 years, shows development based on the available abilities and from 42-63 years of age a period in which personal life experiences can result in further evolution. After 63 years development is acquired through further maturing of the acquired wisdom. This leads to new possibilities. More specifically, anthroposophy describes the human life course in periods of seven years. New learning possibilities become available in each of the seven years: 0-7 years: the phase of goodness, 7-14 years: the phase of beauty, 14-21 years: the phase of truth, 21-28 years: the phase of refinement, 28-35 years: the stage of insight, 35-42 years: the stage unfolding, 42-49 years: the phase uniqueness, 49-56 years: the phase of overview, 56-63 years: the phase of intuition, 63 and older: the phase of preparation. Each period has its characteristic possibilities, opportunities for growth and challenges. These periods are of course not clearly defined and an individual development can show a completely different line of development. When reviewing a care recipient, the anthroposophic care nurse takes these 7-year periods into account when trying to uncover in which phase the care recipient is in. The nurses recognises the influence of this phase in life, respects it and pays attention to the balance between the capacity and burden of the care in this specific phase. The individuality of every human being develops in the course of their life. On the one hand the biological development and on the other hand the inner growth. An anthroposophic care nurse realises that every person is unique, that everyone has their own developmental ideals and tries to realise them to the best of their ability. Reincarnation is an option to be respected. Life processes are crucial during the beginning of life and continue throughout life. When making an inventory of the life processes, the basic nursing observations are interrelated. The physical processes such as breathing, warmth, nutrition, incretion and excretion, sleeping and becoming healthy, growth and the possibility of reproduction are related to the psychological/social processes of absorbing impressions, being able to get impressions at their own temperature, being able to digest impressions through which you are fed, being able to choose, being able to sustain yourself through habits, inner growth and becoming creative.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202210In addition, life processes also form a foundation for learning processes of which the care recipient and nurse can benefit. Development takes place through different manners, which means that providing care is always a mutual dynamic process. The care recipient and nurse are each developing in their own way. In phenomenological perception, a number of aspects can be distinguished as phases of perception; the actual observation, the participatory observation and giving meaning to the observation. The observational abilities have been trained extensively during anthroposophic education. Antrophosophic care nurses practise and fine-tune their observational skills during training courses and during study and training days. (Bakker & Boon, 2012). Health is a dynamic event, in which polarities are constantly bridged: tension - relaxation, sleep - wakefulness, outside world - inner world, absorbing food - excreting, etc. If the balance between these processes is disturbed, disharmony and disease can occur. This disruption can be on different levels e.g. biological, psychological or meaning of life level. Anthroposophical health care considers disharmony and disease as a specific moment of which one can learn: it can provide insight into the individual dynamic process. An anthroposophic care nurse can provide support in this processArea of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022114. Work environment and educational background Anthroposophic care nurses have traditionally worked in general hospitals, psychiatric care, anthroposophic communities and institutions for youth care, elderly care and care for people with mental disabilities. In recent years there has been increasing interest from a large number of other health care sectors for an anthropologic approach, such as maternity care, youth health care, oncology, rheumatology, care for the disabled, elderly care, home care, palliative care. Anthroposophic nurses also work in hospices. In addition, it is important to mention that there are also referrers such as anthroposophic consultative doctors and general practitioners active in Therapeutics (the anthroposophic health centres) and second-line doctors such as paediatricians, psychiatrists and specialists in internal diseases. The diversity of specific care demands results in a diversity of anthroposophic nursing care specialisations. The specific care demands determine the nature of the care provided. More and more care recipients are asking critical questions about standard treatment and are seeking other alternatives, such as integrative medicine. In addition, there is an increasing interest in intangible values of care recipients. This becomes apparent through the fact that care recipients are looking for a broader and more natural vision of care via the internet. There are various options to fulfil these needs, including anthroposophic care. Anthroposophic care nurses work in their own practice and may link this to working within a healthcare institution. Other anthroposophic nurses continue to work in standard care centres or work in an institution where the basis of care is founded on anthroposophic care. There is also an increase in courses offered by nurses working in anthroposophic care. The number of nurses providing anthroposophic care is scarce. We are dealing with an aging population which affects the entire nursing profession. It has been noticed that anthroposophic care nurses struggle with maintaining their own identity. Occasionally, a 'dilution' of anthroposophic nursing can be seen because the profession is mixed with views and interventions from standard care or from other complementary visions on care. Anthroposophic care nurses have completed the 'Orientation course Nursing and Anthroposophy' or the 'Basic module Anthroposophic healthcare' and the 'Advanced Nursing Training from Anthroposophy'. These training courses can be supplemented with various courses, such as: 'Wraps on anthroposophy'. Additional and refresher courses, which are compulsory by the professional association, are recognised and accredited by the Quality Register of Nursing & Caregivers.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022125. The value of anthroposophic nursing care for the care recipient In anthroposophy, the care recipient is not approached fragmentarily, but as a whole. Anthroposophy looks at the biography and life philosophy of an individual. The anamnesis, nursing diagnosis and treatment plan of an anthropo- sophic care nurse focuses on the present time and on the future. Attention is also paid to the care recipient's environment. 'Proximity in freedom' is the quality criteria of anthroposophic nursing care. The care recipient is approached on the basis of equality. The contact is an encounter. In this personal encounter, contact, observation and perception take place, the nurse offers peace and listens to the care recipient in an open manner. These nurses observe the care recipient's physique, movements, breathing pattern and view on the world. They try to uncover the specific request for care together with the care recipient. It is important to note that there are no standard interventions, but nursing interventions tailored to the individual care request. If possible, the nurse looks for suitable, non-pharmacological interventions. Anthroposophic care nurses use non-verbal interventions, for example: baths, rhythmic rubbings, wraps and compresses. The anthroposophic interventions can be found in the elaboration of the CanMEDS roles, see chapter 8 of this document. The anthroposophic care nurse is educated and trained to be able to observe phenomenologically. They restrain themselves, and leave the care recipient be in order to see what comes automatically. The nurses create an open and healing environment for the care recipient.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022136. Developments in the discipline of anthroposophic nursing care The dominant culture in healthcare is focused on efficiency, protocols, guidelines and tangible short term effects. This culture can clash with the anthroposophic view of care in which the core is attention, involvement and the mental processes behind the disease or condition. Communication with referring medics and multidisciplinary collaboration can also be complex as a result. Anthroposophic care nurses regularly experience a shortage of time and space to properly practice their profession. The further development of a common language within anthroposophic healthcare through imaging patient discussions is gaining wider support. The importance of research is endorsed and co-developed by anthroposophic care nurses. In the professional group, cases are described and collected in a joint, international handbook. This handbook serves as a database to work towards evidence-based practice. The use of non-pharmacological therapies require extensive elaboration. See https://www.pflege-vademecum.de/?locale=nl Care recipients search in countless ways for meaning and definition of illness and disorders. These developments influence the work of nurses in anthroposophic care. The growing multicultural society results in a shift in care demands. There is a social trend moving towards less materialism. Anthroposophic care nurses feel responsible to keep up with this social movement. By doing so they fit in with modern times. The development of transmural care, which has become visible in recent decades, offers an opportunity for anthroposophic nurses to contribute with their expertise, to the quality of life for the care recipient. Here too, the \"proximity in freedom\" may be seen as appropriate within the current time frame.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022147. The area of expertise of the nurse This chapter provides a general description of the roles of nurses (Lambregts and Grotendorst 2012) (Terpstra et al, 2015). These descriptions form the basis of the Area of Expertise. The next chapter discusses the specialistic knowledge, skills and attitude of anthroposophic care nurses and their specific roles. These roles, as described below, and the Professional Standard (V&VN, 2015) form the starting point of professional practice for all nurses, including anthroposophic care nurses. a. Supporting the self-management of care recipients, their loved ones and their social network, with the aim of maintaining or improving functioning in relation to quality of life, health and disease. Focuses on the six dimensions of health: bodily functions, mental functions and experience, the spiritual/existential dimension, quality of life, social participation and daily functioning; b. Composing a nursing diagnosis and indicating, organising and providing nursing care and psychosocial support based on clinical reasoning, in non-complex situations based on guidelines and protocols and in complex care situations that require integration of knowledge and combination of guidelines and protocols. Where possible, work is based on evidence-based practice; c. Drawing up, implementing and evaluating a care (life) plan1 and performing management tasks related to the care recipient. This is in collaboration with the care recipient, their relatives, their social network and with fellow care providers. In addition, directing the care process that is linked to the care recipient and/or transcends by organising and coordinating an integrated, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, coherent care plan. This is done by consulting the care recipient (shared decision making), in which the next of kin and the social network of the care recipient and fellow care providers in the (care) chain are also involved; d. Observing the care recipient ensuring timely signalling of for example changes in their state of health, and taking appropriate action to speed up recovery or reduce the risk of disease worsening; e. Carrying out care-related prevention aimed at individuals with a disease, disability or multiple health problems, with the aim of supporting self-reliance, reducing the burden of disease and preventing aggravation of disease. In addition to this indication, development, organisation and implementation of prevention aimed at promoting health, vitality, self-management and participation of people, anticipating health risk and taking action when there is an increased risk; f. Performing tasks, initiating and developing quality assurance in the field of innovation, analysis and practical research and (evidence-based) professionalisation within a work unit or area of expertise, taking into account cost-effectiveness; Supervising and coaching fellow healthcare providers; g. Performing restricted medical actions on the basis of functional independence. 1 Also: nursing plan, supervision plan, etc.Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022158. Elaboration of the CanMEDS-roles The introduction and chapter 7 state that the area of expertise of anthroposophic nursing care can be regarded as a supplement to the professional profile of nurses as described by (Lambregts en Grotendorst 2012) (Terpstra et al., 2015). The professional profile description describes the area of expertise of the nursing profession (chapter 6), which applies to every nurse, including nurses that work within the anthroposophic philosophy. The area of expertise describes the additional knowledge, skills and attitude that are necessary for performing the roles and tasks within the area of expertise of anthroposophic care. This is further elaborated using CanMEDS system (Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists). This systems consists of seven different roles. The core of the professional practice is the nurse as a care provider. All other roles are supportive of the caregiver role. This central role gives direction to the other CanMEDS roles. Figure 1. CanMEDS-system Reading Guide This document provides a brief, general consideration of the CanMEDS roles within the area of expertise of the Anthroposophic Nursing Care. Subsequently, the general applicable knowledge, skills and attitude from the Professional Profile are briefly described for each role. Thereafter, the additional, specific knowledge, skills and attitude are described. This specific information will provide a clear picture of which skills are needed within anthroposophic nursing care which are unique compared to other nursing areas of expertise. The knowledge and skills from the Professional Profile, together with the specialist knowledge and skills/attitude of the anthroposophic nursing care, form a whole and together cover the entire area in which the anthroposophic care is active. Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 2022168.1 Care-worker role Characteristic for anthroposophic nursing care is the role of care-worker, this vision is further elaborated in chapter 3. There is a specific angle for nurses in anthroposophic care for them to make the diagnosis. In addition, it is a given that the interventions used in anthroposophic care are not carried out in any other nursing specialization. The process of taking a patients anamnesis, making a nursing diagnosis and evaluation between care giver and care recipient are all based on the PES, NIC and NOC methods described in the nursing literature by, among others, Butcher (2012) and Moorhead (2020), also referend to in chapter 3. After each step in the nursing care process, reflection is desirable and adjustment is possible. Through this process, nursing care is individually tailored to the needs of the care recipient. This also makes the care more transparent, targeted, methodical and transferable. The following section explains the various steps in the process of nursing care in more details. Anthroposophic care nurses use a number of sources to take an anamnesis and make a nursing diagnosis: Information from the healthcare recipient and their relatives Information from the referrer or other collaborating partners The knowledge from regular nursing and the anthroposophic nursing insights. Anthroposophic nursing diagnostics focuses, among other things, on the seven life processes in humans: - Breathing/uptake - Heating/adjusting - Digestion/dissimilation - In- and excretion/making choices - Conservation/sleep/recovery - Cell division/growth/vitality - Reproduction/creating new life The 7 life processes are approached from the phenomenological vision. They are then connected with the insights from the three and fourfold approaches (Emous et al, 2012). Based on the nursing diagnosis, a nursing plan is drawn up in which the nurse makes a motivated choice from the range of nursing interventions, taking the possible contra-indications and side effects into account. They then make a distinction between short and long-term goals and formulate the plan taking the possibilities of the individual care recipient into account. The evaluation of the care provided is related to the previously established goal and also takes into consideration the unplanned, accidentally successful actions and unexpectedly effective actions (De Vries, (2004). Because anthroposophic nursing interventions are often offered in series, reflective evaluation is possible in-between interventions. In addition, the care recipient is asked whether there has been an improvement in well-being or quality of life. The anthroposophic care nurse strives for trust, delay, activation, rest and well-being in their interventions. During the evaluation, attention is focussed to whether changes have occurred in the relationship between carrying capacity and load on the care recipient. Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202217When it comes to anthroposophic nursing interventions, they are approached regarding body, soul and spirit, whereby the nursing \"caring, mediating and guiding\" are distinguished (see chapter 3). These three aspects can be used within every CanMEDS role, this is because in nursing, these three aspects occur in an integrated manner. In the various CanMEDS roles, an emphasis can be placed on caring, using the associated knowledge, attitude and skills. It is also possible that either the mediating or the guiding role are more prominent. The guiding role can consist of searching for images, listening to intuitions or inspirations, this so that the invisible behind the visible reality can be clarified. Whenever caring, mediating or guiding is mentioned in a CanMEDS role, this emphasis is included.

The mediating interventions occur during the primary care process. These interventions are between the care recipient and nurses, but also seen in various other partnerships. The organiser role focusses on these mediating interventions. This requires the nurse to be able to take on an advisory role in addition to a coordinating role. This also requires that they can effectively transfer knowledge and give instructions to other care providers in order to contribute to continuity of care.

The future In the coming decades, the roles and tasks of anthroposophic nursing care will continue to be influenced by social developments, developments in healthcare and specifically within the field of anthroposophical care and its related fields. The demand for anthroposophic care is increasing. The current developments in health care, such as the increase in the number of patients with multi-pathology and chronic conditions, will influence the scope and content of the demand for anthroposophic nursing care. This is one of the causes of the growing shortage of nurses in anthroposophic care, which is only expected to increase further in the coming years. More and more participation and self-management is expected from the patient and those close to them, and the appeal to the care recipient's environment is increasing. An anthroposophic care nurse navigates alongside these developments in a constructive manner and ensures that they keep up with the knowledge and skills that are required for their job. In the coming years, an anthroposophic care nurse must anticipate the upcoming developments in ICT within their field, such as telehealth, domotics and robotics. These developments have a great influence on various care processes, the involvement of the care professionals and the role of the patient themselves. Finally, developments that are visible within society and healthcare as a whole also apply to anthroposophic care nurses, such as: tightness on the labour market, which results in a greater focus on finding, binding and captivating healthcare professionals. In addition, carrying on working until an older age. Anthroposophic care fits in perfectly with the increasing attention for spirituality, sustainability and environmental awareness. This can further strengthen the identity and position of nurses providing anthroposophic care. The challenge for the future of the anthroposophic nurse is to continue to believe in their own strengths and the added value of their interventions. This requires courage, professional pride and daring. Area of expertise: anthroposophic nursing May 202229Literature 1. Achterberg, der Gesundheid, Dgvt-Verlag. 3. Bakker, I, & J. (2012). Zorg 8.
