Materials & methods: Critically ill patients diagnosed with sepsis received either high-dose (2 g every 8 h) or megadose (4 g every 8 h) meropenem as an intravenous infusion over 3 h. Results: A total of 23 patients with nosocomial sepsis were eligible and included in the megadose (n = 11) or high-dose (n = 12) group. No treatment-related adverse events were observed during a 14-day follow-up. Clinical response was also comparable between the groups. Conclusion: Megadose meropenem may be considered for empirical treatment of nosocomial sepsis without serious concern regarding its safety. Keywords: empirical; high-dose; megadose; meropenem; sepsis. Plain language summary As resistance to antibiotics is increasing among microbes, rational use of these drugs is important both in the community and in hospitals. Many infections with resistant microorganisms may be fatal. For a long time, carbapenems have been the last resort for treatment of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, resistance to these drugs is increasing. It appears that use of higher doses of antibiotics may help in some cases. However, the potential harm caused by higher doses is a problem. In this primary study, higher doses of meropenem, a common carbapenem, were found to be safe.
