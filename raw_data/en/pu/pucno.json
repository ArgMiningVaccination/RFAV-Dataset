I think this is a wrong term. Allopathy was a term invented by early homeopaths to distinguish it from the earlier philosophy of medicine practiced in those days, when the medicines were prescribed according to the imbalance of humoral temperament of the body. For example then it was thought that a particular disease is caused by increase or decrease of Blood, Phlegm, Yellow Bile; Black Bile the usual medicines were prescribed which used to restore balance to those humours. That type of philosophy was prevalent in Greek medicine and later adopted by Muslims and still practiced widely in theIndian subcontinent. Similar concepts but with different names are practiced in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. Whereas in homeopathy they invented a system of medicine where the similar kind of substances (but in much diluted doses) were prescribe to treat the diseases that produce similar types of symptoms. Thus they invented the term homeopathy and regarded other types as Allopathy. We all know in modern concept of medicine there is no such philosophy so it is inappropriate to use the term Allopathy for modern medicine. As modern medicine incorporates only those concepts which can be readily proven by strict scientific standards the better term for it, I think, should be \"Scientific Medicine\".
