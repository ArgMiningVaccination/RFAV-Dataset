While there's a vaccine for hepatitis B, none exists yet for hepatitis C. Learn why.", "sitename": "MedicineNet", "date": "2021-03-11", "cleaned_text": "What do hepatitis B and C have in common? [Hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm) is a family of [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) that [hepatitis infections, [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) and C can also lead to chronic, long-term infections that severely damage the liver over time. This can cause [cirrhosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm) \u2014 or scarring \u2014 of the liver, liver-related [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm), or complete liver failure, especially if you have [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm). [Vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) exist, but only for [hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) A and B infections. There is no [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) for [hepatitis C](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). Both the hepatitis B and C viruses can lead to mild infections that your immune system can fight off. But, in over half of all cases, the infection doesn't go away, and the virus remains in your body for a much longer period. You might not experience any symptoms during a chronic hepatitis B or C infection. But because hepatitis is [contagious](https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm), you may inadvertently transmit it to others. That's why it's very important to get tested if you think that you might have been exposed. If you've had a long-term infection, the effects of hepatitis B or C may not surface until many years \u2014 sometimes decades \u2014 later. One of the first effects you might feel involve damage to your liver. Generally speaking, the younger you are at the time of a [viral hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm) infection, the more likely that it'll become chronic. How are hepatitis B and C transmitted? A key difference between hepatitis B and C is the way they are transmitted. Hepatitis B is typically transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids like blood and semen, while [Hepatitis C](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_c_quiz/quiz.htm) can only be transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. This means that needle sharing is a big problem for the spread of both of these viruses, especially since most people are symptomless and don't know that they're infected. Hepatitis C is much more limited in how it can be spread. By contrast, hepatitis B can be spread several ways, including: - Birth: can be transmitted to a [newborn](https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm)during [childbirth](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_pain_relief_options_for_birth/article.htm). - Sex: can be transmitted to or contracted from a partner through intercourse. - Sharing Items of Personal Hygiene: can be transmitted to or contracted from anyone through the use of items like razors and toothbrushes. The hepatitis B vaccine The first version of the [hepatitis B vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_immunizations/article.htm) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981. Since the early 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all countries add the vaccine to their public immunization plans. Several types of approved hepatitis B [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) are available, including one suitable for people of all ages, from infants to adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that everyone under age 19 get the vaccine, with infants receiving the first dose at birth. The agency also recommends that most adults get the vaccine, especially those who: - have sexual or common household contact with someone with hepatitis B - have more than one sexual partner - have experienced sexual abuse - are likely to be in contact with blood and bodily fluids at work - have other liver conditions, including hepatitis C - are being treated for [sexually transmitted diseases](https://www.medicinenet.com/stds_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), including [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm) The most common version of the vaccine requires three separate doses. There's also a version that the FDA approved for adults that only requires two doses. You can get the hepatitis B vaccine at the same time as other [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm). You'll never catch hepatitis B from the vaccine. Combination vaccines also exist that protect against both hepatitis A and B. Once you're vaccinated against hepatitis B, you should be immune for the rest of your life and won't need a booster. Is there a hepatitis C vaccine? No vaccine exists for hepatitis C right now. While efforts to develop a vaccine for this specific strain are ongoing, it's proven challenging. That's because hepatitis C tends to avoid immune responses. In other words, a person can catch hepatitis C repeatedly despite past infection, which is what makes it hard to create a vaccine that works for this virus. There is an effective treatment for hepatitis C, though, and it involves direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Thanks to this treatment, WHO aims to cut 80% of hepatitis C cases worldwide by 2030. Researchers across the globe think that a vaccine is needed to accomplish this goal, so creating one is a high priority. When to talk to your doctor You may not realize that you've come in contact with hepatitis B or C because oftentimes there aren't any symptoms. You should get tested if you've been in any situation that presents a risk of infection, like sharing needles. The CDC also recommends that all [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) women get tested for hepatitis C. Some people can be [allergic](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm) to the hepatitis B vaccine, so you should also see your doctor if you experience any bad reactions after getting one of the doses.

Can Alcoholic Hepatitis Be Cured?Liver damage from mild alcoholic hepatitis can usually be cured by complete abstinence from alcohol and lifestyle changes. Learn about symptoms, treatment, and survival rates. Can Alcoholic Hepatitis Be Reversed?While mild alcoholic hepatitis may be reversed, once it reaches the stage of liver cirrhosis, it is irreversible. After diagnosis, abstaining from alcohol can improve your lifespan. Can I Get HIV From Surfaces?Studies proved that HIV cannot be transmitted through surfaces such as toilet seats, chairs, doorknobs, drinking glasses and bedsheets. The virus cannot survive outside a human host; hence, transmission through air, water (swimming pools), insect bite or casual contacts such as handshake, hug or touch is not possible. Can I Get HIV From Casual Contact Like Hugging or Touching?Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cannot spread through casual contact such as hugging or touching. HIV does not spread through urine, saliva, tears, sweat, kissing (closed mouth or social kissing), shaking hands, sharing utensils, sharing food or drinks, sharing clothes, or from toilet seats. HIV is spread through bodily fluids from a person with HIV. Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccineHaemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) vaccine is an inactivated bacterial vaccine used for routine immunization in children to protect against infections such as ear infections, bloodstream infection, pneumonia, meningitis, and others. Common side effects of Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine include local side effects at injection site, irritability, drowsiness, loss of appetite (anorexia), excessive crying, fever, pain, diarrhea, skin rash, middle ear infection (otitis media), and upper respiratory infection. The vaccine is not intended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Hepatitis B (HBV, Hep B)The hepatitis B virus (HBV, hep B) is a unique, coated DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family of viruses. The course of the virus is determined primarily by the age at which the infection is acquired and the interaction between the virus and the body's immune system. Successful treatment is associated with a reduction in liver injury and fibrosis (scarring), a decreased likelihood of developing cirrhosis and its complications, including liver cancer, and a prolonged survival. hepatitis B vaccineHepatitis B vaccine is an inactivated viral vaccine administered intramuscularly to provide protection against infection from all subtypes of hepatitis B virus. Common side effects of hepatitis B vaccine include injection site reactions, weakness, fatigue, headache, dizziness, feeling unwell (malaise), fever, muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, and throat inflammation (pharyngitis). Consult your doctor before receiving a hepatitis B vaccine if pregnant or breastfeeding. hepatitis b vaccine (Recombivax HB)Engerix-B and Recombivax HB are vaccinations against the hepatitis B virus. 14 Best and Worst Foods for Your LiverGet some simple diet tips to keep your liver healthy, including the best veggies to keep disease away and some snacks you'll want to avoid. hepatitis A and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine (Twinrix)Hepatitis A and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine (Twinrix) is a vaccine prescribed to immunize adults 18 years old of age or older against hepatitis A and all types of hepatitis B infections. Side effects, drug interactions, dosing, storage, and pregnancy safety should be reviewed prior to taking this medication. Is Hepatitis B Contagious? Hepatitis B is a type of liver infection. Hepatitis B is spread through person-to-person contact or through personal items like razors, toothbrushes, etc. Symptoms of hepatitis B include fever, yellowish skin (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. There is no drug to cure hepatitis B; however, there is a hepatitis B vaccine available. What Is the Normal Range for Hepatitis B Surface Antibody?Learn about how the hepatitis B surface antibody test works, and how its results indicate whether you are immune to the virus or not. Hepatitis (Viral Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G) Hepatitis is most often viral, due to infection with one of the hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E, F (not confirmed), and G) or another virus (such as those that cause infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus disease). The main nonviral causes of hepatitis are alcohol and drugs. Many patients infected with hepatitis A, B, and C have few or no symptoms of illness. For those who do develop symptoms of viral hepatitis, the most common are flu-like symptoms including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, and aching in the abdomen. Treatment of viral hepatitis is dependent on the type of hepatitis. What Does it Mean If You Have Urobilinogen in Your Urine?Urobilinogen is a substance that is produced when bilirubin, a waste product produced by the breakdown of red blood cells, is processed in the liver and released into the intestine. Excess urobilinogen in urine may indicate liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver damage. It is caused by drugs, toxic substances, or conditions associated with increased red blood cell destruction (hemolytic anemia). In a person with low urine urobilinogen and/or signs of liver dysfunction, it can be indicative of hepatic or biliary obstruction. What Type of Drug Is Ombitasvir?Ombitasvir is a direct-acting antiviral drug that is used to treat hepatitis C. The medication acts as a hepatitis C virus inhibitor and is a dipeptide derivative. It is mostly used as a combination drug containing dasabuvir sodium dihydrate, paritaprevir, and ritonavir under the trade name Viekira Pak, which is FDA-approved. Ombitasvir works by inhibiting the NS5A protein, which helps in the replication of the hepatitis C virus. "}
