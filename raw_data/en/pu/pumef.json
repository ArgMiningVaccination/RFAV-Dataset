It can result from an injury to an organ or tissue such as a torn ligament or muscle, a disease such as arthritis or cancer, or damage to a nerve from injury, aging, disease (like diabetes), compression, or inflammation. Pain can result from a psychological condition. It can also be a disease - not just a symptom -- that can occur when nerve cells are out of whack. Acute Pain vs. Chronic Pain Pain that occurs suddenly and is short-lived - days to weeks -- is called acute pain. Persistent pain that lasts for three to six months or longer is chronic pain. It can come in intermittent waves or be a constant presence. No matter where it occurs in your body, pain can be debilitating, physically and psychologically, especially when the cause is unknown. "}
