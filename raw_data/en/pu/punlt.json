Targeted therapy attacks specific features of cancer cells to stop the cancer growing and spreading. Side effects of immunotherapy and targeted therapy Side effects for these treatments vary depending on the particular drug that is used, but can include swelling, weight gain, fatigue, pain, and depression, all of which may affect your libido or ability to have sex.
