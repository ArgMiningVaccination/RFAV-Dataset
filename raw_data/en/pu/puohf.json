Rightfully so. As the number of vaccines given to children has increased, it appears that children are sicker than ever. Today the major threat to our children is not infectious disease like polio, measles or mumps but chronic illnesses of the immune and nervous system. There are epidemic levels of allergies, asthma, autism, learning disabilities, cancer, diabetes, stuttering, eating disorders, hyperactivity and many other conditions plaguing our children. Most of these conditions were rare or even unknown before mass vaccinations and there is increasing evidence being uncovered that suggests this is not a coincidence. Parents mistakenly assume because a majority of children get vaccinated it must be safe. However, no one can predict if your child will be the one to have an adverse reaction to a vaccine. Perhaps that adverse reaction may come in the form of a sudden crib death or a life plagued by other troubles. For a growing number of parents it's just not worth the gamble. If you are a parent that has decided not to vaccinate your child, you may have some questions as to whether your child will be admitted to school. The State of Florida requires parents whom have made the decision not to vaccinate to present the DH 681 Religious Exemption Form. Religious Exemption DH Form 681 (Religious Exemption From Immunization) are issued by [county health departments](http://www.doh.state.fl.us/chdpasco/map.html). WHAT IS THE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION FORM AND [DO I NEED TO BE A CERTAIN RELIGION TO BE EXCEMPT?](https://kehoechiro.com/vaccine-safety/) [(click here for answers)](https://kehoechiro.com/vaccine-safety/) The freedom to choose one's healthcare should be a right for all people. More importantly, access to the information needed to make an educated decision about your families healthcare should available to all. Sometimes the truth requires a little digging. For some parents the choice not to vaccinate is clear, yet they question if they don't vaccinate their children will they be risking their health in other ways? This is a question with many answers worth exploring. "}
