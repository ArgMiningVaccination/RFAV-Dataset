Question: When choosing healthcare options, have you ever tried any type of alternative or complimentary medicine? If so, share your experience. If not, would you consider doing so in the future? Explain why or why not. Complimentary Treatment: Complimentary treatment is the one that does not hold any scientific evidenced related to treatment, and also, complementary treatment cannot be a standard treatment. It is an integrative approach to medical care along with standard treatment. Answer and Explanation: 1 I have not tried any complementary medicine yet, but yes, I can consider doing so in the future, like naturopathy or Chinese traditional medicine, because these do not have any side effects like allopathic medicines. Chinese traditional medicine; acupuncture, naturopathy; meditation, or yoga are few complementary medicines practised worldwide. Complementary medicines focus on multiple dimensions( physical dimension, social dimension, mental dimension, and spiritual dimension) of human beings and create balance among these dimensions without proposing any side-effect on the human body, as allopathy medicine does. Example- Paracetamol is an allopathy medicine, and its prolonged intake may cause liver disorders. Become a member and unlock all Study Answers Start today.
