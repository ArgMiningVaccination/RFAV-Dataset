We, at Simplify, do feel part of a movement, where we, as individuals, have to take charge of our own health and well-being. This movement is called Integrative Healthcare, where all healthcare providers will come together as a team to complement each other for the well-being of their clients/patients. Integrative Medicine, according to Dr. Andrew Weil, Director of the Integrative Medicine program at the University of Arizona, is \"...based on a physician/patient partnership within which conventional and alternative modalities are used to stimulate the body's natural healing potential. It neither rejects conventional medicine nor uncritically accepts alternative practices.\" Complimentary treatments that have a positive impact on healing and recovery or simply help clients/patients to relax and feel more balanced, are becoming more acknowledged as our responsibility to stay healthy. Exercising and Healthy Eating should be a big part of everybody's lives. Taking time to work out, sitting in the steam room or the sauna, taking time for a massage, going to a yoga or Pilates class or seeing me for a personalized Holistic Nutrition Consultation - are all important pieces of our own Health Puzzle. Adding more healthful food choices, more healthful personal products, and cleaning products to our daily routines changes the way we feel and lessens the toxic load. I do encourage you to take charge of your own health by putting a plan in place to make room in your busy lives for all pieces of the Health Puzzle.
