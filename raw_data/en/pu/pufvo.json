LAI is an Ayurvedic and organic farming internship where interns explore key concepts of Ayurveda while gaining hands-on experience with medicinal herb and vegetable cultivation. LAI is a 10-week intensive program at Banyan Farm in Williams, Oregon, blending together Ayurveda and herbalism in a field-based setting. Our interns walk away from LAI with a better understanding of Ayurveda, a deeper relationship with nature and their own personal health, and the skills to practice bioregional Ayurveda in their own home environments. This program is rigorous: interns need to be prepared physically and mentally to immerse themselves in the program and in community, working, learning, and living alongside other like-minded individuals. Program Sessions and Dates We offer two 10-week internships per year. 2024 Session 1: May 18th-July 25th Session 2: August 3rd-October 10th Tending the Farm Interns spend Monday through Thursday working alongside the Banyan Farm team, at an average of 25 hours each week. There is occasional Saturday work at local farmers' markets. Each day is dynamic, with many opportunities to learn. While incredibly rewarding, this work is demanding. Interns must be in good physical condition and prepared to work in all weather conditions, rain or shine. Farm tasks include: seeding, weeding, harvesting, compost making, washing plant material, working at farmers' markets, CSA gathering, apothecary and dry room maintenance, and general grounds keeping. In the Classroom Classes are offered on weekday evenings and weekends throughout the internship, averaging 10-18 hours of learning time each week. Offerings include: basic Ayurveda training that covers Ayurvedic philosophy, history, and practice; cultivation of Ayurvedic medicinals; astrology; Agnihotra; and much more. This curriculum honors indigenous traditions and builds awareness of movements for the decolonization of Ayurveda and Yoga, as well as the universal needs for social, economic, racial, and food justice. Take a look at our [sample calendar](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/uploads/internship-sample-calendar-2021-s1.pdf). \"This internship is life changing. It's something one needs to experience to understand, and everyone will walk (skip, dance, frolic) away with something really special that colors and informs the rest of their existence. If I could do it all over again, and again, I would in a heartbeat. Everyone who feels called to the LAI program will need to know that it's not easy. You'll be called to step up and be your best self in every situation and interaction.\" About Our Teachers LAI teachers include Ayurvedic practitioners, farmers, herbalists, astrologers, yoga teachers, and regional experts.
