Kooistra1* Microglia are the macrophages of the CNS. They originate in the yolk sac, colonize the CNS during embryonic development and form a self-sustaining population with limited turnover. A consequence of their relative slow turnover is that microglia can serve as a long-term memory for inflammatory or neurodegenerative events. Methods: Using ATAC-, ChIP- and RNA-sequencing, epigenomes and transcriptomes of FACS- purified microglia from mice exposed to different stimuli. A repeated endotoxin challenge (LPS) was used to induce tolerance in microglia, while genotoxic stress (DNA repair deficiency-induced accelerated aging through Ercc1 defi- ciency) resulted in primed (hypersensitive) microglia. Results: Whereas the enrichment of permissive epigenetic marks at enhancer regions could explain training (hyper- responsiveness) of primed microglia to an LPS challenge, the tolerized response of microglia seems to be regulated by loss of permissive epigenetic marks. We identify that inflammatory stimuli and accelerated aging as a result of geno - toxic stress activate distinct gene networks. These gene networks and associated biological processes are partially overlapping, which is likely driven by specific transcription factor networks, resulting in altered epigenetic signatures and distinct functional (desensitized vs. primed) microglia phenotypes. Conclusion: This study provides insight into epigenetic profiles and transcription factor networks associated with transcriptional signatures of tolerized and trained microglia in vivo, leading to a better understanding of innate immune memory of microglia.

IIM describes the concept that macrophages, after expe - riencing a primary 'priming' or 'desensitizing' stimu - lus, react with a stronger (immune training) or weaker (immune tolerance) immune response to a subsequent stimulus [2, 3]. IIM was discovered and has been described in blood-derived monocytes/mac - rophages [4-8]. Similar functional states have been described for microglia in mouse models [2, 9]. Primed microglia can be elicited in mouse prion disease [10], neu [14]. When Open Access Xiaoming Zhang, Laura Kracht and Antonio M. Lerario shared first authors. Bart J.L. Eggen and Susanne M.

Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 these mice experienced a peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, microglia exhibited an excessive immune response manifested by increased expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines, called microglia training [10, 11, 13, 14]. Oppositely, mouse microglia can be desensitized with LPS [15-17]. After a secondary challenge, in the form of LPS [16, 17], traumatic brain injury [15] or cer - ebral ischemia [18], microglia display immune tolerance which is defined by a reduced immune response. Inter - estingly, In vitro studies with primary microglia suggest that the dosage and timing of pathogen exposure is deci - sive for the emergence of immune training or tolerance ([19, 20]). Whether this is also the case in vivo, remains to be determined. Microglia are implicated in CNS development, and neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases [21-27]. It is especially interesting to investigate micro - glia IIM in this context. The combination of perturba - tions like maternal immune activation during vulnerable periods of CNS development together with the occur - rence of multiple stimuli over a long period of time is thought to cause neurodevelopmental or neurodegenera - tive diseases. Microglia are the prime cells that respond to CNS stimuli since they express a wide range of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules (homeostatic gene signature) through which they can sense those endogenous and exogenous stimuli [28-34]. Epidemiologic studies report that infections during specific periods of pregnancy increase the risk for the child to develop neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism or schizophrenia [35]. Mouse models of mater - nal immune activation suggest a role for microglia IIM in this process [2, 36]. Peripheral LPS challenge of pregnant mouse dams caused preconditioning of offspring micro - glia which long-lastingly affects microglia LPS respon - siveness in adult offspring and also caused behavioral abnormalities [16]. In case of neurodegenerative diseases, genetic risk loci are generally immune-related [37, 38] and specifically enriched in microglia [39]. A common gene signature was identified in multiple mouse models of neurode - generative diseases, aging and priming and encompasses genes, Clec7a and Mac2 by the APOE- TREM2 pathway and is associated with altered phago - cytic and lysosomal activity, and lipid metabolism [27, 40-42]. Given the chronic nature of neurodegenerative diseases, it is hypothesized that microglia are trapped in a primed/trained state ultimately leading to neurotoxic - ity [43, 44]. This hypothesis was recently confirmed by the observation that induction of priming of microglia in early adulthood caused exacerbation of A pathol - ogy later in life, whereas desensitization of microglia diminished A pathology in a mouse model of AD [11]. Current studies suggest microglia priming and tolerance [11, 16] or neuroprotective [11, 15, 18] consequences, respectively. However, these outcomes should not be generalized and the effects of microglia tol - erance and priming on neuronal viability need to be elu - cidated in a context-specific manner [2]. Both tolerant and trained immunity of peripheral mac - rophages are long-lasting changes in functionality that are instructed by epigenetic reprogramming [6, 8, 45- 47]. Though epigenetic programming has been clearly implicated in the segregation of microglia from other tis - sue-resident macrophages in both mouse and human [31, 32, 34], little is known about the changes in epigenetic signatures in microglia in response to (systemic) immune stimuli or endogenous neuronal damage and how epige - netic memory serves to change subsequent responses. Since microglia are relatively long-lived cells [48, 49], experience of past stimuli is long-lastingly secured in the microglial epigenome and can thus have persistent con - sequences on microglia functionality and neuronal viabil - ity. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for epigenetic regulation of microglia functional states [11, 17, 22, 41, 50-52]. To delineate the gene networks and associated epige - netic signatures and transcription factors that underlie functional microglia states of priming and tolerance, we acutely isolated microglia from mice challenged with LPS and from accelerated aging mice and analyzed their tran - scriptional and chromatin status at a genome-wide level. Methods Animals Animals were conventionally housed in macrolon cages with open top under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (8 p.m. lights off, 8 a.m. lights on) with ad libitum access to food and water. Climate in the animal facility was controlled and temperature set at 21 \u00b0C. Tolerance induction Male C57BL/6J mice were obtained at the age of 7-9 weeks with weights in the range of 25-30 g (Envigo, Horst, The Netherlands). Upon arrival, a minimum accli - matization time of 2 weeks was ensured, where mice were monitored weekly in terms of general appearance and weight. All animals were housed individually to pre - vent fighting induced wounds and inflammation and ran - domly assigned to experimental conditions. To induce endotoxin tolerance, mice received 1 mg/ kg body weight LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, E. coli 0111:B4, L4391) diluted in dPBS (Lonza, BE17512F) to a total vol - ume of 200 \u00b5L by intraperitoneal injection. Immediately Page 3 of 19 Zhang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 following LPS administration, mice were housed in a recovery cabinet at 26 \u00b0C for 24 h. The weight and gen - eral health of injected animals were monitored daily until the body weight was completely restored (usu - ally within 7 days), and monitoring was continued after recovery at a weekly basis. All control mice received 200 \u00b5L dPBS by intraperitoneal injection. After 4 weeks, the mice received a second injection with either dPBS or LPS (1 mg/kg body weight, diluted in 200 \u00b5L dPBS). Obtaining primed microglia Ercc1 transgenic mice [53] were bred in house by cross - ing Ercc1wt/*292 mice (FVB background, the *292 allele is hereafter indicated with ) with Ercc1wt/ko mice (BL6 background) as previously described [14]. The offspring were genotyped after weaning using the primers listed in Table 1. Ercc1/ko were used as experimental mice while littermates with Ercc1wt/, Ercc1wt/ko or Ercc1wt/wt genotypes were used as control. All the mice were group- housed in conventional cages. Initially, mice were moni - tored weekly, which increased to twice per week after the aging-related symptoms appeared. Accelerated aging in Ercc1 animals was monitored by gradual weight loss during aging and the occurrence of motor abnormalities, including clasping of the hind-limbs when lifted by the tail. Bottles with long drinking spouts were provided to prevent dehydration of Ercc1/ko animals. At 11-12 weeks of age, the mice received 1 mg/kg body weight LPS or dPBS as described above. Immediately following LPS administration, mice were temporarily housed in a recov - ery cabinet at 26 \u00b0C. All animals were killed under deep anesthesia (4% isoflurane with 7.5% O2) and perfused with cold dPBS exactly 3 h after the last injection. Microglia isolation and flow cytometry Microglia were isolated as previously described [54]. After perfusion, brains were removed from the skull and kept in cold medium A (HBSS (Gibco, 14170-088) with 0.6% glucose (Sigma, G8769) and 7.5 mM HEPES (Lonza, BE17-737E)). All subsequent steps were per - formed on ice, centrifugation was at 4 \u00b0C. Brains were dissociated using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue homog - enizer after which the homogenate was passed over a 70 \u00b5M cell strainer (Corning, 352350) and pelleted by centrifugation at 220\u00d7g for 10 min. Next, myelin was removed by resuspending the pellet in 25 mL 24% Per - coll (Fisher, 17-0891-01) in medium A (1 \u00d7 final con - centration) with 3 mL PBS layered on top, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 950\u00d7g (acceleration 4 and brake 0). The microglia enriched cell pellets were incu for 30 min on ice. Then the cells were washed once in medium A without phenol red and fil - tered into FACS tubes. Microglia were sorted by gat - ing the DAPInegCD11bhighCD45intLy6cneg cells using the Beckman Coulter MoFlo (Sigma, T3406- 250EA) containing medium A. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo Analysis Software. RNA isolation and RNA sequencing Total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74004) according to the manufacturer's - tions. For every sample, we sorted 50.000 microglia into a separate tube for qPCR validation of an inflammatory response and collected the remaining microglia (usu - ally 200.000-300.000 microglia per brain from wt ani - mals and 150.000-200.000 for Ercc1/ko animals) into another tube for RNA-seq. Quantification of the RNA showed the concentration of isolated RNA for sequenc - ing was on average 3 ng/ul. Endotoxin tolerance The quality of the total RNA was determined using an Experion (Biorad). All included samples had an RNA quality indicator > 6. Sequencing libraries were generated with a TruSeq RNA library prep kit (Illumina, RS-122- 2001). Pooled libraries were sequenced with a HiSeq Rapid SBS kit (50 cycles, Illumina, FC-402-4022) using single reads on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). Priming/Ercc1 knockout The quality of total RNA samples isolated from Ercc1/ ko mice was determined on a LabchipGX (PerkinElmer). All included samples had an RNA quality score > 5.

RNAsequencing analysis Samples (n = 3 per condition) were processed using our in-house pipeline, where quality control was performed with FastQC (v0.11.8). Adapter sequences were removed with genome Mus muscu - lus (GRCm38.82) was used for alignment (STAR v2.7.3a, [55]). Sorting of the aligned reads was done with bamsort tool from biobambam2 tools (v2.0.95). featureCounts (v2.0.0, reads. Picard (v1.130, [57]) and samtools were used to perform the quality control check and the generation of the fastq files. Downstream analyses were performed using R/Biocon - ductor packages (v.3.11), as briefly summarized. Specific functions from EdgeR (v3.30.3, [58]) were used for data normalization and calculation of rpkm expression values. Log2-CPM values and mean-variance relationship were calculated the voom WithQualityWeights function from limma (v3.44.3, [59]). removed using sva (v3.36.0, [60]). Differ - ential expression analysis was performed using limma. Annotation was performed with biomaRt [61]. For plot - ting purposes, genes with a logFC > 1 and FDR < 0.01 were considered differentially expressed. Clustering analysis was performed using the ward.D2 clustering method and Manhattan distance as cluster - ing metrics. Heat maps were assembled using the pheat - map package (v1.0.12, [62]). The optimal number of gene clusters was estimated upon visual inspection of the heat maps. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the gene clusters was performed with the 'enrichGO' function of the clusterProfiler package (v3.16.1, [63]). PCA plots, scatterplots and dotplots were made with the package ggplot2 (v3.3.2, [64]) and standard plot functions from R. To visualize the overlap of differentially expressed genes of different comparisons (Additional file 2: Fig. S2E), gene lists of the indicated comparisons were ranked based on expression level. Following, percentiles were assigned to the ranked genes and percentiles were cal - culated by subtracting percentiles of each gene from the two indicated comparisons. The results were depicted in a volcano plot, where the dots are differential expressed genes (logF > 1, FDR < 0.01) in the indicated comparison and the color of the dots shows overlap of gene expres - sion levels from the two indicated comparisons. For the Venn diagram in Fig. 5a, only upregulated genes of the PL versus PP , KO-PBS versus WT-PBS and KO-LPs versus WT-LPS differential gene lists (Addi - tional files 5, 6) and genes of cluster 2 and 4 of the toler - ance moue model (Additional file 7) were use. The Venn diagram was made with the 'venn' function of the gplots package (v3.1.0 [65]). ChIPsequencing The procedure of chromatin immunoprecipitation has been described previously [17]. Sorted microglia were fixed in 1 mL 1% formaldehyde diluted in dPBS at 20 \u00b0C for 10 min and fixation was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M glycine. Fixed cells were washed twice by 1 mL cold dPBS, and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (5 mM Pipes, pH 8.0; 85 mM KCl; 0.5% NP-40) by incubating on ice for 10 min. At the end, the cells were lysed in 250 \u00b5L nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.1; 10 mM EDTA, 8.0; cated using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) at \"high\" power for 20 min (30 s on and 30 s off, for 20 cycles) at 4 \u00b0C. Chromatin from animals within the same treatment group was pooled (5 animals per pool) and precleared using protein A agarose beads (25%, diluted in DNA, Millipore, 16-157). Following preclearing, chromatin was distributed over separate tubes for incubation with antibodies. Chromatin corresponding to approximately 200.000 microglia per ChIP was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C (final buffer composition during antibody incuba - tion 150 mM NaCl) with antibodies for specific histone modifications (the information of anti - bodies is available in Table 2, the specificity of antibodies have been checked for H3K27me3 peptides, the infor - mation of these peptides is listed in Table 2). The chro - matin incubated with IgG was used as negative control while the chromatin saved without antibody incubation Table 2 Antibodies used for ChIP Antibody Supplier Full name cat # lot # 17-622 2325081Page 5 of 19 Zhang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 served as input. The next day, immune complexes were precipitated with 80 \u00b5L protein A beads (25%) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, washed by low salt wash buffer (150 mM NaCl; 0.1% SDS; 1% mM Tris. HCl, pH 8.1), high wash buffer (500 mM 0.1% SDS; 1% 1% Na-deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM pH 8.1), and TE (10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). After the chromatin was eluted from the beads, the precipitated chromatin was overnight 65 \u00b0C. RNase A (ThermoFisher, EN0531) and Proteinase K (Sigma, P2308) were added. Finally, the DNA was purified by GeneJET PCR purification kit (ThermoFisher, k0701). Sequencing libraries were generated from the puri - fied DNA by MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit 12 (Diagenode, C05010010) Kit v2 \u00d7 12 (Diagenode, C05010012) in case of primed samples. The libraries were quantified by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, pooled and sequenced with a HiSeq Rapid SBS kit (50 cycles, Illu - mina, FC-402-4022) single reads on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). ATACsequencing ATAC-sequencing libraries were generated using Nextera\u00ae DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, FC-121-1030) following the methods described by [66, 67]. A total number of 80,000 microglia were pooled from two animals (40,000 cells from each) and collected in Eppendorf tubes containing 300 \u00b5L medium A. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 4 \u00b0C, 500\u00d7g), resuspended in 50 L of cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and immediately centrifuged as before. Next, nuclei were resuspended in 50 L transposition reaction mix (1 \u00d7 TD reaction buffer, 2.5 L TN5 transposase) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Immediately follow - ing transposition, the DNA was purified using a min - Elute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, 28004) following the manufacturer's instructions. The transposed DNA ments were further amplified and barcoded [66, 67] and purified with a ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo, D5205). The fragments were run on 2% EX agarose gels (Thermo Fisher scientific, G521802) and bp fragments were excised, followed by purifi - cation with Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo, D4007). Library concentration was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer after which 8 samples were pooled and sequenced using HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (50 cycles) using paired end reads on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina).ChIP and ATACsequencing analysis ATAC and ChIP samples were aligned to the Mus mus - culus genome (mm10/GRCm38) with the use of Bowtie very-sensitive flag. Bamsort and bammarkduplicates from biobambam2 tools (v2.0.95) were used to sort the aligned files and to remove dupli - cated reads. Samtools (v.1.1.0, [69]) was used to remove low quality (q < 30) and blacklisted alignments. For Chip- seq data, peak calling was performed using the JetBrains SPAN peak analyzer (v.0.11.0) using default parameters, which were later manually refined upon visual inspection using the JetBrains JBR browser (v.1.0 beta) on each sam - ple. BigWig files were generated using deepTools bam - Coverage (v.3.5.0) with RPGC normalization. ATAC-seq using Genrich (v.0.5) with the ATAC- seq mode (-j switch), and -p parameter set to 0.01. Dif - ferential peak calling for ChIP- and ATAC-seq were performed with manorm (v.1.3.0, [70]). The annotation of differential peaks was performed with the annotate - Peaks function from R/Bioconductor ChIPseeker pack - age (v1.24.0, [71]). Analysis of differential transcription factor binding sites accessibility and classification of transcription fac - tors into activators, repressors or undetermined was per - formed with the diffTF package (v1.7.1, [72]) based on ATAC- and RNA-seq data. ChIP- and ATAC-seq peaks are visualized with the Jet - Brains SPAN peak analyzer. The heatmap in Fig. 5c is based on the diffTF output in Supplemental file 6 & 8. The row z-score was calcu - lated from weighted mean differences of ATAC peaks from the indicated comparison. Following, in each com - parison non-significant differential peaks (adjusted P value > 0.001) and TF classified as 'not-expressed' were omitted. The row z-scores of significant differential acces - sible regions (adjusted P value > 0.001) of putative tran - scriptional activators, repressors and undetermined are visualized in a heatmap assembled with the 'Heatmap' function of the ComplexHeatmap package (v2.4.3 [73]). Results LPS desensitization and accelerated aging result in distinct transcriptional responses in microglia In mouse, previous data indicated two distinct micro - glia functional states of 'desensitization' induced by an intraperitoneal LPS challenge [17] and 'priming' dur - ing accelerated aging resulting from deficiency of the DNA-damage repair protein Ercc1 [14]. These differ - ent functional states can be unmasked by a (secondary) LPS stimulus resulting in a 'tolerant' or 'trained' immune response, respectively, and were so far characterized based on the analysis of limited sets of genes by qPCR [14, 17]. For several tested inflammatory genes, such as Page 6 of 19 Zhang et al.

Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 Il1b, Tnf, and Il6 , the initial stimulus determined whether microglia show a dampened or enhanced response to (secondary) LPS treatment. However, the genome-wide transcriptional remodeling in desensitized and primed microglia and its effect on responsiveness to future inflammatory exposure are unknown. Therefore, we per - formed RNA-sequencing on acutely isolated, FACS-puri - fied microglia (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) from mice that were either recurrently treated with LPS with a 1-month interval, or from Ercc1/ko mice that were stimulated with LPS near the end of their lifespan at 10-12 weeks of age (Fig. 1A). For the tolerance model, we analyzed four treatment groups: the controls that were treated with PBS twice (PP), mice that were treated with LPS and after 1 month with PBS (LP) to investigate desensitization, mice treated with PBS followed by LPS after 1 month to determine the acute response to LPS (PL) and mice that were treated with LPS twice with a 1-month interval between chal - lenges (LL) to identify the tolerant response (Fig. 1A). As has been previously described, after LPS injection, the animals experienced temporal peripheral inflammation, sickness behavior and weight-loss due to decreased food and water intake [74] (Additional file 2: Fig. S2A, S2B). I.p. injection of LPS resulted in significant changes in gene expression in microglia after 3 h (Fig. 1B, D; Addi - tional file 2: Fig. S2C, Additional file 5). After 1 month, this initial response to LPS had subsided and in terms of the transcriptional program, no significant differences were observed between the PP and LP groups (Fig. 1D; Additional file 2: Fig. S2C, Additional file 5). However, when mice were challenged with LPS for a second time, the response was different from the initial response (Additional file 2: Fig. S2C) and many genes were signifi - cantly differentially expressed between PL and LL condi - tions (Fig. 1B, D; Additional file 5). For the microglia priming model, both the Ercc1/ ko mice and their control littermates were treated with PBS (WT-PBS, KO-PBS) to identify priming effects or with LPS (WT-LPS, KO-LPS) to identify training. As we observed previously, deletion of Ercc1 in itself results in significant changes in gene expression (Fig. 1E; Addi - tional file 2: Fig. S2D, Additional file 6). However, when Ercc1/ko mice were treated with LPS, the difference between microglia from control and knockout mice was much more pronounced (Fig. 1B, E; Additional file 2: Fig. S2D, Additional file 5). The response to an acute LPS stimulus was highly similar in mice of the tolerance (C57BL/6J) and priming (FVB/C57BL/6J) model. Nevertheless, it cannot be fully excluded that the LPS response is slightly affected by the genetic backgrounds of the two mouse strains used in this study.Many genes differentially expressed between PP ver - sus LP and WT-PBS versus WT-LPS showed very similar changes in expression in response to LPS, after rank - ing them based on expression level and comparing rank positions between the two groups (Additional file 2: Fig. S2E). With our RNA-sequencing dataset, we confirmed several of our previous findings [14, 27], and replenish this information with complete gene expression profiles of the desensitized and primed microglia phenotype. The opposite regulation of the pro-inflammatory genes Il1b in tolerant (LL) and trained (KO-LPS) microglia (Additional file 2: Fig. S2F, S2G) was confirmed. In addition, primed microglia (KO-PBS) showed increased expression of genes belonging to the 'primed' gene hub [27], including Clec7a and Axl when compared to control animals (WT- PBS, Additional file 2: Fig. S2G). Genes with distinct transcriptional responses to LPS have different biological functions Following 3 h of LPS exposure (PL versus PP , LogFC > 1, FDR < 0.01), 1489 genes showed increased expression (Figs. 1D, 2A) while 1474 genes were downregulated in microglia (Fig. 1D; Additional file 3: S3A). Generally, LPS-induced genes were involved in various aspects of the immune response (Additional file 3: Fig. S3B, Addi - tional file 7), while genes downregulated by LPS were involved in multiple biological processes (Additional file 3: Fig. S3C, Additional file 7). Of note, in the LPS- downregulated genes, the association with biological processes showed a lower level of significance than the GO terms associated with LPS-upregulated genes (Addi - tional file 3: Fig. S3B, S3C; Additional file 7). Focusing on LPS-induced genes, out of 1489 genes, 1187 responded similarly in case of re-stimulation with LPS (cluster 1 and 3), while 302 showed a reduced response to a second LPS challenge (cluster 2 and 4, Fig. 2A). Processes uniquely associated with the 1187 responsive response' and 'response to bacterium' were particularly associated with the 302 tolerized genes (Fig. 2C, Additional file 7). This is in line with the finding that tolerant monocytes/ macrophages are impaired in their ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines [6, 75], but are capable of expressing genes involved in damaging or killing patho - gens, so-called antimicrobial effectors. These data sug - gest that an i.p. injection with LPS initially induces a major immune response in microglia, which then results in the establishment of long-term innate immune toler - ance that is characterized by a significantly reduced tran - scriptional response to secondary LPS treatment.Page 8 of 19 Zhang et al.

Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 genes that were altered by Ercc1 deletion (KO). Genes of clusters 5 are similarly affected in WT and KO microglia and downregulated in both genotypes after LPS treat - ment. GO terms associated with these genes included 'regulation of cell cycle phase transition' , and 'pattern specification process' . The expression of genes in cluster 7 are induced in KO compared to WT microglia and are depleted in both conditions after LPS treatment. These genes are involved in processes like 'nuclear division' , 'cell division' tain genes are upregulated in microglia of PBS- and LPS-treated WT compared to KO mice. These genes are associated with 'cell junction organization' and 'cell-cell adhesion' . Cluster 3 contains genes that were induced in PBS- treated and to a greater extent in LPS-treated KO compared to WT microglia. These primed genes are associated with GO defense . Cluster 2 contains genes that were induced by LPS in KO and to a lesser extent in WT microglia and these genes were associated with GO terms such as 'response to bacterium' trained response of KO microglia to LPS chal - lenge. Cluster 4 contains genes that were induced by LPS in WT and to a lesser extent in KO microglia and these genes were associated with GO terms such as 'trans- synaptic signaling, 'chemical synaptic transmission' and 'nervous system process' . Finally, genes in cluster 1 are induced by LPS to a similar degree in WT and KO micro - glia and are associated with GO terms, like In agreement with our previous findings [14], also at a genome-wide level, Ercc1 deficiency generates an environment where microglia are more responsive to inflammatory stimuli, as evidenced by a large set of inflammatory genes whose expression is significantly increased in microglia upon LPS treatment of Ercc1/ko mice. Epigenetic remodeling in response to LPS desensitization and accelerated aging The transcriptomes of microglia from PP and LP treated mice are almost identical, however, they respond very differently to re-stimulation with LPS (Fig. 2A; Addi - tional file 2: Fig. S2C). Similarly, many genes that are not transcriptionally altered in Ercc1 deficient mice show an increased transcriptional response to LPS (Fig. 2B; Addi - tional file 2: Fig. S2D). These data suggest that micro - glia have innate immune memory that is not secured in their transcriptome. Rather, similar to macrophages and as suggested by our previous analysis of the Il1 locus (Schaafsma et al. [17]), it is likely that epigenetic repro - gramming is involved. To gain insight in the genome-wide epigenetic changes induced by LPS desensitization and Ercc1 performed assay for which posttranslational modifications [76, 77]. In case of the tolerance model, we used antibodies targeting H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers of actively transcribed genes, respectively. In Ercc1/ko mice, we also analyzed H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and addi - tionally H3K4me1 which together with H3K27ac marks active enhancers and the Polycomb-regulated H3K27me3 associated with transcriptional repression (Additional file 4: Fig. S4A). Representative examples of chromatin accessibility and occupation, and RNA of individual tolerized (Il1b, Tnf, Ccl3, Nfkb1 and Relb, Additional file and primed/trained (Il1b, Clec7a and Axl, 2: Fig. S2F, Additional file 4: Fig. S4C) genes are depicted and indi - cate dynamic regulation of epigenetic signatures associ - ated with changes in gene expression levels. Epigenetic characterization of tolerized genes In order to determine which chromatin characteristics correspond to the transcriptional changes induced by LPS, we identified regions in the genome with significant differences in chromatin accessibility or histone modi - fications. Differential peaks were classified as promot - ers when they were located within 1000 bp downstream and 1000 bp upstream of a TSS of the nearest gene and as enhancers when being located distal of this region. To integrate RNA-, ATAC-, and ChIP-seq data, the differen - to differen - tially regulated chromatin regions (M-value) within one comparison. Similar to what has been described in macrophages [5, 78, 79], in microglia H3K4me3 already marks TLR4- responsive promoters prior to LPS stimulation (Addi - tional file 4: Fig. S4B). Irrespective whether microglia are exposed to LPS for the first or the second time, genes which are expressed in response to LPS are, except for a small group of tolerized genes, largely overlap - ping (Fig. 2A). LPS-induced gene expression signifi - cantly correlates with ATAC, H3K4me3, H3K27Ac peak enrichment, associated with permissive gene expres - sion, in promotors and enhancers of microglia from PL Page 10 of 19 Zhang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 compared to PP (Fig. 3A left panel, Additional file 9) and LL compared to LP-treated mice (Fig. 3A middle panel, Additional file 9). In line with the fact that H3K4me3 is generally associated with promoters, LPS-induced gene expression seems to only significantly correlate with enrichment of this mark in promoters but not enhancers in the PL versus PP comparison (Fig. 3A left panel, Addi - tional file 9). Tolerized genes are characterized by increased expres - sion after the primary LPS challenge (PL) and reduced induction after the secondary LPS challenge (LL) (Fig. 2A). When comparing the microglia response to primary and secondary LPS challenge (PL versus LL), the expression of the tolerant genes after primary LPS chal - lenge significantly correlated with enrichment of ATAC and H3K27ac peaks at enhancers, but not promoters (Fig. 3A right panel, Additional file 9). This means vice versa that after secondary LPS challenge, tolerized genes were depleted in these activating expression-associated enhancer marks. The expression of tolerized genes was not significantly correlated to the promoter-associated histone mark H3K4me3. Together, these results indicate Fig. 3 The LPS response in naive and desensitized microglia is defined by enhancer signatures of transcriptional permissive marks. a Scatterplots depicting the correlation of differentially expressed genes (logFC) with corresponding differential ATAC, H3K4me3 or H3K27ac peaks (M-value) at promoters (within 2 kb of the nearest TSS) or enhancers (distal to promoters) between PL versus PP (left panel), LL versus LP (middle panel), PL versus LL (right panel).

Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 that the tolerized response of microglia to LPS seems to be mainly enhancer driven and, at least partially, explained by a loss of histone marks associated with active expression after secondary LPS challenge (Fig. 3 right panel, Additional file 9). Transcription factors (TFs) are critical determinants of changes in both transcriptional and epigenetic programs that can be activated by signaling pathways. TFs are often part of large, multimeric protein complexes that also contain chromatin-modifying enzymes, and recruitment of TFs can result in local remodeling of the chromatin [80]. DiffTF was used to identify the TFs that might be involved in the differential chromatin regulation in toler - ant microglia. Differential chromatin accessibility peaks (weighted mean difference) of putative TF binding sites (TFBS) between two conditions were identified. Next, this ATAC-seq data were integrated with RNA-seq data by correlating differential accessible peaks of putative TFBS to differential gene expression levels of a particular TF. This procedure is then repeated for each TF. Based on whether the correlation of TF activity and expression is positive or negative, TFs were classified as an activator or a repressor. Alternatively, when there was no correla - tion detected, the TF was classified as undetermined or the TF was not expressed (Berest et al. [72], Fig. 3B-D). Fig. 3B; Addi - tional file sites for the key myeloid TFs PU.1 (SPI1), IRF8 and MAFB, described microglia transcriptional identity [22, 81]. In addition, SMAD3, an effector molecule downstream of TGF [82], which is critical for the microglia homeostatic sig - nature [29]. Binding sites of homeostasis-associated were lost and TFBS known early response JUN, JUNB, FOSL2) and the interferon pathway (IRF TF family), STAT3, CEBPB [85-87], and the general activating transcription factor ATF1 were all detected to be enriched in microglia acutely challenged with LPS (PL versus PP , Fig. 3B; Additional file 10). After a secondary LPS challenge, in tolerant microglia (LL vs. LP), many of these inflammatory-associated TFBS are still enriched, except those belonging to the NF-B TF family, indicating that recruitment of these TFs spe - cifically occurs after primary LPS challenge. This is also confirmed in the direct comparison of acutely stimulated versus tolerant microglia (PL vs. LL, Fig. 3D; Additional file 10). Furthermore, the enrichment of TFBS for SPI1, IRF8, micro - glia (LP vs. LL, Fig. 3C; Additional file 10) explains their naive-like transcriptome (Fig. 1D). Many of the inflammatory-associated putative depleted and the TFBS for the transcriptional repres - sor ZEB1, associated with suppression of immune active genes [88, 89], are enriched in tolerant microglia (LL) when compared to microglia of acutely LPS-challenged mice (PL, Fig. 3D; Additional file 10), possibly explain - ing the dampened expression of tolerized genes in LL microglia. These data indicate that deposition of permissive chro - matin marks drive the acute LPS-response of microglia, and loss of those, in particular surrounding TFBS of the NF-B family, might at least partially explain the toler - ized response of microglia to a secondary LPS-challenge. Epigenetic characterization of the priming response In case of microglia priming, we also observed a general concordance between the transcriptional changes fol - lowing Ercc1 deficiency and LPS challenge and the pres - ence of permissive chromatin characteristics. Induction of gene expression by Ercc1 KO or by LPS in both WT and KO microglia significantly correlated with increased chromatin accessibility in promoters as well as enhancers (Fig. 4A; Additional files 6, 11). In addition, compared to WT-PBS, many KO-induced genes are marked with sig - nificant enrichment of the permissive marks H3K27Ac Fig. 4 Enhancer and promoter signatures of transcriptional permissive marks regulate training in primed microglia. a, b Scatterplots depicting the correlation of differentially expressed genes (logFC) with corresponding differential ATAC peaks (M-value) differential H3K4me1, H3K4me3, or H3K27me3 in KO versus WT microglia (b).

The expression of some of the KO-induced genes additionally correlates with H3K4me1 enrichment, which together with H3K27ac deposition is associated with active transcription [90]. Inversely, some of the genes whose expression is induced by Ercc1 deficiency are depleted in H3K27me3, which is associ - ated with Polycomb-associated gene repression, at pro - moters of microglia from KO versus WT mice (Fig. 4B). Together, this indicates that the expression of primed genes in Ercc1 deficient mice might be driven by enriched chromatin characteristics associated with permissive transcription and depletion of repressive chromatin marks. We next determined accessible conserved TFBS and corresponding expression of the TFs in microglia of (LPS-treated) Ercc1 deficient and WT mice. Compared to controls, SMAD1/3/4 binding sites are lost in micro - glia of KO mice (Fig. 4C; Additional file 12), which are involved in maintenance of the microglia homeostatic gene signature [29, 82]. Generally, immune activation of microglia results in the loss of the homeostatic signature [27, 40, 41, 91], and our data show that this is also true APL vs. PP LL vs. PL KO vs. IRF5PO2F2PO2F1YBOX 1SP3SP1.SETS1SP4STAT2EGR3JUNBFOSL2JUNDRELNFKB1RELBNFKB2IRF2IRF7IRF3IRF1ZEB1HMGA1IRF8SPI1MAFB zscore 210 genes LL (tolerized genes)KO-PBS vs. WT-PBS (primed genes ) KO-LPS genes) 10060 264 249145 55 630 0251 8 46 630 103 response to oxidative stress cellular response to oxidative stressribosomal small subunit assemblyorganelle fission nuclear division mitotic cell cycle phase transition chromosome segregation cell cycle phase transition adapt. immune resp. based on somatic recomb. of immune receptors built from immunoglobin superfamily domains lymphocyte-mediated immunity positive regulation of cytokine production positive regulation of immune ef fector process regulation of immune ef fector process regulation of response to biotic stimulus regulation of innate immune response I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling homeostasis of number of cell s extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway trained 249 genesprimed 264 genes primed+trained251 genes acute+tolerized+trained 46 genesCount acute 1006 genespattern recognition receptor pathwayB Fig. 5 Inflammatory a Venn the enriched genes in acute (PL versus PP , light purple, Additional file 5), tolerized (clusters 2 and 4, dark purple, Additional file 7), primed (KO-PBS versus WT-PBS, mint, Additional file 6) and trained (KO-LPS versus WT-LPS, dark mint, Additional file 6) microglial response. b Dotplot depicting the GO terms associated with unique and overlapping gene sets of acute, tolerant, primed and trained microglia.

Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 in primed chromatin accessibility upon Ercc1 deletion include TFs whose associated functions were previously attributed primed family, [93, 94]) (Fig. 4C; file 12). contrast to microglia of LPS-treated WT mice, trained microglia of LPS-treated KO mice are enriched in accessible TF motifs for regulators with known roles in acute LPS-induced inflammation [27, 78, 83], includ - ing NFKB2 several members of IRF TF family (IRF7, 8, 9), and IER-related TFs. In addition, ZEB1, associated with immune response suppression [88, 89], is depleted in trained microglia (Fig. 4D; Addi - tional file 12). Together with the fact that homeostatic genes in microglia of LPS-treated KO mice are even fur - ther downregulated than in KO microglia (Fig. 4E), these results underline the training of microglia from KO mice. These data suggest that Ercc1 depletion shapes a chromatin landscape that enables both the loss of the microglia homeostatic signature, and the gain of a tran - scriptional profile associated with inflammation, which is enhanced with LPS challenge. A large proportion of tolerized genes show an increased transcriptional response in primed and trained microglia Both in tolerized (cluster 2 and 4, Fig. 2A) and primed/ trained gene sets (cluster 1, 2 and 4, Fig. 2B), immune system processes were significantly enriched (Fig. 2C, D). We intersected these gene sets and not only were similar biological processes affected, but many of the differen - tially regulated genes were also shared. Out of the 302 tolerized genes, 145 genes overlap with acute LPS response-induced genes and 46 showed a sig - nificantly higher expression level in microglia of LPS- treated mice and Ercc1/ko mice after LPS treatment. 264 and 249 genes were uniquely enriched in primed (KO- PBS versus WT-PBS) and trained (KO-LPS versus WT- LPS) microglia, respectively, and 251 genes overlapped between these conditions. Finally, 103 overlapping genes were enriched in acutely challenged, tolerized, primed as well as trained microglia (Fig. 5A; Additional file 13). Significantly associated biological processes within these gene sets were identified (Fig. 5B; Additional file 14). Genes involved in 'organelle fission' , 'nuclear division' and 'chromosome segregation' and limited to primed microglia from Ercc1 deficient mice. The genes exclusive for training are involved in 'response to oxidative stress' and 'ribosomal small subunit assem - bly' . The 251 genes that are shared between primed and trained microglia are associated with 'positive regula - process' . The acute, tolerized and trained gene sets, with or without the primed gene set, share GO terms such as 'regulation of innate immune response' , 'NF-kappaB apoptotic signal - ing pathway' . In order to determine possible regulators of the oppos - ing LPS response between tolerized and trained genes, motifs for TFBS in genomic regions with enriched chro - matin accessibility were identified with diffTF in acute (PL versus PP), tolerant (LL versus PL), primed (KO-PBS versus WT-PBS) and trained (KO-LPS versus WT-LPS) microglia (Fig. 5C; Additional 10, four iden - tified microglial phenotypes (acute, tolerized, primed, trained) seem to be regulated by specific TF networks, explaining why gene sets, although being partially shared between some or all of the four phenotypes, are regulated in opposite directions. Summarizing, the presented data indicate that micro - glia in vivo possess innate immune memory and that dif - ferent types of stimuli, in this case Ercc1 deficiency or LPS, can leave epigenetic imprints which seem to influ - ence the response towards a secondary challenge leading to microglia training or tolerance to LPS. Condition- specific epigenetic profiles seem to involve the activity of specific TF networks, which might drive the oppo - site regulation of shared genes in trained and tolerant microglia. Discussion Monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages play impor - tant roles in development, metabolism and immunity, thereby contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis. Though they are innate immune cells, macrophages can retain information of past inflammatory events, result - ing in an altered response to reinfection. Depending on the primary trigger, macrophages can become 'tolerant' , showing hypo-responsiveness, or 'trained' with increased responsiveness to subsequent stimuli. Biologically, these mechanisms are generally thought to provide a survival advantage in case of trained immunity [95], while the refractory state of tolerant macrophages causes increased mortality [4]. However, these effects seem to be context- dependent and it was hypothesized that trained immu - nity might have deleterious consequences in autoimmune diseases (Arts, Joosten, et al. [96]), whereas tolerance can provide a protective mechanism limiting the toxic effects of prolonged inflammation [97]. Monocytes/macrophages undergo functional program - ming after exposure to microbial components [6, 8] and the associated genome-wide epigenetic characteristics of innate immune memory have been described over the past years [5, 6, 98-100]. These observations are thought Page 15 of 19 Zhang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 to provide clues as to which pathways to target to reverse 'tolerance' or stimulate 'training' in a clinical setting. The CNS parenchyma contains microglia, tissue-resi - dent macrophages that fulfill highly specialized functions extending far beyond their innate immunological func - tions [9, 101]. Besides their different job-description that is attuned to their CNS environment, in contrast to some other tissue-derived macrophages, microglia also have a relatively long lifespan [48, 49, 101, 102]. Microglia lon - gevity together with the long-lasting nature of epigenetic mechanisms can have drastic effects on brain functioning and cognition. In microglia, altered functional outcomes reminiscent of 'tolerance' and 'training' have been described and these mechanisms might contribute to poor cognitive outcomes in sepsis patients [103], the general aged pop - ulation and neurodegeneration [2, 11, 36, 44, 104, 105]. Particularly, disease features in mouse AD and stroke models appear to be altered in animals where microglia were exposed to systemic inflammatory stimuli [11]. Many factors influence the extent to which a periph - eral LPS injection induces a response in CNS resident macrophages, including microglia. These include the dose of LPS [106] the time between the LPS administra - tion and analysis [107], the measured output parameter (morphological changes take more time to take shape compared to changes in RNA expression) and ambient temperature [108]. Here, we show that under our experi - mental conditions, exposure of microglia to an inflam - matory challenge (LPS) or an environment of accelerated aging in vivo results in substantial transcriptional and epigenetic changes that impact on their future ability to mount an inflammatory response. In particular, we found that approximately 103 genes are oppositely regulated when 'desensitized' or 'primed' microglia are exposed to i.p. injection of LPS and that these genes are involved in inflammatory and apoptotic processes. In the control situation, promoter and cis-regulatory elements associated with these inflammatory genes are characterized by a certain degree of chromatin acces - sibility, as well as H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac enrichment. In agreement with increased transcription of inflamma - tory genes in microglia from mice treated with LPS, these chromatin parameters were increased during the acute response. In case of tolerance, abundance of these marks is decreased after LPS re-exposure, which, at least par - tially, explains compromised induction of gene expression after secondary LPS challenge. Possibly, there is a second layer of gene expression repression by inhibitory histone marks. Previous data suggest a role for the inhibitory his - tone marks H3K9me2/3 in this context [17, 99]. The TF RELB has a recruiting role for H3K9me2/3 at the Il1 locus after LPS challenge, which leads to transcriptional repression of Il1 in response to a secondary LPS chal - lenge [17, 45]. We identified enriched accessible bind - ing motifs for REL and RELB in PL versus LL microglia genome-wide, indicating that a primary LPS challenge might lead to recruitment of REL/RELB at regulatory ele - ments of tolerized genes and might inhibit gene expres - sion upon secondary LPS challenge through recruitment of H3K9me2/3. However, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed in future ChIP-sequencing experiments. In case of priming, gene sets involved in the immune response and cell division were enriched in Ercc1/ko microglia as well as after an LPS exposure. This data is substantiated by earlier findings showing an increase in the number of Ki67-positive Iba1 microglia in Ercc1/ko mice activity - tion reactive oxygen species of LPS-challenged Ercc1/ ko microglia [14]. Next to gene expression changes, the continuous exposure to an aging environment results in increased chromatin accessibility as well as H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac enrichment. SMAD binding elements are known to act collaboratively with PU.1 and other TFs to facilitate transcription of the homeostatic microglia signature [109]. In the accelerated aging model, chro - matin signatures associated with active gene expression are less associated with SMAD binding elements. This is accompanied by a decrease in expression of homeo - static microglia signature genes in Ercc1/ko microglia, especially following LPS treatment. Microglia priming in this model is caused by neuronal genotoxic stress, since only Ercc1 deficiency in neurons, astrocytes and microglia induced microglia priming [14, 110]. While active marks on promoters and enhancers correlate with increased expression, the Polycomb regulated repressive mark H3K27me3 is lost in some associated genes whose expression is increased in Ercc1/ko microglia. Loss of the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 could be a critical determi - nant of cellular identity and function of primed microglia as the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in maintenance of homeostatic microglia identity in dif - ferent CNS brain regions. Loss of PRC2 activity in micro - glia resulted in aberrant gene expression and altered functionality [111]. Microglia training was previously observed in an AD amyloid mouse model, where an LPS challenge admin - istered prior to the onset of AD pathology caused exacerbation of -amyloidosis [11]. Although the hyper- responsive nature of microglia to two stimuli seems to be comparable in these two studies, the underlying molec - ular mechanisms might be different due to the fact that the LPS stimulus and AD pathology were separated by a non-inflammatory phase [11], while persistent microglial activation is present in Ercc1/ko mice.Page 16 of 19 Zhang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2022) 19:111 Though the genes involved in tolerance and training are overlapping, the fact that the chromatin composi - tion in these regions is diverse, suggests the involvement of distinct protein complexes and epigenetic enzymes. Summarizing, different molecular pathways and different epigenetic mechanisms regulate the behavior of inflam - matory genes in 'tolerant' or 'trained' microglia. Conclusion Our data provide evidence that at least one type of mac - rophage, the CNS endogenous microglia, in vivo can adopt transcriptional and epigenetic programs that con - tribute to the establishment of different functional phe - notypes and thereby influence neuroinflammation in the long term.
