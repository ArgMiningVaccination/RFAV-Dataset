In India, yoga is a science that has been practiced for thousands of years and aims to master the body, mind and soul and live a life of harmony and peace. Imagine having a perfectly healthy body and mind, both functioning at their optimal capacity - no sickness, no disease, no stress - that's what yoga can do for any human being at any stage of life. According to yoga, health is not just a mere absence of disease, but a positive feeling of well-being in the mind, the body and the soul. The literal translation of yoga is - harmony of body, mind & soul, harmony in relationships with others and harmony with the entire Universe. What is this program all about? Ayurveda Yoga Villa offers you this program to take your yoga practice a step beyond the physical exercise. We have a resident yoga master who is highly experienced in the monastic traditions of yoga.
