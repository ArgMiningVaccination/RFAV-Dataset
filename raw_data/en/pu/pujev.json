More programs like this can empower young people to make better health choices for themselves. This addresses the issues of food deserts that plague the poorer communities. In our world of constant change, and with life moving faster than ever, topics such as mental health, self-care, and prevention have become popular buzzwords. People are looking to live healthier lives, and there is superb care out there that is being offered. At the same time, there are misconceptions about the meaning of self-care and exercise. Many opt for quick solutions \u2014 surgery, pills \u2014 to dull the problem without adequately addressing the underlying cause. Meanwhile, many parts of the industry are unregulated and oversaturated. People with years of training are competing with people with weekend training. Many providers are overworked, overwhelmed, and underpaid. The general public is not educated about asking the right questions when selecting a wellness provider. In the face of all this, what can be done to correct the status quo? In this interview series, we are seeking to hear from a variety of leaders in the health and wellness industries who agree that the wellness industry is in need of an overhaul and offer suggestions about what can be done moving forward. As a part of this series, I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Tsao-Lin Moy, L.Ac., MSOM. Tsao-Lin, is an Alternative and Chinese Medicine practitioner, and founder of [ Integrative Healing Arts](https://www.integrativehealingarts.com/) in NYC. She is a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist, with over 20 years of experience. Her specialties include fertility, stress, anti-aging, anxiety, immunity, and sleep. Thank you so much for doing this interview. It is an honor. Our readers would love to learn more about you and your personal background. Can you please share your personal backstory? What has brought you to this point in your life? Can you please share your personal backstory? I grew up in NYC with both my parents being in the Western Medicine field. I was always surrounded by medicine and interested in health and wellness though I did not want to become a medical doctor. Instead I went into the business world, and eventually worked at a job that required working weekends, in addition to traveling, and it was draining my \"life force\". I had to do something that would give my life meaning, be inspiring and help people. My interest in health, wellness, anthropology, eastern philosophy, spirituality, and shamanism lead me to the ancient healing traditions of the East. Alternative and Chinese medicine was the path for me. What has brought you to this point in your life? At this point in my life I have been practicing alternative and East Asian medicine for over 24 years. What led me into my field was when I realized that what I thought was success and happiness was not so and it no longer had the same meaning. Once that was apparent, working in a career that did not have meaning or purpose became soul sucking. For me I recognized that I needed to pivot and do something that helped people. East Asian and Chinese medicine continues to be fulfilling and is a lifelong practice of learning and growing. What is your \"why\" behind the work that you do? What fuels you? What fuels me is my own curiosity and drive to learn and get better at my craft. Every person that I help also adds to my experience that I can then share. Empowering people to learn how they can heal themselves; this is the key to cultivating for health, wellness and longevity. What are some of the most interesting or exciting new projects you are working on now? I recently completed certification in Psychedelic Assisted Therapy. Psychedelic plants and medicine research in the field of mental health and wellness are making a comeback after a 50 year hiatus due to the war on drugs. They are showing to help many people that suffer from treatment resistant depression, PTSD and addiction. These substances come from ancient cultural and healing practices that have profound healing properties. Chinese medicine also comes from ancient cultural and healing practices that support psychedelic therapies with integration and post treatment healing. It has been said that our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Growing up around medicine and then studying massage therapy and Chinese medicine, talking about body parts and organs is very normal. Especially asking questions about poop or even talking about it at the dinner table. I thought that everyone had a relationship with their digestive system and when they checked \"normal\" on the intake you have to ask what is their normal. One of my patients that was seeing me for skin, acne and anemia problems, had constipation where she would poop once a week and it was like rabbit pellets. Her doctors didn't consider it too serious and for her that was the way it was, her normal but it was not healthy. After asking the more detailed questions it became evident that her constipation was the cause of the skin problems as well as the anemia, the underlying cause was a gluten intolerance. This created the constipation and malabsorption of nutrients in her body. Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that? Most people don't like to talk about their poop and don't even check it out. What we put into our body is important and the evidence is what comes out. \"Garbage in, garbage out\" so to speak. Our immune system is dependent on our intestinal microbiome so poop is an important topic. OK, thank you for all of that. Let's now shift to the core focus of our interview. From where you stand, why are you passionate about the topic of Reimagining The Health and Wellness industries? As a practitioner of acupuncture and Chinese medicine, patients come to me after they have tried most allopathic or standard medicine. The cookie cutter approach in Western medicine does not work well compared to Chinese medicine which offers a holistic view and personalized approach. The key is to help people make informed decisions about their health so they can make health-smart lifestyle changes that will positively impact themselves as well as family. East Asian medicine has 8 branches that promote the cultivation of health, wellness and longevity. The principle is to bring Yin and Yang into balance not just internally but externally in your environment and community. This concept of homeostasis resembles Yin and Yang balance. Yin and Yang balance is a dynamic process that incorporates all aspects of a person's life and environment. The 8 branches are Acupuncture, Herbal medicine, Massage therapy, Food medicine, Exercise, Mindfulness, Cosmology and Feng shui. At least half of the branches are practices that the individual cultivates to bring balance to their life. Health and healing are not transactional. Often people believe if they have good insurance they go to the doctor and all they have to do is take pills or get surgery. Health and healing are a transformative process that needs continuous attention and is part of community and personal responsibility. Can you explain what you mean with a story or an example? I work with many women that struggle with infertility. I help them find better and natural ways to get pregnant naturally so they don't have to undergo painful or invasive procedures just to have a baby. I teach my patients to create a strong mind-body connection and a fertility mindset. This means learning about their body and their cycle and understanding the fertile window. Stress plays a huge role in health and is a major cause of many chronic illnesses and negatively impacts fertility. One tip I share is for women to clear the \"cookies\" on their phones and computers and stop going into chat rooms and groups that are often about failures. The more you search for \"what is wrong\" the more the search engine and the negative stories show up creating anxiety and causing doom and gloom. There are more stories and exercises in my book \"Will I Ever Get Pregnant, the Smart Woman's Guide to Get Pregnant Naturally over 40.\" When I talk about Reimagining the Wellness industry, I am talking about reimagining it from the perspective of the providers as well as from the perspective of the recipients and patients. Can you share a few reasons why the status quo is not working for both providers and patients? The healthcare system and education system are both a capitalist model valuing money over people. Clinics and institutions try to cut overhead costs and maximize billing based on what insurance will reimburse, like ordering additional tests to bring in funds. Lower numbers of staff creating burnout and ultimately poorer service to the patient. The medical health system is not a healthy environment to work in, doctors and nurses are not immune to the mental health crisis that we are experiencing. Burnout is a real problem. Each year 300-400 physicians in the US take their own lives. Over work, depression and substance abuse take their toll. Physicians have a higher suicidal ideation than the general population. . This creates shortages of doctors and diminished health standards. Why do you think there is a good opportunity now to improve and reform the health and wellness industry? The opportunity to improve and reform the wellness industry is always now. We see that the US is one of the richest countries in the world and yet we are one of the most unhealthy. The population is aging and we need for people to be more proactive with the health and lifestyle choices they are healthy in old age. At least 17% of the population is over 65 indicating we are already in a healthcare crisis on top of the pandemic. We need to start being proactive with diet, exercise and lifestyle changes because the majority of health causes of death in the US are preventable. Heart disease is listed as the number one health cause of death in the US. Hypertension, high cholesterol and smoking as major factors. Most of heart disease is preventable when we look at other medical conditions and lifestyle choices that contribute to a higher risk for heart disease, such as: - Diabetes, at least 10% if the adult population(34.2 million) have diabetes and 34.5% (88 million) have prediabetes. - Overweight and obesity 41.9% of adults. - Unhealthy diet, the Standard American diet also known as SAD, is high in animal products, dairy and meat as well as processed foods (fast food), sugars and fats. - Physical inactivity, modern society has led to a sedentary lifestyle and this contributes to weight gain, obesity and other chronic illnesses. - Excessive alcohol use. Alcohol related deaths have been on the rise, with an increase by 26% between 2019 and 2020 spiking during the pandemic. The trend was already This is due to poor education (influence) around food and lifestyle; children sitting all day in classrooms and adults sitting at desks is not healthy. Can you please share your \"5 Things That Should Be Done To Improve and Reform The Health & Wellness Industry\"? 1) Community health clinics. Healthcare access for all , this would be universal health. While Canada doesn't have a great system even homeless people have access to care. Many middle and low income housing residences could have community health clinics where people can receive services. There need to be more people trained in the health field. Public schools and armories that host voting can as easily also have monthly clinics and health lectures. 2) Education on food and growing it. A great program is the Bronx Green Box Machine. Students learn to grow and love to eat vegetables and this has impacted their grades and performance. More programs like this can empower young people to make better health choices for themselves. This addresses the issues of food deserts that plague the poorer communities. 3) Free education and sponsored programs for people going into the health field especially fitness, occupational therapy, acupuncture, nutrition, PT, nursing and midwifery. There are not enough health care providers to meet the need for women's health, the aging population and sick populations. 4) Middle school programs about first aid and emergency preparedness. Highschool can include emergency preparedness such as CPR and more in depth first aid. In China, both primary school and middle schools learn aboutTCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) . The approach is to enhance health awareness and lead a healthy lifestyle. The programs also are looking at the future need for more practitioners interested in TCM or the medical field. 5) Changing the culture and belief around what a healthy life is. The lack of understanding that medication is treating the symptoms of an underlying disease and not the disease itself. An example is the high incidence of diabetes and prediabetes, and obesity in the US and the cause is directly related to poor diet and lack of physical activity. Taking insulin or getting bariatric surgery to lose weight is not the answer for being healthy, it is a temporary fix. The United States is the biggest consumer of sugar on the globe. According to sources, the country's per capita sugar consumption is 126.4 grams (30 tsps) daily. That translates to more than ten times the lowest recommended intake of 11 grams per day. (11 grams = 2.53 tsp) This translates to a little over 100 lbs per year per person. From the recipient and patient side of the industry, can you please share a few ways that patients and recipients should reimagine what the wellness and healthcare industry should provide? The greatest impact to health and wellness will be people being proactive about their health with a long term view. This means cultivating a health and wellness mindset, a strong mind-body connection recognizing the difference in our body when we eat foods that are not processed and engage in physical activity. This is awareness of how we can have the greatest impact on our health. Studies show people with other comorbidities were at higher risk of more severe disease (requiring hospital admission) death and long covid. Health coaches offer holistic guidance for lifestyle changes that are part of building the long term health view. Universal healthcare that is not tied to employers or to insurance companies will grant access to healthcare providers before they get so ill they end up in the emergency rooms. What do you think are the biggest roadblocks to reforming the industry? The biggest roadblocks are that the healthcare industry is a for-profit model. Health insurance is the main gatekeeper for people seeking health care services. People make choices based on which healthcare providers are listed that already narrows their choices. Health Insurance companies want to keep the premiums paid by individuals and employers to continue to make money. They can and change their policies of coverage to avoid paying for health care costs. Health insurance companies are insurance companies that are in the healthcare industry, but not in \"service\". The US healthcare system runs on a medical model known as the \"broken and fix\" and disease model. If you wait for illness to be present before treatment the overall health of the person has already declined. This is a short sighted way to look at health and public health and safety. The society suffers and the healthcare facilities and emergency rooms become over packed. In the end the people suffer and ultimately the population becomes sicker and sicker and the cycle continues. A myth is that people think health insurance and healthcare are the same thing, this is far from the truth. Health insurance is a for profit business, meaning receiving payment for premiums and avoiding to pay for services on behalf of the subscriber. This can end up with denying covering health procedures, or not paying health care providers and keeping premiums for shareholders. People without insurance avoid going to a doctor or clinic because they will need to pay out of pocket and only seek help when they are very ill, using the emergency facilities. What can be done to address those hurdles? There needs to be a national healthcare system that is accessible to all people that is focused on the health and wellness of the population. Like the public school system that everyone has access to, it is possible to have clinics that serve as annual check ups, vaccines and medication. The more that people can do on their own with health choices and health smart lifestyle changes much of the problems we face in the healthcare system would be alleviated. Having health insurance is not a guarantee of receiving the best healthcare, it is the opposite. You could have the best insurance and be sitting next to someone that has not seen a doctor for their cough and later find out they had Tuberculosis. Disease does not discriminate though there is more sickness in communities that are of lower income and poverty. I'm very passionate about the topic of proactive versus reactive self-care and healthcare. There needs to be government support and public awareness. Prevention: government programs as well as school programs education about health. Once upon a time home economics was taught, covering the basics of cooking, budgeting and home repairs. How to take care of yourself, learning the basics of food safety and hygiene as well as nutrition, exercise and mindfulness. What do you think can be done to shift the industries towards a proactive healthcare approach? Start as early as possible with health awareness. Grade and Middle school programs about first aid and emergency preparedness. Highschool can include emergency preparedness such as CPR and more in depth first aid. In China, both primary school and middle schools learn aboutTCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) . The approach is to enhance health awareness and lead a healthy lifestyle. The programs also are looking at the future need for more practitioners interested in TCM or the medical field. Free education and scholarship programs for people going into the health field especially acupuncture, nutrition, PT, nursing and midwifery. There are not enough health care providers to meet the aging and sick populations. How can we shift the self-care mindset for consumers and providers alike? The key is to help people make informed decisions about their health so they can make health-smart lifestyle changes that will positively impact themselves as well as family. There is a culture of treating our body like a machine. Thank you for all that great insight! Let's start wrapping up. Can you share your favorite \"Life Lesson Quote\"? Why does that resonate with you so much? \"Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime\" In Chinese medicine the practitioner and the patient work together to address the root cause of a condition. The process is first to balance the Yin and Yang meaning to bring homeostasis where the body can then heal itself, then get stronger and then adopt practices that are preventive. The patient learns how to maintain their health and take on responsibility for improving their health choices. We are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we both tag them :-) I would love to meet Mick Jagger. He is someone that takes his health seriously and is not letting age be a factor in performance. I would say he has cultivated a health, wellness and longevity mindset. I appreciate your time and valuable contribution. One last question, how can people reach or follow you?
