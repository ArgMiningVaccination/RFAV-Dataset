Non-Medical Administrative Costs: Those costs (both direct and indirect) necessary to administer the Medicaid manag ed care program. a. Direct Expenses: Those expenses that can be charged directly as a part of the overall administrative costs; and b. Indirect Expenses: Those elements of costs necessary in the performance of administering the program that are of such a n ature that the amount applicable to the program cannot be determined accurately or readily (i.e., rent, heat, electrical power, salaries and benefits of management personnel which are allocated to different programs, etc.). 2. Medical Administrative Costs Costs, either direct or indirect, related to recipient medical care management (i.e., development of physician protocols for disease management, utilization review activities, case management costs and medical information management systems). The DHCFP wil l review Medical Administrative Costs for reasonability and in the context of the benefit received by the client and the DHCFP (i.e., is the cost of developing physician protocols for disease management less than or equal to the fiscal and health outcome b enefit received). 3. Non-Medical Costs The following are not considered administrative costs. They are, however, included in the overall percentage of non -medical costs and will be reviewed for reasonableness by the DHCFP: MTL 10/17 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: A MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: ADDENDUM April 27, 2017 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DEFINITIONS Section A Page 6 a. Profit: The percentage of profit w hich the Contractor anticipates receiving after expenses (net income, revenues less expenses, divided by total revenues received from the DHCFP); and b. Risk and contingencies: That amount which the Contractor anticipates setting aside (as a percentage of the revenues received) for potential unknown risks and contingencies. ADMINISTRATIVE CUT -OFF DATE A date each month selected by the DHCFP.

Primary diagnosis is the first listed diagnosis for claims submission. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (PA) Titles XI and XVIII of the Act provide the statutory authority for the broad objectives and operations of the Utilization and Quality Control QIO program. The Peer Review Improvement Act of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 established utilization and Quality Control QIOs. QIOs operate under contract with the Secretary of HHS to review Medicare services, once so certified by CMS. They may also contract with state Medicaid agencies and private insurers. The utilization review/control requirements of 42 CFR 456, are deemed met if a State Medicaid agency contracts with a Medicare certified QIO, designated under Part 475, to perform review/con trol services (42 CFR 431.630). PA review is conducted to evaluate medical necessity, appropriateness, location of service and compliance with Medicaid's policy, prior to the delivery of service. PRIOR RESOURCES Prior resources are any non -Medicaid cov erage, public or private, which can be used to pay for medical services. These resources and benefits are payable before Medicaid benefits are paid. PRIVATE DUTY NURSING (PDN) SERVICES PDN is an optional Medicaid service which states may elect to provide .

Nutrition services are practiced within dietetics and include the assessment, evaluation, diagnos is, counseling, intervention, monitoring and treatment of a person which requires substantial specialized judgment and skill based on the knowledge, application and integration of the principles derived from the sciences of food, nutrition, management, com munications, biology, behavior, physiology and social science to achieve and maintain proper nourishment and care of a person. REHABILITATION PLAN 1. A comprehensive, progressive and individualized written Rehabilitative Plan must include all the prescribed Rehabilitation Mental Health (RMH) services. RMH services include : a. Basic Skills Training (BST); b. Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) ; c. Day Treatment ; d. Peer-to-Peer Support ; e. Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR) ; and f. Crisis Intervention (CI). The plan must include the appropriate treatment coordination to achieve the maximum reduction of the mental and/or behavioral health disability and to restore the recipient to their best possible functional level. The plan must ensure the transparency of c overage and medical necessity determinations, so that the recipient, their family (in the case of legal minors) or other responsible individuals would have a clear understanding of the services that are made available to the recipient. In all situations, t he ultimate goal is to reduce the duration and intensity of medical care to the least intrusive level possible - while sustaining overall health. All prescribed services must be medically necessary, clinically appropriate and contribute to the rehabilitati on goals and objectives. 2. The Rehabilitation Plan must include recovery goals. The plan must establish a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the RMH care offered in meeting the stated goals and objectives. The plan must provide for a process to invo lve the beneficiary, and family (in the case of legal minors) or other responsible individuals, in the overall management of the RMH care. The plan must document that the services have been determined to be rehabilitative services consistent with the regul atory definition, and will have a timeline, based on the individual's assessed needs and anticipated progress. MTL 23/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: R MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subje ct: ADDENDUM October 1, 2015 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DEFINITIONS Section R Page 4 3. The reevaluation of the plan must involve the recipient, the recipient's family (in the case of legal minors) or other responsible individuals. T he reevaluation of the plan must include a review of whether the established goals and objectives are being met and whether each of the services prescribed in the plan has contributed to meeting the stated established goals and objectives. If it is determi ned that there has been no measurable reduction of disability and/or function level restoration, any new plan would need to pursue a different rehabilitation strategy including revision of the rehabilitative goals, objectives, services, and/or methods. The plan must identify the rehabilitation goals and objectives that would be achieved under the plan in terms of measurable reductions in a diagnosed physical or mental disability and in terms of restored functional abilities. 4. Rehabilitation goals and objec tives are often contingent on the individual's maintenance of a current level of functioning. In these instances, services that provide assistance in maintaining functioning may be considered rehabilitative only when necessary to help an individual achieve a rehabilitation goal and objectives as defined in the rehabilitation plan. The plan must be reasonable and based on the individual's diagnosed condition(s) and on the standards of practice for provisions of rehabilitative mental and/or behavioral health services to an individual with the individual's condition(s). The written rehabilitation plan must ensure that services are provided within the scope (therapeutic intent) of the rehabilitative services and would increase the likelihood that an individual's disability would be reduced and functional level restored. Rehabilitation plans are living documents and therefore must evolve in concert (show progressive transformations in the amount, duration and scope of services provided) with the recipient's functi onal progress. The rehabilitation plan must also demonstrate that the services requested are not duplicative (redundant) of each other. The wr itten rehabilitation plan must: a. be based on a comprehensive assessment of an individual's rehabilitation needs in cluding current ICD diagnoses and presence of a functional impai rment in daily living; b. ensure the active participation of the individual, individual's family (in the case of legal minors), the individual's authorized health care decision maker and/or pers ons of the individual's choosing in the development, review and modification of these goals and services; c. be approved by a QMHP, working within the scope of their practice under state law; d. be signed by the individual responsible for developing the plan; e. specify the individual's rehabilitation goals and objectives to be achieved, including recovery goals for persons with mental health related disorders; f. identify the RMH services intended to reduce the identified physical impairment, mental and/or behavio ral health related disorder; g. identify the methods that wou ld be used to deliver services; h. indicate the frequency, amount and duration of the services; MTL 23/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: R MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: ADDENDUM October 1, 2015 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL DEFINITIONS Section R Page 5 i. indicate the anticipated provider(s) of the service(s) and the extent to which the services may be available from alternate provider(s) of the same service; j. specify a timeline for reevaluation of the plan, based on the individual's assessed needs and anticipated progress, but not longer than every 90 days or more frequently if needs change; k. document that the individual, the individual's family (in the case of legal minors), or representative participated in the development of the plan, signed the plan and received a copy of the rehabilitation plan; and l. document that the services have been determined to be rehabilitative services consistent with the regulatory definition. 5. Temporary, but clinically necessary, services do not require an alteration to Rehabilitation Plans; however, temporary services must be identified in progress notes. These progress notes must indicate the medical necessity, amount, scope, duration and provider(s) of the service(s). 6. At a minimum, Rehabilitation Plans must include all of the following headings: a. Recipient's Full Name . b. Recipient's 11 -Digit Billing Number . c. Intensit y of Needs Determination: See I ntensity of Needs Determination definition. d. SED/SMI Determination: See S evere Emotional Disturbance (SED) and S erious Mental Illness (SMI) definitions. e. Measurable Goals and Objectives: See G oals and Objectives definitions. f. Prescribed Services: 1. Identify the specific mental health service or services (i.e., family therapy, individual therapy, basic skills training, day t reatment, etc.) to be provided; 2. Identify the daily amount, service duration and therapeutic scope for eac h service to be provided; and 3. Identify the provider or providers that are anticipated to provide each service. g. Rehabilitation Plan Evaluation and Recipient Progress: A QMHP must evaluate the Rehabilitation Plan at a minimum, every 90 days or more often w hen rehabilitation needs change. Rehabilitation Plan reviews must demonstrate the recipient's progress towards functional improvements towards established goals and objectives.

Clinical Supervisor, 2. Recipient and their family/legal guardian (in the case of legal minors), 3. The individual responsible for developing the plan. REHABILITA TION SERVICES Rehabilitation services are an optional Medicaid benefit that must be recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of practice under state law, for the maximum reduction of a physical or men tal disability and to restore the individual to the best possible functional level. Nevada Medicaid provides for physical rehabilitation services and mental health rehabilitation services under separate programs within the plan.

Services may be for 24 -hour periods, and the goal is relief of the primary caregiver. RESTORATIVE CARE Therapy services are considered to be \"restorative\" when there is an expectation that the patient's cond ition will improve in a reasonable (and generally predictable) period of time. Medically necessary, restorative therapy services are eligible f or coverage by Nevada Medicaid. 1. If an individual's expected potential for improvement in function (restoration) would be insignificant in relation to the extent and duration of therapy services required to achieve such potential the therapy would not be considered reasonable and/or medic ally necessary. 2. If at any point in the treatment of an illness it is determine d that the expectations will not materialize, the services will no longer be considered reasonable and medically necessary; and they, therefore, may be excluded from coverage. 3. As a general rule, failure to progress towards goals after a reasonable time pe riod would no longer qualify as restorative.
