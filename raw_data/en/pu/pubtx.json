What is an MRI scan? MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It is a scanning technique which uses a magnetic field, radio waves and a powerful computer to produce very detailed images of the inside of the body. What are the benefits? This type of scan is incredibly sensitive for imaging soft tissue structures including the brain, spinal cord, joints and internal organs. It can provide your doctor with more information than other tests such as CT scans, X-rays or Ultrasound and help in providing a diagnosis or planning treatment. Are there any risks associated with MRI scans? MRI scans are very safe. As this technique uses a magnet and radio waves, there is no increased exposure to radiation. There are no known side effects. If your child has any metal implants inside their body, it may not be suitable for them to have the scan due to the extremely strong magnet in the scanner. Why does my child need a general anaesthetic? We assess each child to see if they may benefit from having a general anaesthetic. MRI scans can take between 20 minutes and 60 minutes to complete. Your child will need to lie very still in order for us to obtain the best quality of images. The scanner also makes a very loud noise while it is taking pictures. The age of your child or the medical condition he/ she has may make it difficult for them to lie still for so long. When you receive your appointment letter Please let us know as soon as possible whether you are able to attend. Your child may need to attend a pre-assessment clinic before the scan. If you are given an appointment please attend, as it is important for us to be able to make sure that it is safe for them to have a general anaesthetic. If you need to cancel your appointment for the MRI scan or pre-assessment clinic, please let us know so we can give your child another date and also use the slot for another child as we have many children waiting for a scan under general anaesthesia. Before the anaesthetic Your child needs to be 'fasted' in order for us to carry out the general anaesthetic safely. Please follow the instructions on the admission letter. If you do not, your child's scan may be cancelled. If you have any questions, please call the MRI department. On the day of the scan If your child is wearing clothes that do not contain any metals (such as zips, metal buttons, badges, etc) then they do not need to get changed out of their clothes. Otherwise they will need to change into a hospital gown. The anaesthetist will review your child and confirm whether they are fit for a general anaesthetic. They will discuss the specific risks for general anaesthesia for your child. You should have signed a consent form when your doctor originally discussed your child needing an MRI scan. The anaesthetist will counter sign it on the day and add any specific information relevant to your child's anaesthetic. You will be asked to fill in and sign a safety questionnaire on behalf of your child to confirm that he/ she does not have any metal implants or clips, pacemakers, dental braces or metal fragments in the eye or any allergies. You will also be asked for permission to give your child contrast during the scan. This is sometimes necessary to improve the picture quality and to help give the doctors more information when interpreting your scan. As with any drugs, there is a very small risk of an allergic reaction. However, your anaesthetist will be monitoring your child for this and will be prepared in case your child suffers an allergic reaction. What does the general anaesthetic involve? Your anaesthetist will discuss with you and your child the options for general anaesthesia. Your child will either have an injection or an anaesthetic gas to go to sleep. They will be asleep for the whole scan and be closely monitored throughout the anaesthetic. The scan is not painful so your child should not need any painkillers afterwards. You will be able to see them as soon as they wake up after the "}
