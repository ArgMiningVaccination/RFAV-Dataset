Summarize this article for a 10 years old Magnetic therapy is a [pseudoscientific](/en/Pseudoscientific) [alternative medicine](/en/Alternative_medicine) practice involving the weak static [magnetic field](/en/Magnetic_field) produced by a permanent [magnet](/en/Magnet) which is placed on the body. It is similar to the alternative medicine practice of [electromagnetic therapy](/en/Electromagnetic_therapy_(alternative_medicine)), which uses a magnetic field generated by an electrically powered device. [[1]](#cite_note-acsMag-1) Magnet therapy products may include wristbands, jewelry, blankets, and wraps that have magnets incorporated into them. [[1]](#cite_note-acsMag-1) [[2]](#cite_note-Pittler2008-2) Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to weak electric or magnetic fields has beneficial health effects. These physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established. [[1]](#cite_note-acsMag-1) [[3]](#cite_note-Park_Voodoo-3) [[4]](#cite_note-Wanjek_BM-4) [[5]](#cite_note-NSF_SEIND_2006-5) Although [hemoglobin](/en/Hemoglobin), the blood protein that carries oxygen, is weakly [diamagnetic](/en/Diamagnetic) (when oxygenated) or [paramagnetic](/en/Paramagnetic) (when deoxygenated), the magnets used in magnetic therapy are many orders of magnitude too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flow.
