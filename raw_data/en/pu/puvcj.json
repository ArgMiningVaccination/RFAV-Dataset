Those people who knew Dr.Servan - Schreiber and those touched by his writing and speaking, will remember his love, caring, and understanding. He was a charismatic writer and speaker, able to express his ideas with clarity in a way that resonated with his audience. He conveyed a sense of our innate resilience and ability to heal. David's presence and empathic connection empowered people to make lifestyle and personal changes. Even being in the same room with him was a healing experience. Our deepest sympathies and kind wishes go out to his family. David Servan -Schreiber, MD, PhD, co - founder and former medical director of the UPMC Center for Integrative Medicine, will be remembered dearly by those who knew him and those impacted by his work. Perhaps his greatest contribution came in recent years after he shifted from research and clinical practice to devote time to writing and speaking. His books were translated to over two dozen languages and have sold over two million copies. As a psychiatrist and cognitive neuroscientist, Dr. Servan -Schreiber studied the effect of emotion on brain imaging. and when a subject didn't show for the scheduled lab time he went into the scanner instead. This led to the discovery of a brain tumor at age 31 and a 20 year struggle with cancer. Rather than slow him down, Dr. Servan -Schreiber approached each task with renewed energy. He excelled in multiple domains, providing warm and empathic care for his patients and their families and in leading the center on solid footing programmatically, academically, and financially. After retiring from clinical practice, he maintained his connection with the center and the University of Pittsburgh as a clinical professor of Psychiatry and continued to provide teaching and consultation. After performing missionary work in Iraq and other war -torn countries, he served as co -founder of the American chapter of Doctors Without Borders. The Pennsylvania Psychiatric Society As the weather gets colder, one way to keep this up is to go to the mall, but watch out for the caramel macchiatos, which negate the benefits. Some people will dust off the treadmill or go to the health club. For those who are on their feet all day, it can be helpful to get a pedometer and shoot for 10,000 steps a day Fall is a great time to enroll in a yoga or tai chi class. Both activities have a general health benefit and are particularly helpful for mood, anxiety, and overall well -being. Additionally, participating in a class with others can give a person the needed encouragement to get off the sofa and remain active. Both yoga and tai chi are helpful for people who work at a desk, because they stretch out and balance tight muscles. Also, both include a focus on breathing, which can be calming and centering.

Regular exercise can reduce the likeli- hood of heart disease by about 50 percent , and there is emerging evidence that exercise may help to prevent cancer as well. In the spring and summer we naturally step up our activity, but as the days get shorter and the weather colder, it can be harder to keep that up. Aerobic conditioning is one type of exer- cise that can have powerful health benefits. For many of us, regular walking, at least a half hour a day, is the easiest kind of aerobic exer- cise to build into our schedules. Inside CIM Newsletter Lectures and Classes 2 Like anything else, tai chi and yoga work best when they are part of a daily exercise prac- tice. As we enter the fall, it's best if we think about how we can maintain the momentum that we started over the summer. Each person needs to look at what kind of exer- cise or activity will work for them. Have a good workout! References:1.Archer, E ., Blair, S .N., et. al.
