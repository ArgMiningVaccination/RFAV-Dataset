Britain's leading food policy experts have penned a letter to Whitehall saying this 'vital' information was not being shared with the public. There is considerable evidence that eating habits influence the immune system, which is responsible for fighting off infection and disease. Eating fruit and vegetables every day does not guarantee to stave off infection. But it gives the body the best chance of beating it early and not becoming severely sick. Older people and those with underlying conditions are known to be at most risk of complications from COVID-19 because of their compromised immune systems. The letter, sent to the Environment Secretary and Public Health England's chief executive, also urged officials to prepare for further disruptions and food shortages. Britain's leading food policy experts have penned a letter to Whitehall, urging the Government to launch a healthy eating campaign amid the coronavirus crisis [WHAT SHOULD A BALANCED DIET LOOK LIKE?](/health/fb-8179619/WHAT-BALANCED-DIET-LOOK-LIKE.html) Meals should be based on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates, ideally wholegrain, according to the NHS Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. All fresh, frozen, dried and canned fruit and vegetables count Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates, ideally wholegrain 30 grams of fibre a day: This is the same as eating all of the following: 5 portions of fruit and vegetables, 2 whole-wheat cereal biscuits, 2 thick slices of wholemeal bread and large baked potato with the skin on Have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks) choosing lower fat and lower sugar options Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of which should be oily) Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and consuming in small amounts Drink 6-8 cups/glasses of water a day Adults should have less than 6g of salt and 20g of saturated fat for women or 30g for men a day Source: [NHS Eatwell Guide](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/) The immune system relies on white blood cells that produce antibodies to combat viruses like COVID-19. Antioxidant-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables and oily fish help increase the activity of white blood cells. Maintaining a healthy weight can also give people a greater chance of beating coronavirus. This is because the immune systems of fat people are constantly ramped up as they try to repair the damage inflammation - caused by overeating - causes to cells. Using all its energy fending off inflammation means the body's defence system has few resources left to defend against a new infection like COVID-19. Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City, University of London, along with two other academics, wrote to the Government this morning. Their letter reads: 'In addition to current government measures, clear and well-informed public guidance is required from the Government on what is nutritionally necessary and sufficient to maintain UK food security and nutritional appropriateness. 'We therefore urge you to establish and operate new working structures, based on clear principles of equity and health, and with co-ordinated methods of delivery. 'These are needed if the country is to address the numerous and complex quantitative and qualitative difficulties emerging in many parts of the UK food system. 'They are also needed to prepare for further potential disruptions and shortages, if the international and national situation remains critical in the medium term.' Professor Erik Millstone of the University of Sussex and Professor Terry Marsden of Cardiff University also point out that most of the UK's fresh fruit, vegetables and salads come from Spain and Italy - two EU countries with the most COVID-19 cases. A medical staff member tests an NHS worker for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 at a drive-in facility set up in the carpark of Chessington World of Adventures. An astonishing 242 members of PHE staff now trouser a six-figure pay package WHY ARE OBESE PEOPLE MORE AT RISK OF BECOMING VERY ILL FROM COVID-19? Studies have shown obese people are more likely to suffer serious complications or die from infections, such as the flu. Doctors say the immune systems of fat people are constantly ramped up as they try to protect and repair the damage inflammation causes to cells. Using all its energy fending off inflammation means the body's defence system has few resources left to defend against a new infection like COVID-19. Obese people also tend to eat a diet with very little fiber and antioxidants - which keep the immune system healthy - such as fruit and vegetables. Most patients with a BMI of over 40 suffer from breathing problems that range from simple shortness of breath to a potentially life-threatening condition known as obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), Excess weight also makes it more difficult for the diaphragm and lungs to expand and inhale oxygen. Starved of oxygen, organs will begin to fail. COVID-19 kills by spreading deep into the lungs and causing complications such as pneumonia. These factors may explain why obese people's lungs tend to fail faster when the new coronavirus strikes, compared to a healthy person. There are several other factors that may increase an obese person's chance of falling seriously ill with coronavirus, including a lack of exercise. Studies have shown that physical activity increases the numbers of certain immune cells that help to bolster immune activity. Clogged up arteries also make it hard for blood carrying immune cells to pass through and repair cells around the body. They warn that these supplies could diminish rapidly if there were too few people to pick, pack and transport them, and suggest a 'volunteer system' could be put in place to ensure supplies. 'UK domestic supplies of fruits and vegetables depend on a sufficient supply of workers, and under conditions of lockdown, and the cessation of cross-border travel, there are very likely to be shortages of workers available, willing and able to produce, pick, pack, process and transport nutritionally vital foods. 'A volunteer system, akin to but improved on what happened in the Second World War, might be desirable to support the food supply, but it needs careful planning to ensure it does not spread COVID-19 infection,' they wrote. The academics warn that the Government has left too much decision-making to the food retailers, writing: 'Some retailers have set limits on some aspects of purchasing, but those restrictions are neither uniform nor consistent; nor do they reflect nutritional or immunological considerations.' They conclude the letter by writing: 'As in 1936-40 and in the run-up to a no-deal Brexit, food strains were understood to be highly likely to appear. 'Now is the time to address and resolve these strains, not exacerbate them by undue reliance on a handful of retailers, important though they are, and to ensure that food advice is clear, open and seen to be shaped by the public interest.' The best way to 'eat for immunity' is to balance calories and ensure you get plenty of good fats, fibre, quality carbs, diverse protein sources, vitamins and nutrients. Carefully select the most beneficial fats, such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, found in olive oils, oily fish, avocados, seeds and nuts. These fats can help lower your LDL cholesterol - which reduces your risk for heart disease - and include omega-3 and omega-6, essential fatty acids the body needs for brain function and cell growth. Fibre provides great fodder for all the different beneficial micro-organisms living in the gut. A diverse microbiome strengthens immunity. It's found in fruit, veg, nuts and seeds, oats, lentils and rice, as well as cooked and cooled white potatoes and porridge. How you can strengthen your defence against COVID-19 with these easy-to-follow tips from an academic who's studied the wonders of the human immune system for 20 yearsBy [Dr Jenna Macciochi Lecturer In Immunology For The Mail On Sunday](/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Dr+Jenna+Macciochi+Lecturer+In+Immunology+For+The+Mail+On+Sunday) The bad news is that there is no magic pill or miracle broth that will 'boost' our immunity against [coronavirus](/news/coronavirus/index.html) overnight. The good news is that there are many ways we can give our immune system the best possible chance of operating at its optimum level. When it comes to maintaining good health, the immune system is our most precious asset. A silent wonder. Yet we rarely appreciate our essential defences until something goes wrong. Most of the time our immune system works quietly away and we don't even notice it. Deeply entwined with every aspect of our physical and mental health, it acts as a fortress and lays the foundations of our health and longevity. It is all that stands between us and 38,000,000,000,000 (that's 38 trillion!) microbes in our body that threaten us constantly - although 99 per cent won't hurt us. As our sixth sense, this system connects our health to our environment, feelings and emotions. DR JENNA MACCIOCHI: When it comes to maintaining good health, the immune system is our most precious asset. A silent wonder Five Fs that are key to building up protection The best way to 'eat for immunity' is to balance calories and ensure you get plenty of good fats, fibre, quality carbs, diverse protein sources and phyto-nutrients (biologically active chemical compounds found in plants). So ensure your plate is filled with these five Fs (OK, one is a Ph but it still counts...!). FATS - Carefully select the most beneficial, such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, found in olive oils, oily fish, avocados, seeds and nuts. PHYTONUTRIENTS - My superfoods. They act as a natural pesticide, helping to protect plants from predators. So it's no surprise that regular consumption helps to prevent us from getting sick, too. There are over 25,000 different ones recorded across many foods - not only in fruits and veg, but in pulses, tea, coffee, red wine, cacao, herbs, spices and olive oil. It's the collective power of phytonutrients that we are after, and, as a rule of thumb, more colourful fruit and veg equals more phytonutrients. FIBRE - This provides great fodder for all the different beneficial micro-organisms living in us, and might just be the life-saving food 90 per cent of us aren't eating enough of. Get it from fruit, veg, nuts and seeds, oats, lentils and rice, as well as cooked and cooled white potatoes. FISH - A source of essential fats, which we can only get from our diet as our bodies can't make them, particularly in the case of oily fish. FLAVOUR - Our flavour-sensing evolved to help us survive by avoiding spoiled, harmful foods and motivates us to seek the good. Eating whole foods doesn't need to be bland. Strive for variety with spices and herbs to bring food to life. Crucially, it's as unique to each of us as our fingerprints - and with good reason, as this diversity helps sustain the human race: if our immune defence systems were identical, a single deadly disease could wipe us all out. That's why we all know someone who 'never gets a cold'. They may have an immune system that is expert at dealing with the common cold, but they might fare worse when faced with a different germ. But while, broadly speaking, we are all different when it comes to immunity, there is evidence that nowhere is the difference greater than between the sexes. This suggests that men aren't just being drama queens - man flu is real. Indeed, we know that significantly more men than women die from infections. The reasons are complex and only partially known, but one theory is that because women can pass bugs from mother to child during gestation, birth, or breastfeeding, they need a hardier immune defence against germs. Devastating outbreaks, such as infection epidemics like coronavirus, have all been caused by the smorgasbord of micro-organisms with which we share this planet. Over the last decades, our fear of them has been realised, with outbreaks of swine flu, Zika, bird flu, ebola and many others - each outbreak prompting new concerns about infection protection. But from birth to death we are silently bombarded, minute by minute, with an untold number of potential infectious threats. And whether or not we get sick is decided by the integrity of our immune system. Thankfully, there are ways in which we can help train and maintain it. Searching 'immunity' online or among the aisles of health-food stores reveals an abundance of nutritional supplements, cold remedies and fortified foods all promising to 'boost' our immune system. But is there any scientific truth in these claims? The notion of the immune system as some kind of internal force-field that can be easily ramped up makes little sense scientifically and is one of the biggest misconceptions I come across in my work. True, researchers have looked at whether things such as echinacea, green tea, garlic and wheatgrass supplements can help see off germs. But evidence in support of a single immune-boosting nutrient or superfood is not strong. If you are looking to strengthen your immunity, the best way is through a combined approach - by adopting these science-backed lifestyle tweaks and changes. They are in no way prescriptive, nor a magic bullet to health, simply a gentle nudge in a better direction... GO ORGANIC Organic produce has a significantly more diverse bacteria population, especially when eaten raw, since cooking would destroy these good bugs. Anecdotally, I've heard of many benefits from consuming fermented foods and drinks like kimchi, kombucha, kefir and sauerkraut which contain a natural synergy of many different types of yeasts and bacteria. Organic produce has a significantly more diverse bacteria population, especially when eaten raw, since cooking would destroy these good bugs (file image) ENJOY SOME SUNSHINE Sunshine is good for immunity and bad for viruses. One reason that flu is a winter problem is because the influenza virus is transmitted best at cooler temperatures and low humidity. But there are other reasons for seeking sunshine. Research suggests it makes disease-fighting cells in the skin move faster and work more efficiently. Sunlight also helps our bodies to make Vitamin D. The World Health Organisation suggests five to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure a few times a week is more than sufficient to keep Vitamin D levels topped up The vitamin's crucial role in immunity is not fully understood but ample levels can help protect against a lengthy list of ailments, including multiple sclerosis, asthma, depression, heart disease and cancer. The World Health Organisation suggests five to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure a few times a week is more than sufficient to keep Vitamin D levels topped up. Public Health England advises that adults and children over the age of one should consider taking a daily supplement containing ten micrograms of Vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter. BRRR... COLD SHOWERS! There's a growing - albeit still rather small - body of evidence that being cold can benefit our immunity. In the right doses, exposure to cold temperatures can help reduce stress, which can have a detrimental impact on immunity. It won't happen straight away but over time, our body can improve its resistance to stress. There's a growing - albeit still rather small - body of evidence that being cold can benefit our immunity Research shows that people who take regular cold showers are almost 30 per cent less likely to call in sick to work than others, due to the improvements in immunity. At the end of every shower, turn the water to the coldest setting and stand underneath for about 20 seconds. Build up to as long as you can tolerate. Even a stroll in the park helps with immunity Moderate aerobic exercise - about 30 to 45 minutes a day of walking, biking or running - can more than halve our risk of catching common winter maladies, and of having a particularly severe form of them. Some cells that deal with viral infections and cancer surveillance increase tenfold after just one bout of exercise activity. And it may sound strange but it's true - exercising a few minutes before a vaccination can even improve its protection. The Government recommends at least 150 minutes (two hours 30 minutes) of moderate aerobic activity with at least two muscle-strengthening activities per week. But walking for one hour a week has been shown to improve overall health in the long term. Get physical throughout the day by taking stairs not lifts, walk to the station rather than getting the bus, meet friends for a stroll in the park instead of a coffee or a drink, or try a standing desk. You can use YouTube to find a ten-minute workout to fit into your day. TAKE THE COUNTRY AIR As well as getting microbes from our mothers and our diets, we get them from our environment. The air we breathe carries bacteria, which together with organisms that come mostly from soil and plants, are deposited in our mouths and airways as we breath and swallow. These are known to have potentially beneficial immunological effects. That's great if you live in the countryside, but less so if you live in an urban environment that is low on microbial diversity. Urbanites are more susceptible to allergies and inflammatory disease, and there is also clear evidence that childhood exposure to outdoor microbes is linked to a more robust immune system. So city-dwellers should spend time in a garden, visit the countryside, go for a walk in the park, eat home-grown food or head to a local farmers' market. Even just digging your fingers in the soil of a potted plant can improve your mood and nourish your immune system. I've always found something about being in nature - whether it's the sound of the sea, the scent of a forest or an impressive countryside vista - eases my stress and worry, and helps me to relax and think more clearly. Exposure to nature works primarily by lowering stress - immune-cell function improves after walking in a forest for a few hours each day. Nature, it seems, is particularly good for strengthening our main virus-fighting cells and cancer-surveillance system. Aromatic substances called phytoncides from trees and plants bring about these amazing health benefits. If you can't get outdoors to decrease stress and assist with immune balance, you could put woody essential oils in a diffuser. Some of my favourites are sacred mountain, pine, cypress, Idaho balsam fir and palo santo. Nature, it seems, is particularly good for strengthening our main virus-fighting cells and cancer-surveillance system TRY PROBIOTICS The official definition of a probiotic is: 'a live micro-organism that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit'. But few products meet this definition as it's tricky to keep the organisms alive. Also, we don't know if they are useful for everyone or which specific strains should be taken. In fact, most microbes from probiotics do not take up residence in our guts, but are transient, detectable only for a limited time during frequent consumption. This is not a reason to dismiss their health benefits though, as they can help improve the availability of nutrients from food and produce compounds that strengthen immunity. One interesting piece of research suggested that taking probiotic supplements is linked to a reduced likelihood of getting colds, and making them shorter in duration and less severe. SLEEP ON IT One of our least valuable cliches is that we can sleep when we die. Much truer is: if we don't sleep, we will die - sooner. While more sleep won't necessarily make us invincible, lack of sleep almost immediately tips our immune system into imbalance, simultaneously dampening parts of it and empowering others. One of our least valuable cliches is that we can sleep when we die. Much truer is: if we don't sleep, we will die - sooner (file image) A single night of poor sleep leads to a decrease of up to 70 per cent of our natural killer cells - our first-line defence against viruses and potentially cancerous cells. Other research has shown that people who sleep for six hours a night or less are four times more likely to catch a cold when exposed to the virus, compared with those who spend more than seven hours a night asleep. No matter what your starting point to wellbeing is, I'd say sort out your sleep before anything else. (See Dr Michael Mosley's guide to a good night's sleep in today's Health section beginning on Page 59). EAT CHICKEN SOUP In my line of work I've heard it all, from chicken soup for the sniffles to copper bracelets for arthritis. The former was prescribed for colds in ancient Egypt and considered a powerful remedy through the Middle Ages. The 12th Century Jewish doctor Moses Maimonides recommended it for everything from haemorrhoids to leprosy, leading to it becoming known as 'Jewish penicillin'. Chicken soup is one of the most effective feel-better foods. This could be due to a number of substances in it, such as carnosine, which enhances the power of immune cells Although not technically a supplement, chicken soup is one of the most effective feel-better foods. This could be due to a number of substances in it, such as carnosine, which enhances the power of immune cells. And properties from the chicken released during cooking resemble the drug acetylcysteine, commonly prescribed for respiratory ailments. \u00a9 Dr Jenna Macciochi, 2020 Adapted by Claire Coleman from Immunity: The Science Of Staying Well, by Dr Jenna Macciochi, published by Thorsons on Thursday at \u00a314.99.

[WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS?](/health/fb-7924235/WHAT-KNOW-DEADLY-CORONAVIRUS-CHINA.html) What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals - the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms - but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much - changing is known as mutating - much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, [Stat News](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/) reported. Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to [Pharmaceutical Technology](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine/). Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.
