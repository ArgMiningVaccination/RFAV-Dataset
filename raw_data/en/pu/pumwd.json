Camila Ram\u00f3n, our favorite Peloton instructor who not only teaches classes in both English and Spanish but also brings the cultura, the perreo, the Sabor and Amor Propio to fitness. She joins us for a conversation that ranges from how to dance on a bike to Camila's experience being a Latina in the spotlight, she shares about her journey in her professional career as well as her Self Love journey, we touch on how to shut out the Tia Toxica vibe out of our lives and how to change our views on what our bodies should look like to feel confident. Plus, Paulina and Bricia debrief from the best night of their lives... the Bad Bunny concert! This episode is full of perreo vibes More About Mariana: Mariana was born in Argentina and move to the U.S. as a 7-year-old. Always feeling nostalgic about her homeland Camila always wanted to go back to Argentina and was able to visit often, staying close to her culture and roots. Camila grew up being really active, running and dancing was always her passion but she had to put that aside for some time as she was working in international public relations, Camila soon realized a desk job was not for her and decided to pursue her true passion. Camila began teaching cycling classes in Los Angeles while her husband was pursuing his military career, she eventually began developing her own training programs and soon realized there was a need in the fitness space where people talked about training to develop a positive relationship with themselves. Camila moved to Miami to be close to her family and where she continued to work on her craft, one day she decided to send an email that changed her life and landed her a position with Peloton where she is now proudly and unapologetically representing the Latin@ Community.
