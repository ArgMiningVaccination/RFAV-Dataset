Just to add I was suffering for good 14 months , constant relapses , but every relapse would be 5-10% less overwhelming, that's a sign your body is recovering , the fatigue comes from your body in over drive throwing resources at the enemy. It's not permanent. It's an experiment. And we are the experiment. [@jtranger](https://vestibular.org/participant/jtranger/) Im still having most of my issues just not as bad as I was. I will say colloidal silver helped with the burning I was experiencing in my pelvis and kidneys which I believe was an infection. Still working on figuring it out. Make sure if you are taking colloidal silver orally you use a reputable brand like Sovereign Silver so the particles are small enough to pass through cells and won't get trapped in organs. Other than that the only thing that has def helped me has been getting enough sleep and time. I've also switched over to just water and a plant based diet (strictly fruit and veggies) which has seemed to help my energy some. If the regular medical industry is not helping you (I haven't gotten a single answer) I have done biofeedback which gave me some answers and Im planning to see a holistic functional medicine person soon to get tests done that won't get done in the normal medical system. If you are interested in going a medication route I have heard many people feel successful on LDN for neurology and pain issues. Hope this helps! [@jtranger]Hi Larry, I see Roeshan Shadravan at Be Well Integrative in San Diego, I believe she also takes virtual clients and she's amazing I did DNRS and also tried Gupta for a few weeks initially but I personally resonated with DNRS better It's much more than mindfulness practices although that's helpful too, I used the app \"BrainTap\" for that Brain retraining uses specific daily practices, methods and exercises that work to create new neural pathways and repair the Limbic system which in turn heals the body if that makes sense @marieski858: What is DNRS and did that help with the chronic \"fight or flight\" anxious feeling? Thanks. [@ksharky13](https://vestibular.org/participant/ksharky13/) Yes! That is exact focus of DNRS to get the body out of fight or flight and into the parasympathetic healing state. It was the main source of relief from my severe anxiety and physical symptoms of panic attacks. DNRS is \"Dynamic Neural Retraining System.\" It is a brain retraining neuroplasticity program to repair damaged portions of the brain which has lead to an overactive stress response in particular the Limbic system which has been shown to be affected by Covid, Long Covid, physical and mental stress, emotional stress, toxins, chemical exposure and vaccines By practicing neuroplasticity exercises, the brain can repair and the body can heal. I was very skeptical but the testimonials and my doctors recommendation for me to try it is what made me give it a go and I'm SO happy I did [Thisistoomuch](https://vestibular.org/participant/margaret2022/)and [Jwills](https://vestibular.org/participant/jwills1/)reacted [@j]Hi. I'm currently in the midst of a flare up too. I haven't had the pain this bad since around this time last year. I noticed mine flares up each time I get a virus. Hi KitKat, each time I have a flat up I get that gnawing feeling in my forearms and strong aching/pain in my hands/feet amongst many other symptoms, each flat up lasts 6-8 weeks. How long are your flare ups? Does your doctor have any idea why the pain? Sometimes I have put ice on my arms which helps distract me from the pain. I have also used A535, tiger balm and Biofreeze topically to distract me from it. I have also used clarity and Allegra but I can't tell if it's working or if I'm just coming out of the flare up (in at week 6 now of a flare up). I'm tired of this - now 1 year and 4 months since my 2nd P jab. You must be excused - I think I read that you have a baby too! That's a lot on your plate...I'm thinking of you and sending positive energy your way [J](https://vestibular.org/participant/j/) [@margaret2022]What steriods helped you? I haven't been given any steroids yet. My neurologist doesn't want to give me anything else until he sees me again which will be on Wednesday. I'm hoping he will give me a trial. But we shall see. I did take Flonase daily in the beginning which did help with my hearing sensitivity but I stopped because it was drying out my nose and it's not recommended to take more than 2 weeks at a time. I was also taking quceretin, b12, iron, vitamin c, vitamin d, zinc, glutathione, liposomal liquid i still take the b12 iron vitc vitamin d zinc. Nothing else I wanted to start on magnesium. I gotta read more about which one to take. Hi everyone, I just wanted to come on here with a SUCCESS story as I was on this forum regularly about a year ago with all of the debilitating symptoms that changed my life overnight including POTS, high BP, neuropathy, severe vertigo and dizziness, new panic attacks, horrific new anxiety, palpitations, paranoia, claustrophobia, severe food sensitivities, insomnia, severe neck pain, nerve pain all over, tremors and tingles, odd sensations in my face, gallbladder and pancreas pain, awful awful awful and saw every specialist and had every test under the sun I am doing GREAT and am feeling 100% as of May of 2022 (Had Pfizer shots summer of 2021, severe symptoms lasted August 2021-May 2022) My advice is: #1) Find yourself a functional/holistic medicine doctor, naturopathic doctor, cranial sacral/bodywork specialist/ therapist. You NEED someone to guide you with supplements and gentle detox protocols for YOU and they provide so much emotional support and are a wealth of knowledge of what works and what doesn't. They can run tests that regular useless docs cannot. I discovered I had underlying high toxicity from years of chemical exposure (hair salon, DIY projects, food, environmental), undiagnosed Lyme disease, parasites and mold exposure which I knew about (yes, very common and can cause debilitating symptoms that exacerbate Vax side effects, TMI I passed MANY visible parasites and still do on occasion, yikes but fascinating!) and had poor methylation and liver function and estrogen dominance plus now the added burden on my immune system of a vaccine that my body simply could not tolerate #2) DNRS or Gupta training. If you are experiencing odd symptoms especially neurological chances are your brain/limbic system is impaired and you are in fight or flight/sympathetic dominance and you cannot heal in this state easily. Covid and the vaccines are triggers for brain impairment and this explains the \"mystery symptoms\", the brain is overreacting and controls the immune, detox, endocrine, adrenals, heart etc etc. This was the MAIN THING that healed me! Watch YouTube testimonials under \"Retrain the brain\" or look into the Gupta program #3) Follow accounts on Instagram that will inspire your journey. (Dr. Charlie Fagenholz 2.0, Dr. CalvinNg from the Cohn Institute, Paola Xhuli, Dr. Cassie Huckaby, Dr. Motley, Dr. Stanton Hom, etc.)They prove that the body and mind can heal and a lot of them take clients virtually I followed parasite and mold protocols, chemical toxicity protocols, saw a holistic chiropractor, holistic naturopath, holistic functional medicine doc/cranial sacral therapist. It took time but DNRS really kicked my healing to gear within weeks. Find your team of people that resonate with you that can help but YOU CAN HEAL!! I hope this helps and never give up! Xo -Marie I also wanted to point out that many of us have undiagnosed and hidden pathogens like parasites, Lyme, EBV, mold exposure and other things that the vaccine can bring to light and cause severe symptoms There's a great podcast called \"Red Pill Your Health\" the episode about Covid and it explains vaccine reactions and long hauler problems and helpful supplements I highly recommend you listen to it it's awesome [https://open.spotify.com/episode/1zQQLHL629g8F7XwqUv0AG?si=NYhVEpS3SRmqHxKDtHEtgA](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1zQQLHL629g8F7XwqUv0AG?si=NYhVEpS3SRmqHxKDtHEtgA) [@ksharky13]I only had 2 pfizer shots but the adverse reactions were worse after the second shot im happy to say the dizziness,loss of balance,the feeling that your legs were no longer your own,heart palpitations and irregular rhythm have finally disappeared. It took 18 months from my first shot before I could say I was better. I gave up caffeine which helped immensely. One thing that never improved was my arthritis. I had mild arthritic pain mostly in my hands prior to the vaccine but experienced a huge flair in all my joints. I don't think this was a coincidence but to date Im still suffering. Hopefully that will ease up to. Are you on a medication regimen for your arthritis flare up. Also do your labs reflect your symptoms? Did any body take paxlovid for covid while still going through vaccine side effects and how was your covid experience? I tested for the first time covid positive yesterday and Iam not sure whether to let the body take its course or take paxlovid. I didn't take any boosters since the terrible side effects I suffered with dose 2 and Iam still suffering from side effects . Iam scared the covid infection will increase my side effects .Can anybody who have had covid after suffering side effects from vaccine let me know their experience with covid ?

Well here's the thing about plaxovid, it should be started within 5 days of onset of symptoms of covid for it to work. You should be in the high risk of complications category. According to them. But all in honesty regardless of timing it should still do the job of stopping the virus from replication to allow your body to heal. To my knowledge plaxovid should help your body fight off the virus better. I have not heard or read anything bad about it. In my clinic I've seen two people receive this medication without complication or worsening of their symptoms. It helped their respiratory symptoms from covid. I recall a post in this forum about a lady who had post vax issues as well that developed shingles. So she was given antivirals for the shingles and it helped with her post vax symptoms. But was then dealing with issues with shingles. I think of you search in key words related to shingles you might find it. I hope this information helps. Keep us updated.
