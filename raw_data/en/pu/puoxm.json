The Head Start Bureau and the Indian Health Service are committed to supporting Tribal governments as they work to insure the well being of their Tribal members, especially Head Start Program participants and their families. This document, the Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code, is intended for use as a tool by Tribal grantees as they work toward and maintain our shared goal of high quality early childhood environments. This Model Code was developed jointly by the Indian Health Service, the Head Start Bureau, and representatives from local Tribal Head Start Programs. Over the last several years, many challenges have been identified that have hindered some Tribal Head Start Programs, Indian Health Officials, and Head Start Bureau staff in reaching the environmental health goals for Tribal Head Start Programs. The development of this Model Code an d the training and technical assistance effort associated with this project will begin to address these challenges. The goals of this project are to: Improve coordination and consistency among local, Tribal, State, and Indian Health inspections, surveys and Federal review findings. Enhance communication among local programs, Federal and State offices, and training and technical assistance providers on the environmental health needs of Tribal Head Start Programs. Develop consistency in the understanding o f which codes should be applied in Tribal Head Start Programs. Federally recognized Tribes maintain a government to government relationship with the United States. The foundation for this relationship is respect for Tribal sovereignty. This Model Code i s being developed in an effort to maintain this respect for Tribal laws, regulations, and systems while also supporting Tribal Head Start Programs in determining how to comply with the Head Start Performance Standards, the Head Start Act, and other Federal regulations regarding environmental health and safety. When Tribal governments choose to apply for and receive Federal dollars, they are agreeing to abide by the terms of the grant. The Head Start Performance Standards are the operating requirements for all funded Head Start grants. These standards provide Head Start grantees with the required health and safety operating practices for the program. Several of these Standards reference local, State, and Tribal codes that must be followed in order to be fully in compliance with the Head Start Performance Standards. This creates a unique situation for some Tribes that do not have their own environmental health codes or choose not to follow State licensing requirements for early childhood program facilities. regional Head Start Programs, grantees are required by the Head Start Performance Standards to follow local and State guidelines, recommendations, and licensing requirements (HSPS- 1304.53(a)(6)). These State and local licensing requir ements are based on State or local health and safety codes that include fire codes, building codes, electrical codes, plumbing codes, transportation codes, food sanitation codes, sanitary facilities codes, hazardous waste codes and others. Together the Head Start Performance Standards with these State and local codes ensure a healthy and safe environment in Head Start facilities. When a Tribal government does not have these types of local codes in place for their Head Start Program to follow in partnership with the Head Start Performance Standards, the health and safety of the program participants and staff may be at risk. The Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code includes the health and safety requirements found in the Head Start Performance St andards as well as requirements of other applicable Federal laws, regulations, and requirements established by nationally recognized health and safety codes and standards of best practice. While it is acknowledged that local conditions often dictate special consideration, this Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code establishes basic health and safety requirements for Tribal Head Start Programs. There are several ways Tribal governments may want to use the Model Code to fulfill the intent of the He ad Start Performance Standards and ensure the health and safety of the participants attending Head Start programs. Tribes can choose to develop their own health and safety laws and regulations governing Head Start programs in addition to the Head Start P erformance Standards, Tribes can choose to follow State or local health and safety laws and regulations, Tribes can choose to follow Federal health and safety codes and nationally recognized health and safety standards presented in the Model Code. If Tribes decide to adopt their own health and safety regulations, then the Model Code can be used as the framework for these Tribal regulations. Tribes can add additional requirements or practices that they feel meet the health and safety needs of their children, parents and other participants. This Model Code was formatted so that a Tribe can easily make changes and additions for adoption as a Tribal code or standard. The Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code provides the basic requirements for evaluating the environmental health and safety of Tribal Head Start programs. In the absence of Tribal codes or applicable State codes, Indian Health Service, Office of Environmental Health Sanitarians will use this Model Code as the basis for their survey of American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start Programs. Tribal Environmental Health Advisors and Sanitarians are also encouraged to use this Model Code when evaluating the safety conditions at Head Start Programs. The Model Tribal Head Start H the findings of Environmental Health Advisors and Federal review teams. Use of the Model Code will facilitate data collection and the development of aggregate reports that can be used by grantees, the Head Start Bureau, American Indian Programs Branch, Tribal Sanitarians, the Indian Health Service (IHS) and training and technical assistance providers to identify needs and improve services to the grantees. Following each item in the Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code are reference numbers to various sections of the Head Start Performance Standard and to Federal regulations or national codes. (Example: HSPS 1304.22 (b)1)) These reference numbers are provided to assist those reviewing this Model Code with understanding how the items relate to the Head Start Performance Standards and to other regulations. Based on requests from grantees, Environmental Health Advisors and others, these reference numbers will appear in the final Model Code. The following code was developed for these reference numbers to indicate if they are citing an authorizing source, a policy clarification or best practice. A = Authorizing Source: An \"A\" before the reference number indicates that the reference is to an authorizing source, such as the Head Start Performance Standards and indicates that this is a quote from the authorizing source and compliance is required. For example (A -HSPS- 1304.22(b)(1)) PC = Policy Clarification: A \"PC\" before the reference number indicates that the reference is a policy clarification and although not specifically stated in the reference source, the item clarifies the intent of the reference citation. For example (PC- HSPS- 1304.53(a)(6)) BP = Best Practice Policy Clarification: A \"BP\" before the reference number indicates that the item establishes best practice with regard to the reference cited. For example (BP- HSPS- 1304.53(a)(10)) Some of the text in the Model Code is presented in bold Italics. This information is provided for clarif ication and understanding. The Model Code is developed to include those health and safety issues that are normally reviewed by State or local authorities in such areas as fire safety, building safety, functional design, playground safety, infection control, food sanitation and others. ealth and Safety Code will increase consistency DEFINITIONS Section 1 -101 Definitions The following definitions apply throughout this Model Head Start Health and Safety Code: 1. \"Accessible\" means capable of being entered, reached or utilized by individuals with physical disabilities, without the aid of an adult or other staff member. 2. \"Accessible to children\" means capable of being entered, reached or utilized by children under six ye ars of age, without assistance from an adult. 3. \"Act\" means the Head Start Act, 42 USC Sections 9801, et seq. 4. \"ACYF\" is the acronym used for the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, United States Department of Health and Human Services and includes regional personnel. 5. \"Adult\" means any person aged 18, or above. 6. \"Age of a Child\" means the age of a child on the date used to determine eligibility for public schools in the community in which the Head Start is located. 7. \"AIPB\" means the American Ind ian Programs Branch of the Head Start Bureau, ACYF, ACF, DHHS. 8. \"Allowable Alternative Vehicle\" means a vehicle designed for carrying eleven or more people, including the driver, that meets all the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to school buses, except 49 CFR 571.108 and 49 CFR 571.131. 9. \"Approved\" means approved by the Environmental Health Advisor. 10. \"Bus Monitor\" means a person with specific responsibilities for assisting the driver in insuring the safety of the children on and off the bus and for assisting the driver during emergencies. 11. \"Child/Children\" means any person/persons enrolled or receiving service in a Head Start Program Center. 12. \"Child Restraint System\" means any device, except Type I or Type II seat belts, designed to restrain, seat, or position children who weigh 50 pounds or less as described in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, 49 Drivers License\" means a license issued by a State or other jurisdiction, in accordance with the standards contained in 49 CFR part 383, to an individual, which authorized the individual to operate a class of commercial motor vehicle. 14. \"Confidential\" means available only to the Head Start Program staff, Head Start Program grantee, health care provider, AIPB, o r to the Environmental Health Advisor only with the permission of the named individual.

(PC-HSPS- 1304.22(a); 1304- 53(a)(7)&(8)) 3. The Head Start Director, or their designee, notifies their Environmental Health Advisor and the Head Start Bureau, American Indian Programs Branch, if the grantee is using health and safety codes established by their Tribe, the State or by the Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code. (PC-HSPS- 1304.53(a)(6)) 4. The Head Start Center staff, including regular volunteers, are knowledgeable and able to take required actions presented in the health and safety policies and procedures. (PC-HSPS- 1304.22(a)) 5. The staff receives annual training on the content, importance, and implementation of the health and safety policies and procedures during their orientation or during various training presentations provided during the year. The Head Start Director works with the Environmental Health Advisor to identify possible organizations or people who could provide needed training. Head Start Program Director and the Head Start Center Teaching Staff work with the Health Services Advisory Committee and the Environmental Health Advisor to develop a site- specific environmental health and safety program. (PC-HSPS- 1304.23(e)(1); PC -HSPS- 1304.53(a)(6)) 7. The grantee utilizes the expertise of the Environmental Health Advisor, the Health Service Advisory Committee and other health and safety professionals to assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the Head Start Center's environment al health and safety program.

The grantee makes available to HSB/AIPB, as necessary, all health and safety surveys conducted by the Environmental Health Advisor, to determine compliance with the Head Start Performance Standards. (PC\u00ad HSPS- 1304.23(e)(1); PC -HSPS- 1304.53(a)(6)) Environmental Health Advisor Roles and Responsibilities This section of the Model Code concerns the roles and responsibilities of the Environmental Health Advisor. As this is a Model Code for Head Starts, the role s and responsibilities of the Environmental Health Advisor are provided to clarify how this position should work with Head Start Programs and what the Head Start Programs should expect from their Environmental Health Advisor. 1. The Environmental Health Advisor is the person or office identified by the Tribe as responsible for providing environmental health and safety services for the Tribe. Generally, the Environmental Health Advisor is an Envi ronmental Health Officer or Sanitarian who's services are provided by the Indian Health Service, Division of Environmental Health Services, or by Indian Self- Determination Act, Title I and Title III, compacting or contracting Tribes. functio n of the Environmental Health Advisor is to ensure the health and safety of the participants, staff and visitors at a Head Start Center. These functions are carried out as an advisor to the Head Start Program and grantees in the area of environmental heal th and safety, unless the Environmental Health Advisor is an employee of the Tribe and is granted enforcement authority. The Environmental Health Advisor also provides technical assistance to the grantee by identifying health and safety issues and working with the grantees to correct these issues. 3. The Environmental Health Advisor, within available resources, surveys each Head Start Center prior to its commencement of operation, and at least annually thereafter. If a grantee determines that some or all of their Head Start Centers are surveyed by State or other agencies, then the Environmental Health Advisor reviews State reports and works with the grantee to address health and safety issues presented in these State reports. (BP-HSPS- 1304.23(e)(1)) 4. In order to provide information and data on the health and safety conditions of Head Start programs, the Environmental Health Advisors are strongly encouraged to use the Head Start Electronic Inspection System Survey software. This software allows the compilatio n and analysis of health and safety data on Head Start Programs at the local, regional and national level. Grantees, funding agencies and health agencies can use this data to identify funding needs, identify technical assistance and training needs and general health and safety conditions in Head Starts Centers. 5. Based upon these surveys, the Environmental Health Advisor makes a determination if the health and safety of a Head Start Center is satisfactory. The Environmental Health Advisor prepares a report to the Head Start Director or others as designated by the grantee, on health and safety issues identified and makes recommendations for corrective actions needed. 6. The Environmental Health Advisor has the authority to declare the existence of an imminent health hazard. 7. When an imminent health hazard is identified, the Environmental Health Advisor provides a verbal recommendation to the Head Start Center Teacher in charge for immediate elimination of the hazard or evacuation, and if necessary securing th e Head Start Center. 15 8. The Environmental Health Advisor provides a written notification of the imminent health hazard, including what the hazard is, the relative risk of the hazard, and makes recommendations for an immediate halt to operation or eliminatio n of the health hazard. The written notification is provided to the grantee within 24 hours of identifying the imminent health hazard, following the grantee's established chain of command for the Head Environmental Health Advisor, upon request and within available resources, provides technical assistance to the grantee, Head Start Program Directors, and Head Start Teaching staff on environmental health and safety issues. Section 3 -102 Environmental Heal th and Safety Surveys 1. The annual environmental health and safety survey conducted by the Environmental Health Advisor is based upon adherence to appropriate Tribal or State requirements or to this Model Tribal Head Start H ealth and Safety Code. (PC-1306.30(c)) 2. The Environmental Health Advisor uses the Head Start Electronic Inspection System software to generate survey reports. If other reports are generated, then the Environmental Health Advisor should utilize the section titles in Chapter 4 -Technical of this code for their report format to ensure that all survey reports are consistent in detail and approach. 3. All environmental health surveys are conducted or reviewed by a National or State certified Registered Sanitarian (RS) or Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS). 4. The Head Start Director requests the Environmental Health Advisor to conduct a pre-operational environmental health survey on any new or remodeled Head Start Center. The survey is conducted after construction is completed and prior to operation of the Head Start Center. 5. The Head Start Director requests that the Environmental Health Advisor conducts a pre- occupancy survey on any existing building or portions of a building that are intended for use as a Head Start Center. The Environmental Health Advisor provides a written report to the Head Start Director of any problems identified and makes a recommendation as to the suitability of this facility for use as a Head Start facility. The intent of the pre- occupancy survey is suitability of existing buildings or portions of a building as temporary or permanent facilities and to avoid unnecessary expenses. 6. Access is granted to the Environmental Health Advisor to evaluate the environmenta l health and safety of a Head Start Program Center during reasonable working hours. Section 3 -103 New Construction and Major Renovations The Head Start programs and the Environmental Health Advisor should work together as a team to review and develop pl ans for a new or renovated Head Start Center. The Environmental Health Advisor should function as part of the Center design team to have input and review of plans before the plans get to the final stage of development. The purpose of the plan review process is to identify health and safety issues with a proposed construction project or remodeling project while the project is still in the planning stage. This should prevent unexpected costs and delays in the provision of new or remodeled Head Start Centers. This review process does not replace the requirements found in HSPS- 1309.10. 1. Construction and remodeling plan reviews utilize the Model Tribal Head Start Health and Safety Code, Chapters 4, and 5 , or other applicable Tribal or State health and safety requirements to ensure that reviews are consistent in detail and approach. This review process does not replace the requirements found in HSPS- 1309.10. 2. Prior to any construction or major renovation to a Head Start Center, one set each of engineering/arch itectural plans and site plans should be submitted to the Environmental Health Advisor for review and approval. a. Plans are stamped by a licensed architect or engineer. b. Plans are of sufficient detail so that compliance with applicable health and safety requirements can be determined. c. The site plans submitted include the availability of utilities such as water, sewage disposal and electrical supply, the location of access roads and the location of any natural or man -made threats within one mile of the proposed Head Start Center. d. The Environmental Health Advisor's review of the plans is limited to a review of the functional design, including fire safety, infection control, food sanitation, playground safety and basic plumbing. e.

The Environmental Health Advisor provides written findings and recommendations on submitted plans within 60 calendar days maximum. Section 3 -104 Staffing Ratios Staffing ratios are important for effective teaching and for addressing the developmental needs of the children, and also to ensure the health and safety of the children. In many cases the staff to student ratios for teaching and development are not the same as those required for health and safety. The differences are often due to fire safety concerns and requirements. The Head Start Performance Standards establish staff to child ratios based primarily on effective teaching and developmental principals. Fire codes establish staff to child ratios based on effective and safe evacuation and supervision of children in the event of a fire emergency. Many fire codes establish staff to child ratios more stringent than the Head Start Performance Standards. In accordance with the HSPS 1304.53(a)(6), a Head Start program is required to follow the more stringent staff to child ratios. For those Head Start Programs where there is no applicable Tribal or State fire code, then the staff to child ratio requirements of the Head Start Performance Standards and the National Fire Protection Association, Life Safety Code are followed. (PC-HSPS- 1306.30(c); A -HSPS- 1304.52(g)(4)) 1.

(PC-HSPS- 1304.22(a)(3)) Section 4 -117 Dangerous Chemicals and Materials Hazard communication programs: All employees are entitled to information about chemical hazards they are exposed to in the workplace. The federal Hazard are the best method to ensure this information is provided. Exceptions to the required Hazard Communication Program are based chemical. Head Start Centers usually use consumer products in their Centers. A consumer product is anything that can be purchased in a retail store and is therefore available to the general public for personal or household use. There is still a hazard associated with the use of these consumer products . Environmental Health Advisors should provide guidance to their Head Start Programs on the types and amounts of chemical products needed for use by a Head Start Center. 1. The Head Start Center program is not required to have a hazard communication program as required by OSHA, 1910.1200 if a Head Start Center uses consumer products or hazardous substances, as those terms are defined in the Consumer Product Safety Act (15U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) and Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq) respectively, where the grantee can show: on use of the chemical, amount of exposure expected and the hazard of the a. that consumer products or hazardous substances are used in the workplace for the purpose intended by the chemical manufacturer or importer of the product, and; b. the use results in a duration and frequency of exposure whi ch is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended. (PC-HSPS- 1304.53(a)(8); PC -HSPS- 1304.53(a)(10)(iii); (A- OSHA- 1910.1200(b)(6)(ix)) To meet this exemption, the grantee need only show that employee use of a consumer product containing hazardous chemicals is of a duration and frequency that clearly does not exceed what a reasonable person would concede to be normal consumer use in a home environment. A common sense approach must be used in evaluating the need for a Hazard Communication Program. The frequency and duration of use must be considered. For example, it may not be necessary to have a data sheet for a can of cleanser used to clean the sink in a restroom. However, if such cleanser is used in large quantities to clean processing equipment, it should be addressed in the Hazard Communication Program. 2. The Head Start Center uses consumer products or hazardous substances, for purposes or in amounts and frequencies other than as described in Section 4 \u00ad 117(1), and the Head Start Center has a hazard communication program as described in OSHA, Title 15, Chapter 47, Section 1910.1200. The hazard communication program includes an identified responsible staff, a written hazard communication program document, a list of all hazardous chemicals in the Head Start Center, material safety data sheets for all hazardous chemicals, and employee information and training. If Consumer products are labeled in Consumer Pr oduct Safety Commission, then this label will suffice. MSDS sheets and training are required as for any other hazardous chemical. The Environmental Health Advisor assists the Head Start Director with development of the hazardous communication program. (PC-HSPS- 1304.53(a)(8); PC -HSPS- 1304.53(a)(10)(iii); (A- OSHSA -1910.1200(b)(5)(v)) 3.
