Yep, a grown adult has around 2 square meters of skin*. Even more importantly, did you know that whatever you use topically on your skin gets absorbed straight into your bloodstream? Sounds scary, but it's true \u2014 your skin basically 'eats' whatever you put on it. In fact, the average woman absorbs nearly 2.5 kilos of damaging chemicals** per year due to beauty products. Holy yikes! All those toxic (and not to mention seriously expensive) chemicals are going straight through your skin and into your body, where your poor little liver has to go into serious overdrive to try to remove them. This uses up 'beauty energy', as nutritionist Kimberly Snyder calls it. Our body could be using that energy to make our hair and skin shiny, our eyes bright and our nails strong, but because the liver has to work extra hard just to detox the chemical nasties, it doesn't have time to do those other things. Cue dull skin, limp hair, flaky nails and tired, gray eyes... not exactly the picture of perfect health, right?! So let me ask you this: Would you spray your deodorant into your mouth? Or spread your mascara on your gluten free toast? Hell no, sister! So why are you slathering them on your body?! There is no better time than right now to take a look at the products you use on your skin. Every time you go to slather something on that beautiful temple of yours, ask yourself: is this good for me and my health? If it is, go right ahead. If not, bin it baby! About 6 years ago, I took a massive black garbage bag into my bathroom and got rid of everything. And I mean everything. I was the type of person that had 15 different glittery moisturizers, 7 different smelling deodorants, and 5 different shades of foundations \u2014 all highly toxic and not good for me. At the time, I loved slathering myself in all those different smelling lotions and potions, but when I learned about the dangers of toxic products, I realized the risk wasn't worth it and decided to start from scratch and only put healthy products on my body. But if you've ever tried to decipher which products are actually good for you, and which ones aren't worth the plastic they're packaged in, you'll know that it can be ridiculously confusing to work out. Sneaky marketing tactics (which are perfectly legal and accepted within the cosmetics industry) would have us believe that if a product has labels like 'natural ingredients' or 'made from pure aloe' plastered on it, it must be ok for our precious bodies. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and many manufacturers use those terms when their products are decidedly unnatural and unhealthy. So what's the answer? Basically, unless you have read and understood every ingredient on an ingredients list and know exactly what is in the product... don't buy it. With so many chemicals and ingredients on the market, it can be super confusing, but let me give you a little hint; if you can't pronounce it and or don't know what it is, it's generally not a natural ingredient. Meaning: steer clear! If you get stuck, try consulting the [Environmental Working Group's](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) website. They're a fab organization dedicated to helping you navigate through the web of beauty and body products, so if in doubt jump on their awesome site. Vote with your dollar.
