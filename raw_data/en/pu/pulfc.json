The private sector generates the vast majority of the nation's economic output, and businesses may find it in their interest to undertake measures that can help reduce the nation's vulnerability to attack and the subsequent potential losses. This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) paper, prepared at the request of the Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, examines the role of the private sector in responding to the threat of terrorism in the United States since September 11.

Vulnerabilities, Potential Losses, and Regulatory Regimes for Large Dams and Reservoirs 30Summary T he events of September 11, 2001, raised the na- tion's awareness of the potential scale of terrorist attacks, the likelihood of such attacks, and the benefits of spend-ing on homeland security. Since that date, the public sec- tor has undertaken efforts to boost security against terror- ism. At the same time, there have been calls for new laws or regulations that would require businesses to assume an increased role in the nation's defense against terrorists. Those calls rest on the premise that the social benefits from private spending to enhance security are greater than the private benefits to the businesses making those spending decisions. If not, then businesses already have incentives to do as much as the nation would find cost- effective to enhance homeland security. This paper examines issues surrounding enhanced secu- rity efforts by private industry. For several important in-dustries, it describes the vulnerabilities and potential losses\u2014to both the private sector and the nation as a whole\u2014that would underlie the expected costs of terror- ist attacks and, hence, the broader benefits of security. The paper also reviews the incentives for private actions to limit vulnerabilities and losses for those industries and the existing government programs that address those in- centives. Although September 11 stands out as a unique event in U.S. history, many situations exist in which the social benefits from private actions to \"take care\" exceed the pri-vate benefits of such activities. In fact, existing regulatory requirements for the industries examined here provide in- centives\u2014and in some case, clear directives\u2014for private parties to take care. Many of those requirements were ini-tiated to meet policy goals for public safety and environ- mental protection. The overall effect of current programs constitutes a \"baseline\" of incentives and institutions for protecting the nation, against which any new efforts can be assessed. Finally, the paper lists ideas in three broad groups for new approaches that might prompt industries to do more to enhance security: those that would cause businesses to internalize more of the social costs of terror-ist attacks; those that would have the government assume more of the direct responsibility for actions to reduce vul- nerabilities and losses from attacks on industry; and those that would improve information that might facilitate pri-vate actions. In the more than three years since the September 11 attacks, lawmakers have enacted legislation affecting homeland security. They have created the Department of Homeland Security and federalized aviation security. To support the Congress's consideration of homeland secu-rity policy, this paper presents ideas that could improve security in several key industries. The evaluation is neces- sarily incomplete because agencies and the Congress both are engaged in ongoing processes to evaluate threats and develop options to address them. The analysis is also at a general level and does not address policy specifics or costs. Industries Analyzed This paper focuses on those industries for which the ex- pected human and economic losses from a terrorist attack would be highest\u2014the country's \"critical infrastructure.\" The analysis more narrowly focuses on those industries that reside largely in the private sector and for which an attack could lead to a direct loss of life. The four activities reviewed here, selected from a longer list of critical indus- tries identified by the Department of Homeland Security and chosen because attacks on them could be an immedi-ate threat to lives and health, are: BCivilian nuclear power, BChemicals and hazardous materials (including oil and natural gas), BElectricity service, and BFood and agriculture.x HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR Civilian Nuclear Power Nuclear power plants and the nuclear materials that are being processed or transported or have accumulated as ra- dioactive wastes may be subject to attacks. Safety inci-dents at U.S. nuclear plants and attacks by terrorists abroad have illustrated the potential to harm people and have long-lasting effects on the environment. T wo broad classes of attack that are of special concern are direct at-tacks (or sabotage) on either nuclear power reactors or the large amounts of spent fuel stored at nuclear plants. The human, environmental, and economic costs from a successful attack on the nuclear power industry could far exceed the value of the nuclear plants themselves. In the most significant incident in the United States to date\u2014 the partial meltdown that occurred at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania\u2014private economic losses have totaled more than $2 billion. (That sum includes the loss of the nuclear facility, costs of decontamination at the site, costs for decommissioning the destroyed plant, costs associated with initial evacuation of neighbors, and ongoing costs for monitoring the health of local residents.) Assessments of the actual vulnerability of and potential losses to the nuclear power industry vary widely, with some industry experts believing that little danger exists. However, even according to studies in which the proba- bility of an extreme accident has been postulated to be very remote, the losses from such as accident could be se- vere. For example, a study by Sandia National Laborato- ries indicated that in an extreme scenario\u2014with full re- lease of nuclear materials, worst-case atmospheric conditions, and no emergency response\u2014there could be very high losses associated with reactors near population centers. For a reactor near Limerick, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, the study estimated 75,000 fatali-ties within a year of the accident, 700,000 injuries, and about $200 billion in costs. Concerning releases from spent nuclear fuel, a study by Brookhaven National Labo- ratory estimated that a severe accident involving only that waste could cause up to 20,000 cancer fatalities and nearly $60 billion in damages. In contrast, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the laboratory's estimate overstates the scope of radiation release that is reasonable to consider, even in a worst case. Such differences in loss and probability assessments highlight the fact that esti- mates are fraught with uncertainty even when prepared for accidental occurrences, not terrorist-instigated events.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has principal au- thority for regulating civilian nuclear power for public safety. That regulation covers nuclear fuels, nuclear reac- tors, and spent fuels. Regarding the latter, the Depart-ment of Energy (DOE) has primary responsibility for the planning and construction of a permanent disposal facil- ity for high-level radioactive wastes at Yucca Mountain, Nevada\u2014funded in large part from fees paid by nuclear power producers. In addition, other federal programs act to promote nuclear power. They include the indemnity program under the Price-Anderson Act, through which the government addresses the negative financial impact on industry from uncertainty about nuclear accidents, and DOE programs that fund research and development of nuclear technologies. Chemicals and Hazardous Materials The security of the chemical industry is important prima-rily because of the dangers that flammable and toxic chemicals pose for release into the air or water or for im- mediate explosion and fire. Attacks could be launched on facilities handling such chemicals or the vehicles that rou-tinely transport chemicals through densely populated ar-eas. Alternatively, the chemicals themselves could be used as a weapon. Although an individual business and per- haps a local economy would be harmed by an attack, the national economy would be largely unaffected because many alternative sources exist for almost every chemi- cal\u2014including inventories, other suppliers, and substi- tute chemicals. Flammable petrochemicals (inc luding fuels, solvents, and the raw materials to make plastics) are concentrated at a relatively few large production facilities. Another flamma-ble substance, nitrate fertilizer, is available from thou-sands of agricultural distributors across the country and can form the key ingredient of explosive devices. How- ever, because the areas affected by the explosion or burn-ing of flammable substances are generally limited to the immediate site, relatively few people are expected to be affected by those types of incidents, even in a worst case. In contrast, small volumes of highly toxic substances re- leased into the air or water could spread farther and affect larger populations. Those substances include ammonia and chlorine, which are used in refrigeration, municipal water purification, and many commercial applications. Each would be poisonous if released in industrial concen- tration. The great majority of facilities and vessels that SUMMARY xi hold ammonia and chlorine are small and would put rela- tively few people at risk. Federal, state, and local programs already exist to require or encourage the operators of chemical facilities and the transporters and holders of dangerous chemicals to boost their efforts to promote safety and security and to share information that can help local governments plan for emergencies. Much of the state and local effort is oriented toward emergency preparedness. The federal effort in- cludes worker-safety, environmental, and information programs. Key federal legislation related to the safety of chemical facilities includes the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA). The EPCRA requires operators of chemical facilities to pre-pare contingency plans for possible accidents, provide in- formation to local planners on the chemicals they handle, and notify local officials of any sudden release. The CAAA mandates a role for the Environmental Protection Agency in overseeing risk-m anagement planning by facil- ities that handle threshold volumes of certain hazardous chemicals identified in the act and by the agency. (Thresholds for toxic substances are based on toxicity and volatility, while thresholds for flammable substances are based on the potential for a vapor-cloud explosion.) Electricity Service The vulnerabilities that the nation's electricity supply faces from terrorism are similar to those that the electric-ity industry confronts from extreme weather and other natural events, accidents, and equipment failures. A ter- rorist event could disable major physical components of the supply network or disrupt the performance of the network's control centers. The potential losses from such disruptions would be limited and of relatively short dura-tion because the industry and electricity customers are generally well prepared for such failures. Concerns about terrorist attacks may give additional support to proposals that have been discussed to improve the reliability of power supplies, including several related to the competi-tive restructuring of power markets. The major vulnerabilities of electricity supplies probably are associated most with regional transmission systems\u2014the power grids that carry electricity at high voltage from power sources to communities. Experiences with major outages involving regional grids suggest ways that a tar-geted attack could lead to widespread loss, although still for only short periods. Outages that could be longer last-ing would be those resulting fr om attacks on high-voltage transformers, which are difficult to replace quickly. The costs of an attack on the nation's power supply are likely to be small. The electricity industry is generally well prepared to prevent and mitigate disruptions attrib-utable to many types of system failures\u2014regardless of the cause\u2014so the scale and duration of a disruption would be limited. The prospect of disruptions resulting from the simultaneous loss of several high-voltage transformers could raise the costs of an attack on a targeted commu-nity. However, even in that event, the flexibility of elec-tricity consumers and the economy in general to adapt to power losses would help limit the costs of any disruptions that did occur. Apprehensions about terrorism are part of the industry's more general concern about providing a reliable supply. Investments and operational practices intended to make electricity service reliable are recognized costs covered in the regulated rates that utilities charge their customers. Many groups are involved in ensuring a reliable supply. Historically, the industry has been structured and regu-lated as regional, vertically integrated monopolies, with state public utility commissions overseeing local opera-tions and approving rates for retail sales and the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission overseeing interstate transmission and rates for wholesale trade. For those util-ities, regulators approve investments that reflect the social and private costs of service interruptions\u2014generally pro-viding for sufficient excess capacity to overcome the loss of at least one important component at a time. The North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry group, also establishes voluntary standards as part of its mission to oversee a reliable wholesale electricity supply in North America. Food and Agriculture The food and agriculture industry faces vulnerability to attack because of the great number of products at risk and the many unsecured points of access in production, stor- age, and distribution. In addi tion to posing threats to health and public safety, disruptions could cause eco-nomic harm. The food and agriculture industry is vulnerable to four basic types of assaults: contamination of food with natu-ral agents (such as botulism and E. coli bacteria), contam-ination of food with man-made contaminants (such as poisons and foreign objects), attacks to disrupt food sup-xii HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR plies (including the use of fires, floods, or biological agents such as foot-and-mouth disease and insects), and use of agricultural resources as weapons for attacks on other targets (such as wildfires that spread to residential areas, nitrate fertilizer for use in explosives, pesticides for poisoning, crop dusters to spread toxins, or radioactive materials used in food irradiation). Many systems are in place to ensure the safety of food supplies and thus reduce the vulnerability to a terrorist act involving food and agriculture as well as limit any re-sulting losses. However, risks remain from attacks involv-ing substances that the government does not regularly test for and that may not be readily identified by government agencies and public health officials. The number of pub-licly documented crimes that have been perpetrated with the intent of harming people or disrupting supplies is small. At the same time, those few known assaults and a number of incidents involvin g the unintentional contam- ination of food confirm the potential threats of terrorism to public health. The nation's economic costs from a disruption of particu- lar food supplies would probably be small, primarily be-cause the food and agriculture industry is well adapted to the prospect of disruptions from weather, pests, and occa- sional health incidents. The regulation of the food and agriculture industry in- volves a number of organizations within four different federal agencies: the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Agriculture, the De- partment of Commerce, and the Environmental Protec-tion Agency. In the food safety system, HHS's Food and Drug Administration has perhaps the biggest responsibil-ity, regulating about 80 percen t of the nation's food sup- plies to protect consumers against impure, unsafe, and fraudulently labeled foods. The nation's public health sys- tem, including the Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is organized to help identify, contain, and treat food-related attacks. Existing government programs also sustain the income of agricul-tural producers. The Private Sector's Role in Homeland Security\u2014A General Framework Markets provide a variety of incentives to producers, their customers, and local communities to guard against a wide range of risks, including the possibility of terrorism. Pri-vate producers of goods and services generally will benefit from safe operating practices (including physical security) and the purchase of insurance to help limit any financial losses. But the incentives for private businesses to reduce their vulnerability to attack, and the potential losses for those who would be affected, may be inadequate when the private costs of the threat of terrorism are lower than the social costs (or, equivalently, when the private benefits from security measures are less than the social benefits). Private costs would be closely associated with damages to production and distribution facilities and the harm to in-dustry workers, as well as the potential loss of business. But the total social costs could go further and include the harm or loss of life to individuals (such as the neighbors of a targeted facility or the consumers of a tainted prod- uct), damage to the local environment, and negative ef-fects on other businesses dependent on the targeted in- dustry. If the product of the targeted industry became a potential weapon in attacks elsewhere, the social costs could be broader still. For example, stolen chemicals could be used to attack an office building. If the disparity between private costs and social costs is significant , the result is that private firms have insufficient incentive to meet social objectives. Many of the government programs that existed before September 11 are intended to bring private and social costs into line. Many firms, especially those in the four critical industries studied here, had long been subject to extensive government intervention because of the dangers that those industries' operations or products can pose to public safety, environmental quality, and local economies. Existing government programs provide a starting point for examining possible new efforts. Those programs may be adequate to prompt businesses to address much or all of the increased terrorist threat. But if private efforts are inadequate, policy options for prompting additional ef- forts will probably build on the incentives generated by existing requirements. Cost-eff ective policies for enhanc- ing homeland security may involve expanding some pro-grams that have nonsecurity goals while reducing others. For example, programs that were intended primarily to help protect the public from relatively common threats, such as industrial accidents or food contamination, could be expanded to help address the terrorist threat. But pro- grams that were intended to disseminate information on critical industries, such as the production and storage ca-SUMMARY xiii pacities of hazardous facilities, might need to be curtailed to keep that information out of the hands of terrorists. This paper generally groups government intervention to align the private and social costs of business decisions about security into three broad areas: BPrograms that would internalize the costs of security to private markets by establishing new standards or in- centives to make businesses and customers in an in-dustry face the full costs of possible losses. BPrograms that would socialize the costs of security by having the government and taxpayers directly bear the costs of reducing losses, whether through the govern-ment's own efforts or its financing of efforts by busi-nesses and customers. BPrograms that would provide the private sector with information on the risk of attacks, the losses from at-tack, and opportunities to reduce losses. If a chemical production facility was subject to an attack, for example, the ensuing fire or explosion could expose the surrounding community to dangerous toxins. That added exposure would represent a social cost that the pri- vate firm would not face\u2014especially if the damage ex- ceeded the limits of the owner's insurance coverage and other financial resources. As a result, the owner would have less incentive than otherwise to guard against such attacks, scale back operations, or relocate. Current gov- ernment programs affecting the safety of chemical-plant operations and supporting local emergency preparations are a response to that social cost and also contribute to homeland security. However, the increased awareness of the terrorist threat since September 11\u2014if not the threat itself\u2014also may indicate a need to step up security efforts since the social benefits of spending on security have in-creased. The type of intervention that would force industry to in- ternalize the costs of security (and for which it would bear the immediate costs) would include requirements to take preventive measures, assessment of penalties for failing to take certain actions, or imposition of taxes on certain ac- tivities or products. The type of intervention that would have the government socialize the cost\u2014so that everyone paid for the enhanced security\u2014would include new programs that rewarded in- dustry for taking measures to protect vulnerable facilities or make those facilities less dangerous (for example, by supporting the adoption of safer production processes or the use of safer chemicals). Alternatively, rather than force or pay industry to make certain changes, new programs could help inform nearby residents of the dangers of an attack or inform industry of currently available options for reducing its vulnerabilities. Strategies to Enhance Homeland Security The broad strategies described in this paper are not policy recommendations, nor do they delineate policies in any detail. Many of the ideas build on programs now in place for one industry that may be applicable to another indus-try or, where several industries already are subject to simi-lar requirements, that may help identify effective alterna-tive approaches. Some of the ideas are currently being considered by the Congress or have been proposed else-where. For nuclear power and chemicals, some common themes emerge. Among new approaches that would internalize more of the costs of terrorist attacks within an industry are: BEstablishing fees or taxes on sales of the industry's product or service to discourage its use (in cases in which less production would mean lower potential losses); BEstablishing new regulations for tracking the owner-ship of hazardous chemicals that could be used as weapons; BEstablishing new, more stringent regulations that would require safe production practices (for example, increasing monitoring for toxic chemical releases or limiting volumes of the spent nuclear material stored near reactors); BCreating financial disincentives for businesses or resi-dents to locate in danger zones (for example, by re-quiring higher insurance coverage or limiting other available business tax incentives);xiv HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR BEstablishing enhanced incentives and protection for reporting unsafe practices, conflicts with best-technol- ogy safety practices, or other sources of vulnerability and potential losses; and BRequiring additional insurance coverage. Alternatively or in combination, new approaches for the nuclear and chemical industries could socialize the costs of security\u2014placing the direct costs of enhancing security on taxpayers. If the federal government has a strong cost advantage over the private sector in performing certain security activities, federalizing those activities may be cost-effective. New initiatives could include: BEstablishing positive fiscal incentives for businesses to adopt safer designs or production processes; BProviding financial assistance to people and businesses to move away from potentially hazardous sites; and BFederalizing and expanding the current level of perim-eter security, structural defenses, and employeescreening. Businesses and neighboring communities may underesti- mate the likelihood of a terrorist attack and thus mis- gauge the risks and costs of such an incident. Some ideas for new approaches related to nuclear power and chemi- cals that could help improve information include: BPreparing vulnerability assessments and potential damage assessments that better reflect the worst-case scenarios for terrorist attacks (rather than accidentscenarios);BMaking additional information available to govern- ments on the vulnerability of certain facilities and products, both to aid in emergency planning and to encourage businesses to reduce those vulnerabilities; BEstablishing emergency planning zones that better re-flect current information on estimates of losses and ac-count for more-complex worst-case failures (for example, involving multiple systems or attacks on multiple industries); and BEstablishing a national zoni ng system (for chemical plants and nuclear plants) to help inform property owners of their risks. Potential strategies for electricity service include prepar- ing for the threat of attack on critical equipment that might require significant time to replace (such as high-voltage transformers) and supporting reforms that would make the electricity supply more reliable in the event of a disruption. Providing more information on alternative supplies of electricity could enable consumers to reduce their dependence on single, vulnerable suppliers. For the food and agriculture industry, initiatives that would help internalize the costs of attacks within the in- dustry could include requirements for enhanced product labeling and tracking (to help identify and contain a po- tential contamination) and changes in the product speci- fications or tracking requirements for dangerous agricul- tural supplies (in particular, nitrate fertilizers and pesticides that can be used as weapons). Some of those costs might be borne by the public if the government in- creased its inspection of food supplies.1 Introduction T he events of September 11, 2001, and subsequent revelations of terrorist plans raised the nation's awareness of the potential scale of terrorist attacks, the likelihood of such attacks, and, as a result, the potential losses from ter- rorism. Federal, state, and local governments as well as the private sector may contribute to security efforts to help reduce the chances of attack and the losses from an attack at the lowest overall cost to the economy. The pri- vate sector generates the vast majority of the nation's eco-nomic output, and there are corresponding incentives and opportunities for businesses to undertake security measures. Nevertheless, the few data that are available suggest that since September 11, relatively little addi- tional spending has come from the private sector. 1 There have been calls for new laws or regulations that would require businesses to take an increased role in the nation's defense against terrorists, an approach that as- sumes it would be cost-effective for the private sector to enhance homeland security. This paper reviews the vul- nerabilities and potential losses for several key industries and the current market and government incentives and institutions for undertaking security efforts. The paper describes a broad range of policy approaches for each in- dustry that could enhance the existing, or \"baseline,\" in-centives for security. The baseline consists of current pro- grams, laws, and regulations that affect the likelihood of attack, the potential damage from attack, and the re-sponse to (and ultimate cost of) an attack. The options for new initiatives are not policy recommendations, nor do they delineate policies in any detail. What Is Homeland Security? Homeland security has been described as a \"concerted na-tional effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur.\" 2 At a basic level, enhancing security means reduc- ing the potential losses from terrorist attacks and the risk of such attacks. \"Terrorism\" means criminal acts by indi-viduals or groups (whether of domestic or foreign origin) motivated by political or social agendas. Statutory defini-tions of terrorism refer to criminal acts that are dangerous to human life and appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a gov-ernment by intimidation or coercion, or affect the con-duct of a government. 3 In common usage (and in this pa- per), terrorism also includes acts that may be designed to harm property and, more broadly, economic infrastruc-ture, with the intent of furthering some political or social objective. From a public policy perspective, attacks by similar means may be associated with national security threats (perpetrated by foreign governments) and criminal threats (perpetrated by indi viduals for their personal gain). And similar damages may occur from natural events, technological failures, or human error. As a result, homeland security activities are closely related to ongoing CHAPTER 1.

The basic legal definitions of international and domestic terrorism appear in 18 U.S.C. 2331.2 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR activities by businesses and governments to promote gen- eral safety. Viewed from the perspective of existing policies, busi- nesses already may be doing as much as is in the national interest to enhance homeland security, given that thelowest-cost options may be dominated by the public sec-tor. However, private incentives for security that were ad-equate before September 11 may now be considered in-sufficient. If so, new government interventions to enhance private security efforts may be appropriate. A Focus of Security Concerns: Critical Industries Critical industries are those in which the expected human and economic losses from a terrorist attack would be highest. Expected losses reflect both the probability of at-tack (as jointly determined by the attractiveness of a tar- get and its vulnerability) and the amount of damage that could occur. Losses may be associated with the incidental damage and loss of life that result from the destruction of facilities or the diversion of hazardous materials to attacks elsewhere, with the direct harm from contamination of products, or with the indirect harm from the loss of prod-ucts or services. The risk of such attacks may also entail losses, including direct emotional trauma and economic losses because employees or customers want to avoid the industry. Of immediate concern in prot ecting homeland security are the physical assets that could be attacked (including factories, buildings, transmission lines, and the like) and the less-tangible assets (such as networks for moving goods, energy, or information) that could be threatened. People could be harmed from a disruption of emergency services during a power outage as well as in a direct as-sault on a factory. The nation has adopted the term \"crit-ical infrastructure\" to describe such targets (see Box 1-1 for more details about the concept of critical infrastruc-ture). The Department of Homeland Security has identified a number of critical industries with \"infrastructures so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a de-bilitating impact on defense or economic security.\" 4 Those critical-infrastructure sectors are agriculture, food, water, public health, emergency services, government, de-fense, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and finance, chemicals, and postal and shipping services. 5 This paper focuses on four of those critical-infrastructure industries that reside largely in the private sector. Those industries are: BCivilian nuclear power, BChemicals and hazardous materials (including oil and natural gas), BElectricity service, and BFood and agriculture. Why the Private Sector Might Spend Too Little on Security Businesses would be inclined to spend less on security than might be appropriate for the nation as a whole if they faced losses from an attack that would be less than the overall losses for society. A number of common cir-cumstances can exist in private industry in which there is a gap between the private and public costs of a terrorism event. Private costs for businesses or individuals could include spending for defensive measures to lower their vulnerabil- ity to attack, changes in location or operations to reduce their losses from an actual attack, or emergency-response capabilities to help contain those losses. Businesses could also reduce exposure to some types of losses by scaling back operations. But when terrorists target a business, they put others at risk, too. Those other businesses and individuals may not be in a position to undertake their own security efforts\u2014for example, they may not know about the threat. And in some cases, they may not be able to hold the targeted business liable for the damages that they incur. The social costs of terrorism would be the sum of those costs incurred by others and the private costs incurred by the targeted business. 4.

Office of Homeland Security, The National Strategy for Homeland Security .CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 3 Incomplete information about the nature of the vulnera- bilities, the potential losses, or the costs of options for en-hancing security can lead to too little private spending on security, especially when all of the affected players do not have access to the same information. For example, a busi-ness may know about its exposure to attack, but the firm's customers or the surrounding community (and local emergency planners) may not. Or the government may have knowledge of threats, losses, or solutions that private businesses do not have. (In some cases, there may be an argument for withholding available information on vul-nerabilities or losses if that disclosure would increase the attractiveness of a particular target to terrorists. That pos- sibility should be weighed in considering policy opera-tions to improve private incentives for spending onsecurity.) The term \"moral hazard\" describes the reluctance of busi- nesses or individuals to undertake protective measures that are otherwise in their interest because they believe that someone else will pay the bill for any damages that are incurred. Insurance companies try to avoid that prob-lem by requiring their customers to take preventive mea- sures or encouraging them to do so through the premium structure or copayments. In the case of homeland secu- rity, the prospect of moral hazard can create a gap be-tween social and private costs if, for example, businesses expect the government to compensate them for major losses from an attack. What Is the Government's Role? If the social costs of terrorism exceed the private costs, governments may be able to help correct the conse-quences of any differences between social and private per-spectives. Broadly speaking, the government can choose among three approaches to affect the behavior of busi- nesses: BInternalizing the costs of security. Policies could include new regulations affecting the behavior of businesses or consumers. They could also include new taxes or pen-alties that would raise the cost of not undertaking such activities. The effect would be to make businesses, their customers, or at-risk populations (such as the neighbors of an at-risk facility) face more fully the costs of potential losses.Box 1-1. Changing Concepts of Critical Infrastructure In an executive order authorizing federal agencies to adopt protective measures, President Clinton defined critical infrastructures as those that are \"so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debili- tating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States.\" 1 The concept of critical infra- structure and critical assets has broadened in the past few years to go beyond concerns just about defense and economic security. The PATRIOT Act of 2002 refers to those \"systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that [their in- capacitation] . . . would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" 2A related concept is that of a target industry. Some critical industries may be the target of attack, with the losses at stake closely associated with production and distribution in those industries. In the case of other critical industries, their products may be more akin to weapons used to carry out attacks elsewhere (such as highly flammable chemicals used to make explosives). Still other industries may be critical to homeland security because their products are part of the solution to terrorism\u2014in particular, the finance and telecommunications industries, which can con- tribute to efforts to stem flows of money or commu-nication among terrorist groups. 1. Executive Order 13010, \"Critical Infrastructure Protection,\" Federal Register , vol. 61, no. 138 (July 17, 1996), p. 37347, available at www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/cip/eo13010.pdf.2. Further discussion of the concept of critical infrastructure appears in Office of Homeland Security, The National Strat- egy for Homeland Security (July 2002).4 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR BSocializing the costs of security. The government (and indirectly the general tax-paying public) could assume the costs of reducing risks and potential losses, either by undertaking protective measures itself or by financ- ing efforts by businesses, their customers, and affected populations to enhance security. BProviding better information for making security deci-sions. For example, programs could be created to give businesses and individuals additional information on the risks of attacks, potential losses from attacks, and opportunities for reducing risks. Such programs could include information collection and dissemination, as well as research and development\u2014either by the gov-ernment or, in response to regulatory or financial in- centives, by businesses. Those approaches sometimes overlap. For example, the T ransportation Security Administration imposes a fee on private airlines to help pay for government screening of passengers. That program both forces airlines and their customers to internalize costs of security and, if the fee does not cover all of the costs, socializes the remaining costs of providing security by paying for them from gen-eral revenues. The choice among both general approaches and specific options will depend in large part on the cost-effectiveness of the action\u2014how fully it improves security and at what cost. In some instances, the government will have a cost advantage over the private sector in performing an activ-ity. (For example, cost-effectiveness was among the argu-ments used in support of the federal takeover of airline passenger screening.) Areas where the government is likely to have a cost advantage are related to services that the government already provides, such as intelligence gathering, law enforcement (i ncluding potential screen- ing of employees), and research and development. Simi-larly, local governments have an advantage in providing first-responder services. Some specific options have serious drawbacks. For exam- ple, making more information on terrorist threats, vul-nerabilities, and potential losses generally available means that potential terrorists also might access that informa- tion. Further, not all communication among businesses provides a social benefit. An titrust concerns cause the government to restrict information sharing amongcompetitors. The Government's Response Since September 11\u2014A Baseline for Further Change All of the critical industries discussed in this paper were subject to extensive government intervention before Sep- tember 11 to mitigate the danger that they\u2014or disrup-tion of their operations\u2014can pose to public safety, envi- ronmental quality, and the national or local economies. Since that date, additional measures that specifically ad- dress security concerns have been implemented. Those new programs\u2014plus the earlier ones that restrict industry activity to prevent or mitigate industrial accidents, natu- ral disasters, or crime\u2014serve as a starting point for identi- fying additional efforts needed to address an increased terrorist threat. Numerous programs are in the domain of state and local governments. Containing the losses from a terrorist at- tack frequently falls to the emergency first-responder ser- vices of local governments\u2014including the fire, police, medical services, and relief-sup port agencies. State and lo- cal governments have an active role in preparing for emergencies involving many of the critical industries that may be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. In some of those industries, state and local governments may have a regula- tory or a direct ownership role. For example, local gov- ernments provide electricity services to many communi- ties and also own some of the nation's large dams\u2014any of which may be the target of attack. State and local govern- ments also participate in emergency preparedness by reg- ulating activities of industries that may be subject to at- tack and establishing zoning requirements that restrict activity near hazardous facilities. The federal government respon ded to the increased threat of terrorism after September 11 with a number of admin- istrative and legislative initiatives to address perceived im-mediate needs. The President issued a series of Homeland Security Presidential Directives establishing a Homeland Security Council to coordinate the actions of federal agencies, setting up the homeland security advisory sys- tem, directing changes in immigration policy and the tracking of foreign visitors, and implementing other mea- sures to reduce the immediate risk of attack and spread information on the threat. The Congress also took a number of actions in the period immediately following September 11 in the areas of aviation security, surveil- lance powers for law enforcement, and funding of state and local first responders. In addition, it acted to reim-CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 5 burse many of the direct victims of the attacks and to limit the liability of airlines used in the attacks by passing, respectively, the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 and the Air T ransportation Safety and System Sta-bilization Act of 2001. The Administration and the Congress now are assessing broad strategies to improve security that will be funded and overseen by the Congress. Those include programs to facilitate the sharing of information between government and the private sector (see Box 1-2). Among the important new laws enacted since September 11 are: BThe Aviation and T ransportation Security Act of 2001, establishing the Transportation Security Ad- ministration and federalizing airline passengerscreening; BThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (or the USA PATRIOT Act) of 2001, introducing legislative changes to increase the surveil- lance and investigative powers of law enforcement agencies in the United States; BThe Homeland Security Act of 2002, reorganizing federal agencies to establish the new Department of Homeland Security; BThe Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act (or SAFETY Act) of 2002, protect- ing merchants from liability for technologies that do not perform as intended in a terrorist attack; BThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, establish- ing a temporary federal terrorism reinsurance program to provide some public compensation for insured losses from terrorism; BThe Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Pre-paredness and Response Act of 2002, authorizing the creation of medical stockpiles to prepare for biological attacks and other measures; BThe Maritime T ransportation Security Act of 2002, requiring the Coast Guard and other agencies to im- prove security at the nation's ports and waterways by requiring security assessments, new security plans, and new security measures; BThe Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Re-form Act of 2002, requiring measures to help counter illegal aliens and track potential terrorists in the country; BThe Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, requiring measures to protect federal informa-tion and information systems; and BThe Project BioShield Act of 2004, requiring measures to expand and expedite the availability of vaccines and treatments to combat pote ntial bioterrorism agents. Among new legislation that the Congress is considering are measures that would affect the reliability of electricity supplies and require further security actions in such areas as civilian nuclear power, air freight, and chemical facili-ties. Also under consideration are revisions to some of the laws already enacted, including the USA PATRIOT Act. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is scheduled to lapse at the end of 2005, and bills to reauthorize the terrorism re-insurance program are before the Congress. 6 Improving Homeland Security\u2014 A General Framework This paper examines additional approaches that may be appropriate to bring incentiv es for private-sector spend- ing on homeland security in line with social objectives. Many of those approaches are under discussion. For ex- ample, the Government Accountability Office (GAO, formerly the General Accounting Office) has summarized the many recommendations from commissions created by the Congress to look at the nation's security in gen- eral. 7 Further suggestions have come from the National Research Council, the Brookings Institution, and the 6. See Congressional Budget Office, Federal Terrorism Insurance: An Update (forthcoming, January 2005). 7. General Accounting Office, Homeland Security: Selected Recom- mendations from Congressionally Chartered Commissions and GAO , GAO-04-591 (March 2004). The findings reviewed are those of the National Commission on T error (or Bremmer Commission), the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (or Gilmore Commission), and the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century (or Hart-Rudman Commission).6 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR House Select Committee on Homeland Security.8 GAO has provided its own analyses for specific industries, too, as has the Congressional Research Service. The Congres- sional Budget Office has provided cost estimates for some of the proposals that have already been offered in the form of new legislation. 9In this analysis, the ideas for new approaches in each in- dustry are organized into three areas: approaches that would cause private actors (businesses, their immediate customers, and the neighbors of potential physical tar-gets) to internalize more of the social costs of an attack, those that would have the government and taxpayers as- sume more of the direct responsibility for reducing the social costs of an attack, and those that would improve information on the risks and costs of an attack so that private actors could make better decisions about security. The following example may help explain the problem fac- ing policymakers. If a chemical production facility was subject to an attack, the ensuing fire or explosion could expose the surrounding community to dangerous toxins as well as destroy the facility. That broad exposure would represent a social cost of continued operation that would Box 1-2. Government Efforts to Share Information with Industry Many formal and informal relationships exist to share information that is re levant to homeland secu- rity. Some of those relationships encompass basic government efforts to open lines of communica- tion\u2014describing government services and funding opportunities, hosting informational conferences, and providing training sessions. 1 Other federal initi- atives, such as disaster-preparedness grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, involve di- rectly funding the coordination efforts of local gov- ernments and businesses. One initiative that is particularly relevant to home- land security is the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or ISACs. ISACs generally are private-sector organizations (or networks of organizations) that the federal government has helped create to disseminate real-time information on threats to critical industries (see table on facing page). In addition to helping get the word out on imminent threats, ISACs can serve as forums to help coordinate efforts to identify and reduce vulnerabilities. The government first encouraged the development of ISACs in 1998 through Presidential Decision Di- rective-63, calling for ISACs to serve as a mechanism for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating private- sector information and sharing that information with the government. 2 ISACs are generally funded by membership fees or federal grants, although the ISAC for information technology is operated by the federal National Communications System, with par-ticipation by federal agencies and industry. 3 Some of the major trade organizations represented in the ISACs (including the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, and the North American Electric Reliability Council) have been ac- tive both in establishing standards for safety and se-curity in their industries and in working with local governments to plan for emergencies. 1.

That function is covered in part by the ISACs for electric power, surface transportation, and emergency services.

In that situation, the owner's losses alone would provide less incentive to undertake preventive actions than would the full costs of an attack. Many different types of programs could help address such a problem. Programs that would internalize the costs of security could include requiring the relocation of an at- risk facility (or a reduction in the neighboring popula- tion), requiring businesses to adopt the use of less volatile materials, or establishing regulations that would change protective services or production processes. Programs that would socialize the costs could include providing tax in-centives or direct subsidies for businesses to add physical protections or to adopt the use of less volatile materials and increasing public funding for local emergency ser-vices. Information programs could include helping local populations learn about risks and plan for contingencies.Scope of the Analysis This paper aims to develop a useful framework for think- ing about homeland security policies and to formulate ideas for new programs in the context of that framework. Those ideas are all subject to limitations and caveats. First and foremost, because the costs of a terrorist attack in each industry cannot be known, the return from imple-menting the approaches outlined here cannot be known. Also, this paper does not present the options in detail; thus, a cost-benefit analysis of them is not possible. In-stead, the paper generally characterizes the economic ef-fects of different options, noting their impact on resource allocation and, where possible, the magnitude of their cost. In some cases, it could be inferred that additional se-curity motivated solely by potential terrorist attacks is not likely to be worthwhile. Further, this analysis is limited in that it narrowly focuses on four industries. T errorists could well choose targets that are not a part of those industries. Regarding alterna-tive targets, a target's attractiveness to terrorists is gener-ally thought to depend in part on the security of other potential targets. That is, the various options described here may not achieve their full potential to enhance total security if they cause terrorists to look elsewhere.2 Civilian Nuclear Power M embers of the terrorist group that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, indicated that they also were interested in attacking the nation's nuclear power plants. That information, in the context of an increased na tional threat, is drawing at- tention to concerns about the vulnerability of nuclear re- actor cores and the spent nuclear material stored at power plants, as well as the need to guard nuclear material in transit and at different stages of production. T wo notable accidents involving nuclear plants\u2014Chernobyl in Ukraine and Three Mile Is land outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\u2014indicate the potential losses from an at- tack, as do studies of the possible consequences of acci- dental releases. This chapter focuses on security concerns associated with nuclear power used for electricity genera-tion. It excludes concerns about the use of low-level ra- dioactive materials in medica l applications, research, and food irradiation\u2014large amounts of which would be needed to fashion any kind of weapon. 1 Vulnerabilities from Attacks on Power Reactors and Spent Material The staff of the National Commission on T errorist At- tacks Upon the United States reports that a precursor to the September 11 plan included crashing two airplanes into two unspecified nuclear plants.2 In 2003, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said there was evidence that terrorists may have specifically targeted the Palo Verde nuclear power plant near Wintersburg, Arizona\u2014the largest commercial nuclear facility in the country. 3 A year earlier, a National Research Council report concluded that nuclear power plants \"may present a tempting high-visibility target for terrorist attack, and the potential for a September 11-type surprise attack in the near term using U.S. assets such as airp lanes appears to be high.\" 4 Where Nuclear Plants Are Vulnerable Nuclear facilities and nuclear materials in the private sec-tor could present several different types of targets to a ter-rorist\u2014wherever nuclear fuels are produced, transported, and consumed, and wherever production wastes are accu- mulated. 5 Currently, 104 licensed nuclear reactors are op- erating at 65 power plants in 31 states; they supply about 20 percent of the nation's electricity.6 Power plant operators are most concerned about direct attacks and sabotage that may target nuclear reactors or the spent fuel stored by nuclear plants. (If the govern- ment proceeds with plans to transport spent material to long-term storage facilities, the security of material in transit also will become a concern.) Reactor cores are con-tained in concrete structures to prevent accidental releases CHAPTER 1.

T o further limit the possibility that a ground attack or internal sabotage could cause a major release of radioactive material, facilities ob- serve internal safeguards (such as backup electric power for pumps) and take measures to ensure secure perime-ters. Further, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires background checks of all nuclear opera-tions. 7 The NRC periodically issues directives on the types of attacks that its licensees must protect against. The latest directive requires plants to prepare for the \"largest reasonable threat against which a regulated pri-vate guard force should be expected to defend under ex-isting law.\" 8 However, NRC policy specifically exempts nuclear plants in the United States from any requirement to be built or operated \"for the specific purpose of protec-tion against the effects of (a) attacks and destructive acts, including sabotage, directed against the facility by an en-emy of the United States . . . or (b) use or deployment of weapons incident to U.S. defense activities.\" 9 Nuclear power plants are also vulnerable to attacks on the large quantities of spent nuclear fuel stored on-site. 10 That fuel, which is held outside the reactor core contain-ment structures, may be more vulnerable than the reactor cores. Most of the spent material currently is stored in cooling pools. At some plants, the storage areas for those pools are built with thick concrete walls and located par-tially below ground level, which would afford them some protection. But at other plants, the pools are covered only by lightly constructed steel frame buildings. Regardless, the fuel stored in those pools would remain at risk to any attack that harmed the water cooling systems. As the ra- dioactivity of the spent fuel diminishes with time, some of the fuel can be moved to storage in dry casks, where its low radioactivity makes it of less concern. At the end of 2002, U.S. electric utilities were holding more than 47,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, in both wet and dry storage, accumulated from about 35 years of nuclear power generation. 11 A terrorist attack could cause greatest harm if radioactive materials were released, whet her as a direct consequence of an explosion or an ensuing fire or as an indirect conse- quence of disabling a plant's cooling systems or other sys- tem safeguards. Any attack that breached the contain- ment structure for the reactor core or the spent fuel kept in wet or dry storage could cause an explosion or fire. An attack that resulted in coolant loss in the reactor core could lead to core damage or a melting of the fuel. Other systems at risk in a nuclear power plant include electricity supplies, circulation pumps, the intakes for cooling water, and other piping. Problems in any of those areas could cause temperatures to rise excessively or lead to excessive steam pressure. An attack could also compli-cate the shutdown of the fission process. Normally, oper- ators insert neutron-absorbing control rods among the uranium fuel rods in the reactor core or remove the fuel rods altogether to halt fission. Without water, the fission process would stop, but removing the fuel from the core at that point would be nearly impossible, and the radioac- tive material could be spread by any fire. (In the event of a fire, radioactive material might be vented unintention- ally to the outside even if the walls of the containment structure for the reactor core were not breached.) Concerning the inte ntional crashing of a large aircraft, research provides conflicting information about how well the reactor core or spent-fuel storage areas of a nuclear plant could withstand such an assault. For example, the Electric Power Research Institute conducted a study for the Nuclear Energy Institute using a computer simulation of a wide-bodied aircraft striking a nuclear plant. It con-cluded that although the structure housing spent fuel could be breached, cooling water would not be lost, and 7. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group representing the industry, provides brief descriptions of security measures at nuclear plants (available at www.nei.org/index.asp?catum =2&catid=274) and of the special security for reactor cores(available at www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=2&catid=276). 8.

An air- craft collision that disrupted water cooling and external safety equipment could start a fire even without fully penetrating the containment structure. History of Accidents and Assaults The nature of technological vulnerabilities is revealed by the history of safety incidents involving nuclear plants (including civilian, military, and research facilities), ura-nium enrichment facilities, and nuclear material in transit that have caused or threatened the release of radioactive material. 15 Among such incidents, the accidents at Cher- nobyl in 1986 and Three Mile Island in 1979 are the most noteworthy. Further evidence of nuclear plants' direct vulnerability to attack comes from the history of actual assaults on nu-clear facilities. Although plants in the United States have not experienced an armed assault, much less a large-scale attack, facilities in other countries have been attacked by politically motivated groups. Among those events were multiple assaults by Basque separatists in Spain, multiple attacks by Chechen fighters in Russia, an apartheid-era attack by ground forces in South Africa, and a rocketattack in France. 16 Future attacks in the United States could come on the ground (possibly using high explosives or military weap-ons such as rocket-propelled grenades) or involve a colli-sion by a large or small aircra ft loaded with explosives. To counter potential ground attacks, plants' security guards now generally train to prevent intruders from taking over a facility or causing harm at close quarters. NRC-super-vised mock attacks involve lightly armed attackers and periodic tests of those security measures suggest that weaknesses may exist. 17 Potential Losses from Exposure to Radioactivity and Destruction of Power Facilities The human, environmental, and economic costs from a successful attack on a nuclear power plant that results in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive material to the environment could be great. The losses from an at-tack on civilian nuclear facilities could include not just the immediate personal injury and economic and envi-ronmental damage but also the long-term harm. People who survive initial exposure to substantial amounts ofradiation will remain at an elevated risk for reproductive problems and cancer for their entire lives. Other people will face continued risk of exposure to any radioactive material that remains in the environment. Further costs include the loss of electricity-generating capacity and ex-penses required for a best-effort cleanup and decontami-nation of the attack site. In 2002, the National Research 12.

In studies that have shown large potential losses, the probability of such accidents was deemed minuscule. In one study of nuclear reactor cores conducted in the early 1980s for the NRC, Sandia National Laboratories reported on the likelihood of deaths and injuries from accidents at individual reactors across the country. It evaluated an extreme scenario that assumed a full release of nuclear materials, worst-case at-mospheric conditions, and no emergency response. For reactors near population centers, the potential losses were quite high, with the most extreme being from a severe re-lease from one of the reactors in Limerick, Pennsylvania, northwest of Philadelphia\u2014more than 75,000 fatalities within a year of the accident, about 700,000 injuries in the same time frame, and about $200 billion in costs (not adjusted for inflation). 19 In a separate study for the NRC, Brookhaven National Laboratory considered the conse- quences of a severe accident involving only spent fuel and concluded that such an accident could cause up to 20,000 cancer fatalities and nearly $60 billion in dam-ages. 20 Such estimates are fraught with uncertainty. For example, according to the NRC, the Brookhaven study's estimate overstates the scope of radiation release that is reasonable to consider, even in a worst case. 21 However, loss and probability assessments based on accidental occurrences, such as the estimate in that study, were not prepared with terrorist-instigated events in mind. The extreme circum- stances of a full release and an impeded emergency re-sponse might indeed be relevant for a terrorist attack and could be useful in deciding how to prioritize security ef-forts. Evidence of Potential Losses from Past Accidents Some indication of potential losses comes from the Cher-nobyl and Three Mile Island accidents\u2014events in which many unanticipated circumstances combined. Chernobyl in particular demonstrates the consequences of a broad dispersal of nuclear material and an impeded emergency response\u2014although even in that case, conditions could have been worse. The fire and meltdown at Chernobyl re-sulted from a coincidence of design deficiencies (not present in U.S. reactors), workers' violations of standard procedures, and the lack of a \"safety culture\" in the re- sponsible organizations. 22 The operators had bypassed or disconnected important safety systems, including emer- gency cooling and backup power, as part of an experi-ment to increase power output. After the fire started, the operators and the Soviet government did not give prompt warnings about the fire and the release of radioactive ma-terial. The fire, largely fueled by the graphite core of the reactor, spread radioactive substances across northern Eu-rope. Because the power plant was built without a full concrete containment structure, the meltdown also al-lowed radioactive materials to burn down into the ground and contaminate grou ndwater. A concrete \"sar- cophagus\" was subsequently built around the core to limit further contamination. Some 50,000 square miles of land in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were contaminated to the extent that the health of local residents and the safety of agricultural 18.

(Thyroid can- cer can result from exposure to radioactive iodine, which accumulates in the thyroid gland of growing children.) And workers involved in accident cleanup have experi-enced an increased death rate. Among the economic costs, the people of Chernobyl and nearby communities had to permanently relocate, and agricultural lands were permanently contaminated. The incident at Three Mile Island was much less severe than the one at Chernobyl. The Three Mile Island acci-dent was triggered when the main feed water pumps stopped, steam pressure began to build, and a safety valve designed to relieve that pressure stuck open, allowing coolant to flow out of the reactor core. The Pennsylvania power plant had a containment structure and was able to withstand a partial meltdown of the reactor core, al-though there had been fears of an explosion and breach of containment. Also, its reactor core was not constructed with graphite, which had made the Chernobyl fire so dif- ficult to contain. In the end, some highly radioactive ma- terial did escape into the atmosphere before the reactor could be shut down. 25 CRS points to studies indicating that even that brief pub-lic exposure may ultimately cause perhaps five deaths over the ensuing 30 years. At the time of the accident, nearly 150,000 people left their homes until the situation was stabilized. The Susquehanna River, along which the nu- clear facility was located, flows past productive farmland surrounding Harrisburg and into the Chesapeake Bay. The Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey population centers are immediately downwind. Information on the costs of the Three Mile Island inci- dent to the nuclear industry comes from court settle- ments, facility losses, and a changed investment environ- ment. Expenses arising from claims and litigation to date total about $70 million, mainly for costs relating to the evacuation. 26 The courts also required that the plant op- erator finance a fund to pay for continued monitoring of local health. By far the biggest costs were from the loss of Three Mile Island's Unit 2, which had cost rate payers $700 million to build, and the approximately $1 billion spent to defuel the facility and decontaminate the grounds. In 1995, retirement costs for the destroyed unit were estimated to be $399 million for radiological de-commissioning and $34 million for nonradiological re- moval. 27 The incident also precipitated a broad market reassessment of nuclear power: dozens of plants in plan- ning or under construction at the time were canceled, at a direct cost to rate payers across the country, and no utili- ties in the United States have ordered new units since then. Current Programs for Plant Safety, Control over Nuclear Materials, and Compensation for Losses The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has principal au- thority for regulating civilian nuclear power and can bal- ance incentives between producing power and ensuring safety and security. Concerns about the safe disposal of high-level radioactive wastes are being addressed (al- though not yet resolved) through programs of the De- partment of Energy (DOE), financed in part by industry contributions to the Nuclear Waste Fund. Separately, through the Price-Anderson Act, the federal government has acted to address the negative impact on industry of uncertainty about accidents, and DOE supports the in- dustry by financing research and development of new production technologies.23.

The NRC oversees the safety and security of nuclear reactors (in- cluding their construction, operation, and decommis-sioning), production and transportation of nuclear mate-rials (including uranium ox ide, uranium hexafluoride, and enriched uranium), storage and transportation of spent fuel, and disposal of high-level waste. (Under agree-ments with the NRC and subject to NRC minimum standards, the states may regulate low-level radioactive materials, including materials used by medical, research, and food irradiation facilities, as well as disposal sites for low-level wastes.) Other federal agencies are involved as well. DOE is di- rectly responsible for developing disposal sites for high-level wastes, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for developing environmental stan-dards for such sites. However, the NRC licenses the con-struction and operation of disposal and storage sites. It coordinates its security program with the Department of Homeland Security (including the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and other federal agencies and with state and local emergency planners. Through its licensing process, the NRC helps ensure the safety of nuclear power plants by requiring that they be built with important safeguards such as automatic shut- down mechanisms and backup electricity supplies. It also requires that operators regularly test nearby air and water for radiation leaks. The NRC has established rules gov-erning preparations for variou s classes of threats and re- quiring that plants be secure against ground attacks and inside saboteurs. In addition to approving plants' security measures as a precondition to licensing, the NRC con-ducts security drills to test those defenses. The NRC requires that emergency plans include prepara- tions for evacuation or other actions to protect residents in the vicinity of nuclear plants in the event of a serious incident. 29 Each plant must have on-site and off-site emergency plans. For on-site planning and response, the NRC takes the lead in reviewing and assessing operators' plans. For off-site planning, the Federal Emergency Man- agement Agency (FEMA) has th e lead role in reviewing and assessing operators' emergency plans and in assisting state and local governments. For planning purposes, the NRC defines two emergency planning zones (EPZs) around each nuclear power plant\u2014one circling at a 10-mile radius and the other cir- cling 50 miles. The 10-mile EPZ reflects the potential area in which people could be directly exposed to the air-borne radioactive material released in a fire. The 50-mile EPZ is described as the area in which people could be ex-posed by the ingestion of contaminated food and water. The size and configuration of the zones may vary from plant to plant because of local emergency-response needs and capabilities, as determined by the number of people, the terrain, access routes, and local government bound-aries. The emergency response within the 10-mile EPZ calls for providing emergency shelter or evacuation and using potassium iodide (a medication to reduce absorp- tion of radioactive isotopes of iodine in children's thy- The response for the 50-mile EPZ calls for limit-ing access to the area and halting the distribution of potentially contaminated food and water. Since the NRC was established, it has modified security- plan requirements for its licensed nuclear plants several times, partly in response to new information on the na-ture of threats. 30 Since 1977, plants have been required to add physical barriers that protect vital equipment and restrict access, upgrade alarm and electronic security sys- tems, and maintain minimum numbers of armed guards. In 1993, plants had to specifically address the ground threat from a vehicle bomb by installing vehicle barriers. And in 2003, plants were required more generally to ad-dress the \"largest reasonable threat against which a regu- lated private guard force should be expected to defend.\" On several occasions since the attacks of September 11, some states have ordered National Guard units to aug- ment perimeter security at nuclear plants. 28. The NRC's regulatory authority is described on the agency's Web site, www.nrc.gov.29.

General Accounting Office, Nuclear Regulatory Commission: Over- sight of Security at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants Needs to Be Strengthened , GAO-03-752 (September 2003).CHAPTER TWO CIVILIAN NUCLEAR POWER 15 The Nuclear Waste Fund and Yucca Mountain The safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other high- level wastes from nuclear power activities requires isola- tion of that material in perpetuity at secure sites distant from population centers and commercially valuable prop-erty. 31 As far back as 1957, the National Academy of Sci- ences suggested that the best way to protect the environ-ment and public health and safety would be to store that waste in geologically stable rock formations deep under-ground. In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act estab- lished legislative authority to construct such a long-term disposal facility. And in 1987 amendments to that law, the Congress directed DOE to concentrate on the Yucca Mountain region\u2014near Las Vegas, Nevada\u2014as the only site to consider for waste disposal. Controversy continues to surround the Yucca Mountain site and the safety of transporting spent fuel to Nevada. Thus, despite support from the current Administration, completion of the stor- age facility is not certain. Current DOE plans call for the site to accept its first shipments of waste in 2010. Given the planned capacity of the site (established in legislation) to hold 70,000 met-ric tons, it is likely that the amount of commercial spent fuel on hand by that date will exhaust the space allotted to it. (Electric utilities added about 10,000 metric tons in just four years to reach their 2002 on-site storage of 47,000 metric tons.) Even if the current plans are success-ful, a second repository\u2014not yet planned and requiring additional decades to construct\u2014would be needed to ser- vice continuing commercial generation. Price-Anderson Indemnification and Liability Limits The Price-Anderson Act, a 1957 amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, provides financial support for the nuclear power industry by creating an insurance pool with compensation limits that are greater than what would otherwise be available through commercial insur-ance. In addition, that law limits the total liability of an individual nuclear operator and of the industry. The law was also intended to help victims of a catastrophic nu-clear accident by potentially making more resources avail- able to settle claims than might otherwise exist and by simplifying the legal process of bringing claims against the industry. Without Price-Anderson, electric utilities would most likely have had difficulty raising the capital to build the nuclear power plants in operation today or perhaps even continuing operations at current levels. The law requires nuclear plan t operators (specifically, whoever holds an NRC license) to carry the maximum amount of commercial insurance that is available (cur- rently $300 million). 32 But it also requires all operators to commit to providing additional resources (currently up to about $100 million per reactor, to be paid out over time) to help any one operator settle claims. That second- ary insurance pool includes firms involved in nuclear fuel production, shipment, and storage, as well as DOE con- tractors who operate government nuclear facilities. Contributions from Price-Anderson pool members would be available and legal proceedings would be re- stricted in the event of what the act calls an \"extraordi- nary nuclear occurrence\" (or ENO). An ENO is any event that causes a release of radioactive material beyond the plant site that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or DOE, for its contractor facilities) determines to be substantial and likely to result in substantial damages to people or property off-site. 33 If the NRC makes a finding that a release constitutes an ENO, operators indemnified under the Price-Anderson Act waive certain legal defenses, relieving the claimant of having to prove a defendant's negligence and of having to disprove such defenses as contributory negligence. Claim- ants need only demonstrate personal injury or property damage, the value of that loss, and the causal link be- tween their loss and the release of radioactive material. Claimants need not establish the fault of any party to pre- vail in their claims\u2014the law essentially provides \"no 31.

Under that law, the plant operator alone is liable for any damages. That feature is intended to sim-plify the process of making claims against the industry\u2014 plaintiffs can make all of their claims against just one de-fendant in just one court. Individuals affected by an ENO may make a personal-injury claim within three years of discovering an injury, such as cancer, regardless of how long it has been since the incident. However, those benefits depend on the NRC's declaring an ENO\u2014which, for example, it did not do after the accident at Three Mile Island. With 104 commercial nuclear reactors contributing about $100 million each to the industry insurance pool, the maximum liability of any single operator for any sin-gle incident today would be about $10.6 billion. 34 Pre- sumably, parties harmed by a nuclear accident or attack also would be eligible for federal disaster relief, including any emergency funds that the Congress might elect to ap-propriate for losses that exceeded $10.6 billion. Commer-cial insurance is the primary insurance for power plants, and to date, no claims have been paid from the secondary Price-Anderson pool. Further federal assistance could be available under two other laws. The first is the Robert T . Stafford Disaster Re-lief and Emergency Assistance Act, which would com-pensate state and local governments for up to 75 percent of their efforts to provide early assistance to victims of ac-cidents that the President declared to be an emergency or major disaster. 35 The other is the Terrorism Risk Insur- ance Act of 2002 (TRIA). The TRIA program, which is scheduled to lapse at the end of 2005, is designed to re-imburse insurers, including federally approved insurers such as those in the Price-Anderson indemnity program, for a significant portion of their terrorism claims. 36 Ideas for New Approaches to Nuclear Power Security Nuclear power plants may be relatively attractive as ter- rorist targets because of the potential for mass casualties and long-term environmental damage. Civilian reactor cores were not designed to protect against the type of at- tacks that are now of such concern. Moreover, spent nu- clear fuel stored by electric power producers remains vul- nerable unless the security of that on-site storage can be improved or the material can be safely moved to a secure central facility, such as the one being constructed at Yucca Mountain. Despite the many efforts by nuclear plants since September 11, emergency preparedness that would help to contain losses may not fully reflect the realities of the current terrorist threat. A range of options exists that could increase the nuclear industry's liability for the costs of preventing or paying for an attack, give the govern-ment greater responsibility for reducing those vulnerabili- ties and losses, and correct problems with incomplete in- formation that could help improve decisionmaking about security. Since September 11, all of the parties involved in the nu- clear power industry have recognized a need to reassess security. On the regulatory front, an NRC official testi-fied before the Congress in ea rly 2003 that the agency has issued orders requiring \"increases in security staffing, posts, and patrols [and] installation of substantial physi-cal barriers.\" 37 The same testimony highlighted the NRC's efforts, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, to devise realistic attack scenarios and responses. It also cited ongoing studies of the vulner-ability of reactor cores and on-site storage of spent mate- rials to attacks by air. Many of the options that the Congress might choose to implement would be likely to build on actions already under way or being examined. The Government Ac- countability Office has reviewed the many recommenda-tions from commissions create d by the Congress and has provided its own analyses of some specific concerns about nuclear security. 38 The National Research Council also has reported recommendations for addressing nuclear 34. The actual cost to the industry would be less than $10.6 billion in present-value terms because it would be paid out over time. 35.

Ad- vocates of federal programs to support nuclear energy cite many positive attributes of nuclear power generation for the nation's energy supply and environment (such as an absence of emissions associated with global warming, acid rain, and ambient ozone, as well as the haze that can come from coal-fired generation). Policies that would have the effect of restricting nuclear power activities to promote increased security would need to be balanced with those other considerations. Internalizing the Costs of Nuclear Security Any accident or attack involving nuclear power presents risks to health and the environment well into the future, and the losses from a large release of radioactive material at a nuclear power plant would far exceed the value of the electricity such a facility would generate. In creating the NRC, the Congress recognized that low private costs mean the industry would have greater incentive to pro- duce nuclear power and less incentive to invest in plant security than may be optimal for society as a whole. A number of options exist that could help address that con- tinuing concern by internalizing the costs of potential at-tacks within the industry. One approach would be to increase the share of the costs to nuclear power operators and investors in the case of a severe incident, or to make those costs more apparent to the neighbors of nuclear po wer plants. That would add private incentives to take security precautions or perhaps just to operate the number of nuclear power plants that would be most consistent with the relative benefits and costs of nuclear energy. Other options more generally would mandate changes in industry practices to improve the security of power reac-tors and spent fuel against ground and air assaults. Those options include: BRequiring utilities to increase the physical security of reactor cores against both gr ound and air assaults (for example, by employing security forces that could resist a more significant armed attack or by adding physical features that would better shield containment struc-tures against attacks by heavy arms or by aircraft than is now the case). BRequiring utilities to construct safer interim storage facilities for spent nuclear materials (for example, by increasing the physical security of storage areas or the use of dry-cask storage). BEstablishing requirements for safer transport casks or, alternatively, establishing safer transportation routes that nuclear fuel and spent fuel should follow. Safer routes might involve constructing new rail lines to avoid city centers. BEstablishing enhanced incentives and protections for reporting on unsafe practices and security breaches. Concerning improved security against ground assaults, two months after the September 11 attacks, the NRC proposed that private guards at nuclear plants be permit- ted to use deadly force in a wider array of circumstances and be given better armame nt. (Federal law now pre- cludes the use of automatic weapons by guards at civilian nuclear power plants.) It also proposed that federal au- thority supersede state laws that would otherwise restrict private guards from using deadly force or certain weap- ons. 41 Those proposals have not yet been acted on. Other options that would have the effect of forcing in-dustry to internalize the expected costs of a terrorist at- tack relate to changes in the Price-Anderson Act. Insur- ance coverage under that program may be too low because it does not consider a worst-case attack or attacks 39.

General Accounting Office, Nuclear Regulatory Commission: Over- sight of Security at Commercial Nuclear Plants Needs to Be Strength-ened, pp. 20-21.18 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR on multiple targets. Such considerations suggest options that include: BIncreasing insurance coverage to reflect the full costs of a nuclear disaster\u2014for example, by raising the max-imum liability per licensed reactor in the Price-Ander-son pool or requiring plant operators to purchase (and commercial insurers to offer) additional coverage. There could be a requirement for individuals and businesses residing in emergency zones to carry their own nuclear incident coverage (and for commercial insurers to offer that coverage). BRevising the Price-Anderson Act's indemnity so that more of any payout would come from the investors in those utilities rather than from the rate payers. BPlacing authority for determining an extraordinary nuclear occurrence\u2014the prerequisite for activating the expedited judicial process under Price-Anderson\u2014with the courts or some other agency or establishing explicit criteria in legislation for the Nuclear Regula-tory Commission to determine an ENO. Such action could raise the industry's financial exposure and in-crease the likelihood of a payout from the Price-Anderson pool. Socializing the Costs of Nuclear Security Many nuclear security enhancements could instead be addressed by having the government take over or pay for those activities. Some options that would socialize the costs of nuclear attacks include: BEstablishing fiscal incentives for utilities to construct safer interim storage (for example, tax credits for spending on dry-cask storage or stronger structures for wet storage). BEstablishing fiscal incentives for studying and, if feasi-ble, adopting inherently safer reactor designs and safer containment structures. BProviding financial assistance to people and businesses to move away from nuclear sites. If the federal government has a strong cost advantage over the private sector in performing certain security ac-tivities, federalizing those activities may be cost-effective. One activity that the governme nt is already addressing is the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes through the development of the Yucca Mountain disposal site, funded in part by fees on utilities. However, completion of that site is not yet certain. The federal government may also have some advantages over pr ivate firms in directly pro- viding physical security. For example, many people be- lieve that the authority to use deadly force and to use cer- tain high-powered weapons should reside with a government entity. Some options reflecting that position include: BFederalizing and expanding the current level of perim-eter security, structural defenses, and employee screen-ing to help protect nuclear power plants and the spent material stored there. BConstructing a secure, central disposal site for spent fuel, such as Yucca Mountain\u2014and possibly expand- ing storage capacity beyond current plans to accom- modate the additional wastes that are likely to accumulate in the next few years. The threat of terror-ism increases the benefits of completing a central site to lower the risk of an attack on the spent fuel now stored at plants across the country. BSubsidizing the construction of safer transport casks and safer transportation routes that the spent fuel should follow. The latter could involve subsidizing the construction of new rail lines to avoid city centers. Since the attacks of September 11, the Congress has con- sidered a number of measures that would create a federal force dedicated to securing nuclear plants or taking ac-tion if an attack occurred. For example, the Congres- sional Research Service notes that the proposed Nuclear Security Act of 2001 would have created a federal security force to replace the private security guards now in place at nuclear plants. 42 Another legislative proposal, the Nu- clear Security Act of 2002, would have stopped short of replacing the security forces already guarding nuclear plants but would have augmented those forces with fed- eral personnel and National Guard troops. 43 Among other things, that bill would have created new rules on security compliance at nuclear facilities and a program to classify, track, and monitor radioactive sources through- out the country. On the basis of information from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Congressional 42. H.R. 3382, 107th Cong. (2001). 43. S.1746, 107th CIVILIAN NUCLEAR POWER 19 Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the Nuclear Security Act of 2002 would have had a gross cost of $486 million over the 2003-2007 period. However, the NRC has the authority to offset a substantial portion of its annual appropriation with fees charged to the facili- ties it regulates. Accounting for such collections, CBO es- timated that implementation would have resulted in a net federal cost of $126 million over that period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. 44 Improving Information If the owners of nuclear power plants underestimate the likelihood of a terrorist attack on their facilities or under-estimate the loss\u2014even their own direct loss\u2014from such an incident, they may be inclined to operate more nuclear power plants or utilize more of their existing capacity than is consistent with homeland security. They may also not spend enough on safety at those plants. Similarly, many people will reside too close to a nuclear plant if they misgauge the risks and costs of an incident. The task of recognizing personal risk is especially difficult because many of the health effects of radiation exposure can be delayed for decades and because the effects vary among individuals. Contamination and exposure may continue for decades. Some policy options that could help improve information include: BProviding better information to the public on the safety record of individual nuclear plants. BExpanding NRC emergency zones to reflect worst- case events, tailored to individual plants. BPreparing individual vulnerability assessments for localities that would reflect the danger from spent fuel as well as from the reactor core. BEstablishing national prop erty zoning (like FEMA flood zones) to inform new-home purchasers and businesses of the zone designation. 44. See Congressional Budget Office, Cost Estimate for S. 1746, Nuclear Security Act of 2002 (October 25, 2002) . 3 Chemicals and Hazardous Materials T he security of the chemical industry\u2014which in- cludes oil and gas production, processing, and transporta- tion\u2014was a concern before September 11, but after that date, the increased national threat of terrorism amplified the expected losses for individual chemical facilities and transport systems that many people already deemed vul- nerable. No information suggests that the relative attrac-tiveness of attacks on the chemical industry has increased, although September 11 did indicate that the scope of po-tential attacks is now larger. In addition, certain types of attacks, such as those using fuel oil and nitrates to fashion weapons for use elsewhere, may be more likely now than before. Vulnerabilities from Processes, Transportation, and Misuseof Materials Ensuring the security of the chemical industry is impor- tant primarily because of the special dangers that flamma- ble and toxic substances can pose, including immediate explosion and fire, release into the air or water, or theft (and subsequent use in attacks elsewhere).1 The major groups of chemical products include basic industrial chemicals, plastics and rubbers, drugs, detergents, paints, and agricultural chemicals. However, only a small subset of the many thousands of chemicals produced and con- sumed in the United States are of concern for homelandsecurity. Extremely Hazardous Chemicals The Environmental Protection Agency\u2014the primary federal agency tasked with pr otecting the public and the environment from chemical accidents\u2014lists more than 300 chemicals as \"extremely hazardous.\" 2 Focusing on those chemicals that could harm people after exposure for only a short time, the agency closely monitors chemical facilities with the capacity to process amounts in excess of threshold quantities from a list of 77 acutely toxic chemi-cals and 63 flammable gases and liquids. 3 Even on that shorter list, just 13 substances or mixtures account for more than 90 percent of the total mass (by weight) of hazardous materials. The most hazardous chemical substances come largely from three segments of the industry: BPetrochemicals (organic industrial chemicals), BNitrates (agricultural chemicals), and BAmmonia and chlorine (inorganic industrial chemicals). Petrochemicals\u2014such as fuels, solvents, and raw materi- als to make plastics\u2014are of concern not only because CHAPTER 1.

Threshold quantities for toxic substances range from 500 pounds to 20,000 pounds. For all listed flammable sub- stances, the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds. For explosive substances, the threshold quantity is 5,000 pounds. See Environ- mental Protection Agency, List of Regulated Substances and Thresh- olds for Accidental Release Prevention, 40 C.F .R. 9, available at www.epa.gov/swercepp/rules/listrule.html.22 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR they are highly flammable but also because they are found at very large and complex facilities, often in close proxim-ity to one another. Thus, the immediate dangers from an attack and the resulting economic disruption would be greater than otherwise. In sufficient concentrations, the atmospheric release of many of those substances (by fire or spills) could also be immediately toxic or, over time, be associated with cancer and ot her health problems or with environmental damage. Nitrates, produced from ammonia or urea, include a vari- ety of nitrogen-based compounds used to make fertilizers, pesticides, and explosives, and they are highly flammable. Nitrate-fertilizer plants themselves could be targets for at- tack, but the fertilizers stored at thousands of warehouses across the country (accounting for the largest number of sites that EPA monitors) are perhaps of greater concern for homeland security, primarily because of the difficulty in securing fertilizers against misuse. The sale of ammo- nium nitrate fertilizer is legal. However, retail outlets could be vulnerable as targets for diversion of fertilizers by terrorists, and weakly guarded storage facilities could be targets for theft. Ammonium nitrate combined with diesel oil was used as the explosive in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City bomb-ing in 1995. Some toxic substances\u2014especially ammonia and chlo- rine\u2014are a homeland security concern in large part be-cause of their preponderance and, hence, their accessibil-ity. They can be very poisonous if released into the air or water in high concentrations. Ammonia is present in one- third of the facilities handling at least threshold volumes of hazardous material and in more than half of the facili-ties handling toxic substances. (At those facilities, the vol-ume of anhydrous ammonia is of greatest concern; the threat from aqueous ammonia, which is common in household cleaners, is much less significant.) The major use of ammonia and its compounds is as fertilizers. Rela-tively smaller amounts of ammonia solutions also are present in thousands of cold-storage facilities, where they are used as refrigeration coolants. Other uses include cleaning; making soap; bleaching (and processing paper); etching aluminum products; and manufacturing other chemicals, drugs, and plastics. Chlorine, too, is widely present. It is used in purifying water in communities across the country as well as in pro-ducing vinyl plastics and making many medicines. Con-cern over chlorine stems from both its storage at facilities and its transportation in rail tank cars. A related concern is the flammability of hydrogen, a byproduct in the ex-traction of chlorine from salt water. Monitoring Facilities Through EPA's Risk Management Program Concerns about hazardous chemicals\u2014whether flamma- ble or toxic\u2014relate to both the suppliers and the users of those chemicals, including those who transport and store such materials. On the basis of data provided by busi- nesses to EPA's Risk Management Program, EPA reported in 2000 that nearly 15,000 facilities were handling at least one hazardous substance in a quantity greater than threshold limits. Those facilities themselves represent a subset of a much larger numb er of businesses handling a \"significant\" quantity. EPA's Risk Management Program monitors large chemi- cal producers, including petroleum refiners, petrochemi-cal manufacturers, and nitrate-fertilizer manufacturers. It also monitors many small facilities involved with fertilizer storage, refrigerated storage, and water treatment. The greatest number of chemical processes that EPA tracks in-volve just two toxic substances: ammonia and chlorine. Relatively few chemical processes, other than production of nitrate fertilizers, involve flammable substances. How- ever, because the facilities that handle many flammable substances\u2014petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas plants, wholesale-fuel terminals, and propane distribution centers\u2014have such large capacities, the greatest volume of hazardous chemicals that EPA regu-lates are flammable. In addition to the facilities monitored by the Risk Man- agement Program, numerous fa cilities with smaller quan- tities of such chemicals can raise homeland security con- cerns. In particular, the 15,000 facilities in the program exclude retail outlets for flammable chemicals used as fuel, such as gasoline stations and retail propane distribu-tors, which are not required to report to EPA. The many smaller suppliers, transporters, and consumers of those chemicals may hold sufficient quantities of dangerous materials to cause harm if the materials were released or set on fire. They may also have the information or equip-ment necessary to make more-dangerous substances. Fur-ther, because those smaller potential targets are especially dispersed and potentially more difficult to defend, they may be attractive as terrorist targets.CHAPTER THREE CHEMICALS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 23 Potential Losses from Explosions and Toxic Releases Indications of the possible costs of an attack on chemical facilities come from several sources, including assessments of accidental-release scenarios prepared for EPA; assess- ments of attack scenarios that the Department of Home-land Security (DHS) has recently been preparing on its own; and information about the human, environmental, and economic losses from previous major accidents in- volving chemicals. As distinct from the immediate eco- nomic costs to targeted facilities (and, possibly, associated businesses and nearby communities), economic costs to the nation as a whole from an attack would derive mainly from any disruption of current supply to the businesses and consumers that purchase the output of the targeted facilities and from any loss of productive facilities (and future supply). EPA's Accidental Release Scenarios Chemical-facility operators covered by EPA's Risk Man- agement Program must submit analyses, referred to as offsite consequence analyses, of the possible consequences of hypothetical worst-case release and alternative-release scenarios for the most hazardous substance present. (Those analyses are separate from the five-year histories of accidents that those businesses must also report.) Al- though the scenarios are intended as a source of informa- tion on potential accidents, they also can provide insights into the numbers of people potentially at risk from an at- tack on those facilities. In the \"worst-case release\" scenarios, operators describe the maximum quantities of release from the rupture of the single largest vessel or process line at the facility and the maximum range (or end-point distance) that a toxic cloud or a blast could reach. (The end-point is the dis- tance a toxic vapor cloud, heat from a fire, or blast wave from an explosion could travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures would no longer occur.) The analyses also include infor- mation on the number of people or sensitive sites that such a release could harm. The results reflect the popula- tion present in the full circle around the chemical facil- ity\u2014not necessarily the number that would be harmed\u2014 and are intended only to show the consequences of worst- case atmospheric conditions with no measures taken to prevent or mitigate a release.In contrast, EPA's \"alternative-release\" scenarios describe the consequences of incidents that may be more represen- tative of actual emergencies. In particular, toxic clouds are assumed to disperse farther, but only in the direction of the prevailing winds, and an y losses would be mitigated by early-warning systems and emergency response. For that reason, EPA recommends that communities make use of alternative-release-scenario assessments in their emergency planning for chemical accidents. When considering a terrorist attack, it may not be reason- able to assume the presence of mitigating circumstances. For example, emergency vehicles may not be able to reach the release site. Or the attack may be timed so that the wind is blowing in the worst possible direction. There- fore, reviewing the worst-case release data is also useful. EPA's worst-case release data indicate that, in general, the distances and thus the populations that could be threat- ened are greater for toxic substances than for flammable substances. 4 Measured as end-point distances from the fa- cility, releases of toxic substances in those worst-case sce- narios encompass 1.6 miles\u2014the median distance for all facilities reporting. For facilities handling flammable sub- stances, the median distance affected by a vapor-cloud ex- plosion would be 0.4 miles. Similarly, the median popu- lation size that those releases would affect are 1,500 people for toxic substances and 15 for vapor-cloud explo- sions involving flammable substances. Those statistics, however, mask far greater dispersions for a significant number of facilities. Models of atmospheric dispersion indicate that the chlorine stored by many facil- ities in 90-ton rail tank cars can spread as far as 14 miles in urban settings and 25 miles in rural settings. Models provide similar estimates for the dispersion of large quan- tities of several other toxic chemicals. Concerning the populations at risk, about 8,000 facilities that handle toxic substances reported worst-case release scenarios that each could endanger at least 1,000 people. Those figures do not represent deaths or injuries but 4. Data on Environmental Protection Agency release scenarios come from Paul R. Kleindorfer and others, \"Accident Epidemiology and the U.S. Chemical Industry: Accident History and Worst-Case Data from RMP* Info,\" Risk Analysis , vol. 23, no. 5 (2003), pp. 865-881, available at opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/ 03-24-PK.pdf; and from conversations with James C. Belke of EPA. 24 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR rather the numbers residing within a circle that encom- passes the facilities' worst-case end-point distance. With the short end-point distances for explosions of flammable substances, relatively few people would be endangered by such events, even at the largest chemical facilities in the country. Nearly 300 of those large facilities reported worst-case release scenarios involving flammable sub-stances that could affect more than 1,000 people, and none could endanger more than 100,000. Department of Homeland Security's Release Scenarios T o help identify the facilities most at risk and to prioritize security efforts, the Department of Homeland Security has been working with the EPA model to prepare its own assessments of likely attack scenarios and consequences. 5 The chemical releases addressed in DHS's scenarios gen-erally pose a greater danger than those in EPA's worst-case release because all chemicals at each facility are assumed to be at risk. However, as with EPA's alternative-release scenarios, DHS assumes that the plume of release only blows in one direction and that an emergency response is able to further mitigate the losses. On net, the number of people at risk is generally lower in those DHS scenarios than in an EPA worst-case release, but the threat to them is likely to be greater. Such an assessment can be of value in determining how to prioritize security efforts\u2014in con-trast with the EPA program's purpose, which is to under-stand and prevent accidents. DHS reports that only about 3,700 plants (handling either toxic or flammable substances or both) would threaten more than 1,000 peo-ple. 6 And only two plants would endanger more than a million people. Evidence of Potential Losses from Past Accidents Further indication of the potential human and environ-mental losses and economic costs from an attack on a large chemical facility comes from major accidents that have occurred both abroad and in the United States . Those events indicate that the human and environmental losses could be significant. The most notable example of a chemical accident that caused widespread losses is the 1984 accidental release of a fatal pesticide ingredient in Bhopal, India. By some esti-mates, that accident killed nearly 4,000 people outright. India's courts ordered the Union Carbide Corporation, which owned the facility, to pay $470 million in compen- sation to more than 566,000 survivors and dependents, including thousands of victims who were permanently disabled. 7 Bhopal involved the release of a single sub- stance from a single vessel but under the worst atmo-spheric conditions and with no emergency response\u2014 much as in an EPA worst-case scenario\u2014and was com-pounded by inadequate building standards and no effec- tive zoning to limit resident ial housing around the plant. The greatest loss of life in the United States from a chem-ical accident came from the 1947 explosion of a fertilizer- laden ship in Texas City, Texas, which spread fire to nearby ships and to industrial facilities onshore and claimed about 600 lives. 8 Because it involved multiple substances, the explosion was more akin to the DHS at-tack scenarios. In both of those cases, the chemicals involved were widely available, so the costs of those accidents to the private sec- tor were largely confined to the value of the facilities and product that were lost and, in the Bhopal case, the subse- quent court judgment against Union Carbide. Recent experience with chemical accidents in the United States is much less extreme. Many of the accidents have involved freight derailments, tanker spills, pipeline leaks, or fires at major production facilities. The nation appears to be particularly vulnerable in the transportation stage, as hazardous materials move by truck and rail through population centers, although the history of chemical acci- dents includes very few events with a loss of life beyond a facility site. The Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 is an example of such transportation risks. As with Bhopal, it appears that the immediate economic costs of that spill to the Exxon Cor- poration were less than the associated human and envi- 5. The Department of Homeland Security has not released those assessments in any public documents. A discussion of its method- ology and some results\u2014numbers of facilities that may be associ- ated with harm to critical levels of population if attacked\u2014appear in Robert Block, \"Chemical Plants Still Have Few T error Con- trols,\" Wall Street Journal, August 20, 2004, p.

The net economic costs to the oil industry were probably small. When the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the value of the 240,000 barrels of crude oil spilled (a measure of the immediate economic harm) was only about $25 million. In addition, there was the lost value of the tanker. On top of those immediate costs, Exxon incurred further private costs to compensate for the damage that it caused. The company reportedly paid more than $2 billion for cleanup activities, as well as about $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil penalties\u2014much of which went to pay for further cleanup, restoration, and compensation (largely through purchasing land that would be perma- nently protected as wildlife habitat, parks, and refuges). 9 Economic Costs to the Nation Versus Immediate Costs to the Owner In previous major accidents involving chemicals, it ap- pears that the economic costs to the whole nation in question were even smaller than the immediate costs to the owners from the loss of production facilities and sales. The national cost derives only from any resulting disrup- tion of current supply to the businesses and consumers purchasing the output of the targeted facilities and from any loss of productive facilities (and future supply). For that reason, measures of the aggregate value of chem- ical sales greatly overstate the potential for losses to the economy. For example, the 1997 Economic Census, which uses the same industry categories that EPA uses for its Risk Management Program data, indicated total sales of more than $540 billion for all of the industries that used any of the regulated chemical processes. However, many of the establishments counted in that census do not maintain the chemicals of concern for homeland security. Also, the cost figures for any one establishment probably overstate the potential loss from attack because replace- ment supplies would be available from spare capacity throughout the industry, including supplies from inven-tory and imports. In some cases, altogether different chemicals and production processes could be substituted. The future cost to industry from a chemical attack would reflect only the increased cost of supplying those replace-ments or substitutes. (Considering the Exxon Valdez ex- ample, all of the lost oil was replaced from other sources, with only an imperceptible increase in world oil prices.) In general, any increase in industry costs attributable to terrorist attacks is likely to be small, primarily because the chemical industry has already adapted to the prospect of disruptions from accidents, and terrorist incidents are likely to fall in the realm of its experience and planning. The same may not be true for the social costs. For a toxic release that spreads over a significant area, the social cost itself may expand to include the disruption of activity by local business and local populations not otherwise in- volved with chemicals. Also, there is no way to gauge the full economic consequences of an attack that involves a theft of toxic or flammable chemicals. A further example in which the social costs may exceed the private costs involves the disruption of supplies of critical chemicals for which few alternative sources ex- ist\u2014such as chemicals that are key industrial ingredients or that have important medical uses. There may be only one or a few manufacturers of a number of medicines, such as vaccines. Without stockpiles of those items, a supply disruption could prove harmful. Current Programs for Safety and Emergency Preparedness Federal, state, and local programs already exist that\u2014 with varying degrees of effectiveness\u2014encourage or re- quire the operators of chemical facilities to boost their efforts to promote safety and security and to share infor- mation that can help local governments plan for emer- gencies. 10 Much of the overall government effort for chemical safety occurs at the state and local level and is oriented toward emergency preparedness. The federal ef- fort includes worker-safety, environmental, and informa- tion programs that are intended to support local activi- ties. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to- Know Act of 1986, passed largely in response to the Bho-pal accident, represented the first federal initiative to pro- mote safety specifically in chemical facilities. The law re- quired operators of chemical facilities to participate in 9.

Additional background is available at www.newsaic.com/casecivil.html#exxon. 10. A discussion of the basic laws appears in Schierow, Chemical Plant Security.26 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR community emergency planning to address the possibility of an accident, provide information to local planners on the chemicals they handle, and notify local officials of any sudden release. It also mandated the establishment of state and local commissions to coordinate planning and response for large releases of specified hazardous sub- stances and required that local officials inform the general public about chemical hazards and emergency plans for them. Additional requirements came in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The CAAA mandated a role for the Environmental Protection Agency in overseeing risk- management planning at facilities that handle threshold quantities of certain hazardous chemicals identified in the law and others to be identified by EPA. Operators are re- quired to have programs for detecting, preventing, and minimizing the consequences of accidental releases of those chemicals. The CAAA also required the preparation of risk-management plans and offsite consequence analy-ses (for worst-case accidents). Further federal support for chemical security comes from assistance grants to local governments for first-responder programs and from technical support and training pro- grams, such as those of the Federal Emergency Manage- ment Agency. Among recent legislation, the Maritime T ransportation Security Act of 2002 requires the prepara- tion of vulnerability assessments for chemical facilities along the nation's waterways, and the Public Health Secu- rity and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 authorizes the creation of medical stockpiles to pre- pare for biological attacks. Ideas for New Approaches to Chemical and Hazardous-Material Security The gap between the private and social benefits of im- proved security for chemical facilities and transport is likely to be as large as for any of the critical industries considered in the aftermath of September 11. Although precise estimates are not available, information on acci- dents in the chemical industry, company assessments of what could happen in a severe release or explosion, and actual terrorist incidents involving chemicals suggest that the risk of attack is real and that losses could be signifi-cant. Any losses for society at large would probably be much more extensive than the immediate damage to the chemical facility that was targeted or whose chemicals were diverted as a weapon against others. Ideas for new approaches that would internalize the expected cost of an attack to chemical producers, socialize the cost of im-proved security, and address problems with incomplete information all deserve attention. In some cases, the in-tended change in behavior could be accomplished by more than one type of policy. Internalizing the Costs of an Attack on the Chemical Industry More-stringent regulations an d enhanced enforcement of safe practices are options that would internalize the ex- pected cost of a terrorist attack that used a chemical facil-ity or chemicals in transit as a weapon to inflict mass ca-sualties. Specifically, those options could include: BEstablishing fees or taxes on sales of certain hazardous chemicals to discourage their use. BEstablishing new regulations for tracking the owner-ship of hazardous chemicals that could be used as weapons. BEstablishing new regulations governing the safe trans-port of hazardous chemicals to route them away from population centers. BCreating financial disincentives for businesses or resi- dents to locate in danger zones (for example, by re- quiring higher insurance coverage or disallowing business tax incentives). BEstablishing enhanced incentives and protections for reporting on unsafe practices, conflicts with best-tech- nology safety practices, or other sources of vulnerabili-ties. Businesses may not face the full costs of damages from an attack because the full financial resources of the parent firm are not at stake or because the required limits for pri- vate insurance coverage are too low. Raising the stakes would increase private incentives to make chemicals and chemical production safer an d could be accomplished by: BSupporting industry efforts to pool financial resources to settle claims against any single business in the in-dustry; BRequiring chemical plants to purchase higher mini-mum coverage levels, regardless of cost; andCHAPTER THREE CHEMICALS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 27 BRequiring private insurers to offer higher coverage levels. The Congress has considered a number of measures that would cause the chemical industry to assume increased costs of security. For example, the Chemical Facilities Se-curity Act of 2003 (S. 994) would have required DHS to develop regulations designed to increase security at facili- ties vulnerable to unauthorized releases of hazardous chemicals, in part by requiring owners and operators of those facilities to perform vulnerability assessments and to establish site security plans. (Although the Congres- sional Budget Office did not estimate the direct cost to industry of those measures, it estimated that the federal cost of implementing S. 994 would be $216 million over the first five years, assuming necessary appropriations. 11 Of that amount, DHS would use $126 million to de-velop the required regulations, maintain chemical facili- ties' site information, and enforce the bill's new require-ments.) Socializing the Costs of Improved Chemical Industry Security The government may have a cost advantage in perform- ing certain security services that are necessary to reduce the expected social costs of a terrorist attack on a chemi- cal plant. For example, the government could directly provide for the perimeter security of chemical plants, as the Coast Guard already does to some extent for facilities located along navigable waterways. Among the provisions of S. 994 were federal grants to im- prove security at agricultural businesses that produce or sell hazardous chemicals (such as fertilizer), which CBO estimated to have a federal cost of $90 million over five years. 12 Other ways to spread the costs of improved security could include subsidizing the cost of private insurance or pro-viding government insurance. Such insurance programs on their own might help pay for the damages from an at- tack, but they would not necessarily cause the industry to make actual security improvements unless the financial resources of the business or insurance underwriter were at stake as well. Only then would the insurer have an incen-tive to induce industry to improve its safety\u2014for exam- ple, by making coverage or premiums contingent on specified safe practices. Government funding for security improvements also could subsidize the sale of safer chemicals, subsidize ex-penditures on safer production materials and processes and safer transport methods, and provide assistance for people and businesses that wanted to move away from dangerous sites. Improving Information The general public, local emergency planners, and per- haps even the chemical industry lack a wide range of in-formation about the potential scope of damages from a terrorist attack. To the extent that the potential cost is un-derestimated, spending to counter those damages will be too low. Another area in which information could be im- proved involves alternative technologies. Alternative chemicals or chemical processes may exist that would be inherently safer in some applications, but information on them is not widespread. There are also dilemmas concerning information about all of the critical industries. One dilemma is how to bal- ance the need for good information on potential vulnera-bility with the need to keep that information from people who could exploit it to launch a more effective attack. Another problem is how to disentangle industry's normal disincentive to make business information public from le- gitimate security concerns about disclosure. The Con- gress restricted access to offsite consequence analyses be-fore September 11, and more recently, concerns about security prompted DHS to protect security-related data submitted voluntarily by cr itical-infrastructure compa- nies from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Problems related to incomplete information suggest several types of options to help boost security, including: BEstablishing emergency planni ng zones that reflect re- lease scenarios consistent with the potential scope of a terrorist attack. (That measure could indicate more- extreme damages than in EPA's alternative-release sce- narios, now used by many communities in emergency planning.) BBetter informing the public on where dangerous chemicals are, either by regulation or through public/ private partnerships to disseminate information.11. See Congressional Budget Office, Cost Estimate for S.994, Chem- ical Facilities Security Act of 2003 (May 10, 2004). 12. Ibid.28 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR BEstablishing national prop erty zoning (similar to FEMA's flood-zone mapping) to help inform new pur- chasers about local dangers; setting national restric-tions on what activities can occur near dangerous chemicals (in particular, other critical industries); and dictating safe routes for transporting dangerous chem-icals. (All of those responsibilities now lie with local governments.)BDisseminating information to businesses on inher-ently safer chemicals and safer production processes (through public reports, demonstration projects, in-centives such as research and development grants, and public/private partnerships such as EPA's product-labeling programs and in formation-sharing coali- tions).4 Electricity Service E lectricity service is one element of critical infra- structure for which the post-September 11 benefits of im- proving security may not be very different from the pre-September 11 benefits. In general, the vulnerabilities that the nation's electricity supply currently face from terror- ism are similar to those that the industry has long faced from extreme weather and other natural events, acci-dents, and equipment failures\u2014occurrences that could disable any of the major physical components of the sup- ply network or disrupt performance of the system's con- trol centers. Potential losses from such disruptions would be limited and of relatively short duration because the in-dustry and electricity customers are generally well pre- pared for such failures. However, greater losses could oc- cur if attacks on key facilities were coordinated with the intent of causing a widespread and prolonged system fail-ure. Concerns about terrorist attacks may give added im- petus to proposals already under way to improve the reli- ability of power supplies. Other concerns related to electricity service are the secu- rity of nuclear power facilities (discussed in Chapter 2) and the security of the nation's large dams and reservoirs. Many of the largest dams support hydropower produc-tion, although the vast majority serve other purposes. The Department of Homeland Security identifies large dams as critical infrastructure because of the potential downstream harm that the breaching of such a dam could cause (see Box 4-1). This paper does not explore options for improving the safety of dams. Vulnerabilities from Disruption of Regional Transmission The major vulnerabilities of electricity supplies are associ- ated with regional transmission systems\u2014the power grids that carry electricity at high voltage from power sources to communities. T ransmission systems include the sub-stations and high-voltage transformers that first \"step up\" the force of the current as it moves from generators onto the transmission lines and then \"step down\" that current as it moves onto the low-voltage lines necessary for local distribution. Generation facilities\u2014other than nuclear power plants and hydropower dams, which present a dif- ferent type of concern\u2014are generally not a major source of vulnerability to electricity supplies because there are so many generators and so much excess generation capacity. Similarly, although highly exposed to attack, the distribu- tion systems for carrying electricity at low voltage over the last few miles directly to homes and businesses would not make a good target, as a break in those lines would probably be well within the range of the industry's experi-ence and capacity for making speedy repairs. Assaults on Individual Components Experiences with major outages involving bulk power (that is, generation and transmission) suggest ways in which a targeted attack on those systems could lead to widespread outages. Of particular concern for supply dis- ruptions are assaults on selected individual compo- nents\u2014or combinations of components\u2014that could take advantage of system safeguards to produce a cascading se- quence of failures and widespread service disruptions. For example, assaults on transmissi on lines at multiple points or at key nodes could cause failures that operators in con- trol centers could not adjust to quickly; cyber attacks on the control centers themselves could also wreak havoc. But in general, such attacks would result in losses only for short periods. A principal concern about supply losses for a longer pe- riod relates to attacks on the high-voltage transformers where the force of the current is stepped down from re- gional transmission lines to local distribution lines. The sudden loss of multiple substations could precipitate an imbalance between the amount of power being pushed CHAPTER30 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR onto the wires from generation and the amount being pulled off for consumption (known as system load), which could threaten the regional grid as well as sever electricity to the targeted community. 1 (Power could be rerouted to compensate for the loss of only one or a few substations, depending on the load balance in the af- fected region.) Unlike with other equipment problems\u2014 such as damaged towers and downed lines\u2014the industry does not have experience with emergency losses and sub-sequent replacement of multiple transformers. High-Box 4-1. Vulnerabilities, Potential Losse s, and Regulatory Regimes for Large Dams and Reservoirs Compared with chemical faci lities or nuclear plants, the largest dams are inherently secure structures by virtue of their massive design. Yet if a large dam up- stream from a major population center was breached, large-scale loss of life and major economic damage could result. Dams are continuously vulnerable to extremes in weather, earthquakes, and failures be- cause of age and inadequate maintenance. And with the increased threat of attacks since September 11, some preventive actions that may not have been cost- effective in the face of only natural events now may be worth undertaking. The actual vulnerability of any dam to a terrorist at- tack that could release large volumes of water would depend on the uses of the dam, its basic design, and possibly its state of repair. Of greatest concern are those dams that are sited and designed to achieve maximum water storage\u2014whether for recreation, flood control, or hydropower production. Among the different designs, earthen and rock-fill dams may be the most vulnerable to a concerted, small-scale ef- fort to exploit weak spots. The two most notable dam failures in U.S. history\u2014the Johnstown Flood of 1889 and the Teton Dam collapse of 1976\u2014in- volved earthen structures. Age is a big concern be- cause most federally constructed dams were com-pleted by the mid-1900s, and two-thirds of the nonfederal dams that are licensed by the Federal En- ergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are more than 50 years old. 1 Historical experience with accidents gives some indi-cation of the human losses that could result from an intentional breach of a dam. Total failures are very rare, but they have occurred with disastrous results. After Pearl Harbor and September 11, the event that caused the single greatest loss of life in this country was the Johnstown Flood of 1889, in which more than 2,200 people died. The failure of the newly built T eton Dam in Idaho in 1976 resulted in 11 deaths, 20,000 households evacuated, and perhaps $800 million in damages (beyond the cost of the dam itself). Economic losses from flooding would come from damage to downstream properties and to the dam itself, reflecting the lost value of any services the structure had been providing (including power gen-eration, municipal water, irrigation water, and recre- ation). Not all consequences need be negative; in fact, some environmental advocates would point to gains for some flora and fauna by letting rivers run free. Recognition of private and public disincentives to build and operate dams in a way that provides the most cost-effective level of protection for down- stream communities has led state governments and federal agencies to extensively regulate nonfederal dams. The security of federal dams, which include many of the nation's largest hydropower projects, is the responsibility of the federal agencies that build and operate them. 1.

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) lists more than 500 Box 4-1. Continued The vast majority of the country's dams are small nonfederal structures that are not used to generate hydropower. They are regulated by the states and lo-cal governments, although the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has an interest in those dams, too. The National Dam Safety Program Act, passed in 1996, increased FEMA's authority to provide financial assistance to the states for strength- ening their own dam safety programs. FEMA works with the states to promote dam safety legislation, es- tablish emergency action planning for dams that present potential hazards, inspect dams regularly, and track dams in need of remediation. With federal assistance, the states reportedly inspected 14,000 dams in 2002. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regu- lates the construction, operation, and maintenance of nonfederal dams that are built for hydropower generation. In addition, most projects that affect navigable waters, occupy federal lands, or use water power from a government dam require a FERC li-cense to operate. The commission is currently re- sponsible for dam safety at more than 2,600 licensed and exempted dams and related water retention structures. FERC requires all operators to develop emergency action plans that indicate how to protect people and property in the event of a natural disaster or sabotage and how to quickly restore power. In addition, for all larger projects, operators must pro-vide a security plan that identifies protective mea-sures and evaluates on-site security systems, as well as a vulnerability assessment that identifies vulnerable project features, threats, the consequences of an at-tack, and the likely effectiveness of security systems to counter an attack. The security of federal dams is the direct responsibil- ity of agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers, which own and operate the largest federal dams and associated power-gener-ating facilities. The Tennessee Valley Authority also owns the dams in its hydropower systems and sells that power. Some smaller dams are owned by the Bu-reau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and several other agencies. All of those federal operators are subject to federal guidelines on dam safety, al-though the guidelines do not establish technical standards that the agencies must meet. As the desig- nated coordinator of the National Dam Safety Pro-gram, FEMA also monitors the progress of federal dam operators in implementing the federal guide- lines for dam safety. Information on state regulators is available from the Associa- tion of State Dam Safety Officials, an organization of state and federal regulators, dam operators, and others interested in dam safety, at www.damsafety.org.

And 19 from that list involved dis- ruptions for more than 1 million customers (households and businesses). Of the 58 bulk power outages in 2000 alone, about half were attributable to natural events (26 to weather and two to wildfires). The rest were caused by human error and equipment failure (24) or by a contrac- tual failure to provide enough supply to meet demand (six). Most of those outages were brief and affected rela- tively few people, with notable exceptions. A 1998 ice storm in southern Canada and New York left 1.6 million people without power for up to a month. The outage of August 2003, the largest to date, blacked out power for a day or more to perhaps 50 million people in the upper Midwest, eastern Canada, New York, and New England. The Problem of Systemwide Failure In the history of bulk power outages, single-component failures are the most common, but many of the largest outages\u2014including the August 2003 blackout\u2014involved cascading failures. In a cascading failure, problems with a key transmission link cause power to be rerouted over ad- jacent lines, which then become overloaded and automat- ically shut down. The effects cascade from the initial point of disturbance onto other lines and generators, suc- cessively tripping more protective devices and knocking out power over a broader area. T wo factors are at play in the inherent vulnerability of re- gional grids to cascading failures. One is the physical re- quirement that the amount of power going into the grid (from local generation or from neighboring grids) match the power that consumers are taking off the grid. When that balance is upset, system safeguards kick in to keep wires from overheating or consumer electrical equipment from being damaged. The other factor is the basic loop design of the regional grids, where power moves into the grid from multiple generators (and from neighboring net-works) and then around to the multiple communities be-ing served. (The simplest lo op would directly connect a single generator with a single community.) Unlike the spoke-like design of distribution systems, in which only the customers down the line from a break would be af-fected, an assault on the transmission loop, transformer substations (especially those connecting transmission and distribution systems), or regional control centers could affect all users if system safeguards were not available to isolate problems and restore the balance between genera-tion and consumer load. Research on How Systems Could Fail The equipment used in the production and transmission of electricity and the electronic monitoring devices and other controls on which operators rely would be vulnera-ble to physical attack because those targets are located outdoors and have little active protection. The National Research Council recently reported that an assault on any individual segment of the network would probably cause only a local disruption, but \"a coordinated attack on a se-lected set of key points in the system could result in a long-term, multi-state blackout.\" In a war-game simula-tion carried out at the Naval War College, experts de-scribed an attack on regional power supplies that com-bined a physical attack on transmission towers at key points with a cyber attack on control systems in the same region. 4 Cyber attacks could take the form of a computer virus, introduced through Internet connections and the utilities' private networks, that would target supervisory control and data-acquisition systems that utilities use to manage power flows. 5 Potential Losses from Disruption of Vital Services Although there are indications that the total costs from losing power for a short time might not be great, even a 3.

Specific concerns about envi ronmental consequences re- late to power losses at water treatment and sewage plants. In the August 2003 blackout, concerns about potential contamination of local water supplies as a consequence of even a brief shutdown in treatment facilities prevented people from using their water service for many days after power was restored. Impaired operations at sewage treat- ment plants could have further environmental impacts if they caused raw sewage to be released into rivers or lakes. Also at stake in a power loss are injuries that occur in darkened buildings, heart stress, consequences of limited emergency service (for example, from restricted access to high-rise buildings), and health problems caused by dis- rupted life-support apparatus and the loss of refrigeration for medication or food subject to spoilage. A power loss also may compromise government emergency services and telecommunications to the extent that emergency calls cannot be placed. A loss of power also could impose economic costs related to disruptions in commercial, government, or residential activity as well as physical damages to electricity infra- structure. At a basic level, consumer costs arise from breaks in electricity service because utility customers have limited flexibility to switch to other sources of electricity or completely different sources of energy. Immediate costs for business customers could result from lost pro-duction and inventory, damaged equipment (including damage to computer systems and electronic storage sys- tems), and restart costs. For residential customers, direct costs from the loss of lighting, refrigeration, heating and cooling, and the use of other appliances may be associ-ated with threats to health and safety as well as dimin- ished lifestyle. Some of those losses may be erased when power comes back on, but there may be capital losses, too\u2014for example, from lost data on computer systems or appliances damaged by power surges\u2014that have longer- lasting consequences. Evidence from past blackouts demonstrates that the elec- tricity transmission system has been designed so that line failures do not cause physical damage to the system be- yond the initial breaks. As a result, if difficult-to-replace equipment, such as high-voltage transformers, is not di- rectly targeted in the attack, power can be restored rela- tively quickly and economic losses can be minimal. The response of electric utilities to the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center shows how robust the elec-tricity network is and how good utility service people are at restoring service. That attack destroyed two electric substations and severely damaged five subtransmission feeders, in addition to numerous other distribution facili-ties. 6 The damage cut off service to 13,000 customers, many of which were buildings serving key financial mar-kets. The electricity supplier restored service to most of those customers within eight days and enabled major fi- nancial institutions to reopen after only six days. An example of a much broader, regional disruption was the Northeast-Midwest blackout of August 14, 2003, which affected about 50 million people. In that case, it took five days to fully restore service throughout the re-gion, although most customers had power within 24 hours. The Department of Energy estimated the total cost of the blackout at $6 billion, with the biggest cost coming from lost income and earnings. 7 However, data on actual electricity use in that region in August 2003 show no discernible, unseasonable change in total power consumption attributable to the blackout\u2014that is, what-ever drop in power use occurred over those days appears 6.

Individuals directly affected by a power loss may take a different view. The industry commonly describes con- sumers' concerns about supply interruptions in terms of \"reliability\" of service. Studies of the economic value of that reliability (or, equivalently, the costs of interrup-tions) indicate that many customers would have been willing to pay perhaps 100 times their normal electricity bill for a disrupted period to avoid that loss of power. 9 Regulating for Reliable Electricity Service Utility regulation and voluntary industry standards gov- ern the reliability of electricity supplies. Regulatory bod-ies represent the interests of electric utility customers, working to ensure that the utilities maintain a level of re- liability that reflects the social costs of service interrup-tions\u2014not just the private costs to utilities from damaged equipment and lost sales. Un der current standards, the utilities generally achieve the required level of reliability by maintaining sufficient excess capacity to overcome the loss of at least one important component at a time. The regulatory structure of the industry is changing, with large parts of the wholesale trade in electricity being priced at market rates, but most retail rates continue to reflect utilities' guaranteed recovery of expenditures on reliability. For the most part, rates for retail sales, trans-mission services, and some wholesale trade are approved by state public utility commissions (PUCs), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other government entities on the basis of prudent expenses by utilities plus a markup that allows them to earn a given rate of return on their capital investments. 10Because utilities interact with other utilities and, increas-ingly, with independent generators to move power over large regional networks, they are interdependent in pro-viding their respective customers with reliable supply. The industry has adopted voluntary standards to help prevent outages to customers that result from disruptions by other suppliers. In response to the nation's first large blackout, in New York in 1965, the electric power indus- try established the North American Electric Reliability Council to oversee the overall reliability of wholesale elec-tricity supplies in North America. Utilities' participation in the NERC is voluntary, but the organization exercises significant influence over reliability planning and coordi- nation because utilities recognize their high degree of in-terdependence. Under NERC's voluntary standards, utilities operate the network with a contingency for the failure of network components that is known as \"N minus one.\" That means the transmission network is operated so that it could continue to serve customers fully if a single critical network component failed. (Critical equipment includes generators, segments of the transmission grid, and high-voltage transformers.) In the event of such a failure, oper- ators are supposed to quickly adjust the network to a new N-minus-one status in which the system can withstand the failure of an additional component. If operators can-not restore the network to that status, they are supposed to take other actions to ensure that any effects are isolated to the local area so that neighboring systems cannot be af- fected. (Under existing standards, all power systems have protective devices such as fuses to ensure that any disrup-tion in power quality cannot physically damage the equipment. In the event of a power surge that could not be controlled by those automatic fail-safes, operators would need to shut down all affected equipment to avoid 8. For example, see monthly data on retail electricity sales from Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Elec- tric Power Monthly , DOE/EIA-0226 (various issues), which indi- cate no relative drop in sales from July 2003 to August 2003 compared with those months in 2002 and 2004. 9. Estimates of the value of service reliability vary widely depending on many factors, such as the ty pe of customer and the time and length of the outage. For a detailed review of estimates, see Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Scoping Study on Trends in the Eco- nomic Value of Electricity Reliability in the U.S. Economy (Berkeley, Calif.: Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, June 2001).10. With the introduction of competition in wholesale markets\u2014 largely because of federal policy initiatives\u2014new merchant gener- ators have emerged that are not subject to rate-of-return regula-tions, and utilities have had strong incentives to divest generation capacity to avoid rate-of-return re gulations, too. In some states, utilities have sold off additional generation capacity as a part of local initiatives to restructure retail markets. However, utilities that still own generation facilities as part of their vertically inte- grated systems and all of the federal power agencies continue to base their wholesale prices on operating costs plus a return on cap- ital. For transmission services, the federal government ensures that all utilities receive their costs and a fair rate of return, but individ- ual purchasers of transmission services may pay more than that cost, depending on local congestion.CHAPTER FOUR ELECTRICITY SERVICE 35 damage.) The NERC also has developed detailed guide- lines that may help protect the electric power sector from physical and electronic attacks. 11 Ideas for New Approaches to Reliable Electricity Service A terrorist attack (or another, more common cause of power loss) that disrupted electricity supplies would be likely to impose social costs on the public in addition to those faced by the providers and direct purchases of that power. Private costs would be borne by the owners of the generators, transmission lines, or control centers that were the immediate target of such an attack and by their electricity customers who lost power for any period of time. Those private costs include the value of equipment damaged in the attack and lost sales from the interrup-tion of power. Society's costs would encompass other power suppliers (and their customers) affected by cascad-ing system problems but not directly doing business with the targeted utility. Total costs would include the incon-venience or threats to safety for everyone dependent on the goods and services that the direct electricity custom-ers provide\u2014for example, residents of high-rise build-ings, customers of retail gasoline outlets, or communities that rely on water treatment systems and certain emer-gency services. In general, electricity suppliers do not see the full social benefits from spending to increase reliability or are not able to fully profit from their efforts. For that reason, there is general recognition that government has an im-portant role to play in promoting efforts to make electric-ity service more reliable and increase consumers' ability to endure interruptions. Many of the options described here have been considered as a part of several comprehensive energy bills introduced in past Congresses\u2014independent of any concerns about homela nd security. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish sev-eral new rules for managing the nation's electricity system and governing the electricity industry's business prac-tices. 12 Such rules would affect transmission services, construction and siting permits for new transmission lines and the reliability of the nation's electricity transmis- sion infrastructure.13 Internalizing the Costs of Power Losses Policies that would lead the electricity industry to inter- nalize more of the social costs of potential attacks could include fiscal incentives and regulatory changes that caused utilities to further improve their response to a loss of key facilities or that helped reduce general economic losses by making utilities and power consumers less reli-ant on particular sources of supply. For example, to improve preparations for the threat of an attack on any one critical piece of equipment, such as a high-voltage transformer, utilities could be required to hold larger inventories of those critical spare parts (or per-haps establish a national stockpile). Another option would be to standardize the design of critical spare parts to increase the use of existing local inventories in re-sponding to attacks elsewhere in the country. Also, al- though the costs of hardening defenses for the nation's transmission system may far exceed the benefits of avoid-ing an attack on any part of the system, opportunities may exist to physically protect certain key pieces of equipment. 14 For instance, because there are relatively few high-voltage transformers that step down power to serve the nation's largest cities, protecting those impor- tant substations against light attacks may be cost-effec- tive. Introducing Competition. Introducing competition into both wholesale and retail markets for electricity has been a goal of federal law and regulation for almost 30 years. Competition has occurred to some extent in the whole- sale markets, and security concerns may reinforce the case for continuing on that path. Specifically, introducing competition from additional power sources could further reduce losses from a successful attack by making it easier 11.

For a discussion of why hardening the transmission system's defenses may not be the best stra tegy to pursue, see Alexander E. Farrell, Lester B. Lave, and Granger Morgan, \"Bolstering the Security of the Electric Power System,\" Issues in Science and T ech- nology (Spring 2002), available at www.issues.org/issues/18.3/ farrell.html.36 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR for utilities to replace lost power and by giving regional systems more flexibility in achieving a balance of genera- tion and load. In addition, customers would be better able to choose suppliers on the basis of reliability or to switch to other power sources during a disruption. Fur- ther, increased competition could better align electricity prices with scarcity, giving consumers and businesses greater incentives and capabilities to switch to less costly sources of supply. 15 Competition could also allow cus- tomers who placed a particularly high value on reliability to invest in their own backup generation or contract with local, off-grid suppliers\u2014thus enabling them to switch to other power sources during a disruption of the main sup- ply. More sources of supply would mean greater reliability in the face of disruptions to any one of those sources. But competing sources of electricity supply\u2014such as neigh-boring utilities, merchant generators, and industrial co- generators\u2014may need federal legislation to overcome regulatory impediments to expanding their markets. Such impediments come from regulations that establish who can buy and sell power at competitive rates, restrict the addition of transmission lines and regional planning in general, restrict connection of new su ppliers to local grids, and limit consumers' ability to add generation ca- pacity. Adding transmission capacity may be especially important to increasing competition\u2014whether by adding new lines or improving the management of existing sys-tems. Local Versus Regional Regulation. Regulatory obstacles to protecting the supply of electricity are complex. Be- cause of the network design of the regional grid and the interdependence of local supply systems, new spending on transmission links or activities to directly protect equipment in one local system would help protect sup- plies regionwide. But local regulators might be reluctant to approve rate hikes to cover spending that did not ex- clusively benefit their local consumers. And more imme- diately, local utilities might be reluctant to take actions that could protect regional supplies\u2014such as shedding load to help preserve system balance\u2014if they did not re- ceive compensation for lost sales. One possible solution to those problems is to transfer authority for approving new transmission lines or other changes related to re- gional reliability from local regulators to regional authori-ties that would focus more on systemwide effects. Other restrictions on competition make it difficult for lo- cal customers to choose suppliers on the basis of reliabil- ity or to develop capacity to switch to other power sources during a disruption. Consumers continue to face obstacles to installing their own generating devices, al- though such home- and business-based power would be likely to enhance regional reliability. 16 Despite the difficulty of devising fully competitive mar-kets for wholesale and retail power, several options related to market restructuring exist that might help internalize social costs that could otherwise result from service dis-ruptions. Those options include: BEstablishing a structure for wholesale markets for elec-tricity (and for ancillary services) that would reduce barriers to entry for new suppliers and help improve incentives for regional coordination in areas of the country where such markets do not exist. BRequiring planning over broader regions (whether by private entities independent of the utilities or by gov- ernment agencies) for genera tion and transmission ca- pacity to reduce system vulnerability, funded by fees on all regional suppliers. (S uch planning organizations would have authority over local public utility commis-sions and publicly owned utilities and merchant gen-erators that are not subject to PUC jurisdiction.) BRequiring all suppliers (utilities and nonutilities) to build greater redundancy into regional systems by constructing whatever generating and transmission capacity is called for in the regional plans. BImproving real-time management of regional power grids to further increase the system's flexibility to man-age disruptions (either by placing more decisionmak- ing authority about generation and load-shedding with operators of the regional transmission systems or by improving the availability of information on emerging supply constraints to help local utilities make decisions). 15. A discussion of problems in implementing increased competition appears in Paul L. Joskow, The Difficult Transition to Competitive Electricity Markets in the U.S. (Washington, D.C.: AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, July 2003), available at www.aei.brookings.org/admin/authorpdfs/page.php?id=271.16. For a discussion of regulatory obstacles to distributed generation, see Congressional Budget Office, Prospects for Distributed Electric- ity Generation (September 2003).CHAPTER FOUR ELECTRICITY SERVICE 37 Concerning the options for re gional planning and real- time management, one approach could be to give the North American Electric Reliability Council regulatory authority to establish and enforce clear standards for util-ities on available reserves. Another approach could be to give regional operators the ability to issue orders to tem-porarily reduce the supply to some consumers (or shed load) as a precondition for connection to regional power grids. And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could be given authority to direct the construction of ad-ditional transmission lines and to set conditions for wholesale markets that would enable more suppliers to participate. Increasing Customers' Flexibility. One option to increase electricity customers' flexibility to respond to disruptions would be to require retail utilities to promote diversity of energy and power sources for their customers (including providing a choice of suppliers). To be most effective, such diversity would need to reflect an addition to the generating capacity anywhere it might be needed (to overcome constraints on transmission), an increase in the number of different suppliers (to overcome constraints on individual suppliers), or an increase in the types of energy sources for generating power (to overcome constraints on supplies of individual fuel s for generating power). One approach to help achieve that diversity would be to re- move technical, contractual, and pricing impediments that discourage consumers from investing in distributed power (for homes and businesses) and cogeneration (es-pecially for critical industries). In addition, the current system of average-cost pricing can undermine consumers' incentives to reduce power use at critical times, thus weakening system reliability. One possible response would be to implement real-time, marginal-cost pricing at the retail level, with consumers free to choose providers. The resulting prices would more fully reflect the scarcity of supply, so that any power dis-ruptions would lead to higher prices\u2014which in turn would lead some consumers not affected by shortages to reduce their use. For disruptions that lasted long enough for the price signals to reach consumers, the reduction in power use by some would make additional power avail- able where it was needed most. Need for Backup Generators. One problem for the mar- ket is that many of the people who rely on electricity are not the direct purchasers\u2014for instance, people who live in high-rise buildings, take the subway, or depend on community and business services that require reliable electricity. Many critical services, such as hospitals, al-ready maintain their own generators as a backup source of electricity. And under local building codes, most high-rises are required to have them, too. But the August 2003 blackout demonstrated that many high-rises in New York City had no working backup systems. Traffic gridlock en-sued because traffic lights did not work; people ran out of gas in idling cars, and service stations were unable to refill gas tanks. In several cities, the absence of backup power at water and sanitation facilities for even a brief period jeop-ardized the safety of drinking water for weeks. That sce-nario suggests the establishment of national building codes to require the presence of emergency backup gener-ators for high-rise buildings, electricity-powered subways, traffic lights, gasoline stations, and critical public func-tions such as water treatment. Socializing the Costs of Power Losses It may be cost-effective to federalize some supply activi-ties, such as transmission, or to make regional planning a government activity. Options that would socialize the costs of power losses attributable to terrorism (or other causes) include: BEstablishing fiscal incentives for utilities to remove constraints on regional power systems\u2014for example, by supporting construction of additional generating units (possibly driven by different fuels) or new trans-mission lines in markets that have little diversity of supply. BCompensating local utilities for their stranded costs attributable to new competition. (Stranded costs are investments by the utilities that cannot be paid off be-cause of regulatory changes that undermine the utili-ties' revenue base.) BEstablishing fiscal incentives for new investments in distributed power (in homes and businesses) and co-generation (in critical industries), especially in markets where there is no choice among electricity suppliers. Improving Information Security efforts can be enhanced if suppliers and custom-ers have more-complete information on the extent of a current power loss or their vulnerability to future losses. With changes in the structure of electricity markets, transmission systems must now move power for more generators and to more communities than they originally 38 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR were designed for.17 And the communities that purchase bulk power do not always know where their power is coming from or by what routes. Several options to ad-dress that information gap include: BRequiring utilities or transmission-system operators to prepare vulnerability assessments that would indicate facilities where the need for additional capacity or a hardening of defenses was greatest. BEstablishing market-based, real-time prices in the wholesale markets for electricity to help convey better information about the potential for losses. BRequiring operators to install additional sensors and telemetry to provide detailed, real-time information on power flows at all points within the regional grids and between grids. BCollecting and disseminating additional national in-formation indicating potent ial supply constraints and system weaknesses and improving the display of power-flow information.17. For a discussion of information needs in the transmission sector, see Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Electricity Transmission in a Restructured Industry: Data Needs for Public Policy Analysis, DOE/EIA-0639 (December 2004).5 Food and Agriculture R eports of terrorist groups' interests, as well as the history of events involving food contamination and the use of biological agents, support concerns about the pros-pect of terrorist attacks on the food and agriculture in- dustry. 1 The industry would be vulnerable to attack be- cause of the large numbers of food items and the many points of access. However, many of those vulnerabilities are already addressed through extensive regulation put in place before September 11 in response to the nation's continuing concerns about fo od safety. That regulation and the organization of the nation's public health system would help limit the losses from any attacks on food sup-plies involving a range of known agents. The greatest concern would be threats that could escape or exceed the nation's current detection capabilities or for which an ef-fective response would require an increased level of coor- dination among agencies and different levels of govern- ment. Vulnerabilities from Contamination, Loss of Food Sources, and Use of Agricultural Resources as Weapons The use of natural agents in attacks on agriculture or di- rectly on people is commonly described as bioterrorism. That term would include biological attacks\u2014such as with Bacillus anthracis (anthrax ) and smallpox\u2014that might not involve farms and food but would require some of the same protective measures and emergency responses. The security of drugs and drinking water supplies is a particu-larly important, related concern. And although the main focus of attention in the event of a biological attack would be on the immediate safety of the food supply, much of the value of the indust ry's output is in areas such as forest products, fibers, and other products that are not related to food\u2014and those nonfood resources could be threatened as well. Types of Attacks The food and agriculture industry is vulnerable to four types of assaults: BContamination of food with natural biological agents, such as Clostridium botulism toxin (botulism) and Es-cherichia coli of food with man-made contami- nants, such as poisonous minerals or chemicals and foreign objects; BAttacks to disrupt food supplies, including the useof fires, floods, or biological agents such as foot-and- mouth disease or insects; and BUse of agricultural resources as weapons for attacks on other targets, such as wildfires that spread to residen-tial areas, nitrate fertilizer for use in explosives, pesti-cides for poisoning, crop dusters to spread toxins, or radioactive materials used in food irradiation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified several specific hazards to the safety of food supplies. 2 Among the biological hazards, the deadly pathogens an-thrax and botulism are considered the greatest dangers. Next are salmonella, pathogenic strains of E. coli, and ri-CHAPTER 1.

Food and Drug Administration, Risk Assessment for Food T errorism and Other Food Safety Concerns (October 13, 2003), available at www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/rabtact.html.40 HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR cin. Among the man-made contaminants that present a threat, FDA has noted concerns about heavy metals (such as lead and mercury), pesticides, dioxins, and other sub-stances that could be introduced into the food supply. Potential Weaknesses in Defenses The vulnerability to extensive losses would be relatively small if a disease or contaminant maliciously introduced into the food supply was one with which the industry had experience. The government tests for the most common diseases and requires that outbreaks of many diseases (whether in plants and animals or in the human popula-tion) be reported. As a result, it is likely that an attack would be detected early, traced to its source, treated, and contained. Losses could be significantly higher if the attacks involve substances that can enter the supply chain at a point be-fore or after which their origins cannot be traced, sub-stances that are not tested for, and pathogens or contami-nants with which government inspectors or health professionals have little experience. Tests may not be available to detect certain agents within foods, and peo-ple's exposure to such substances may not be recognized or reported to appropriate state or national organizations to discern a pattern of assault or initiate a response. Fur-ther, detection of and response to new modes of attack may require an increased level of coordination among dif-ferent federal agencies and between different levels of government. For example, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) tests many meat products for E. coli and salmonella, but it does not routinely test food supplies for contamination from anthrax or ricin. Records are kept on animals, poul-try, and eggs that enable USDA to trace the source of contaminants back through much of the supply chain. But after meats are delivered to meat processing centers, for example, there is no way to distinguish what herds (or animals from specific regions or countries) went into what batches of meat products for subsequent delivery to stores. The Food and Drug Administration also requires random testing of many food products (in processing and packing facilities and in transit) for certain contaminants. However, for food products, FDA currently requires only that lot numbers (for tracking purposes) be placed on in-fant formula and low-acid canned food.Terrorists' Intent and Past Incidents T errorist groups reportedly have shown interest in ex- ploiting weaknesses in the na tion's food and agriculture industry, although little information on that threat is publicly available. The al Qa eda terrorist group is known to have considered using crop duster aircraft, apparently with the intent of distributing toxins or pathogens over crops and populated areas. Members of a related group were arrested in London for trying to manufacture the deadly poison ricin\u2014a product of castor beans. The number of publicly documented crimes intended to harm people or disrupt supplies is small. However, many of those assaults confirm the potential for serious health and economic consequences. For example, efforts by a religious cult in Oregon to contaminate local salad bars with salmonella in 1984 affected 750 people. Other inci- dents of food sabotage ar e more commonly perpetrated by disgruntled employees and affect only a few people. But the consequences can be more widespread than the direct numbers harmed, as illustrated in the 1982 case of cyanide-tainted Tylenol capsules. The immediate effect was seven deaths, but the resulting publicity caused a near-total collapse in national demand for that product and led to at least five imit ation attacks in subsequent years, all involving fatalities. 3 Potential Losses from Threats to Health or Consumers' Aversion to Contaminated Products The immediate consequences of a terrorist attack on food and agriculture may be illness or the loss of life, depend-ing on the nature of the attack and how quickly it is de- tected. With the important exception of several food- borne outbreaks affecting many thousands, the numbers of people seriously harmed by individual incidents (whether by accident or intent) have been small, at least in part because of current re gulations and the success of the nation's public health system in containing outbreaks and limiting losses. As a result, the costs of a terrorist at- tack may be related more to business losses than human losses. Much of the economic cost would result from the increased costs of replacing lost supplies. That cost might 3. Those acts were the poisonings of Lipton Cup-A-Soup in 1986, Excedrin in 1986, Tylenol again in 1986, Sudafed in 1991, and Goody's Headache Powder in 1992.CHAPTER FIVE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 41 be small for the nation but could differ among regional economies. Losses from Accidental Contaminations Past incidents involving accidental contaminations of the food supply indicate the potential health consequences of an attack and underscore the importance of current food safety regulations and public health institutions. Re- searchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion estimate that 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospital- izations, and 5,000 deaths occur every year because of contaminated food.4 Specific incidents point to how widespread a contamination can become if not detected quickly. About 170,000 people were sickened by salmo- nella typhimurium in milk from a U.S. dairy plant, and 224,000 people were sickened by salmonella enteritidis linked to ice cream. 5 Economic costs associated with those threats to health and safety can be significant. For example, USDA esti- mates that the annual cost to the nation\u2014in terms of medical costs, productivity losses, and costs of premature deaths\u2014from five major foodborne pathogens totals $6.9 billion.6 Why Economic Consequences Might Be Small Retail sales by food and beverage stores (including grocer- ies) were more than $505 billion in 2003, and agricul- tural exports were valued at more than $59 billion.7 However, those types of aggregate measures of the value of annual sales or output are likely to overstate the poten-tial economic cost to the nation of disrupting the indus- try. It is difficult to imagine how all food supplies could be affected or even how the total supply of any basic food source could be affected for a significant amount of time. Replacement supplies (from storage or from unaffected regions) and very close substitutes (from the perspective of consumer welfare) are readily available for virtually ev-ery type of food product. People could draw on current inventories of the targeted item (in home and stores), stop consuming any particular food item altogether, stay away from food from a particular agricultural region, or not frequent a given grocery chain or fast-food outlet. For the nation as a whole, the sales lost by products or estab-lishments that were directly affected by an attack would be made up in increased sales elsewhere. The cost to the national economy would, for the most part, be the increase in the cost of supplying those re- placements or substitutes (and the loss in consumer satis- faction). For a number of reasons, even that residual cost should be small. First, the food and agriculture industry is well adapted to the prospect of disruptions from weather and occasional health incidents. For example, in anticipa-tion of periodic crop losses, the most vulnerable crops are often grown in multiple regions, and individual farmers diversify their plantings and purchase crop insurance. Similarly, food distributors and grocers already have expe- rience with identifying and recalling contaminated lots. Second, government programs are in place to ensure food safety (and limit the health consequences of an attack) and to sustain the income of some agricultural producers (and, indirectly, the businesses and regions that depend on them). As a result, the economic effects of a terrorist incident might well fall within the realm of industry ex- perience and current public plans for detection and re-sponse. Cases in Which Economic and Societal Costs Would Be Highest Circumstances could exist, however, in which the cost of replacement would be high or the cost to society would be greater than the immediate loss associated with any re- placement or substitution for lost supplies. For example, replacement costs could be greater than otherwise if there was a high market concentration in the targeted food or agriculture industry. Where only one or a few businesses account for a large share of sales, the opportunities for drawing on inventories or switching to other suppliers may be limited. Also, in some cases of contamination, the costs of replacing lost supplies may entail more than sim-4. Paul S.

For some diseases, there may be few options to eliminate the risk of further contamina- tion other than burning facilities, plants, and livestock. The cost to society would be greater than the direct losses associated with replacement and substitution if there were noneconomic losses to consider. For example, if the at-tack resulted in a major forest fire, costs could include the loss of recreational benefits, erosion from damaged water- sheds, and loss of wildlife\u2014values that can be difficult to express in dollar terms. And attacks involving pesticides or other toxins could cause environmental damage. Regardless of the economic cost to the nation, the poten- tial loss for the particular producers or regional econo- mies could be significant. For example, in seven states, farm employment accounts for more than 5 percent of the total state work force. 8 The nature of many agricul- tural commodities is that they are produced in discrete growing seasons: once the current supply is lost, the do- mestic market has to wait through a new cycle. Other Long-Term Effects on Businesses Broad consumer concerns abou t the safety of food sup- plies can have other adverse economic effects. Any public demonstration of vulnerability to attack can lead to costly, long-term (if not permanent) changes in product handling and consumer dema nd. The Tylenol case, for instance, led to requirements for tamper-resistant packag-ing. The situation with mad cow disease, although not deriving from terrorism, has led to new costs, too\u2014from having to discard certain animal parts, restrict the con- tents of animal feed, and inspect slaughtered animals. Based on the costs to beef producers in Japan for inspect- ing slaughtered animals, that requirement alone could en-tail $1.2 billion in expenses for the much larger U.S. beef industry if applied here. 9 (Japan spends $40.9 million a year inspecting only about 1.3 million slaughtered cattle. The United States slaughters about 37 million cattle annually.) Current Programs for Food Safety The U.S. food and agriculture industry is highly regu- lated.10 Virtually all products at all points in the supply chain are regulated to some degree to ensure the ultimate safety of the food supply and protect the agricultural economy. The principal federal regulatory agencies re- sponsible for providing consumer protection are FDA (part of the Department of Health and Human Services), USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Environ- mental Protection Agency. Inspectors from the Depart- ment of Homeland Security's Bureau of Customs and Border Protection assist other agencies by checking im-ports. (Further controls come from state and local regula- tions. All states conduct safety inspections of food pro- cessing plants. Some states, such as California, have programs that restrict certain agricultural imports or that call for inspections of agricultural shipments.) Federal Programs FDA is charged with protecting consumers against im- pure, unsafe, and fraudulently labeled foods. It has regu- latory authority over about 80 percent of the nation's food supply, including seafood, canned goods, and other products that are defined as \"food\" in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Many substances come under FDA jurisdiction as \"food\" because of the presence of substances or chemicals in food containers or other food- contact surfaces that can leech into food products. Generally, only meat, poultry, and egg products fall under the direct responsibility of other agencies. The Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates the safety, quality, and labeling of most meats, as well as poultry and egg 8.

No food or feed item may be marketed legally in the United States if it contains a food additive or drug residue not permitted by FDA or a pesticide residue exceeding tolerance level established by EPA. The role of the Ani- mal and Plant Health Inspection Service is to protect against the introduction and spread of plant and animal pests and diseases, in part by monitoring countries expe- riencing outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, and other diseases. Those agencies also use exist- ing food safety and environmental laws to regulate plants, animals, and foods that are the products of biotech-nology. Many other agencies have food safety missions within their research, education, prevention, surveillance, stan- dard-setting, and outbreak-response activities. Within FDA are the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutri- tion and the Center for Veterinary Medicine. Other agen- cies at the Department of Health and Human Services are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health (which identify sources and cures for food-related illnesses), and other offices of the Public Health Service (which help prepare hospitals and health professionals for responding to a bioterrorist at- tack). 12 Other USDA agencies with some stake in food safety are the Agricultural Research Service; the Coopera-tive State Research, Education, and Extension Service; the Agricultural Marketing Service; the Economic Re- search Service; the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stock- yard Administration; and the Food and Nutrition Ser-vice. At the Department of Commerce, the National Marine Fisheries Service inspects fish processing plants for compliance with FDA and USDA safety regulations under a voluntary industry program. New Policies Since September 11 The federal policy for defending the food and agriculture system against terrorism, disasters, and emergencies was laid out in January 2004 in Homeland Security Presiden- tial Directive-9. 13 The Department of Health and Hu-man Services, USDA, and EPA were directed to increase their efforts in the areas of prevention, surveillance, emer-gency response, and recovery. Much of USDA's effort is grouped in its Food and Agriculture Defense Initiative, including its program to direct research and share infor-mation through the Food Emergency Response Network \u2014a joint effort with FDA and participating state labora-tories. 14 In addition, the Public Health Security and Bio- terrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 pro-vided the authority for new regulations to improve FDA's ability to identify domestic and foreign facilities that pro-vide food, monitor and target inspections of food im-ports, and notify food processors and other establish-ments that may have been or become involved in the contamination of food supplies. 15 Regulations recently promulgated under the authority of that law require all businesses in the chain of supply to maintain records that would identify the immediate previous sources and im-mediate subsequent recipients of food and its packag- ing. 16 Finally, the Project BioShield Act of 2004 required new measures to expand and expedite the availability of vaccines and treatments to co mbat potential bioterrorism agents. Ideas for New Approaches to Food and Agriculture Security T wo basic problems can cause the social losses from an at- tack on food supplies to be greater than the private losses to suppliers. One problem is that most food products, by the time they reach the market, cannot be distinguished by their source, so the supplier of a harmful product may bear little responsibility for, or suffer serious economic loss from, its adverse effects. That situation also applies to sellers of hazardous agricultural supplies, such as nitrates or pesticides, that can be used in attacks elsewhere. The other problem is that consumers may not be able to assess the safety of their food and suppliers may not know if they are starting with a contaminated product. 11. Products subject to regulation are defined in the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act. 12.

Such systems also could in-clude the tracking of animals and animal products, with the goal of helping health officials more quickly pinpoint and isolate the source of contamination. Other requirements could include regular sampling at different stages of food processing and delivery to de-tect a wider range of dangerous contaminants. 17 BShort of complete labeling, indicating the country or region of origin for some foods\u2014if that could help health officials more quickly pinpoint the sources of contamination. (Otherwise, reports of contamination might lead to discarding more food than was neces- sary.) BEstablishing full tracking of ownership for the most hazardous materials in the agriculture industry that could be used as weapons (i ncluding nitrates and cer- tain pesticides). BEstablishing enhanced incentives and protections for reporting new incidents of food contamination, im- proper sales of hazardous materials, unsafe processing and handling procedures, or incomplete inspections that might increase consumers' vulnerability. Socializing the Costs of Food and Agriculture Security In some cases, government efforts to conduct or fund safety programs may be more cost-effective than private efforts. For example, it may be worth considering ex- panding the food and agricultural inspection system by adding inspectors and increasing the frequency of sam-pling where there already is a federal role, as well as intro- ducing federal inspectors in other vulnerable markets. Improving Information Suppliers may have little information about the technolo- gies for or costs of making their products safer. Further, they may not know about threats to safety that are intro- duced somewhere farther along in the supply chain. That last point is especially relevant for individual food busi-nesses that do not have full control over their production, distribution, and retail activities\u2014because they lack ei- ther direct ownership of that full chain of activities or long-standing arrangements with their suppliers and cus-tomers. Expanding programs to provid e early warning of contam- inations\u2014without creating a major new regulatory sys- tem\u2014could help improve information. One such option would be the creation of new public/private partnerships to help quickly disseminate information on specific threats to the general public\u2014for example, on assaults in progress\u2014or on general threats and potential corrective actions. Those partnerships could help move critical in-formation to individuals, businesses, and local govern- ments that must take action. A related option would be to create new information clearinghouses to address the difficulty of pulling together isolated pieces of informa- tion on outbreaks of certain illnesses or instances of con- tamination that are not widely monitored\u2014in much the same way that certain communicable diseases must now be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention. That option could help move information up-ward toward central agencies that could look for broad patterns and provide early warning of an assault under way. 17.
