The BEST healthcare choice I have ever made. I am in the best health I have been in my entire life and every day I get stronger, wiser about my health care choices. I have taken her professional advice and used it to help me understand the messages my body has been communicating and I have a happy place with balance. Balance should be the objective not perfection.

I'm hopeful with her insight and care she will lead me in the right direction. She is caring, professional, knowledgeable and listens. I'm excited to be encouraged after being so disappointed by medical doctors.

Dr. Johnson took the time to listen to my concerns , and made a plan to help me get my body back in line. One of the only doctors that actually listens. I have gone to another doctor that thought the symptoms that I had were in my head but Dr.Johnson broke it down and understood my needs.

Being free of medicine and pain is the ultimate health life goal. Having the scan was life changing and put me in the mindset that I'm not as healthy as I thought but having Dr. Johnson to educate me on my health is invaluable. She is so patient, kind and professional. I will keep her as my only health care provider. I'm so glad to have found her.
