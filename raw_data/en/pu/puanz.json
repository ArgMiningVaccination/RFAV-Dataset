UHC requires strong, well-run health systems, sustainable and equitable methods to finance health services, sufficient capacities of well-trained and motivated health workers, and - last but not least - access to essential medicines and technologies. This Flagship Report deals with the latter - the challenges to achieve equitable access to essential medicines. With expenditures on medicines reaching extreme levels - with some low- and middle- income countries directing two thirds of their entire health spending on medicines - the need to rethink and redirect action in the field of medicines has never been more pressing. Only with new ways of understanding the scope of the problems can policies, regulations and health interven- tions be designed to ensure that, when it comes to accessing necessary medicines, no one is left behind, no matter where they live, no matter their age, or sex, or race. This Flagship Report calls for a \"systems approach\" to position medicines within the complexity of any health system. This approach moves beyond the idea that medicines are little more than a series of interactions between patients and public health services. A health systems approach to medicines may facilitate the understanding of the system's integral relations and connections, allowing for innovative and contextual responses in developing and implementing new medicines and new medicines policies and regulations. As evidenced throughout this report, medicines access, affordability and appropriate use must be a core focus for any effort to strengthen health systems and to advance universal health cover - age. This Flagship Report calls for greater accountability of stakeholders, and stimulates some fresh thinking among decision-makers, researchers, civil society, and development partners. This Flagship Report will undoubtedly inspire important conceptual and practical on-the-ground work. Marie-Paule Kieny Assistant Director-General Health Systems and Innovation Cluster World Health OrganizationPrefaceMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The World Health Organization (WHO) defines essential medicines as those medicines that respond to the priority health needs of a spe- cific population. They should be available at all times in adequate amounts, be affordable, and have a proven efficacy, quality and safety. When observing these criteria, essential medi-cines are one of the most cost-effective ele- ments for any health system, with an immedi- ate and long-lasting health impact. WHO has deemed medicines and health tech- nologies one of six health system building blocks. Yet as a fundamental element, medi-cines and health technologies do not lie in iso-lation from the other components of a health system. To appreciate the many interconnec- tions and actors that influence and shape medicines, a systems approach is required. A systems approach features prominently in this report. This allows us to situate medi-cines against the full complexity of a health system, understanding how interventions in the pharmaceutical sector influence the rest of the health system and vice versa. In applying a systems approach, we come to understand that improving access to medicines can pro-mote health equity, and contribute to both stronger health systems and the goals of uni- versal health coverage (UHC). As health systems and the actors who shape them feature many core interac-tions and connections, it is essential to examine the ways in which the access to, affordability, and use of medicines affect and are affected by decisions in other parts of the health system. Drawing on the work of the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research (AHPSR) (11, 12), this report applies a systems approach to medicines. Through various country case-stud- ies, the report illustrates major challenges and advances in the access, affordability and ap-propriate use of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Only through an appreciation of the dynamic interplay - often unpredict - able and always changing - among health system components and actors can we arrive at a full understanding of a health system, and specifically how medicines policies and medicines interventions affect and are affected by the system's constant adaptation and complexity. Following a description of how the access to medicines field has evolved since the 1970s, we explore specific links between medicines and UHC, then move to the role of innovation in developing and delivering medicines, and then to a focus on the pluralistic health sys-tems around medicines, with particular atten-tion on health market systems. We conclude with some action-oriented guidance and rec- ommendations for decision-makers to inform, monitor, and evaluate the inevitable reforms required to improve medicines access, afford-ability, and use in LMIC settings. As demand-side barriers are of critical impor - tance in accessing medicines, it is essential to move past the traditional conceptual confines of medicines as goods transacted in a series of interactions between patients and public health services. This report argues that only with sound deci- sion-making - informed by the aspirations of universal health coverage, a fuller under - standing of the interrelationships between ac-tors in systems, and guided by health system strengthening efforts - will we make viable Executive Summary10 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE and sustainable progress in increasing equi- table, affordable access to medicines that are appropriately used by providers and patients in LMICs. As multiple dynamics, factors and sys- tems influence pharmaceutical and health sector governance, it is essential to map out, analyse, and involve these actors of influence. Essential Medicines in LMICs Despite increased global attention to medi- cines - with rights to medicines enshrined in national constitutions, and as part of Mil- lennium Development Goal 8 - there remain some core problems with essential medicines in LMICs. Cost-effective, quality-assured medi-cines are not guaranteed to be available, pre-scribed or used appropriately. Medicines may be counterfeit or substandard, and they may not be accessible due to financing barriers or poor advice from providers and drug sellers. Essential medicines reflect, in short, the prin-cipal shortcomings of the health systems in which they are distributed and delivered. To ensure that medicines are, as per WHO, \"available within the context of function- ing health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality and adequate informa-tion, and at a price the individual and the community can afford,\" any medicines strat- egy must pay specific attention to a fuller understanding of the bottlenecks in ensuring equitable access to and appropriate use of medicines across various LMIC populations. What policies can improve both the afford-ability and the appropriate use of medicines? And how can we strengthen accountability and good governance structures in the public and private sectors? The challenge: providing equitable, affordable access to appropriately used essential medicines This report focuses on three specific medicines dynamics: the equitable access to essential medicines, their affordability, and their appro-priate use. kEquitable access. The actual medicines that patients access will differ from country to country, depending on multiple factors including disease burden, health system in- frastructure, and the financial capacity (of households and of health systems). Within and across LMICs, vulnerable populations often lack access to essential medicines, due to geographic, economic, cultural, or other barriers. Equitable access to medi- cines means that each person receives medicines available in a system according to her or his needs, and that the quality of care and the quality of medicines is the same for everyone. kAffordability. For households, high out-of-pocket payments can have clinical re-percussions (e.g. those in need forego or interrupt their treatment), economic reper - cussions (e.g. high out-of-pocket expendi- tures reduce household spending on other necessary items), and societal repercus- sions (e.g. community divisions stemming from inequitable medicines access due to cost). For many health systems, medicines constitutes a large and growing propor - tion of total spending and certain essential medicines (e.g. novel cancer treatments) may be unaffordable, creating health-equi- ty ramifications across a society. Ensuring that medicines are, in fact, affordable is a key dimension of access. kAppropriate use. When medicines are available, they need to be appropriately used by all involved, including prescribers, Executive SummaryMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 11 dispensers, households and patients. Mul- tiple factors contribute to their misuse, in- cluding a lack of regulatory enforcement, insufficient disease and treatment knowl-edge, and unintended effects of health and pharmaceutical system policies. Ensuring the appropriate use of medicines is criti- cal to reducing disease burden in LMICs, to preserving the future efficacy of proven treatments, and to spending scarce re- sources wisely. Our strategy: addressing medicines challenges using a systems approach Conceptualizing access to medicines as a foundational element for a health system al-lows us to move past the more traditional approach to medicines. Integrating medicines within a holistic concept that better reflects how real-world, complex systems actually function allows us to appreciate how medi-cines affect and are affected by decisions and interventions in other parts of the health sys- tem. This report examines many of these health system connections - between medicines and governance, for instance, and between medi-cines and information, arguing throughout that an increased attention to these connec-tions is paramount. As different elements of systems - including the development, production, marketing, reg- istration, selection, financing, procurement, distribution, prescribing, dispensing and ul-timately the use of medicines - must func-tion in a coordinated fashion to ensure that medicines benefit lives, the routine inclusion of multiple stakeholders is another aspect of vital importance. Recognizing the many dy-namics, factors and systems that influence pharmaceutical and health sector governance, we must map, analyse, involve, and try to align actors of influence in medicines decision-mak- ing, and actively guide health market systems.When we recognize that access to medicines depends on much more than a series of in-teractions between patients and public health services, we understand that innovations for developing medicines and implementing med-icines policies are essential to bring both new and existing medicines to people. This raises challenging questions around novel, high-cost medicines and generics which, to be resolved, require routine multi-stakeholder engage-ment in fair and inclusive decision-making processes. A Framework for moving forwardFollowing discussion and analysis of the medi- cines situation across LMICs, this report con-cludes with three core arguments for the medicines agenda in LMICs: 1. Include access to medicines and their appropriate use as an explicit focus in health system strengthening and efforts towards universal health coverage. As LMICs currently spend a disproportionate amount of households' and systems' budgets on medicines, any attempts to strengthening health systems and achieving UHC must in-clude a primary focus on medicines. 2. Recognize the needs for transparency and governance in the medicines sector within and across health systems, and then strengthen governance capacities. For essential medicines in any LMIC health sys-tem and globally, there are multiple authorities and governance structures. Pluralistic health care delivery and financing systems require in- novative forms of governance different from those systems that organize public health care delivery alone. Moreover, the governance and regulation of essential medicines transcends national boundaries, requiring both local and international collaboration and innovation.Executive Summary12 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE 3. Build more robust connections be- tween information, medicines and de-cision-making. Recognizing that data on medicines lie in a fragmented manner across a health system - and that information is central to a systems approach to medicines - there is an urgent need to develop innovative means for generating information from data and for connecting not only information and medicines policies, but the actors who gather, shape, control and make decisions based upon that information. An overviewIn Chapter One, we lay the groundwork for the rest of the report by introducing and ex-ploring key medicines concepts, including how a systems approach allows us to bet- ter understand medicines interventions and health system connections. Chapter 2 offers a historical perspective on concepts regarding medicines access, affordability, and use, draw-ing important parallels between the evolution of the field of essential medicines with the global agenda of health systems strengthen-ing and universal health coverage. Chapter 3 argues for an explicit focus on medicines when moving towards universal health cov- erage. The chapter discusses how two key aspects of implementing universal health coverage - information and financing - can support policies that facilitate the equitable and affordable access to, and appropriate use of, medicines. Chapter 4 discusses how inno- vation can meet three key challenges in access to medicines: the lack of optimal treatment options for some health conditions; under - use of high-quality, lower cost generic medi-cines in most health systems; and the lack of equitable, affordable access to specialty medicines. Chapter 5 explores health market systems, examining how medicines are deliv-ered, and how patients and communities ac-cess medicines in markets. The chapter offers alternative ways of delivering and accessing medicines in pluralistic health systems. Chap-ter 6 concludes by drawing lessons from the examples and complex situations discussed in the preceding chapters. Finally, the Web An-nex presents all of the case-studies that in-formed this report, along with other useful re-sources. It can be accessed at: www.who.int/ alliance-hpsr/resources/flagshipreports/en/ As population needs and the health systems to meet those needs continue to evolve in an increasingly connected world, old challenges will persist and new ones will arise. No one stakeholder or single approach will suffice to ensure that medicines contribute to improving individual and population health and well-be- ing. The emerging synergies between efforts to improve health equity, to strengthen health systems, and to provide universal health cov-erage, offer unprecedented opportunities to make appropriately-used medicines accessible and affordable across LMICs. The time is now - for communities, for nations, for our community of nations - to act upon these synergies, and respond to the pressing medicines needs in LMICs.

The WHO Model List of Es-sential Medicines provides guidance for the development of national and institutional es-sential medicine lists. Not only does this guid- ance allow countries to select medicines for their own context, it has led to the global ac-ceptance of essential medicines as a powerful means of promoting health equity, pursuing universal health coverage (UHC), and, ulti-mately, strengthening health systems (1). Essential medicines should be available at all times in adequate amounts, in appropri- ate dosage forms, and be cost effective. To respond effectively to a population's health needs, they must have a proven efficacy, qual-ity and safety. When respecting these criteria, essential medicines are one of the most cost- effective elements for any health system, with an immediate and long-lasting health impact. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), simple iron-folate preparations can reduce maternal and child mortality from anaemia during pregnancy; inexpensive artemisinin- based combination therapies can prevent ma-laria fatalities; and affordable medicines can reduce heart attacks and strokes (1). Despite this health impact - and despite a thriving medicines market - there remain critical problems with essential medicines in LMICs. They are often not easily available or accessed. They can be unaffordable and of poor quality. They are used inappropriately. They reflect, in short, the principal shortcom- ings of the health systems in which they are distributed and delivered. To address this issue, in recent years a human rights argument has framed access to essential medicines as part of a broader movement to improve the equitable access to health and ac-celerate the achievement of UHC (2-4). To that end, many LMICs have enshrined the right to health - including access to medicines - in their national constitutions (5). This has in turn contributed to the inclusion of access to es-sential medicines in Millennium Development Goal 8, and the increasing - though incom- plete - use of the essential medicines concept across United Nations agencies and other in-ternational organizations (6, 7). Despite some global attention on the issue, however, much work remains to be done. Cru-cially, governments, the international commu- nity, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the pharmaceutical industry must move the medicines agenda beyond intellectual property rights and increasingly respect their legal and ethical responsibilities in working towards the equitable access to medicines in LMICs. This includes specific attention to: ka fuller understanding of the bottlenecks in ensuring equitable access to medicines across LMIC populations; kimproving both the affordability and the appropriate use of medicines; kincreasingly using fair and transparent pri- ority setting processes to determine which medicines to select and include on a na-tional essential medicines list (8, 9); kdetermining innovative pricing and financ- ing strategies for medicines, along with more efficient models of supply; and kdeveloping incentives for the appropriate use of medicines. LMIC governments and the international com- munity must recognize and follow through on their responsibilities to achieve these ac-cess goals. Furthermore, this focus on access In recent years a human rights argument has framed access to essential medicines as part of a broader movement to improve the equitable ac-cess to health and accelerate the achieve-ment of UHC.Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 19 Global atten- tion on UHC and strength-ening health systems opens some impor - tant windows for access to medicines. This report uses concrete ex-amples through country case-studies to contrast the stated goals of medicines policies with their actual outcomes and implementation challenges. to medicines can help advance steps towards universal health coverage - a principle where people can obtain the health services they need without incurring financial hardship. Giving people access to the high quality, af-fordable medicines they require can only occur within a context of stronger health systems that have removed barriers to the full and equitable participation of populations across LMICs. This global attention on UHC and strengthen- ing health systems opens some important windows for access to medicines (10). To take full advantage of these opportunities, we must adopt a health systems approach and situ-ate medicines against the full complexity of a health system to visualize how interventions in the pharmaceutical sector influence the rest of the health system and vice versa. In applying a health systems approach, this report deep- ens our understandings of the many ways to improve access to medicines within a broader system that is increasingly able to satisfy the health needs of the people it serves. Such an analysis generates some strong recommen- dations for decision-makers to act upon, and presents priority topic areas for researchers. 1.2 Introduction to the Flagship ReportThe goal of this Flagship Report is to provide an analysis of essential medicines using a health systems approach. This approach ad-vances an innovative and holistic perspec-tive that will ultimately enhance informed decision-making to improve medicines access, affordability and appropriate use in LMICs. Drawing on the work of the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research (AHPSR) (11, 12), this report uses concrete examples through country case-studies to contrast the stated goals of medicines policies with their actual outcomes and implementation challenges. The report also offers guidance and recommenda- tions for decision-makers to inform, monitor, and evaluate the inevitable reforms required to improve medicines access, affordability, and use in LMIC settings. 1 This report's central contribution lies in its ap-plication of a health systems approach to essential medicines. Recognizing that the in-troduction of a new or modified intervention generates both predictable and unpredictable responses from the health system, a health systems approach allows us to anticipate how pharmaceutical interventions affect other health system functions and are, in turn, af-fected by them. What, for instance, are the governance or financing or service-delivery implications - across a system - when ex-panding access to an essential medicine? A medicine may be an essential life-saving mea-sure, but without adequate attention to how it will be financed in the medium and long term, or to how it will be stocked and delivered - consistently and reliably - and how it will be used appropriately, the intervention will be-come yet another vertical effort that fails to integrate with the health system, seeing its impact fading over time. A health systems approach allows for a com- prehensive mapping of relevant actors and their influence and power on medicines ac-cess. Some of these actors may be an active part of the health system (e.g. nurses provid- ing health care and local officials implement- ing medicines policies), and some may lie well beyond the actual delivery of health care (e.g. bilateral donors funding specific interventions or pharmaceutical companies' marketing prac-tices). Arriving at a deeper understanding of health system actors - including an appre- ciation of their power, interests and ability to effectively collaborate - is a crucial missing 1. Whereas the report recognizes that there are vulnerable popula- tions in all countries - with growing inequities threatening people in need of essential medicines for acute and chronic conditions no matter their geography - the report focuses on LMICs. Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?20 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE Only with sound decision-making - informed by the aspirations of UHC and guided by health system strengthening efforts - will decision-mak-ers make viable and sustainable progress in in-creasing access to medicines in LMICs.piece in access to medicines. Through this increased understanding of relevant actors, a systems approach allows us to then visu- alize the many decision-making points and processes within a health system - in priority setting, for instance, in policy formulation, and in policy implementation (10). The challenge of course lies in finding new ways of influencing those decision-making processes with voices and experiences from across the health system. We argue through-out this report that only with sound decision-making - informed by the aspirations of UHC and guided by health system strengthening efforts - will decision-makers make viable and sustainable progress in increasing access to medicines in LMICs. 1.3 Definitions and conceptsIn any context, access to medicines is much more than simply an intellectual property is- sue. Access to medicines depends on which medicines are selected for inclusion on a na-tional essential medicines list, and whether they are available, affordable and appropri-ately used. As these dimensions of access are of fundamental importance to the report, we define them below. 1.3.1 Selection and availability of medicinesWHO updates its Model List of Essential Medi- cines every two years (13), selecting medicines \"with due regard to public health relevance, evidence on efficacy and safety, and compara-tive cost-effectiveness\" (14). WHO states that \"essential medicines should be available with- in the context of functioning health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appro-priate dosage forms, with assured quality and adequate information, and at a price the in- dividual and the community can afford\" (14). The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines serves as a guide for developing national and institutional essential medicine lists. Effec-tive implementation of essential medicines lists will depend on several factors: standard treatment guidelines for health conditions, in-cluding communicable and noncommunicable diseases that are relevant to the population (15-17); changing population-health condi-tions and treatment options; the capacity of skilled health care providers and levels of care; infrastructure conditions such as the state of storage facilities and transport issues; the availability of quality-assured products; af- fordability; and financing, with a particular focus on out-of-pocket costs. 1.3.2 Affordability There are different ways to define affordabil- ity, with assessments typically focused on two levels: affordability for patients/households, and affordability for the health system itself. At the patient/household level, an inability to af-ford medicines can have clinical repercussions (e.g. those in need forego or interrupt their treatment), economic repercussions (e.g. high out-of-pocket expenditures reduce household spending on other necessary items), and so-cietal repercussions (e.g. community divisions stemming from inequitable medicines access due to cost). The WHO/Health Action Interna-tional (HAI) Project on Medicine Prices Avail- ability and Affordability measures patient af- fordability by estimating the number of daily wages - using the salary of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker - required to purchase a course of treatment (18). 2 Such measurements provide a precise snapshot of a medicine's affordability in any given context, helping to quantify the impoverishing effect of purchasing medicines (19). 2. Cameron et al. (2009) studied affordability for both acute and chronic conditions - specifically a course of antibiotics for a bacterial infection, and one month of treatment for diabetes.Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 21 Several authors (20, 21) have furthered this work by constructing three indicators of the financial burden of medicines spending at the household level: (1) high (and potentially catastrophic) health care spending, defined as 40% or more of total expenditures after ac-counting for food costs, over a period of 4 weeks; (2) undesirable financial coping strate- gies, such as using savings, borrowing money, or selling assets to pay for health care; and (3) an unbalanced proportion of house- hold health care spending on medicines. At the health system level, there are no set benchmarks for what is an affordable medi- cine. Can LMIC health systems afford the med-icines they put on their essential medicines list? Can they, for instance, afford a high-cost cancer treatment on their list? Health system affordability depends on medicines prices and also on the budgets health systems can com- mand to spend on medicines. Commonly-used indicators of health system spending on medi-cines include the proportion of total health expenditure on medicines, total pharmaceuti- cal expenditure as a percentage of GDP , and per capita pharmaceutical expenditures (22). Ultimately, however, we need to ensure that spending on medicines aligns with the needs of all population groups, defined by socioeco-nomic status (e.g., expenditure quintiles), geo- graphic location (e.g. urban or rural), racial or ethnic category, health status, and other char - acteristics that allow for the identification of potentially vulnerable populations. Spending medicines budgets without strong regard for who benefits from that spending could lead to disproportionate gains for specific population groups (e.g. the urban elite, given their typi-cal proximity and access to decision-making processes). 1.3.3 Appropriate use WHO defines the appropriate use of medicines as when \"patients receive medications ap-propriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the low-est cost to them and their community\" (23). Historically, this concept was referred to as the \"rational use\" of medicines - but in this report, we prefer the term \"appropriate use\" as stakeholders have various reasons for using particular medicines and the \"rational\" use of medicines may in fact still be inappropriate (as inappropriate use includes overuse, unde-ruse, or inefficient use of medicines, including, for example, using antibiotics for viral infec-tions or non-adherence to chronic treatment regiments). Several major initiatives such as the 1985 Conference of Experts on the Rational Use of Drugs in Nairobi, Kenya (24), the International Network for Rational Use of Drugs (25), and the three International Conferences for Im-proving Use of Medicines (26), have increased global awareness of the problem of inappro- priate use of medicines, and have encouraged programmes and policies to target the appro-priate use of medicines in LMICs. 1.4 Essential Medicines and Health Systems Essential medicines and medical technologies are core elements of a health system (27, 28). Thinking of access to medicines as a founda- tional element for a health system allows us to integrate medicines within a holistic concept that better reflects how real-world, complex systems actually function. Figure 1.1 conveys the many interactions and connections among a health system's building blocks, which were first described by WHO in 2007 (27). Thinking of access to medicines as a foundational element for a health system allows us to integrate medicines within a holistic concept that better reflects how real-world, complex sys-tems actually function.Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?22 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE While these building blocks divide a health system into convenient, conceptual pieces that provide, above all, for analytical simplicity, the systems approach as advocated throughout this report goes much further. We argue that only through an appreciation of the dynamic interplay - often unpredictable and always changing - among health system components and actors can we arrive at a full understand- ing of a health system, and specifically how medicines policies and medicines interven-tions affect and are affected by the system's constant adaptation and complexity. A systems approach that recognizes the inter - connected nature of health system compo- nents - and the policies and interventions that play out across them - represents a true paradigm shift in access to medicines (29). Ac-cording to Bigdeli and colleagues (2013), this shift reveals three key factors that characterize access to essential medicines (29): 1. As health systems - and the actors who shape them - feature many core interactions and connections, it is es- sential to examine the ways in which the access to, affordability, and use of medicines affect and are affected by decisions in other parts of the health system. Essential medicines connect to the other core health system components in the following ways: kService delivery processes affect how medicines reach patients and whether they are appropriately prescribed, dispensed, and taken. kWell-trained health care providers are required for appropriate prescribing and dispensing practices as well as for support-ing patient adherence to prescribed use. kInformation systems play a critical role in supporting the appropriate use of medi-cines (e.g. through monitoring prescription practices and adherence), supply manage- ment (including avoidance of stock-outs), pricing, and payment. kFinancing systems are crucial to ensure equitable access and affordability of medi-cines. Without national policies stipulating access to essential medicines for vulnera- ble populations, many households are un-likely to access medicines when necessary - or will access them at the risk of further impoverishment. kGood governance and effective stewardship are essential to all aspects of medicines in health systems, including registration, selection, quality assurance, procurement, financing, prescribing and dispensing of medicines. PEOPLE MEDICINES AND TECHNOLOGIES GOVERNANCE INFORMATION FINANCING SERVICE DELIVERY HUMAN RESOURCESFigure 1.1: Interconnectedness of health system components (12) A systems ap-proach that recognizes the interconnected nature of health system components - and the policies and interventions that play out across them - represents a true paradigm shift in access to medicines (29).Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 23 2. As demand-side barriers are of criti- cal importance in accessing medicines, it is essential to move past the tradi- tional conceptual confines of medicines as goods transacted in a series of in-teractions between patients and public health services. Access to medicines, and their affordability and use, are influenced by multiple factors at the patient, household, community and systemic levels. Understand-ing the cost and perceived quality of medi-cines and health services, patient demand and health-seeking behaviour, and sociocultural barriers (among others) are critical elements that expand our area of inquiry and generate more systems-based knowledge. 3. As multiple dynamics, factors and systems influence pharmaceutical and health sector governance, it is essen- tial to map out, analyse and involve these actors of influence. This would in- clude mapping and analysing international development efforts, global and bilateral trade agreements, local politics, public and private market forces, informal and unregulated pro-viders, research and development priorities, industry priorities, and intellectual properties rights. An analysis of these dynamics, factors and systems - focused on the converging and diverging interests that influence the health system - will greatly assist in an understand-ing of the forces for and against change, the perspectives any medicines policy will need to navigate or address, and ultimately move us towards a broadened vision of health system stewardship. Figure 1.2 illustrates the conceptual frame- work that guides this report (reproduced from 29). It shows how the medicines sub-system is nested within the broader health system and Figure 1.2: Access to medicines from a health system perspective adapted from Bigdeli et al.

These dynamic relationships are characteristic of a complex system, and must be considered in order to understand how innovations and interventions in one part of the system will affect other parts of the system (30-32). As Kannampallil and colleagues rightly observe, \"complex systems cannot be understood by attending to their individual components in isolation\" (33). 1.5 Applying systems thinking to access to medicines Health systems have both predictable and un- predictable behaviours and reactions to indi-vidual interventions. Research tends to assess the predictable outcomes of these interven-tions, ignoring the unpredictable or unintend- ed consequences of the system's response. This contributes to an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the full effects of an intervention. Relationships between system components are governed by a set of inherent rules that are highly context-specific. Sheikh et al. (34) designate values and norms, relationships and power, and ideas and interests, as the \"soft- ware elements\" of health systems. The sys-tem's reaction to an intervention creates new relationships and often reconfigures these ex-isting \"software elements\" (34). Understanding access to medicines through a health systems approach must take into ac- count several additional factors. First, studying effects over time is important since adapta-tion - in which the effect changes with time - is common in complex systems. For example, interventions may have a so-called \"flash ef- fect\" - they seem successful immediately but less so in the medium and longer term. Another characteristic of complex systems is the inclusion of multiple actors, with their per - spectives, connections and the ways in which they interact influencing each other's behav- iour, which in turn affects the system. When Box 1.1: Systems thinking for health systems strengthening (12) The Alliance published its 2009 Flagship Report on Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strength- ening. This 2009 Flagship Report discussed the linkages between the concepts of systems think- ing and health system strengthening, arguing that systems thinking provides \"a way forward for operating more successfully and effectively in complex, real-world settings. It can open powerful pathways to identifying and resolving health system challenges, and as such is a crucial ingredi-ent for any health system strengthening effort\". This current Flagship Report expands on the work and thinking of the previous report, applying systems thinking to the area of access to medicines. As described in the 2009 report, systems thinking is a process that \"works to reveal the underly- ing characteristics and relationships of systems... Health systems are constantly changing, with components that are tightly connected and highly sensitive to change elsewhere in the system. They are non-linear, unpredictable and resistant to change, with seemingly obvious solutions sometimes worsening a problem.\" Anticipating how an intervention might \"flow through, react with, and impinge on\" sub-systems is crucial, creating \"the opportunity to apply systems thinking in a constructive way...\" (12).Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 25 assessing an intervention in a complex system, we must attempt to predict actors' behaviours and reactions, as these may lead to potential unintended consequences in the system. Iden- tifying these potential unintended effects of interventions before the intervention is imple-mented is critical in ensuring that intended outcomes overshadow the unintended. Systems thinking has particular relevance for medicines as their access, affordability, and use are determined by multiple processes both within and outside the health system - and at multiple political and socioeconomic levels. Predicting patterns of behaviours from various perspectives and based on different sources should help us better plan, implement, and as- sess interventions that improve access to med-icines (and in turn, better health outcomes). While such predictions are essential, they are often challenging to make in practice. This report responds to that challenge by of- fering concrete examples of specific medicines issues through a systems approach. The report uses case-studies to describe challenges and the approaches to meet those challenges in real-life contexts. 1.6 Overview of the chaptersFollowing this introduction, Chapter 2 offers a historical perspective on concepts regarding medicines access, affordability, and use. It ex- amines how these concepts have evolved over time since the 1970s and 1978's Alma Ata Declaration, and then briefly discusses issues around the quality of medicines. The chapter draws an important parallel between the evo- lution of the field of essential medicines with the global agenda of health systems strength-ening and universal health coverage. Chapter 3 argues for an explicit focus on medicines when moving towards universal health coverage. The chapter discusses how two key aspects for implementing universal health coverage - information and financing - can support policies that facilitate the equita- ble and affordable access to, and appropriate use of, medicines. The chapter describes medi-cines management strategies used in financial risk protection schemes in several countries at different stages of implementation of uni- versal health coverage. It then discusses the importance of ethical considerations in de-signing medicines policies for universal health coverage. Chapter 4 discusses how innovation - broad- ly defined as \"a process to create or improve products, processes, technologies and/or ideas to generate positive changes in efficiency, value and quality\" (162) - can meet three key challenges in access to medicines. These include: the lack of optimal treatment options for some health conditions; underuse of high quality, lower cost generic medicines in most health systems; and the lack of equitable, af- fordable access to specialty medicines. Chapter 5 explores health market systems, examining how medicines are delivered, and how patients and communities access medicines in markets. The chapter offers ex- amples of alternative ways of delivering and accessing medicines in pluralistic health sys-tems - through accreditation of drug outlets, expert patients groups, provider and regula-tory networks, and social business initiatives. These new approaches are promising yet have broader system implications that require care- ful consideration. Chapter 6 concludes by drawing lessons from the examples and complex situations discussed in the preceding chapters. Acknowl- edging the many challenges of ensuring the equitable, affordable access to and appropri-ate use of medicines, the chapter offers tools and recommendations for understanding Systems think- ing has particu-lar relevance for medicines as their access, affordability, and use are determined by multiple processes both within and outside the health system - and at multiple political and socioeconomic levels.Chapter 1: Why a Health Systems Approach?26 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE medicines situations in complex health systems that will ultimately inform sound decision-making.

To provide a sequential understanding of many of the aspects central to this chapter, an extensive table (Figure 2.1) shows some no- table milestones in the evolving concepts of essential medicines, health systems, and the interplay between the two. 2.1.1 Essential medicines since the 1970'sThe idea of selecting a list of essential medi- cines originated in military medicine, particu-larly during the Second World War, and was adopted in some LMICs (e.g., Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) in the 1970s (35, 36). WHO formal- ized the concept of medicines selection with the publication of the first essential medicines list (EML) in 1977 (37). In 1981, WHO created the Action Programme on Essential Drugs - now called the Department of Essential Medi-cines and Health Products - while Manage-ment Sciences for Health published the first edition of Managing Drug Supply, a leading reference on how to manage essential medi- cines in developing countries (38). While this initial focus lay on creating a list of medicines, in the 1980s and 1990s multiple stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and pharmaceutical companies, began to con-sider factors such as supply, appropriate use, product quality, and affordable pricing. The In- ternational Network for Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) was established in 1981 \"to design, test, and disseminate effective strategies to improve the way drugs are prescribed, dis-pensed, and used, with a particular emphasis on resource-poor countries\" (25). In 1985, key stakeholders, including patients and consum-ers, discussed the appropriate use of essential medicines at a landmark conference in Nairobi (24). This meeting resulted in the WHO Re-vised Drug Strategy, which put the \"emphasis beyond selection [onto] procurement, distri-bution, rational use, and quality assurance for the public sector\" (37). The first International Conference on Improv- ing the Use of Medicines (ICIUM) convened in 1997, followed by ICIUM conferences in 2004 and 2011, which brought together research-ers, policy-makers and, most recently, indus-try stakeholders. Above all, these conferences sought a global consensus on interventions designed to improve the use of medicines and on a research agenda to address particular knowledge gaps (26). There was also atten-tion paid - particularly by northern European development agencies - to support research and capacity strengthening on the use of medicines in LMICs (25, 26). With a growing focus on improving the quality of essential medicines, the WHO began a Prequalifica-tion Programme in 2001 to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (39). This service has since been expanded to cover medicines and products for other priority diseases and for re-productive health. More recently, there has been a focus on household access and affordability with the development of measurement tools to in- crease transparency and the creation of evi-dence-informed policy. The WHO/HAI pricing survey methodology, first published in 2003, provided a new approach to measuring prices of medicines at different points in the supply chain (40). This had a particular focus on end-user prices and in promoting greater transpar - ency of global medicines prices. Over this pe-riod, WHO led the development of a toolkit for Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health Systems30 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE country assessments that includes health facil- ity and household surveys to measure the sup-ply of medicines, how they were prescribed, along with their price, accessibility, and use (41). Currently, as described in this report, there is a growing focus on the availability, ac-cess, affordability, and use of medicines in the context of complex, real-world health systems. 2.1.2 Health systems: from Alma Ata to UHC Alongside this evolution of the access to medi- cines field were important developments in the concept and understanding of the health system. The 1978 Alma Ata Declaration was the first international commitment to primary health care and \"a first attempt to unify think-ing about health within a single policy frame-work\" (27). It emphasized the importance of essential medicines in health systems when it identified the \"provision of essential drugs as one of eight key components of primary health care\" (37). In 1987, the Harare Declaration and Bamako Initiative spearheaded efforts to improve primary health care systems in Africa through decentralization (i.e. a district health system approach) and user fees for medicines (i.e. revolving drug funds) (42). In the 1980s and 1990s, user fees were widely promoted as a means to finance struggling health sys-tems, though this approach would contribute to \"widespread 'financial catastrophe (for households) associated with direct payments for health services'\" (43). Three decades after the widespread adoption of user fees, there is now a worldwide movement toward more equitable financing of health care and risk protection through universal health coverage. The 2000 WHO World Health Report (44) em- phasized the goals of quality and equity, par - ticularly fairness of financial contributions, of national health systems. In 2005, WHO Member States made a commitment to work towards universal health coverage (45). The 2010 WHO World Health Report (46) provided guidance for countries to raise sufficient re- sources, improve efficiency of health systems, and achieve universal health coverage. During this time, there has also been a grow- ing recognition, largely as a result of the World Bank's 1993 World Development Report (47, 48) and the 2001 WHO Report of the Com-mission on Macroeconomics and Health (49, 50), that greater investment in health by both LMICs governments and donors will acceler - ate economic development in LMICs. 2.1.3 The impact of HIV/AIDS on health systems and essential medicines The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had massive impli- cations for both essential medicines and health systems. As the HIV epidemic spread, with more and more patients requiring anti-retroviral therapy (ART), pharmaceutical com- panies defended their intellectual property rights, which maintained high prices for ART, putting these life-saving medications out of reach for most LMIC populations (51). South Africa in particular struggled with a devastat-ing HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the government eventually enacting the Medicines and Re- lated Substances Control Amendment Act in 1997, which allowed for the provision of more affordable HIV medicines through parallel im-ports and compulsory licensing (52). In 1998, however, 41 companies sued the government of South Africa, claiming that the act was in violation of the Trade Related In- tellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement protecting drug patents (51). Following pub-lic outcry highlighting the urgent life-saving importance of these medicines, the case was dropped in 2001. However, the publicity sur - rounding the court case spurred global access campaigns and the creation of donor-driven access-to-medicines programmes, especially Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health SystemsMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 31 around HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (e.g., Clin- ton Health Access Initiative, Global Fund, PEP-FAR, and UNITAID) (53-56). Ensuring access to medicines that prevent or treat these three diseases has since become the focus of major global health efforts. While these vertical disease-focused pro- grammes have improved access to medicines through increased donor support, novel and enhanced funding and purchasing mecha- nisms, and improved supply chains, they have created a raft of unintended consequences. These consequences have seen the global fo-cus shift away from other essential medicines, and from other issues such as the appropriate use of medicines, and the role of medicines in overall health system strengthening efforts. Recent attention to these unintended conse- quences has, however, helped to shift the global focus back to health system strength-ening and improving access to medicines for noncommunicable diseases (57). Govern- ments use flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement that encourage efforts to make medicines more affordable in LMICs - allowing, for in-stance, for the production or importation of generic products of patented medicines when there is a public health emergency (58, 59). Donors are now analysing the HIV/AIDS access campaigns for lessons on how to strengthen health systems and improve access to essen-tial medicines for noncommunicable diseases within the context of a complex, real-world health system (60). 2.2 Current situations of medicines in LMICs In this section, we examine some of the cur - rent key issues relating to access to medi- cines in LMICs. This includes sub-sections on the general LMIC situation around the avail-ability of medicines; affordability issues for patients and for health systems; prescribing practices, dispensing and use; health-seeking behaviour and reliance on the informal health sector; traditional medicines; quality control and regulation; and investing in research and development. 2.2.1 Availability of medicinesThe availability of essential medicines, particu- larly in the public sector, is still poor in many LMICs. Beginning in 2003, WHO/HAI surveys have found that the availability of widely-used generic medicines was 57% in the public sec- tor and 65% in the private sector (61). In both sectors, medicines for chronic conditions were less widely available than those for acute con-ditions (62). Where people live in relation to the nearest health facility affects their geographical access to medicines. As a result, those in rural areas typically have much poorer access to medi-cines - a fact further compounded by lower treatment adherence in rural areas (63). Rural households are also more likely to incur cata- strophic health expenditures (64). Distance and poor road conditions can also interrupt the medicines supply chain, leading to an er - ratic supply of medicines, including stock-outs (65). 2.2.2 Affordability for patientsThe price of medicines varies widely across countries, as well as by region and between the public and private sector (18). Medicines are often wholly unaffordable for poorer pa-tients (18). Without a financial risk protection scheme (e.g. health insurance with a compre-hensive medicines benefit) and a functioning public health care delivery system in most LMICs, patients pay high out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Out-of-pocket spending can be financially devastating as medicines ac-count for the largest category of out-of-pocket Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health Systems32 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE health expenses in LMICs - in 2002-03, ap- proximately half (41%-56%) of households spent 100% of their health care expenses on medicines (20). Medicine expenditures often lead to cata- strophic levels of household spending and im-poverishment, with the poor being particularly vulnerable (66). Health insurance, which can reduce or eliminate out-of-pocket spending on medicines, provides a form of financial risk protection and has been shown to improve access to medicines in LMICs (67). However, many insurance programmes do not provide a comprehensive essential medicines benefit. 2.2.3 Affordability for health systems On average, total pharmaceutical expendi- tures in both public and private sectors ac- count for over a quarter of total health expen- diture in LMICs (30% in low-income countries and 28% in lower-middle income countries), with some LMICs spending up to two-thirds (67%) of their total health expenditure on pharmaceuticals (22). A high proportion of health spending on medicines may constitute good value for money. However, high expen-ditures on medicines may in fact threaten the sustainability of a health system, as in Ghana where, in 2008 - three years following the im-plementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme - spending on medicines consumed nearly half of the scheme's expenditures (see Chapter 3). Given resource constraints, LMIC health sys- tems cannot afford to spend money ineffi- ciently. In 2010, WHO determined that three of the top ten sources of health care inefficien-cy involved medicines - specifically the high prices of medicines; the use of substandard and counterfeit medicines; and the inappro-priate and ineffective use of medicines (46). Health system reforms aimed at increasing ac- cess to medicines may also serve to increase expenditures, a dynamic that requires more emphasis on the appropriate and efficient use of medicines (68). Risk protection schemes and health care delivery systems in LMICs can use purchasing, selection, utilization manage-ment, and contracting strategies to provide incentives for health system stakeholders (e.g. pharmaceutical industry, providers, and patients) to sell, dispense and use medicines more appropriately and more efficiently (see Chapter 3). 2.2.4 Prescribing practices, dispensing and use Over half of the medicines used in LMICs are used inappropriately; according to the World Medicines Situation 2011, only 30-40% of LMIC patients are treated according to clini- cal guidelines and only about 50% of patients anywhere adhere to treatment regimens (69). Recent studies have identified health system shortcomings - including unreliable medicines procurement and supply systems; insufficient numbers of adequately trained prescribers and dispensers; inadequate knowledge of prescrib-ers, dispensers and patients about medicines; and perverse incentives for prescribers and dis-pensers - as the major causes of suboptimal use of medicines (70, 71). These shortcomings require targeted system strengthening policies to improve the use of medicines (69). In a 2012 report (70), WHO promoted various actions for improving medicines situations at the national level. These included the develop- ment and mandated use of a national essen- tial medicines list; investments in improving national medicines procurement and supply systems; promoting early screening and ac-curate diagnoses; facilitating the of evidence-based treatment guidelines; treatment initia-tives; monitoring medicines use to guide ev-idence-informed policy-making; and ensuring Three of the top ten sources of health care inefficiency involved medi-cines. Over half of the medicines used in LMICs are used inappro-priatelyChapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health SystemsMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 33 government commitment to and stakeholder engagement in the appropriate use of medi-cines (70). 2.2.5 Health-seeking behaviour and reli- ance on the informal health sector Over-the-counter treatments, when used properly, can reduce pressure on the health system and give patients - especially those with poor access to formal health care pro-viders - greater control over their medical conditions (72). However, in many countries, prescription-only medicines are widely sold without a prescription, resulting in patients self-medicating without proper instruction (72). This type of self-medication may not be effective and potentially compromises pa-tients' safety when treatments require diagno- sis by trained practitioners, proper instructions on drug regimens, or follow-up with a provider (83). People may also self-medicate when they have poor access to health care providers or perceive public health facilities to be ineffi- cient or of low quality. Health insurance cover - age for medicines can potentially reduce reli- ance on self-medication and thereby improve the appropriate use of medicines. There are a host of social factors that influence health-seeking behaviour specific to medi-cines. Medicines are sometimes not accept- able due to cultural reasons, stigma (e.g. enrolment in an HIV medicines programme signals HIV/AIDs status (73)), or perceptions about low product quality (e.g. belief that ge- neric medicines from local manufacturers are inferior (74)). Evidence of gender inequities in access is thus far not conclusive (75,76) - the issue remains to be investigated further. 2.2.6 Traditional medicinesPatients in many LMICs rely on traditional medicines or complementary and alternative medicines (77), either because of cultural beliefs or because of poor access to the for - mal health system. While these traditional medicines or complementary and alternative medicines may have clinical benefit, there is concern regarding their lack of regulation and insufficient data on safety, efficacy and quality (77). WHO encourages countries to develop a national policy on these medicines and when safety, efficacy and quality can be established, these medicines may be eligible for inclusion in a national essential medicines list and a health insurance system's medicines reim-bursement list. 2.2.7 Quality control and regulation Challenges in ensuring the quality of medi- cines in LMICs include a lack of reliable data on the extent of the problem, and a lack of agreement between stakeholders about how to deal with those quality issues (78). These challenges have to be addressed within wid-er system constraints that include a lack of regulatory capacity, a general inability to test and monitor data, and a substantial market for counterfeit medicines in LMICs (79, 80). WHO has defined standards of acceptable product quality, safety and efficacy, and it uses these criteria to evaluate medicines for prior - ity diseases and to \"prequalify\" medicines for UN agency and other LMIC purchasers (39). Cost-effective, rapid technologies are needed to monitor the quality of medicines in supply systems, and improved information exchange about quality between key stakeholders (81). An example of an initiative for supporting the exchange of information on medicines qual-ity is QUAMED (Quality Medicines for All), an alliance of non-profit organisations (82). QUAMED was launched in 2011 by the Insti- tute of Tropical Medicine (Antwerp, Belgium) with a mission to improve the quality of the medicines available in LMICs. The organization collects independent information on quality of On average, total phar - maceutical expenditures in both public and private sectors account for over a quarter of total health expenditure in LMICs (30% in low-income countries and 28% in lower-middle income countries), with some LMICs spending up to two-thirds (67%) of their total health expenditure on pharmaceuti-cals (22). In many coun- tries, pre-scription-only medicines are widely sold without a prescrip-tion, resulting in patients self-medicating without proper instruction.Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health Systems34 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE medicines from multiple sources (e.g. public sources such as WHO, audits of international wholesalers and local distributers and manu- facturers, and registration files submitted to regulatory authorities) and partners with NGOs and non-profit procurement centres to share information on the quality of medicines and to build the capacity of LMIC partners to procure quality medicines. 2.2.8 Investing in research and development Research and development (R&D) on innova- tive products, formulations, and drug deliv-ery technologies are important components of improving access to essential medicines in LMICs, especially for HIV/AIDS, tuberculo-sis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases (83) - and also for the medicines children require (84). Driven by strong advocacy, global ac-cess campaigns for HIV/AIDS have resulted in patent flexibilities for public health emergen-cies and national disease priorities (51, 85); enshrined the right to health and medicines in many LMIC constitutions (2); and led to the creation of organizations dedicated to expanding access to medicines for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, such as the Global Fund, PEPFAR, Clinton Health Access Initia- tive, and the Global Drug Facility (53-56, 86). Similar campaigns are needed for neglected tropical diseases, since many of these can be prevented or treated with available medicines, and more research is needed to develop strat- egies to make these medicines accessible, par - ticularly for remote populations (87). The problem of low investment in R&D for medicines for neglected diseases due to low market demand in poor countries is now well recognized. Of the 850 new therapeutic prod- ucts registered in 2000-11, only 37 (4%) were for neglected diseases (88). WHO has tried to address this problem by establishing a Consultative Expert Working Group on Re-search and Development: Financing and Coor - dination, which has made far-reaching recom- mendations to change incentives for R&D (see Chapter 4). The pharmaceutical industry, from small local manufacturers to large multinational R&D firms, has an important role to play in improv-ing access to medicines in LMICs. Increasingly, companies recognize that improving access to medicines in LMICs is a corporate social re-sponsibility goal - and a viable business strat-egy (89). There are numerous tools that in-dustry can use to expand access to innovative products, such as: differential or tiered-pricing according to the economic capacity of the buying country or population group; voluntary licensing to generic manufacturers for produc-tion of generic versions of patented medicines; investing in R&D for neglected diseases; pro bono research; creating wholly-owned local subsidiaries in LMICs; public-private partner - ships for R&D; and participating in patent pools, in which several patents are donated by medicine producers to drive R&D in a particu-lar area (89, 90). More recently, some pharmaceutical compa- nies have started so-called social business or shared-value initiatives that target both the generation of social value for populations in LMICs, and profit (91, see Chapter 5). The Ac-cess to Medicines Index collects data on in-dustry efforts to improve access to medicine in LMICs and publically recognizes companies for their investments and initiatives (92, 93). The Index's objective is to create another form of competition between companies, based on recognition of their investments in access to medicines rather than on market share or sales volumes.Challenges in ensuring the quality of medicines in LMICs include a lack of reliable data on the extent of the problem, and a lack of agree-ment between stakeholders about how to deal with those quality issues. Research and development (R&D) on innovative products, for - mulations, and drug delivery technologies are important components of improv-ing access to essential medi-cines in LMICs, especially for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and ne-glected tropical diseases.Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health SystemsMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 35 2.3 The future of medicines in LMIC health systems Recent decades have seen great progress in improving the access, affordability, and appro- priate use of essential medicines. During this time, understanding has grown about how to create sustainable and equitable health systems in LMICs. From a health systems per - spective, many countries have now identified achieving universal health coverage as their top health system priority (10). At this junc-tion, it is essential to bridge the considerable work done towards improving access to medi-cines, and their affordability and appropriate use in LMICs with the promising agenda of health systems strengthening and universal health coverage.Chapter 2: Evolving Concepts in Essential Medicines and Health Systems36 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE Figure 2.1: Timeline of milestones in development of essential medicines and health systems concepts Alma Ata identifies the \"provision of essential drugs as one of eight key components of PHC\".

Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 43 3.1 Introduction While defined in different ways (94), universal health coverage (UHC) is the focus of high- level global health discussions (95-99) and a declared goal of governments in more than 50 countries (95). WHO's approach to UHC is in Box 3.1 below. In this chapter, we describe how a systems ap- proach to medicines, combined with using in-formation and financing levers, can contribute to achieving UHC goals. We summarize medi- cines policies and management strategies in four countries working towards UHC, and dis-cuss the importance of a systems approach. We go on to emphasize the need for policies to engender equity in health care, and suggest that equity could be advanced through fair decision-making processes. Finally, we outline categories of the information necessary to effectively monitor and adapt policies that ad-dress the equitable access to medicines, their appropriate use, and their affordability for households and systems. 3.2 Why is an explicit focus on medi- cines needed to achieve UHC? The key facets of UHC are the \"provision of, and access to, high-quality health services\" for all people and \"financial protection for people who need to use these services\" (46). Achiev-ing these goals sustainably requires \"constant attention to waste and inefficiency\" in health systems (99). Medicines are indispensable for delivering key aspects of UHC - including coverage, service provision, and risk protection (46) - because they are a requirement for high-quality care, contribute significantly to household health expenditures, and are one of the major causes Box 3.1: Universal Health Coverage (3) The goal of UHC is to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suf - fering financial hardship when paying for them. For a community or country to achieve UHC, several factors must be in place, including: 1. A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority health needs through people- centred integrated care (including services for HIV , tuberculosis, malaria, noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health) that: kinforms and encourages people to stay healthy and prevent illness; kdetects health conditions early; khas the capacity to treat disease; and khelps patients with rehabilitation. 2. Affordability - a system for financing health services so people do not suffer financial hard - ship when using them. 3. Access to essential medicines and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems.4. A sufficient capacity of well-trained, motivated health workers to provide the services to meet patients' needs based on the best available evidence. Medicines are indispensable for delivering key aspects of UHC - includ-ing coverage, service provi-sion, and risk protection (46) Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage44 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE of health system inefficiency. Moreover, the policy mechanisms to manage, pay for, and facilitate the appropriate use of medicines are interwound with those guiding the improve- ment of health systems as a whole. Hence, policy-makers committed to achieving UHC must explicitly focus on medicines through targeted, well-implemented, and continuously adapted policies. Even systems with a long history of working towards UHC must develop new mechanisms for managing the financing of medicines (see Thailand's policy for cover - age of high cost medicines in Chapter 4) and incentivizing their appropriate use in changing environments. 3.2.1 The inappropriate use of medicines can threaten equity, quality, affordability, and efficiency When used appropriately, medicines contrib- ute to the health and well-being of individuals and populations. When used inappropriately, medicines can exacerbate health system in-equities, endanger health, waste resources, and threaten the sustainability of health sys- tems. Given that about half of the medicines in primary care settings are inappropriately prescribed and dispensed (100, 101), ensur - ing quality and appropriate use is of primary concern for health systems and financing schemes. More than US$1,000 billion is spent globally on medicines every year (102), accounting for up to 67% of total health expenditures in LMICs (22) - mostly paid out-of-pocket by consumers. Spending on medicines in LMICs will need to increase even further as donors decrease their financial support for expanded access programmes for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis treatment. As discussed in Chapter 2, medicines account for three of the top 10 sources wasting scarce health system resources. These include higher than necessary medicines prices, substandard and counterfeit medicines and the inappropri- ate use of medicines (46). Medicines-related waste occurs through cost-inflating taxes and tariffs (101); the underuse of generic products (46); the unreliable availability of medicines in public sector facilities (62, 103); the overuse of antibiotics (often for children with respiratory infection or diarrhoea) (104), resulting in drug resistance (105); and the underuse of proven therapies, particularly among the poor and for chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabe- tes) (106, 107) Meanwhile, many households face poverty from having to pay for medicines (108, 109) and many patients die prematurely because they lack access to life-saving medi- cines (110). 3.2.2 Decision-makers must balance com- peting policy objectives Governments and other stakeholders in health systems must balance the competing objec-tives of policy decisions relating to medicines, all of which are closely connected to the goals of achieving UHC. In an ideal world: kall patients - particularly those in vulner - able populations - would be able to ac- cess the medicines they need, according to evidence-based treatment guidelines; kproducts would be of proven quality; kappropriately prescribed and dispensed medicines would be available where and when patients need them; kpatients would take these medicines as necessary to achieve their clinical effects; khouseholds and health systems would have the resources to pay for medicines; kpatients and providers would be satisfied with the way the health system functions; Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 45 klocal manufacturers would be profitable while providing high-quality priority prod- ucts at affordable prices; kresearch companies would inno- vative products for unmet health needs; and kall stakeholders would adhere to good governance and ethical business prac- tices and actively contribute to equitable systems. The four main policy objectives with respect to medicines in health systems - widely available high-quality generic and innovative products; equitable access; appropriate and safe use; and affordability for households and systems - inevitably compete in many ways (Figure 3.1). For example, price pressures to contain costs may contribute to low quality - or the outright lack - of products in the market, and providing subsidized medicines may strain a system's resources. Limiting the coverage of medicines to preserve financial sustainability - for example, by only subsidizing medicines used in inpatient settings - may increase out- of-pocket household spending on medicines in ambulatory care, impoverish households, decrease access, impede appropriate use, and negatively impact health (111). In addition to competing objectives, other system charac- teristics add further complexity. Weak regula- tory capacity, information imbalance, lack of coordination among - and opportunities for economic gain by - different stakeholders provide perverse incentives for suppliers, dis- tributors, prescribers, dispensers and patients to increase the consumption, cost, and inef-ficiencies of medicines in systems. 3.2.3 Decision-makers can use information and financial levers to balance competing objectives Although the various objectives of medicines policy may compete with each other, a systems Encouraging Appropriate Use \u007f Implementing and updating standard treatment guidelines (STGs) \u007f Matching essential medicines and reimburse-ments lists to STGs \u007f Assessing provider performance \u007f Managing care comprehensively \u007f Implementing and monitoring policies to encourage clinically appropriate and cost-effective useEnsuring Availability of Quality Generic and Innovative Products \u007f Monitoring product quality \u007f Prequalifying supplies, products \u007f Negotiating prices, quality, volume, supply-chain security \u007f Promoting fair competition \u007f Engaging in risk sharing agreements \u007f Establishing patient access programsImproving Equitable Access \u007f Understanding socioeconomic and geographic disease and utilization pro les \u007f Assessing of household care seeking and barriers to care \u007f Expanding provider networks \u007f Targeting policies and programs to improve access for vulnerable populations Keeping Costs Affordable \u007f Monitoring routine medicines expenditures by therapeutic area \u007f Evaluating health technologies, budget impact \u007f Assessing household medicines expenditure burden \u007f Implementing and monitoring policies and programs to reduce waste, inappropriate useFigure 3.1: Approaches to balance competing medicines policy objectives The four main policy objec-tives with respect to medicines in health systems - widely available high-quality generic and innovative products; equi-table access; appropriate and safe use; and afford-ability for households and systems - inevitably compete in many ways.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage46 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE approach offers opportunities for innova- tive solutions. Countries implementing and expanding financing schemes to meet UHC goals will also have levers - information and financial incentives - to help balance compet-ing medicines policy objectives (Figure 3.1 lists some approaches that rely on these levers). For instance, financing schemes can access in- formation on the demographic characteristics, health care needs, and utilization patterns of members because they enrol members and pay for their care. Financing schemes can also access information about the demographics and behaviour of health care providers, includ- ing their prescribing patterns and associated costs, because they employ or contract with them. As financial intermediaries, financing schemes have leverage to determine what types of care, and medicines, they pay for; they can also pro- vide incentives to health care providers for purchasing, prescribing, and dispensing, and to patients for using the most clinically appro-priate, safe, and cost-effective medicines. Since they pay for large quantities of medicines, fi- nancing schemes can also be in a position to negotiate product prices with suppliers (See Chapter 4), dictate standards of product qual-ity, react to unethical promotion practices, and demand supply chain efficiency. By virtue of their access to information, schemes can help to shape patient demand for care, through ed-ucational outreach and provider and patient targeted incentives to encourage screening, prevention, and cost-effective care. Information and financing levers may help policy-makers balance the competing aims of equitable and affordable access, availability of high-quality, needed medicines, and appropri- ate use. International (111, 112) and local data on burden of disease, combined with informa-tion on patterns of utilization within schemes, are needed to prioritize health conditions in a population, and to signal potential inappro-priate medicines use patterns. Evidence-based clinical guidelines (113) can inform medicines reimbursement lists. Economic assessments (including health technology assessments and budget impact analysis) (114), can inform de-cisions about the coverage of treatments, and frameworks for transparency (115) can guide decision-making processes (116). Participa-tion in international collaborations on product quality assurance (117) can strengthen capac-ity for the efficient and reliable supply of medi- cines (118). Several medicines management approaches, such as implementing standard treatment guidelines and selecting medicines for es-sential medicines lists, have been used for many years in LMICs (120). In section 3.2, we describe examples of approaches used in se- lected countries. Policies and programmes that target costs of care (e.g. reference pricing or generic substitu-tion) or quality of care (e.g. disease manage- ment programmes) have been used extensively in high-income countries. More recently, coun-tries and systems have implemented policies that seek to incentivize use of high-value care through pay-for-performance programmes. These financially reward prescribers for achiev- ing quality, efficiency and \"value\" by reducing out-of-pocket expenses for medicines known to improve health outcomes. However, evi-dence on the effects of value-focused policies is mixed in high-income countries (121-124) and virtually non-existent in LMICs (125). 3.3 Medicines management in China, Ghana, Indonesia and Mexico To illustrate how health care financing schemes have balanced competing objectives with respect to medicines, we conducted case-studies in four countries striving towards UHC: Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 47 CountryReported % popula- tion enrolled in any scheme in the countryScheme covering the poor Year of inception: funding arrangementProvider mix China 94%-99% (126)NCMS (2003): Premiums and federal and local government subsidiesLargely private contractors Indonesia 40%-63% (127, 128)JK (2005) 1: General tax revenueLargely public sector providers Ghana 33% (129)NHIS (2004): Value added tax and mandatory social security contributions by formal employeesMixed public/private providers Mexico 75-100% (130, 131)SP (2003): Premiums and general tax revenueNearly exclu-sively public providers the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in China; the National Health Insur - ance in Ghana; Jamkesmas (JK) in Indonesia; and Seguro Popular (SP) in Mexico (Table 3.1). The countries were select- ed to balance a mix of population coverage (showing different stages of moving towards UHC), funding arrangements (tax-based vs. premium-based), geographical differences, and provider networks (public vs. private). In performing these case-studies, we explored five crucial policy and management areas (67): kthe selection of medicines that schemes provide or subsidize; kstrategies for procurement and reimburse-ment; kcontracting with or paying providers who prescribe and dispense medicines; kmedicines utilization management tools; and ksystems for monitoring prices, prescribing behaviour, and user satisfaction. We reviewed documents and interviewed key informants to understand whether the schemes used specific strategies for selecting medicines (lists of covered medicines [formu-laries]; patient cost sharing; and regulations for dispensing a generic for a prescribed brand-name product). We also investigated what policies were in place for purchasing (price negotiations, bulk purchasing, and ref- erence pricing); contracting (fee-for-service, capitation, or Rural Scheme, SP: Seguro Popular: 1Since 2014 Jamkesmas has ( Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial or BPJS) Detailed case-studies is in the web annex.Table 3.1: Overview of health care financing schemes in China, Ghana, Indonesia and Mexico The case-study investigations uncovered a wealth of information on health system structures within which the schemes operated, on the popula-tions, sources of overall scheme financ-ing, and on the medicines that were selected for service provision and paid for by the scheme.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage48 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE reimbursement rates, and preferred provider networks); and management of utilization (pay-for-performance, separation of prescrib- ing and dispensing, disease management pro- grammes). We also asked schemes whether they monitored member satisfaction, and pur - chasing and prescribing patterns. The case-study investigations uncovered a wealth of information on health system struc- tures within which the schemes operated, on the populations, sources of overall scheme fi-nancing, and on the medicines that were se-lected for service provision and paid for by the scheme. Much less information was available on medicines procurement, and even less on how schemes contract suppliers, manage the use of medicines, and monitor prescribing or member satisfaction. Some evidence on the impact of medicines financing on medicines access was found in China, Ghana and Mexi-co, but not in Indonesia. Table 3.2 summarizes the management and policy approaches of the four schemes in 2013 (further details are in the web annex). All schemes had formularies that defined the medicines they covered, and these were based on national essential medicines lists, al- though selection criteria may not always have been based on evidence of clinical effective-ness. Some schemes (Indonesia and Mexico) required the use of generics when available. All schemes paid 100% of the costs of cov-ered medicines without patient co-payments. However, in China, schemes only start cover - ing medicines after patients have paid a de- ductible, and they discontinue coverage after a maximum insurance payment has been reached (coverage cap) in a given time frame. Informants did not mention restrictions on coverage for specific medicines or populations, such as requirements of documenting failed treatment with a first-line therapy before a second-line therapy would be covered (prior authorization). The four schemes used pooled procurement to lower medicines procurement prices. In addi- tion, three schemes (China, Indonesia, Mexi- co) engaged in direct price negotiations either for all medicines procured by the scheme or only for single source products, and they have introduced electronic procurement systems to enhance transparency in the process. Ghana and Mexico set maximum prices at which sup- pliers are reimbursed by the scheme. Indone-sia set maximum retail prices for all retailers, not only those affiliated with the scheme. Most schemes limited coverage to accredited health care service providers. Prescriber and dispenser payment strategies varied: Ghana, Indonesia and Mexico used fixed prescriber payments whereas in China, payment was linked to service volume and type. Whereas In-donesia and Mexico had fixed dispenser pay-ments in the public sector, dispensing charges in China and Ghana were included in the product reimbursements. All schemes implemented a variety of strate- gies to manage utilization, including sepa-rating the incomes of public prescribers from medicines sales. Most reported well-estab-lished programmes for developing and imple-menting standard treatment guidelines and for disease management. However, payment for performance in relation to standard treat-ment guidelines had not been used to incen-tivize individual prescribers or dispensers. In general, publicly-available documentation in these four countries provided little informa- tion on monitoring and evaluation activities of the schemes. No scheme reported mechanisms to routinely monitor utilization. All schemes had introduced the monitoring of procure-ment processes. Only Mexico routinely moni- tored and published information on patient satisfaction with the dispensing of medicines Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 49 at the country level. The case-studies found some information on how financing medicines affects the availabil- ity, access, and use of medicines, and house- hold and system affordability in China, Ghana and Mexico. Early cross-sectional appraisals of China's health system reforms found lower medicines prices in primary care facilities, but no clear positive impacts on generally low availability (132), cost per prescription (133) or less-than-appropriate use. In Ghana, medi-cines expenditures had drastically increased (134), although for some, access to medicines seems to have improved (135). However, whether increased spending has improved eq-uity in access and appropriate use is question-able, given evidence of supplier-induced de-mand (136) and medicines utilization changes that did not match enrolment patterns (137). In Mexico, there was no drop in household medicines spending after 10 months (138) or in comparison to households not insured by Seguro Popular (139). 3.3.1 Systems striving towards UHC face common policy implementation challenges These case-studies highlight common chal- lenges faced by different health systems. For instance, decentralization in China, Indone-sia, and Mexico has led to differences in the implementation of medicines policy across provinces, and may contribute to geographic and socioeconomic inequities in access and use. For numerous reasons, including increas- ing numbers of individuals enrolled, a rise in prevalence of chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy, greater availability of new, higher cost medicines, and higher demand for these medicines, the use of medicines and their expenditures increase over time in any system. If rising costs are not managed effec-tively, they may threaten the long-term sus-tainability of schemes (140).Evidence from Thailand shows that financing schemes tend to address medicines in an ex-plicit way only when spending on medicines threatens the viability of the scheme (141), and that they then focus primarily on prices rather than on appropriate use of medicines and the mechanisms that influence use. This approach is reflected in the four schemes studied, where responses to containing expenditure growth have included budget caps on pharmaceuti-cal expenditures (Mexico) and medicines price limits (all four countries). Providers are mostly paid through fixed salaries, irrespective of the quality of their prescribing efficiency or the health outcomes actually achieved. 3.3.2 Using financial and information levers to increase quality and efficiency Given that about half of the medicines in pri- mary care settings are inappropriately pre- scribed and dispensed (100, 101), ensuring quality and appropriate use must be of pri-mary concern for health systems and financ-ing schemes. Expenditure-focused policy instruments can be blunt and have unintended effects: while policies such as state-level caps in the Chi- na and Mexico case-studies could contain spending on pharmaceuticals, they do not necessarily direct spending to more clinically appropriate medicines or eliminate wasteful spending on clinically unnecessary or substan-dard products. Medicine sales are difficult to regulate in the private sector, even when, as in Ghana, private sector providers are part of the NHIS network. Incentives to sell higher-priced products may drive higher medicines expendi-tures in such systems. Different mechanisms of provider payment may incentivize more cost-effective use of medicines. So far, perfor - mance-based payment strategies have been underused in the schemes studied. Given that about half of the medicines in primary care settings are inappropriately prescribed and dispensed (100, 101), ensuring quality and appropriate use must be of primary concern for health systems and financing schemes. For numerous reasons, includ-ing increasing numbers of individuals enrolled, a rise in prevalence of chronic condi-tions requiring long-term therapy, greater availability of new, higher cost medicines, and higher de-mand for these medicines, the use of medi-cines and their expenditures increase over timeChapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage50 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE Medicines Management StrategiesNew Cooperative Medical Scheme (China)National Health Insurance Scheme (Ghana)Jamkesmas (Indonesia)Seguro Popular (Mexico) SELECTION Formulary \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc Cost sharing for medicines included in the formulary \u00fc Generic substitution \u00fc 1 1 PROCUREMENT Medicines prices negotiation or rebates \u00fc \u00fc (\u00fc) Bulk procurement \u00fc \u00fc1 \u00fc \u00fc Generic reference pricing \u00fc 1 \u00fc CONTRACTING Fixed salary for prescribers \u00fc \u00fc1 \u00fc Fixed reimbursement rates for medicines \u00fc \u00fc 1 1 Preferred provider network (accreditation) \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc UTILIZATION Standard treatment guidelines (\u00fc) \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc Payment for performance (\u00fc) Separation of prescribing and dispensing \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc \u00fc Disease management programmes \u00fc 4 \u00fc \u00fc MONITORING AND EVALUATION Routine patient consumer satisfaction monitoring(\u00fc) 4 \u00fc Medicines purchasing monitoring \u00fc4 4 \u00fc Prescription monitoring 4 Table 3.2: Policy and management approaches in country case-studies 2= mix of capitation and salary; 3= confidential agreements between insurance companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers; 4=information not publically available; ( )= Limited use.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 51 The four case-studies highlight the fact that schemes may not have sufficient information about which medicines they pay for. As ob- served in Ghana and Indonesia, schemes of- ten have inefficient claims-processing systems, which may be paper-based rather than elec-tronic, and often require resource-consuming reviews. Inefficient claims-review systems can lead to delays in payments to facilities, short-ages of facility funds to purchase medicines, and medicines stock-outs. Inefficient data pro-cessing systems also make it difficult to access timely information about medicine utilization, which is crucial for both routine expenditure monitoring and for designing strategies to en-courage more cost-effective use. Access to pa-tient-level clinical and demographic data will be increasingly important in systems covering innovative, high-cost biological medicines such as novel cancer treatments that may benefit only a few carefully selected patients. Differ - ent tools and approaches than those designed to provide a minimum benefit from medicines are needed to help make decisions about the coverage of specialized high-cost medicines (142). (See Chapter 4). 3.3.3 A systems approach is important when implementing medicines policies The case-studies highlight how one policy in a complex system can impact the behaviours of multiple actors, which may in turn affect expenditures, quality of care, and patient outcomes in numerous ways. Figure 3.2 il-lustrates the relationships between key actors in Ghana's pharmaceutical system.

When case-based provider payment was first introduced in Ghana in 2008, medicines were excluded from the provider payment, and medicines reimbursement to facilities contin- ued on a fee-for-service basis (143). For the various types of providers (e.g. licensed chemi-cal sellers, private pharmacies, private hospi-tals, public hospitals, and mission hospitals), payments for medicines may have served as a source of income to offset perceived or actual decreases in income from medical services (143). Providers' responses to the payment policy likely contributed to an unintended rise in numbers of prescriptions, cost per prescrip-tion, and doubling of NHIS expenditures on medicines (143), which pressured the NHIS both logistically (through the required review of claims) and financially. Reimbursement de-lays may have led to medicine stock-outs and to providers leaving the NHIS. This cascade of policy effects (described in more detail in the web annex) would have had negative effects on consumers and patients, as they had more difficulty in obtaining access to prescribed medicines. The case-studies illustrate that medicines poli- cies and strategies - which are crucial to achieve wider UHC goals - vary across differ - ent settings, and that information and financ- ing levers with the potential to help balance competing medicines policy objectives are cur - rently underused. A systems approach helps to identify where policies have the greatest potential to advance UHC and medicines ob-jectives - or where those policies might lead to unintended consequences that undermine their objectives. Such a perspective can also highlight some of the substantial ethical chal-lenges that schemes face when making deci-sions about medicines coverage. 3.4 Towards UHC: ethical consider - ations must guide policy decisions UHC is by definition an ethical endeavour as it urges health systems around the world to implement pre-payment and risk-sharing strategies, ensure the equitable distribution of health resources, and move towards equity in access to health services (45). Equity here refers to \"equal access to available care for equal need, equal utilization for equal need, and equal quality of care for all\" (144). In the context of this chapter, equity relates to avoid-ing or minimizing disadvantages that arise from lack of access to medicines (for example, due to an inability to pay for them), especially for the poorest. In every health system, limited resources are spread across medical services that range from preventive to curative (including pharma- cotherapy) and palliative care. Medicines con- stitute a critical component of expenditures. Even well-intended policies may create ineq-uitable outcomes. For instance, limiting cover - age to inpatient care (inclusive of medicines) to protect households from catastrophic pay-ments for sudden high-cost hospitalizations may contain expenditures on medicines by the financing scheme, but may be detrimental for poor households that cannot afford regular payments for common outpatient medicines. In contrast, wealthier households are better able to shoulder recurring expenditures, and they are also more likely than poorer house-holds to be able to access hospital-based care. In working towards UHC, decision-makers must ensure that policies facilitate access to medicines and decrease economic burden equitably, an aspect we address in the sub-section below. The case- studies illustrate that medicines poli-cies and strate-gies - which are crucial to achieve wider UHC goals - vary across different set-tings, and that information and financing levers with the potential to help balance competing medicines pol-icy objectives are currently underused. Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 53 3.4.1 Striving towards equity-enhancing pharmaceutical policies To achieve UHC, policy-makers must move to- wards equity-enhancing pharmaceutical poli- cies. Equity is intimately linked with fairness and social justice, and underscores the legiti-macy of policies (see Box 3.2). Equitable poli-cies can help reduce poverty in the long run, especially where investment strengthens hu- man capabilities (145, 146). They also height- en awareness of the discrimi-nation suffered by certain groups of people, boost trust and social cohesion, and re-duce political conflict (147). Finally, equity contributes to the sustainability of health systems by determining what will be provided within a resource-constrained setting based on a set of criteria that is fair (148). Determining whether a phar - maceutical policy is equitable can be difficult as this judg-ment is intertwined with other social values. Often, a specific situation is further compli- cated by clinical uncertainties, competing ob- jectives, and different stakeholder interests. Not surprisingly, there is disagreement over which values should drive pharmaceutical policy decisions and there is no fixed formula guaranteed to resolve differences arising from conflicting values or to generate categorically equitable outcomes. Many health systems rely on input about cost-effectiveness from health technology assessment (HTA) for decisions on medicines selection or reimbursement, al- though different systems vary in how they ap- ply these assessments. While HTA and other forms of economic evaluations are important in informing policy, they tend to be primarily concerned with efficiency, which is just one of many values. There are several frameworks for assessing the equity and fairness implications of a policy. Rather than providing the strengths and weak- nesses of these frameworks here, we have in-stead selected a commonly-used and accepted ethical framework - \"accountability for rea-sonableness\" (A4R) - to guide our analysis (149, 150). To date, a number of organizations and regulatory bodies have applied this A4R framework, to varying degrees, in assessing the equity and fairness implications of policies. These include Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in the USA (see Box 3.3), the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK (151), Seguro Popular in Mexico (152), the Response to Accountable Priority Setting for Trust in Health Systems (REACT) project in the United Republic of Tanzania (153), and the National Health Insurance Program of South Korea (154). A4R seeks to ensure that policies enhance eq- uity by satisfying four decision-making condi- tions (149): kPublicity: policies regarding both direct and indirect limits on the provision and Box 3.2: Equity Equity refers to \"equal access to available care for equal need, equal utilization for equal need, and equal quality of care for all.\" (144) In the context of this chapter, equity relates to avoiding or minimizing disadvantages that arise from lack of access to medicines (for example, due to in-ability to pay for them), especially for the poorest. Equity is intimately linked with fairness and social justice, and un-derscores the legitimacy of policies. A systems ap- proach helps to identify where policies have the greatest potential to advance UHC and medicines objectives - or where those policies might lead to unintended consequences that undermine their objectives.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage54 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE reimbursement of medicines and their ra- tionales should be publicly accessible. kRelevance: the rationale behind decisions should provide a reasonable explanation of how the varied health needs of a de- fined population are met under reasonable resource constraints. An explanation is \"reasonable\" if it is grounded in principles and evidence that are accepted as relevant by fair-minded people who are disposed to finding mutually justifiable terms of cooperation. kRevision and appeals: all decisions and policies must be subject to mechanisms for challenge and dispute resolution, and more broadly, provide opportunities for revision and improvement in light of new evidence and arguments. kRegulation or enforcement: there must be voluntary or public regulation to ensure that the conditions set out above are met. To further emphasize the importance of full participation in democratic deliberation, some have proposed empowerment as a fifth con-dition to the A4R framework (155). In the context of this report, empowerment would require effort by policy-makers to minimize power differences in decision-making pro-cesses and to optimize opportunities for par - ticipation in priority setting. Arguably, pharmaceutical policies in systems working towards UHC are more likely to be equity-oriented or equity-enhancing if they are generated in a deliberative environment that is fair and inclusive - both in terms of the values encompassed and through partici-pation by members of the health system con-cerned, especially those that are most directly affected. In reality, however, it can be difficult to fully account for these fairness and inclusion requirements of the A4R framework. While the framework attempts to ensure that decisions in pharmaceutical policies are legitimate and fair, the outcomes are not necessarily equi- table. Hence, constant monitoring and evalu-ation of policy outcomes is of utmost impor - tance in ensuring that equity is enhanced or maximized as systems strive towards UHC. 3.5 Information about medicines is key to achieving UHC goals Information is critical in determining policies for effective, safe, equitable, and efficient use of medicines; affordable access by households; and economic sustainability of schemes. Medi-cines policies also need to account for contexts such as population demographics, disease epidemiology, treatment approaches, and political and economic environments that are constantly changing. This means that systems need to generate routine, up-to-date informa-tion about the medicines that patients need, which medicines they are using and how use differs across member groups, who prescribes them, whether these medicines are clinically appropriate, address the disease burden faced by the population, and how much both the scheme and its members spend on medicines. Without this information, systems will find it difficult to ensure that they are moving in the direction of UHC - i.e. equitable access to quality care and financial risk protection - and that they are spending their resources efficiently. Information systems need to have mecha- nisms to capture individual medicine utiliza-tion and expenditures, to judge the quality, equity, and efficiency of care and to know whether bundled payment rates, when imple- mented, are justified. However, when schemes reimburse providers through bundled payment arrangements (e.g. case-based or episode-based payment), information systems may not Systems need to generate routine, up-to-date informa-tion about the medicines that patients need, which medicines they are using and how use differs across member groups, who prescribes them, whether these medi-cines are clini-cally appropri-ate, address the disease burden faced by the population, and how much both the scheme and its members spend on medicines.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 55 Box 3.3: The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care ethics advisory group Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC) is a not- for-profit, private health insurance company serving about 1.2 million members in the USA. In 1996, facing the challenge of balancing rising costs with growing patient needs, the organization created an ethics programme, based on \"the conviction that virtually every area of our activity has implications for the ethical quality of the care and service our members receive\" (156). An ethics advisory group (EAG) composed of health insurance leaders, insurance purchasers, consumers, and physician leaders from contracted practices, and representatives of the larger public (157) meets quarterly to deliberate on cases brought to it by the insurance scheme's managers who need to consult on the values associated with operational and policy decisions. The EAG's ap-proach is based on a widely-used framework for conceptualizing the ethics of organizations called \"stakeholder theory\" which holds that the interests of all the parties involved in any transaction ought to be considered in deter - mining how to act ethically (158). The main goal of the EAG is to \"promote increased or - ganizational skill at identifying and addressing ethical aspects of key policy, operational, and budgetary decisions\". (159) Through active participation, members of the ethics group systematically examine conflicts of values that arise from the legitimate and often competing interests of the various stakehold-ers whose needs the insurance scheme seeks to meet. Over the years, the EAG has deliber - ated on a number of challenging medicines-coverage decisions. For example, the 1998 US approval of sildenafil for erectile dysfunc-tion raised the question whether an insurance scheme should allocate resources to pay for a medicine considered by some to be \"a life-style drug\" (159). More recently, the EAG dis-cussed the challenge of covering increasingly available high-cost specialty medicines that provide benefits to only a few patients. Such medicines include ivacaftor, a new drug to treat patients with a rare form of cystic fibro-sis, currently priced at about US$ 300,000 per patient per year. Importantly, this EAG meeting included representatives from several pharma-ceutical companies (160). In both instances, EAG deliberations provided non-binding guid-ance to insurance decision-makers. The experience of how this group has worked within the organization offers several practi-cal lessons. The stakeholders of the EAG can help insurance leaders tease out the value di-mensions underlying policy options; voices of members, providers, employers who purchase insurance, insurance programme staff, and the larger community contribute to a growing case portfolio of transparency in difficult discussions about cost and quality of care. Explicit ethical analysis of challenging coverage questions can provide practical decision-making support to insurance leaders and help communicate deci-sions to different stakeholders (159). EAG leaders believe that over time, health care ethics will advance through careful observa-tion of decision-making processes by govern-ments, payers, providers, and consumers (159); that values underlying decisions will become more transparent and decision processes more fair, contributing to increased trust between patients, providers, and payers; and that re-sulting management of costs of care through limit-setting policies may be more just and ac-ceptable by different stakeholders. (160)Policy-makers seeking to improve medi-cines situations on the way to UHC need to take a systems approach, considering the converging or competing interests, roles, responsibilities, and resources of all stake-holders. Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage56 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE be designed to capture data on specific medi- cines prescribed for individual patients, since payment does not depend on the information. Routine information in at least four categories is needed to inform medicines policy adaptation: kspending on medicines (e.g. per member per month); kmedicine utilization (e.g. number of pre- scriptions per member per month); kquality of pharmaceutical care (e.g. per - centages of primary care patients receiving antibiotics, those receiving injections, or newly-diagnosed diabetic patients receiv-ing first-line therapy according to standard treatment guidelines); and kfraud and abuse (e.g. number of prescrip- tions per provider, number of prescriptions dispensed per member). Key indicators need to be assessed overall, but also disaggregated by therapeutic drug class, provider, and member characteristics (so-cioeconomic status, location of residence, etc.). Based on key medicines information, policy-makers can develop interventions to strengthen the management of medicines in the scheme as a whole; target policies that increase access within specific disadvantaged groups; develop strategies for volume-based price negotiations with manufacturers; target education programmes for members and pro- viders and incentive policies aimed at improv-ing prescribing; and carry out audits of institu-tions or providers suspected of fraud. In the early stages of developing information systems, schemes can plan to combine in- formation from different parts of the health care system. Regular samples of paper-based facility procurement, prescribing, and dispens-ing records can provide sufficiently detailed information on utilization to inform policy decisions. Widely-used facility-based indica-tors of medicine use that can be calculated from relatively small, regular samples of pa- per-based records include the percentages of medicines procured or dispensed in primary care facilities that are injectables, antibiotics, corticosteroids, or vitamins; the percentages of medicines prescribed that are on essential medicines or reimbursement lists; and the per - centage of prescriptions that follow standard treatment guidelines. Chapter 6 and the re-lated web annex elaborate more on medicines indicators and data sources. Importantly, equity in access to medicines can- not be assessed using only data from the delivery system, because these data do not capture underuse of services by people who cannot access care because of geographic, economic, or sociocultural reasons. Household surveys are needed to understand community need for and barriers to access among vulner - able, disadvantaged populations (161). 3.6 Conclusions and recommendationsThe case-studies presented in this chapter il- lustrate that, despite the overall size of the pharmaceutical market, to date medicines are not a central component of UHC debates. Making UHC a reality will require a much more explicit focus on medicines. Health systems pursuing UHC have information, financial and other policy levers to work towards balancing the competing objectives of availability, access, affordability and appropriate use, equitably and efficiently. Policy-makers seeking to im-prove medicines situations on the way to UHC need to take a systems approach, considering the converging or competing interests, roles, responsibilities, and resources of all stake- holders - regulators, payers, facility managers, procurement officers, local and multinational drug industries, prescribers, dispensers, and Pharmaceutical policies in systems work-ing towards UHC need continuous adaptation to a shifting context (e.g. evolving population demograph-ics, disease epidemiol-ogy, treatment approaches, political and economic envi-ronments) and changing reali-ties. Such adap-tations must be informed by the best available evidence.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health CoverageMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 57 consumers. These diverse stakeholders have different perspectives on how systems should devote resources to medicines, highlighting the ethical complexities of policy-making that require deliberative, inclusive, and transpar - ent processes. The use of evidence-informed, systems-oriented policy approaches will in-crease the likelihood of equitable, effective, af-fordable pharmaceutical policy outcomes, and boost progress towards UHC. Pharmaceutical policies in systems working towards UHC need continuous adaptation to a shifting context (e.g. evolving population de- mographics, disease epidemiology, treatment approaches, political and economic environ-ments) and changing realities. Such adapta-tions must be informed by the best available evidence of what works, for whom, how, and why, in a given situation. Routine monitor - ing and periodic evaluations of impacts of pharmaceutical policies in health systems are therefore indispensable.Chapter 3: The Role of Medicines in Achieving Universal Health Coverage4 INNOVATION TO ENSURE BETTER ACCESS TO MEDICINES 60 - KEY MESSAGES kInnovation - broadly defined as \"a process to create or improve products, processes, technologies and/or ideas to generate posi-tive changes in efficiency, value and quality\" (162) - is urgently needed to bring new and existing medicines to people in novel ways. kInnovations for developing novel medicines for unmet needs require multiple public- and private-sector partnerships, building on communication technology advances, and delinking research and development (R&D) funding from sales revenue. kInnovations to increase the use of quality- assured generic products include multi- pronged strategies involving government regulations of generic product manufactur - ing and licensing, payers that incentivize the prescribing and dispensing of generic prod- ucts, and media that communicate the value of quality generics in health systems. kExpanding access to increasingly available novel products - often high-cost, biotech-nology-based products - raises challenging clinical, ethical, economic, societal, legal and political questions that require multi-stake-holder engagement in fair decision-making processes. kThe overall effects of innovations on health systems need to be assessed. This includes evaluating the reasons the innovations were introduced, monitoring their intended and unintended effects over time, and determin-ing how the innovations adapted (or were adapted to) local contexts.Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 61 4.1 An inclusive definition of innovation Overcoming challenges in medicines availabil- ity requires innovation to identify new diag- nostics and therapies for many diseases and populations around the world (163). Innova-tions are also necessary to ensure that exist-ing products are supplied, prescribed and dispensed correctly, and used appropriately by those who need them, at costs that both households and health systems can afford. Innovation does not solely mean invention, or the development of a new product or technol- ogy. Throughout this report, we consider inno- vation broadly as \"a process to create or im-prove products, processes, technologies and/or ideas to generate positive changes in ef-ficiency, value and quality\"(162). For instance, ensuring that medicines are more widely avail- able and that health market systems work (see Chapter 5) requires stakeholders engaged in different parts of the health system to oper - ate in new ways in developing, regulating, financing, procuring, distributing, prescribing, dispensing, and using medicines. These health system activities are connected to each other; as in the systems approach advanced through-out this report, innovations targeting one part of the health system will require interaction with health system components, institutions or stakeholders to ensure that medicines do in fact improve health. There are many examples of innovations de- signed to make medicines better available (164, 165), several of which illustrate how health system activities are integrally con-nected to other sectors. For instance, the 2013 joint report of the World Health Organization, World Intellectual Property Organization, and World Trade Organization offers a crucial, in-depth discussion of issues at the intersection of public health, intellectual property, and trade (166). In this chapter, we explore innovations in med- icines in three different ways. First is a discus- sion of innovative models of research and development, illustrated by India's promising Open Source Drug Discovery initiative (OSDD). In section 4.3 is an analysis of how markets for generics are expanding, with a look into Bra-zil's innovative generic laws. And lastly is an examination of ways to expand access to spe-cialty medicine, exploring Thailand's access programme targeting high-cost medicines. 4.2 Towards innovative R&D modelsInnovations in research and development (R&D) are needed to develop new products for neglected diseases (e.g. Dengue, Chagas, river blindness) and newly emerging diseases (e.g. pandemic influenza) - both of which dispro-portionally affect people in LMICs. Innovations on new formulations of existing medicines ap- propriate for LMIC populations (e.g. paediatric formulations of HIV/AIDS treatments; heat-stable products) are also required. Traditional R&D models based on protecting intellectual property rights have failed to bring necessary technologies to market because there is often little financial profit. This is a critical friction to resolve: impoverished populations - who suf-fer from diseases they often cannot afford to treat - lack both the political voice and the economic means to afford new medicines. How can industry's profit motive be effectively balanced with essential treatment needs? Creating incentives for pharmaceutical R&D is not only an urgent issue for LMICs, but increas-ingly, for the rest of the world. A major global R&D challenge is the development of new an-tibiotics, since many bacteria have developed resistance to frequently-used antibiotics. No matter how judiciously antibiotics are pre-scribed, their use will inevitably generate re-sistant organisms, rendering novel antibiotics Overcoming challenges in medicines avail-ability requires innovation to identify new diagnostics and therapies for many diseases and populations around the world.Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines62 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE less effective over time. Further complicating the matter is market logic: restricted use of antibiotics will limit sales and impede the cost recovery of drug development, providing little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics. Even if R&D for an-tibiotics could be sufficiently stimulated with public or private subsidies, the current busi-ness model that links revenue and profit to sales volumes will lead to marketing strategies that encourage overuse and drug resistance. Thus, innovative business models are needed to delink revenue from usage. Alternative R&D models do exist and more are currently under development. These involve a wider range of actors and innovative collabora- tions to \"share resources, risks, and rewards\". (167) These novel R&D approaches seek to delink sales revenue and R&D costs through push mechanisms - payments for R&D inputs by, for example, supporting the conduct of clinical trials - and through pull mechanisms such as prizes for R&D that brings successful inventions to market. Innovative product development partnerships (PDPs) (174, 175) have increased the number of medicines in development for neglected dis-eases (176). PDPs are non-profit R&D partner - ships between industry and non-profit organi- zations with major external funding (notably by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Ex-amples of major PDPs include the Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. In 2012, these organizations collectively ac-counted for two-thirds of the more than US$ 375 million funding for PDP research (almost 12% of all global funding for research) on medicines for neglected diseases (176). PDPs are beginning to generate products. In 2007, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Ini-tiative (DNDi) developed the first ever anti-malarial resulting from a PDP (177). ASAQ, a fixed-dose combination of artesunate and amodiaquine for uncomplicated malaria, is a non-exclusive and non-patented drug for adults and children in sub-Saharan Africa; it is a quality, heat-stable product that is dosed Box 4.1: Innovative push and pull R&D Strategies \"Push\" strategies can be used to subsidize research inputs - using funds to spur, for instance, the discovery of new medicines. These strategies, which often devote public funds to R&D in the private sector, include: public-private partnerships such as the GAVI Alliance (168) and the GSK Diseases for the Developing World Research Centre (169); targeted research grants programmes such as the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative (170); and tax credits for R&D spending (169). \"Pull\" strategies, on the other hand, reward research output, providing an incentive to make the results available to its intended population (171). Innovative pull strategies include: prize funds (163), priority review vouchers (169), transferable patent exclusivity (169), and advance market commitments, in which governments or donors commit to buying a quantity of a drug to drive R&D (163, 172). Other strategies to incentivize priority R&D include orphan drug legislation, open source drug discovery, patent pools and regulatory harmonization (173). Creating incen- tives for pharmaceutical R&D is not only an urgent issue for LMICs, but increasingly, for the rest of the world.Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 63 once a day (178). The drug is sold at a \"no- profit, no-loss\" maximum price of US$ 1 per adult treatment to national health services and nongovernmental organizations in en- demic countries. So far, ASAQ has been regis-tered in more than 30 countries and more than 200 million treatments have been distributed (179). Using a tiered-pricing approach, the company sells the fixed-dose combination in private sector markets and contributes 3% of net private sector earnings over seven years to DNDi to further lower the public sector sales price. Another key issue lies in the fact that restricted access to proprietary data can slow or even prevent drug discovery. India launched the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) Initiative (180) to identify urgently needed medicines by combining open source innovation and prod-uct development partnerships (see section 4.2.1.). This new initiative draws upon the les- sons of open-source innovation in information technology and is strategically positioned be-cause of the Council on Scientific and Industri-al Research's history of translating its findings for the Indian generic industry. Innovative open-access development has also begun with medicines to treat common chron- ic diseases affecting patients in high-income countries (181). Similar to the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative (182), the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is a new venture between the United States' National Institutes of Health, ten biopharma- ceutical companies and several non-profit or - ganizations to transform the current model for developing new diagnostics and treatments by jointly identifying and validating promising biological targets of disease (183). To do so, the NIH and industry partners have committed to a (roughly equal) contribution towards an initial five-year budget of US$ 230 million for up to five pilot projects in four disease areas: Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, rheuma-toid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythema-tosus (183). AMP data and analyses will be made available to the entire biomedical com- munity, with the goal of shortening the time to bring new therapies to the market. 4.2.1 India's Open Source Drug Discovery initiative (OSDD) In 2008, India's Council on Scientific and In- dustrial Research (CSIR) piloted the OSDD to develop new medicines for those diseases that drug discovery and development processes had thus far neglected. This first targeted tubercu-losis and later broadened its scope to malaria, filariasis and leishmaniasis (184). The initia-tive seeks to reengineer the means by which new drugs are brought to market. By sharing resources, risks and rewards, OSDD engages a community of students, scientists, clinicians, academicians, and institutions, which collabo-rate through an online platform and offline lab work, in partnership with companies, to develop new treatments free from monopoly rents. By publicly financing the costs of R&D, OSDD can work with generic manufacturers to produce the treatments at close-to-marginal cost, thereby ensuring greater affordability for those in need (185). OSDD shares resources through an online col- laborative platform that operates through a \"clickwrap license\" in which participants agree not to remove knowledge generated from the online commons for proprietary gain. So far, the platform has over 7600 registered participants from 130 countries, 13 engaged CSIR labs, 39 academic institutions and 14 industry partners. OSDD has connected with major product development partnerships, in- cluding the DNDi, the TB Alliance, and MMV . The OSDD hosts over 240 projects, both online and offline, led by over 180 principal investi-gators. At any given time, up to 20% of the Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines64 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE registered participants actively contribute. Online collaborators work on diverse projects, focusing, for example, on identifying gene tar - gets for therapy and understanding toxicities of pre-clinical compounds. The initiative also maintains publicly accessible databases, in-cluding an integrative genomics map of My-cobacterium tuberculosis (185). Engaging its online community, OSDD recently ran a You - Tube Video competition on \"The Need for New Drugs for TB.\" One product from the OSDD network has already involved network volun-teers, who re-annotated the entire M. tubercu- losis genome, telescoping 300 person years of effort into four months (186-188). The OSDD Initiative has also sought to line up the infrastructure to translate early-stage dis-coveries into the first in-human trials, facilitat-ing the transfer from basic research scientists to those who might translate this work into a drug candidate. Biological resources are avail-able through such collections as a library of plant-derived, anti-infective compounds for screening, and an open-access repository of M. tuberculosis clones. The initiative has also assembled a diverse small molecule repository, synthesized by a community of about 80 syn-thetic chemists from 35 institutions. The OSDD Initiative's models share both risks and rewards. Funding is both public and pri-vate, including US$ 12 million funding from the Indian government, private-sector dona-tions and in-kind Information Technology support from companies such as Infosys, and grants from foundations such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. Funding is, in turn, released to proj-ects, both as awards to principal investigators or as projects commissioned and coordinated by OSDD itself. The OSDD initiative also shares financial and non-financial rewards, both at the individual and collective levels. Individual rewards have ranged from activities encouraging women scientists to small prizes in the form of credit for phone usage and Internet access. Largely supported by the Indian government, scien-tists and students alike contribute voluntarily to the network's activities. The OSDD's col-laborative platform tracks those contributing significantly to the online community project, and rewards those individuals in various ways, including authorship and acknowledgement in subsequent publications. Moreover, the best performers in the OSDD community have leveraged their participation into competitive applications for fellowship training in pro-grammes abroad. By publicly financing the R&D of novel antibi- otics, OSDD seeks fair returns from this in- vestment by keeping drug costs affordable through generic licensing. To advance its virtual R&D pipeline, OSDD en- gages partners in such undertakings in two ways: it contracts service providers on a \"work for hire\" basis; and it collaborates with part- ners who donate their services, with the re-sulting intellectual property belonging to the OSDD community. Along these lines, OSDD has secured a non-exclusive right to TB drug candidate PA-824 from the TB Alliance for testing this drug in a new combination regi- men (pyrazinamide + moxifloxacin + PA-824) in Phase IIB clinical trials. The combination has the potential of shortening TB treatment from six to two months. OSDD's non-hierarchical structure carries over to its governance. A Science Support Group - comprised of seven core members and people drawn from the OSDD community, with the leadership of Chief Mentor Dr. S. K. Brahmachari - guides the direction of the OSDD initiative and makes decisions on By sharing resources, risks, and rewards, and involv-ing scientists around the world, OSDD exemplifies a new culture of R&D and is developing a publicly-owned pipeline for bringing new products to markets. Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 65 policies governing its open-access reposito- ries. Though the vision and mission of OSDD is to improve innovation for neglected diseas- es and provide affordable health care to all, its efforts have also inspired a generation of young minds. By sharing resources, risks, and rewards, and involving scientists around the world, OSDD exemplifies a new culture of R&D and is devel- oping a publicly-owned pipeline for bringing new products to markets. 4.3 Innovation in expanding markets for high-quality generic products Quality generic medicines can greatly improve a population's access to medicines (189) - but producing generics and marketing them are not on their own sufficient to achieve this. Introducing generics requires addressing mar - ket forces and challenges in public perception, and in creating incentives for their preferential use. Until this occurs, the utilization of gener - ics and the realization of potential savings from generic utilization, will remain variable across countries at all income levels. Most medicines on national essential medi- cines lists are available as generic products - defined here as products that are intended to be clinically equivalent, lower-cost versions of the molecules of their originator brand coun- terparts, manufactured without a license from the originator and marketed after the expiry date of the patent or other exclusive rights. (189, 190). The highest volumes of generic utilization and resultant medicines expenditure savings have been reported for the United States of Amer - ica (USA), which has successfully addressed both market forces and the challenges of pub-lic perception (191). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves ge-neric products if there is evidence to show that their active ingredient is absorbed at the same rate and to the same extent as the originator product - i.e. that they are \"bioequivalent\". Studies on \"bioequivalence\" (199) and clinical equivalence (200) have shown that most orig-inator and generic products in the USA are, in fact, equivalent. The FDA also enforces the same rigorous standards for quality assurance (current Good Manufacturing Processes) (192) for generics as for originator medicines. Qual-ity assurance is one of several important steps to overcome the almost universal perception that generic products are of lower efficacy or quality than originator products. Generic products play a crucial role in the US health system. In 2011, nearly 80% of the 4 billion prescriptions written in the USA were dispensed using generic products (193). Ge-nerics were dispensed 94% of the time when both a generic and an originator brand coun-terpart were available (194). Use of generics is facilitated by state-level generic substitution regulations, which, in most states, mandate pharmacists to substitute an interchange-able generic product for a prescribed origina-tor product unless otherwise indicated by the prescriber (195). Health insurance schemes in- centivize generic use through tiered pharmacy benefit policies, which have lowest patient co-payments for generic products (196). The high use of generics has resulted in major medicine expenditure savings in the USA, where generic prices are typically a fraction of originator brand prices. Once a second generic product enters the market, the average gener - ic price falls to half the price of the originator counterpart; additional generic competition reduces the cost further, to 20% or less (197). Without safe, high-quality generics, the USA would have spent US$ 500 billion instead of US$ 320 billion on medicines in 2011 (197). Between 2002 and 2011, the use of generics is estimated to have saved the US health care Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines66 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE system US$ 1,070 billion (207). In addition, compared to patients who were dispensed brand-name products, those who were given prescriptions for generic products were more likely to adhere to their chronic disease treat-ment regimens since they incurred lower co-payments (198). Generic products can reduce health care ex- penditures provided that quality generic prod-ucts cost much less than their originator coun-terparts. Some European countries have been less successful than the USA in realizing the full savings potential from the use of gener - ics, due to a prevailing model of administra-tive price regulation that caps reimbursement for generic medicines at a threshold derived from the originator price, rather than letting the market determine the price - as in the USA. When all generics are reimbursed at the same price, the incentive for price competition is lost. This is why several European countries have re-introduced elements of competition in their generics reimbursement policies. Recom-mendations to increase the use of generics in Europe include, among others: accelerating market authorization, pricing and reimburse-ment decisions for generic products; increas-ing prescribing through the use of electronic generic prescribing tools coupled with finan- cial incentives; expansion of generic substitu- tion policies; and incentives for pharmacists to preferentially dispense generics (199, 200). If LMICs increased their use of high-quality, lower-cost generic products, they could realize substantial savings (201). Switching to gener - ics, however, poses considerable challenges. In some LMICs, generics remain relatively expensive because of regulations that do not encourage price competition and a strong domestic generic industry that benefits from keeping prices relatively high and does not favour pro-competition reforms. In Brazil, for instance, generic prices are set at 65% of the prices of originator brand counterparts, thus limiting price competition. In addition, the Brazilian public health care system - Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS) - does not currently apply procurement or financing levers to in-centivize generic use. Other barriers to wider generic use in many countries include mistrust from both providers and patients of the qual-ity of generic products, pharmaceutical sector policies that incentivize the use of high-cost brand name products, and lack of regulation on generic substitutions (202). For LMICs to increase their use of generic products, several factors must be addressed: kthe availability of less expensive, high- quality generic products; kthe low levels of public trust in the quality of available generics; and kthe incentives for prescribers, dispensers, and patients to preferentially use generics. The principal innovation required to meet the above factors include the development of multi-pronged strategies to ensure that low- cost, high-quality generics are available, pre-scribed, dispensed, and used in ways that fit local contexts. Local contexts will require bal-ancing the goals of the health sector - i.e. the availability of low-cost, high-quality generic products - with those of other sectors - e.g. maximizing local generic industry profits - through public and professional education, enforced regulation, active management, and value-based financing policies. In section 4.3.1, we describe several ap- proaches undertaken by the government and other stakeholders in Brazil to increase the availability and use of high-quality generics. Innovation required to promote ge-neric medicines include the development of multi-pronged strategies to ensure that low-cost, high-quality generics are available, prescribed, dispensed, and used in ways that fit local contextsChapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 67 4.3.1 The evolution of Brazil's approach to generic medicines Access to medicines has been a constitutional right in Brazil since 1998. The societal and political environments in 1998 were favour - able for the necessary technical and regula-tory changes, and the government launched a multi-pronged strategy to facilitate access to high-quality, affordable generic medicines (203). Highly-publicized uses of counterfeit products (204) had encouraged social mobi-lization (of patient organizations, advocacy groups and the media) to improve the safety and quality of medicines. In 1999, the Bra-zilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) (205) was created to protect and promote the health of the population. One of ANVISA's first actions was to develop the Brazilian Generics Law, which is one instru-ment in the 1999 National Medicines Policy (206). The goals of the Generics Law were to stimulate competition by increasing the num- ber of products on the market, to improve the quality of medicines, and to facilitate access to medicines. Following international stan-dards (206), the Brazilian Generics Law estab-lished criteria for production, bioequivalence, bioavailability, registration, prescription and dispensing of generic medicines. In 2000, Bra-zil's first six generic products were registered (207). Then, in January 2001, a new regula-tion - with Resolution 10 replacing Resolution 391 - provided greater flexibility in the reg- istration process for generic medicines, thus accelerating the availability of generics in the market. The new regulation added informa-tion, revised points of the original resolution, and filled regulatory gaps (206). The 1999 National Medicines Policy regulates generics, along with medicine production, pro-curement, prescribing, dispensing, and use. To encourage effective implementation, different actors were engaged at the policy develop-ment stage, including various arms of the gov-ernment (the Ministry of Health and ANVISA), local and multinational pharmaceutical com- panies, private retail pharmacies, professional organizations of doctors and pharmacists, and the general population. In 2002, to further engage multiple stakeholders, the Ministry of Health launched campaigns to educate con- sumers (208-210), prescribers, and dispensers about the value of generic medicines, often communicating through social media (218). The educational campaigns seem to have con- tributed to public awareness of generics: in 2007, 95.7% of the sampled population had heard of generic products, and 68.1% could even define \"generic medication\" (211). Since the National Medicines Policy was im- plemented, Brazil has had three types of medi-cines. The first are originator brand products. The second are generics that meet clinical equivalence criteria, are commercialized under the international non-proprietary name (212) of the active ingredient in packages marked with a yellow stripe, (along with a large letter \"G\" and the inscription Generic Medicines), and which are considered interchangeable with the respective originator brand prod- ucts (213). The third are \"similares\" or non-originator brand-name products which do not have to meet equivalence criteria, and which are marketed under a trade name. Since 2000, regulations aimed at assuring the quality of medicines in the market have been implemented. In 2002, Resolution RDC 157 established the requirements for pharmaceu-tical equivalence studies for \"similares\". In 2003, Resolutions RDC 133 and RDC 134 required \"similares\" to undergo, by 2014, the same relative bioavailability and pharmaceu-tical equivalence tests required for generic products.Regulated market entry of quality-as-sured generic products was one strategy adopted by the Brazilian government to increase the availability of high-quality medicines.Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines68 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE Within Brazil's public Unified Health System (SUS), prescribers must use generic names. In private practices, prescribers may use generic or brand names, but may choose to restrict the substitution of branded medicines with gener - ics (214). Notably, the procurement of generic products is not mandatory in the SUS; rather, quality standards, product specific characteris-tics, and lowest price are the principal criteria for selecting a supplier and product for SUS (215). \"Similares\" are thus more available than generics in the public sector (214, 216). Regulated market entry of quality-assured ge- neric products was one strategy adopted by the Brazilian government to increase the availability of high-quality medicines. To make generics more affordable, the Brazilian Gov-ernment set the maximum generic end-user product prices at 35% below the innovator brand product prices (217). On average, in 2006, generic medicines were priced 40% lower than their innovator counterparts (218). The introduction of the 1999 Generics Law likely contributed to the growth of the domes- tic pharmaceutical industry. In 2003, only one Brazilian firm was among the 12 companies controlling close to half of the Brazilian mar - ket, but by 2012, 5 of the top 12 companies - with a 49% market share - were Brazilian (219). In 2002, generics made up 4.8% of the market volume, but this grew to 18% by 2008. Market share in value increased from about 4% in 2002 to about 15% in 2008 and 27% in 2013 (220). While additional policy mea-sures are available, a multi-pronged strategy of ongoing adaptation of legislation, the gov- ernment's enforcement of regulations, and its involvement in educating the public through social marketing have increased access to quality assured generic medicines at more af-fordable prices in Brazil (207).4.4 Innovation in expanding access to specialty medicines The majority of new medicines coming to mar - ket target complex diseases that require specialist treatment. Many of these diseases are increasingly prevalent across the globe, including cancer (221) and hepatitis; oth-ers, such as cystic fibrosis, affect relatively few patients, with most of these in high-income countries. Frequently, new medicines are biological agents - complex macromol-ecules produced by recombinant DNA tech-nology - that come to market at prices that are orders of magnitude higher than those of small-molecule products. Biological agents are expected to represent about 20% of the world's pharmaceutical market by 2017 (222). Reasons behind the high prices for biological agents include: the challenge of establishing bioequivalence for follow-on biologics, or bio- similars; the extended data exclusivity offered to biologics (12 years in USA); and the com-plexity of manufacturing some biologics. Providing access to novel cancer therapies and other specialty medicines poses enormous challenges. Innovation is required to ensure that specialty medicines reach only the pa-tients for whom they are indicated; that they are administered in the specialty settings re-quired for safe and effective care; that they are priced and financed in ways that individuals, households, and systems can afford; and that they maintain incentives for different actors to continue the R&D of innovative products. Pharmaceutical companies, governments, pay- ers, philanthropists, clinicians and professional societies, nongovernmental organizations, pa-tient groups, academics and others have roles in improving access to valuable new specialty medicines. To make new treatments more af-fordable, these groups should engage in con-structive dialogue about which medicines are Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 69 clinically beneficial and economically afford- able, and how products should be priced to re-flect their medically-proven and cost-effective value (223). Companies can offer highly discounted prices for valuable medicines to LMICs, with tiered- pricing schemes targeting different in-country populations, patient assistance programmes for the poor, risk-sharing programmes with LMIC governments and insurance schemes, and voluntary licenses to - and partnerships with - generics manufacturers (224). Governments can facilitate access through regulations that increase the speed and effi-ciency of clinical trials for promising products. They can ensure that only valuable specialty medicines are appropriately used by improv- ing health care delivery and informatics infra- structures and through financing policies that remove provider and patient incentives that unintentionally lead to the misuse of high-cost medicines. Governments can allocate resources, engage in innovative financing ar - rangements with companies, and coordinate different funding sources - e.g. the private sector, philanthropic agencies, and third-party payers - of specialty medicines for different populations in their systems. Generic production of biosimilars, and subse- quently, competition among products, are expected to make biologic compounds less expensive and more accessible. Different from small-molecule medicines, however, for which approval generally indicates interchangeabil- ity with the originator product, governments need to define requirements for approving a biosimilar. To date, regulations on the licens-ing and interchangeability of biosimilar prod- ucts vary by jurisdiction and remain in flux (225, 226). Governments also have the option to use compulsory licensing provisions under the TRIPS agreement, with such licensing allowing governments to import or produce a generic version of a patented product without the con- sent of the patent holder (227-228). However, compulsory licensing is highly controversial and its use can lead to political pressure and potentially negative consequences for trade in other, unrelated sectors. Compulsory licens- ing is also time- and resource-consuming as it usually has to be applied product-by-product and company-by-company and may involve lengthy, confrontational negotiations. How-ever, some countries (for example Brazil, India, and Thailand) have used the credible threat of applying TRIPS flexibilities to strengthen their negotiating position with innovator compa-nies and to incentivize the development of creative solutions for better access to novel medicines with high public health impact. Payers can collaborate on the review of new technologies, in light of new disease priorities, available budgets, and the values underlying decisions about benefit packages in their set-tings. They can engage with other stakehold-ers on the values underlying different deci-sions and communicate coverage decisions transparently (Chapter 3); they can also nego- tiate risk-sharing agreements with companies, incentivize appropriate use of products, and implement strict monitoring systems to track the spending on and use of specialty medi-cines (229). Funders can contribute resources to the treat- ment of poor patients suffering from cancer and other complex diseases. Clinicians must push for novel therapies with substantial clini-cal benefits, and prescribe and dispense spe-cialty medicines only to patients for whom the products are indicated, with strict continued clinical monitoring and support to ensure safe use in severely ill patients. Academics can con-tribute evidence for decision-making by evalu-ating the impacts of different strategies to Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines70 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE make specialty medicines accessible to those who need them. Section 4.4.1. below describes a range of pol- icy approaches used by different stakehold- ers in Thailand to facilitate access to selected high-cost specialty medicines (230). 4.4.1 The E2 Access programme for high- cost specialty medicines in Thailand The National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) has been an important part of the Thai national medicines policy since it was first pub-lished in 1981 (231). The NLEM is the basis for the mandatory payment of medicines costs by the three major Thai health insurance schemes - the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), the Social Security Scheme (SSS) and the Universal Coverage (UC) Scheme - which together enrol nearly all Thai people. Insured patients under these schemes do not pay for medicines on the NLEM. As in most countries, high-cost specialty medi- cines pose a major challenge to the health system in Thailand. The government addressed this challenge in 2008 through a multi-pronged strategy known as the E2 access programme (232). 3 The programme initially targeted ten very costly medicines (botulinum A toxin, docetaxel, erythropoietin alfa, eryth- ropoietin beta, intravenous, imatinib, and verteporfin) for 21 relatively rare conditions, which require specific diagnostic and treat- ment monitoring approaches (232). E2 programme medicines were listed in the newly-created NLEM E2 medicines category, which then mandated insurance schemes to pay for these high-cost medicines for patients meeting specific clinical eligibility criteria. However, unlike for other medicines in the NLEM, insurance schemes were given time to implement coverage of E2 medicines to allow them to identify ways to address the resulting budget impact. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) began covering E2 medicines for UC scheme patients in January 2009, with the Social Welfare Office (SWO) following suit three years later (July 2012). Enrollees in the CSMBS scheme continued to receive the medicines without charge under their fee-for-service benefit (233). Following the announcement of the E2 access programme, government, payers, and com-panies facilitated its implementation through strategies focused on system affordability of the regulatory coverage mandate. These strat- egies differed by medicine, manufacturer, and payer. For example, the government consid-ered the use of compulsory licences for three E2 anti-cancer medicines, letrozole, docetaxel, and imatinib (234, 235). The Thai government allowed patent holders to negotiate before resorting to compulsory licencing. In 2008, Novartis Pharma AG agreed to provide the anti-cancer drug imatinib free of charge by expanding its patient access programme to all patients under the UC Scheme - in lieu of a compulsory license - facilitating the NHSO implementation of the E2 policy for this drug. For letrozole and docetaxel, the government instituted compulsory licences in January 2008 - applying this policy instrument for the first time to non-AIDS medicines - to reduce the prices of these anti-cancer medicines. Payers in turn implemented the E2 programme-mandat-ed coverage for these medicines. In addition, the NHSO collaborated with the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), introduc- ing in 2009 central procurement (instead of individual hospital-based procurement) for all In most coun- tries, high-cost specialty medi-cines pose a major challenge to the health system. 3. In Thailand, medicines on the National Essential Medicines List are classified in 6 groups from A to E2. The E2 category includes \"high risk costly drugs to be used by a senior specialist\". Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 71 E2 products used for UC patients in hospitals. Pooled procurement resulted in lower prices of medicines, saving the government the equiva- lent of millions of dollars annually (236). Operationally, the GPO distributes E2 products for UC-insured patients directly to hospitals via the so-called vendor-managed inventory system. On behalf of hospitals, the SWO en-gaged with the pharmaceutical manufac- turer, negotiating a 50% price reduction for imatinib, while also completely covering the drug for social security patients as of 2012. In January 2013, the SWO transferred its budget to NHSO to participate in the central procure-ment and delivery of E2 medicines for SSS pa- tients. Recently, the list of E2 medicines has been expanded and in 2013 includes 16 prod-ucts indicated for 27 conditions (232). The Thai E2 strategy illustrates aspects of a system-oriented approach to benefit policy design that combines government regula-tory, managerial, and economic measures with stakeholder cooperation in order to bal- ance equitable access to and appropriate use of medicines with their affordability - along with the development of viable markets for industry. Given an increasing number of novel, high-cost treatments available and the result- ing expansion of the E2 access programme, questions about its present and future eco-nomic impacts on the health system must be raised. In addition, effects of the programme on the health of individuals who receive E2 category medicines and on the overall popula- tion's health are currently unknown. 4.5 Innovation and ethics in medicines decision-making The increasing availability of novel but expen- sive medicines and health technologies heightens some ethical decision-making di- lemmas - particularly around priority setting and resource allocation in health policy and financing. These dilemmas affect countries at all income levels, although LMICs are likely to face greater constraints in re-allocating funds from other public needs to health financing. Health technology assessments - as imple-mented for example by NICE in the UK (237) - can contribute technical information on cost-effectiveness but importantly do not ensure that a policy decision meets ethical goals. Po- litical battles in many countries (238, 239) and legal challenges to reimbursement decisions, mostly in those Latin American countries with a constitutional right to health (240), are il- lustrative of contentions in rationing health care resources. Controversies among different stakeholders are likely to become more preva-lent, given that most drugs in development pipelines are biotechnology-based, will come to market with high prices, and will need to be evaluated for potential coverage by expanding health insurance schemes. There is no easy solution to fundamental con- flicts in which \"reasonable people will have moral disagreements about choices that create winners and losers - often with life at stake.\" (241) At a basic level, decisions on priority set-ting and resource allocation processes should be made in a way deemed \"fair\". Generally speaking, this will require these processes to be transparent and inclusive. In addition, deci-sions should be deliberative and reasonable, with attention paid to appropriate scientific evidence as well as to the perceptions, inter - ests, and values of different stakeholders af- fected by such decision-making. 4.6 Conclusions and recommendationsInnovation to bring urgently needed medicines to market requires novel partnerships among health system stakeholders. LMICs must find a combination of approaches that integrate the interests of these stakeholders and match-es the needs of different constituencies in Innovation to bring urgently needed medi-cines to market requires novel partnerships among health system stake-holders.Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines72 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE pluralistic financing and care systems. The intended and potentially unintended im- pacts of innovations in bringing medicines to markets must be better and more system- atically assessed. We do know that bringing needed medicines to markets generate prime learning opportunities for national and global systems. At this point, monitoring and evalu-ation of the impacts of innovative regulatory, financing, supply and delivery mechanisms on medicines access, affordability, and use are crucial - not to \"take advantage of these op-portunities condemns us to rediscover at great cost what is already known or to repeat past mistakes\" (242). It is also critically important to consider how innovations could be opti-mized given the constantly changing environ-ments of LMIC health systems, and how in-novations have adapted to local contexts and implementation challenges. Chapter 4: Innovation to Ensure Better Access to Medicines5 MAKING HEALTH MARKET SYSTEMS WORK FOR MEDICINES74 - KEY MESSAGES kImproving access to and ensuring the appro- priate use of medicines requires an under - standing of health market systems. In recent years, these markets have expanded dra-matically in LMICs, yet policy-makers have not given them sufficient attention. kPoorly-organized health market systems fail in many dimensions, resulting in unneeded or harmful treatments, excessive and impov-erishing costs, counterfeit and substandard products, and antibiotic resistance. kIn and of themselves, the training of health-care providers and providing better, more targeted information to health system stakeholders are not enough to improve the access and appropriate use of medicines. kSuccessful interventions aimed at improving health system markets and correcting market failures require continuous revision; they en-gage multiple stakeholders, apply a balance of incentives, controls, and capacity building, and use data to monitor the intended and unintended consequences and to enhance accountability.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 75 5.1 The growing role of health care markets in access to medicines Market factors are now critical to the health systems of LMICs. They are especially impor - tant in the development of medicines and oth- er diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, as well as in the delivery of health-related goods and services. However, although markets have come to play such an important role in health systems over the last few decades, govern- ments have not created adequate regula-tory developments to provide effective market oversight (243, 244). Most countries have highly pluralistic health care delivery systems, with health providers ranging from itinerant drug sellers, small shops and private pharmacies, private clinics, not-for- profit and government hospitals, public sector multi-specialty hospitals, and different types of provider networks. These health providers have different levels of knowledge, training, and qualifications, various types of legal and professional standing, and different mecha- nisms for formal and informal payment (245, 246). In most LMICs, medicines are more likely to be purchased from shops, private pharma-cies, and informally-trained private providers than through government health facilities. Yet many governments and international agencies have long neglected the role of the private sector in the supply of medicines. Health markets are highly segmented. Often, those who are well-off can afford higher-quali- ty professional care and have better protection through privileged financing arrangements - such as private health insurance - while the poor rely on underfunded public systems and low-cost, informally-trained providers (e.g. vil- lage doctors or traditional health providers). This segmentation is further subdivided on the basis of patient preferences and social needs, their particular health condition, as well as their understanding of disease, an assessment of provider reputation, the effectiveness of medicines, and their purchasing power (244). Although there are many debates around the best way to organize health systems, there is a widespread consensus that markets on their own do not produce efficient or equitable health systems. Both the causes and symp-toms of market failures in the health sector are well documented (247), and include in- formation asymmetry between providers and clients that make clients vulnerable to the abuse of provider power, resulting in exces-sive health costs, and unneeded or ineffective treatment. This can also lead to shortages of public health and preventive services, under- insurance against major health expenditures, an inability to control health care costs, and the inequitable distribution of health services and medicines (245, 247, 248). A variety of measures exist in most countries to counteract these market failures. These in- clude the government provision of health ser - vices, public regulation and laws, and profes- sional self-regulation based on adherence to rules and standards. In LMICs, many of these formal institutions are weak, and the arrange- ments to create market order tend to be more informal and local, such as through provider referral networks or consumer word-of-mouth (249). Active interventions in informal markets can be effective, however, and tend to require multi-component strategies that balance in- centives, controls, and education and involve multiple stakeholders (250). This was demon-strated in a series of studies in Thailand and Viet Nam, where poor case management and dispensing practices at private pharmacies were improved through regulation, education, and peer support (251, 252). The public sector in health often fails too. In LMICs, shopkeepers who sell drugs, Although mar - kets have come to play such an important role in health systems over the last few decades, governments have not cre-ated adequate regulatory developments to provide effective market oversight. Active interven- tions in informal markets can be effective, and tend to require multi-compo-nent strategies that balance incentives, controls, and education and involve multiple stakeholders.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines76 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE informally-trained providers, and public sec- tor health workers who take supplemental payments or hold additional private-sector jobs - all of this operates outside the formal legal framework, leaving governments with little capacity to enforce existing regulations (253, 254). Government health services can also fail to deliver due to under-funding and weak management systems, or because of re-current shocks to the system from civil conflict, natural disasters, and economic crises. Analy-ses of public-sector failure in LMICs find that government employees may be influenced by financial incentives, or political and patronage relationships, and may not act in the general interests of the population (255, 256). Some informal payments may be considered \"fair\" in the context of low public-sector pay, while others may be considered exploitive. Interven-tions that do not consider the reality of condi-tions for public providers and regulators may create negative, unintended consequences (257). The public and private health sectors are clearly interconnected since the factors that threaten government systems also affect the performance of private markets. The ability of institutions to enforce agreed-upon rules spec-ifying expectations and behavioural norms are critical to the performance of both the public and private health sectors (249, 258). The in-ability to provide such institutions may con-tribute to growing problems with substandard and counterfeit medicines, the excessive use of antibiotics, the poor quality of medical care, and excessive costs. Pharmaceuticals markets have also been harmed by unethical drug pro-motion practices, including misleading or false claims about a drug, non-disclosure of side effects, and sales representatives who influ- ence doctor's prescribing practices by offering financial incentives and gifts (250).5.2 A systems approach to analysing health care markets Given the interconnectedness of stakeholders in the health sector and pervasiveness of mar - ket transactions, analysing the public and pri- vate sectors separately jars with the reality of how LMIC health systems actually work, and limits the options for intervention. Instead, it can be helpful to consider health market sys-tems, with supply and demand - or the service transactions among providers and clients in both the publicly- and privately-owned health facilities - at their core (as shown in Figure 5.1). These provider-client transactions are in- fluenced by formal and informal sets of rules, which are established and enforced by a wide range of market actors, each of whom is in-fluenced by many other factors. Supporting functions for providers and users in a health market include those that provide infrastruc- ture, equipment, training and human resource management, monitoring and evaluation, coordination and management support, and financing services. These supporting functions create an environment that either enhances or constrains the market actors, reflecting the norms, values, and regulatory actions for the suppliers and users of health care and medi-cines (244). The wide number of stakeholders and interac- tions confers a complexity to health market systems. As in other complex systems, inter - ventions that focus too narrowly on a specific aspect - such as strengthening the manage-ment of a single organization - are likely to fail (259). A review of interventions on infor - mal private providers (260) found that train-ing alone had little impact on performance - unless combined with reinforcing measures that change incentives to improve prescribing practices. The public and private health sectors are clearly intercon-nected since the factors that threaten government systems also affect the performance of private markets. The ability of institutions to enforce agreed-upon rules specifying expectations and behavioural norms are critical to the performance of both the public and private health sectors (249, 258). Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 77 In any complex system, unintended conse- quences are common, and many different health system interventions, whether initiated through public or private providers, can affect medicines access, affordability, and use. One reason for this lies in the self-organizing be-haviour of the different market actors, as they react to each other, test and learn new ways of acting, and create new structures and in- stitutional arrangements. Thus, interventions that are flexible in design, and use data and feedback to adapt are more likely to succeed (261). A systematic review of health-provider performance in LMICs (262) found that many interventions can be effective, though results are highly variable across different contexts, and that multi-component strategies with system-oriented problem-solving approaches are more likely to improve performance. Interventions in health markets are often ex- amined through a narrow perspective, typi- cally only addressing their intended effects. However, to understand the wider effects on the critical stakeholders, it is essential to use SUPPLYD EM AND Not-for-profit Membership organizations sector Representative bodiesMARKET PLAYERS Sector-specific Non-statutory standardsLawsInformal rules and normsSUPPORTING FUNCTIONS Information InfrastructureRelated servicesInformal networks Government Private sector Informing and communicating Setting and enforcing rulesFigure 5.1: Framework for understanding health market systems adapted from Bloom et al (254)Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines78 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE a systems approach. This will provide a better understanding of how interventions change over time, indicate why they may succeed or fail, and point towards systemic elements that would benefit from routine monitoring and evaluation measures. Ultimately, this approach can provide insights that will inform key stake-holders in ways that can bring increased order to health market systems, which in turn will contribute to a transformation of the medi-cines situation in LMICs. 5.3 Case-studies of interventions ad- dressing market failures in LMICs Four country case-studies analyse different in- terventions designed to improve health mar - kets and to address market failures in LMICs. These case-studies also highlight the role of important market players and how the inter - vention managed to channel their contribu- tions towards improved medicines access. The first case from the United Republic of Tan- zania documents the development of ac-credited drug dispensing outlets, created in response to a weak supply chain and failing market, with the intention of providing es-sential medicines to the rural poor. It was designed through engagement with multiple stakeholders, with strong government leader - ship, and was adapted as the program became more decentralized. The participation and buy-in of drug shop owners, a neglected market player in the health systems of LMICs, was an important component of its success. The second case - the MoPoTsyo programme in Cambodia - addressed a market failure that left diabetes patients without care. It did this by creating an innovative and effective network for highly sought-after services that rotated around a new market player - a peer educator. The third case-study - Thailand's Antibiotic Smart Use project - was a response to market failure involving the over-prescription, inap-propriate demand, and subsequent growth of treatment resistance to antibiotics. It re- veals how many different stakeholders were involved in the design and implementation of the programme, which required concert-ed efforts to align competing interests and incentives. The final case-study, from Kenya, is a recent social business innovation, Familia Nawiri, de-signed to increase access to generic medicines for poor populations. It also aims to build a sustainable enterprise that meets both social goals for the population and a level of prof-itability to continue operations. It also high-lights the use of \"systems dynamics\" research methods to understand how this type of inter - vention can achieve its intended objectives in a complex environment. These case-studies combine a review of pub- lished and grey literature, complemented by direct or indirect information collected in the field through an analysis of monitoring data, internal or external evaluation reports, discus- sions with key informants, and access to un-published data. Full case-studies are available in the web annex. 5.3.1 The United Republic of Tanzania: ac- credited drug-dispensing outlets Private medicine retailers are key players in supplying medicines in LMICs (263-265), yet their role tends to be ignored in devis- ing health policies, strategies, and monitoring and evaluation approaches. In rural areas of the United Republic of Tanzania, most people depend on duka la dawa baridi (DLDBs) or private medicines outlets for essential medi- cines, since most of the country's pharmacies and formal health facilities are in urban areas (266). Whereas these outlets are only autho-rized to sell over-the-counter medicines or In any complex system, unin-tended con-sequences are common, and many different health system interventions, whether initi-ated through public or private provid-ers, can affect medicines ac-cess, affordabil-ity, and use. Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 79 non-prescription medicines, they frequently sell prescription medicines illegally. They typi-cally have poorly-trained staff, inadequate drug storage facilities, and low-quality drugs. In 2003, the accredited drug-dispensing out- lets (ADDO) programme was launched in the United Republic of Tanzania's Ruvuma region to train and accredit DLDBs with the aim of improving access to quality medicines and increasing consumer demand for appropriate medicines. Intended as a partnership between public and private actors, the programme set out to improve government oversight of stan-dards for training, operations, and quality con-trol. Capacity building was a strong focus of the programme, training shop owners in effec- tive business practices - e.g. monitoring sales, stock expiry, profit management, and training dispensers in treatment guidelines and stock management. Taken together, this pushed training far beyond any previous interventions (267). The programme also rolled out a public information campaign. Following two years of assessment, consulta- tion and design, the ADDO programme was launched by the Tanzania Food & Drugs Au-thority (TFDA), the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), DLDB owners and Management Sciences for Health (MSH) - an international NGO that was initially funded to perform this work by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. A 2004 law required all DLDBs to practice the ADDO set of accredita- tion standards and code of ethics, established through consultation with government offi-cials, medical officers and DLDB owners. The ADDO programme began with 210 outlets in one region (Ruvuma), with credit assistance provided to the DLDB owners to pay for the physical upgrades needed to meet accredi-tation standards. Early in the programme, a high-profile government study visit to the region resulted in the MOHSW describing the programme as a \"key MOHSW programme\" and not a \"donor-funded project,\" then al- locating government funds for the further expansion of the programme. After a 2006 independent evaluation of the pilot, the pro-gramme was rolled-out by central authorities to three more regions. By 2007, it was clear that a centralized management approach was taking too long, was too expensive, and had overstretched their ability to inspect and sup-port DLDBs. A decentralized approach was then taken through the training of trainers and local inspectors, along with greater in- volvement of local governments, including local government financial contributions. This was successful, cutting the cost of rolling-out in half, and the time reduced from 18 to 12 months per region, with more regions launch- ing the programme in parallel. The government took a number of actions to institutionalize the programme. In 2007, Tan- zania's National Health Insurance fund in-corporated the ADDOs into its scheme. The government also revised the legal framework to mandate local government planning and budgeting (2008), to update the standards to allow local inspection and the phase-out of unaccredited DLDBs (2009), and to clarify ADDO programme oversight. In 2010, at the initiation of ADDO owners, the NGO MSH facilitated the creation of a new ADDO provider/dispenser professional as- sociation to give them a stronger voice in dealing with regulatory authorities and local governments. It enabled the joint procurement of drugs to reduce purchasing prices, and provided savings and credit opportunities to members. By 2013, ADDOs were found in every region of the country, in both rural and urban areas. There were 5,500 ADDOs representing over Private medi- cine retailers are key players in supplying medicines in LMICs (263-265), yet their role tends to be ignored in devising health policies, strategies, and monitoring and evaluation approaches.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines80 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE 60% of all drug outlets in the country, and the programme trained more than 13,000 dis-pensers and 3,200 local inspectors. The quality of services continues to improve. For example, in Ruvuma, patients receiving recommended malaria treatment rose from 6% in 2003 to 24% in 2004 and 63% in 2010. The availability and quality of products has al- ready improved. No unregistered products were found in 2010 compared to 2% in 2004 and 26% in 2001. The availability of antibi-otics in Ruvuma in 2010 was 70% compared with 79% in 2004 and 53% at 2001. Less is known about how well the programme is reaching the poor; reports suggest that AD- DOs are still not found in the most inaccessible parts of the country where households are es-pecially impoverished, as it would be difficult for them to be profitable. Although international donors largely financed the original programme-development costs, roll-out costs soon came to be shouldered by ADDO owners. Unsurprisingly, in all regions, prices increased after accreditation since the costs of upgrading shops and stocks, and training dispensers, needed to be recouped in some way. Yet these increases have been mar - ginal; a 10-year evaluation of the pilot ADDOs found that antibiotics cost 15% above median prices in 2004 and 16% in 2010, according to the International Drug Price Indicator Guide. Other African countries such as Uganda and Liberia have set up similar programmes. The engagement of stakeholders, including a supportive regulatory environment created by these national governments, attention to technical support, available financing, demand generation, linkages to community health ini- tiatives, and use of information and evaluation to guide changes will be critical factors in their success. 5.3.2 Cambodia: task shifting to expert patients for diabetes care Many health interventions consider patients as recipients of care, without paying atten- tion to how they might play an active role in their own treatment. This second case-study from Cambodia illustrates the importance of \"expert patients\" - individuals who are suit-ably educated about their own disease so that they can not only effectively contribute to their own treatment, but provide support to others. Health care delivery through \"expert patients\" has been tested as an innovative approach to expand HIV treatment and care to counteract shortages of health staff in re- source-limited settings. \"Expert patients\" are trained to carry out pre-defined clinical tasks and community outreach, and establish a link between the community and health services. In some cases, their contribution to minimizing stigma and achieving greater involvement of communities in health care delivery and treat- ment programmes is also recognized. Such task shifting could be especially important for chronic diseases that require long-term care: in many LMICs, the burden of NCDs is rising (268, 269), yet the capacity of health systems to provide that care remains sharply limited. In Cambodia, 3.1% of the adult population (roughly 44,000 out of 1.4 million) have dia-betes. MoPoTsyo is a Cambodian NGO estab- lished in 2004 to empower people living with diabetes to self-manage their condition by creating networks of community-based diabe- tes peer educators. It originated out of both a market and a state failure to provide diabe-tes care and medicines in urban slums. Over time, both the scale and scope of services has expanded, and the growing network of peer educators has become more tightly linked to other market players, such as pharmacies, lab-oratories, and public and private sector health providers - though it has been less successful \"Expert patients\" are trained to carry out pre-defined clinical tasks and community outreach, and establish a link between the community and health services. In some cases, their contribution to minimizing stigma and achieving greater involvement of communities in health care delivery and treatment programmes is also recognized.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 81 in connecting to the Ministry of Health. The NGO uses expert patients as peer educa- tors. They receive training, basic equipment and supplies, and host weekly patient gath- erings and education sessions in their homes, which act as patient information centres. Their activities (on average three half-days per week) focus on providing people living with diabetes with reliable information on nutri- tion and exercise and basic skills such as self- measurement of glucose levels. The peer edu-cators are trained to do blood glucose tests and general follow-up work, and if the patient does not show up for follow-up, the peer edu-cator will visit the patient at home to motivate them to continue treatment. The educators receive financial incentives for service and performance, including incentives for activities such as screening, monitoring, patient gather - ings, and a travel reimbursement. The average monthly incentive is around US$ 30 a month; as a comparison, garment factory workers earn US$ 75 a month. Occasionally, incentives have led to conflicts of interests, including one instance where the number of urine glucose self-test results recorded by a peer educator exceeded the amount of urine strips she had received - but fortunately, these seem rare. By the end of 2013, with a growing member - ship and a weak public health system, MoPoTsyo started to become more engaged with service delivery aspects. For example, when the NGO started to roll-out activities in rural areas, they found that there were no doc- tors trained in diabetes care and no consul-tation services available for patients at either health centres or district referral hospitals. The organisation hired a number of doctors from diabetes clinics in Phnom Penh to carry out di- abetes consultations and to train local doctors. In 2006, the NGO decided to address the pro- tracted problem of inadequate access to diabetes and chronic disease medicines through a revolving drug fund. It established contracts with local pharmacies to sell certain generic medicines, procured in bulk interna- tionally, at a fixed price to MoPoTsyo mem-bers. The pharmacies, mostly private, are al-lowed a 15% profit margin. The pharmacies were chosen in close collaboration with dis- trict health authorities, looking predominantly at their proximity to network coverage area, but also at the reputation of the people run-ning them. Pharmacy receipts given to patients are collected by the peer educators, allowing the NGO to monitor both the performance of the pharmacies and patient adherence. Until recently, most contracted pharmacies were private, but the NGO is now also working with pharmacy outlets in public facilities. In early 2010, MoPoTsyo started to develop its own capacity to carry out laboratory tests, again in response to a service gap. At the referral hospitals these tests were either un- available or unaffordable; MoPoTsyo charges less than half the price of public hospitals. Blood samples are taken in the community and transported to a central laboratory, and the test results are sent to the peer educator, who explains them to the patient. The pro- gramme now includes other services relevant to diabetes, with peer educators also address-ing hypertension or organising eye screening in collaboration with private non-profit clinics. By the end of 2012, over 12,000 people were registered patients with MoPoTsyo, with nearly 500,000 adults having been screened for diabetes. An external evaluation in 2011 (270) showed that the programme had seen major successes. There were significant im- provements in fasting blood glucose levels and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a randomly-selected group of patients who were in the programme for at least two years, with about one-third of patients reaching Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines82 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE treatment targets for fasting blood glucose and two-thirds for blood-pressure levels. More than two-thirds of patients reported improve- ment (\"better\" or \"much better\") in terms of their perceived health, ability to control their condition, and adherence to both medication and lifestyle adjustments when compared to their situation before joining the programme. There have also been several unintended con- sequences of the scheme. For example, many patients incorrectly view peer educators as doctors, relying on them for disease manage-ment. Although the aim of the networks is to help patients self-manage, many patients re- main passive. It is not always clear whether the peer is reluctant to pass certain tasks to the patients or whether the patients do not want to take on responsibility. Some peer edu-cators do take on roles beyond their training, such as giving advice on which medicines to take or how to adjust dosage. Peer educators have in many cases become gatekeepers to other health services; when patients encoun-ter a health problem, many turn to them for non-diabetes related questions for which they are ill equipped to provide referral advice. Giv-en the high unmet demand for health services and the lack of professional providers in this market, peer educators, who are trusted and available, have filled some of this gap. The success of the network has led the Minis- try of Health to plan on absorbing it, but this plan presents several unresolved issues. Inher - ently, the effectiveness of a network that oper - ates largely outside the formal health system creates strong concerns for the health system. And indeed, despite the low capacities of the Cambodian government to offer diabetes care, Ministry of Health officials have condemned the vertical approach of the networks - ques-tioning the sustainability of a system reliant on donor funds and which has organised ac-cess to medicines and delivery of services in parallel to the public health system. Senior Ministry of Health officials and physi- cians believe that diabetes care, including laboratory services, consultation and medicine supply, must be accessed through the formal health system. Similarly, the Ministry of Health opposed the Revolving Drug Fund, since it goes against official government policy that medicines should be provided for free. How-ever, there is no alternative vision on how to ensure a constant supply of affordable medi-cines and laboratory supplies for chronic con-ditions without patient contributions and the type of innovation that has been developed by MoPoTsyo. 5.3.3 Thailand: Antibiotic Smart Use Initiative The third case-study uses traditional stake- holders - physicians and pharmacists - as the entry point for an intervention designed to improve the use of antibiotics. The misuse of antibiotics, for instance, is rampant in Thailand and has serious health effects; in 2010, anti-microbial resistance in the country caused at least 3.2 million extra hospitalization days and 38,481 deaths (271). This case-study shows that the financial and non-financial incentives in place for physicians and pharmacists may be misaligned with appropriate drug use. This has resulted in the underuse, overuse, or misuse of medicines, which in the case of antibiotics, can drive resistance - a growing global threat producing untreatable or expensive infections. In Thailand, there is no divide between pre- scription and dispensing systems: physicians may dispense medicines, and pharmacists may prescribe them. Both directly benefit from dispensing more antibiotics under a fee-for- service system. This situation is further exacer - bated by the fact that the country has strong consumer-demand for antibiotics, irrespective of the cause of infection. Thailand's Drug Act Financial and non-financial incentives in place for physi-cians and phar - macists may be misaligned with appropriate drug use. Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 83 classifies antibiotics as drugs with potential- ly serious side effects or ya-an-talai, which translates to \"dangerous drugs\". Colloquially, however, antibiotics are sometimes called ya- gae-ug-sep, which means \"drugs that counter inflammation\". This reinforces the layperson's belief that all inflammatory symptoms can be cured with antibiotics, whether or not the cause is bacterial. Thailand's Antibiotics Smart Use (ASU) Initia- tive was established by the Thai Food and Drug Agency (FDA) in 2007 to improve the rational use of these medicines by improving educa-tion on antibiotic use to address local miscon-ceptions. The Initiative also promoted alterna- tive treatments, such as traditional Thai herbal medicines - listed in the country's National Essential Medicines List - for non-bacterial in-fections to discourage people from demanding antibiotics from their doctor (271). It targeted three conditions not requiring antibiotic treat- ment: upper respiratory infections, acute diar - rhoea, and simple wounds. The programme focused on healthy ambulatory patients older than two years of age, and took care to ex-clude those who were hospitalized, diagnosed with diabetes or a compromised immune sys- tem, or suffering from serious co-morbidities. ASU began as a network of researchers from Thailand's Ministry of Public Health and phar - macists and doctors from Srinakharinwirot University and Chulalongkorn University. They piloted educational and training reforms to improve prescribing in 10 hospitals and 87 pri- mary health centers in the Saraburi province, which had received seed money from WHO. During the pilot phase, the provincial health office monitored: antibiotic prescription rates; provider attitudes of effectiveness and knowl- edge of antibiotics; non-prescription rates in cases of non-bacterial infections; and patient health and satisfaction. Applying these same indicators, the second phase scaled-up this intervention to 44 hospitals and 621 primary health centres in three provinces and two hos-pital networks. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) piloted a pay-for-performance system to realign financial incentives to pre-scribers and providers. Under the guidance of the FDA, local health authorities managed this initiative with additional assistance from the NHSO and the Health Systems Research Institute. The Initiative's third phase has seen the net- work grow to 22 public hospital systems in 15 provinces, with the focus on longer-term sustainability (271). The first phase of the ASU intervention offered a half-day training on clinical guidelines for physicians, nurses and pharmacists. These efforts were intended to re-assure providers that antibiotics were neither appropriate nor necessary for patients with a viral infection. Health-care providers were also given posters and pamphlets to communi- cate better with patients, while also receiving white-light illuminators in lieu of flashlights to improve the diagnosis of sore throats. The Initiative has a strongly decentralized ap- proach that relies on engaging local partners from health care, government, and academia, to adapt guidelines to their own health care settings and communities. The partners includ-ed hospital directors, provincial health admin-istrators, university researchers, medical and pharmacy students as well as local physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The ASU Initiative has encouraged ownership among local partners by enabling them to brand and design locally effective methods to improve the use of anti-biotics in their communities, bolstered by re-gional and national support networks and ed- ucational and some financial guidance (271). The Initiative seeks to integrate these changes into local health care systems by influencing individual behaviour rather than enforcing guidelines through a heavy-handed, top-down Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines84 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE approach. In Cha-lae District in Songkha Province, ASU advocates added the principles of appropriate use of antibiotics into their own local \"health constitution,\" and they signed memoranda of understanding with grocery store owners not to sell antibiotics over the counter. In the Muaklek District in Saraburi, the ASU network enlisted not only local hospitals, but also the community bank, which rewarded customers with reimbursements for groceries if they cor - rectly completed a self-assessment quiz on how to care for oneself without antibiotics in the face of an upper respiratory infection, acute diarrhoea, or a simple wound. (272). The first stage of the Initiative led to impres- sive declines in antibiotic prescription rates in hospitals (decreases were between 18% and 23%) and in primary health centres (between 39% and 46%) (271, 272) - a strong achieve-ment given that the original goal aimed to reduce prescription rates by 10%. The third phase began in 2010 to ensure sustainability of these policy initiatives. Persuaded by the ini-tial success of ASU, the National Health Secu-rity Office (NHSO) - responsible for universal health coverage for 47 million Thais - changed the capitated, pay-for-performance system to ensure greater compliance with antibiotic pre-scribing guidelines. It did so by moving from a process evaluation, relying on a checklist of key activities, to an output evaluation that measured the actual level of antibiotic pre- scriptions for upper respiratory infections and acute diarrhoeal cases. In response to a need by providers to have other treatment options, ASU developed pack-ages of herbal medicines for non-bacterial in- fections. These traditional Thai medicines were approved in the National Formulary for reliev-ing symptoms of viral infections and were packaged in capsules similar to antibiotics. However, herbal medicines are not without side effects, and the initiative is teaching pro-viders that the best treatment at times may be watchful waiting. An important goal of the Initiative was to low- er consumer demand for antibiotics. It did so through an educational programme rolled out in participating pharmacies. When pa-tients came in for prescriptions, pharmacists asked them to use a mirror to examine their own tonsils along with a tongue depressor and white light illuminator, and contrast this against side-by-side pictures of typical bacte-rial and viral throat infections. This allowed them to see when their symptoms did not ap- pear to be caused by bacteria. The pharmacists also provided alternative herbal treatments to relieve the patients' symptoms. While not to-tally preventing the over-the-counter purchase of antibiotics, the pilot study found that over 90% of the 998 patients fully recovered and more than 80% were satisfied with treatment outcomes (272). These types of interventions could help ad- dress challenges in the fee-for-service model. The ASU Initiative has also looked into incen-tives under the Diagnosis-Related Group- based payment system and into establishing an audit system that would provide hospital-level comparisons. Where positive financial incentives may not suffice, these may, in the future, need to be complemented by negative financial incentives, or penalties. The ASU Initiative in Thailand reveals the com- plex interplay between providers and patients, national guidelines and locally inspired efforts to implement them, and incentive systems and culturally mediated interventions. As it un- folded, the Initiative evolved in unanticipated ways into a network with multiple implement-ing partners and various sources of funding, with some agencies playing key informal Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 85 influencing roles, while others created and en- forced more formal rules. The Initiative reveals the importance of local stakeholder ownership in overcoming long-held expectations and practices in a sustained way. 5.3.4 Kenya: Familia Nawiri social business initiative This fourth case-study examines the role played by pharmaceutical companies through their social business initiatives, and the new forms of medicines supply and service provi- sion these initiatives can create in LMIC health markets. According to 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, the two main business prototypes - organizations that seek to maxi-mize profit and shareholder value; and not- for-profit organizations that seek to maximize social gain - are inadequate in addressing the global and systemic concerns around medi-cines access (273, 274). As a hybrid of both models, \"social businesses\" can be an effec- tive alternative (275). Social businesses seek to maximize social good, but must also be financially profitable to cover their costs and offer a return on investment. In Yunus' model, profit goes to those stakeholders who help fulfil the mission of these social businesses, rather than to shareholders. This is not an easy task, however. Several busi- nesses focusing on the world's poor, or \"bot-tom of the pyramid\" populations, have had difficulty achieving both commercial and social value, particularly at a significant and sufficient scale (276). In the last five years, several pharmaceutical companies have be-gun social business or shared-value initiatives (277), including for example, a programme in China aimed at diabetes prevention and management ( 278) and the Arogya Parivar programme in India designed to increase the availability and use of generic medicines for people living in rural India (279). While such initiatives can achieve substantial scale and generate profit - within four years, Arogya Parivar achieved financially sustainability by serving more than 42 million people in 31,000 villages across 10 states in India - unfortu-nately not much is known about how well they meet both commercial and social objectives. Adapting the Arogya Parivar model from India, the company began the Familia Nawiri pro-gramme in 2012 in Kenya, where access to medicines is characterized by a lack of quality generics in the public sector; geographic and economic barriers that prevent access to medi- cines for the poor; overuse of antibiotics; and underuse of chronic disease treatment (280). In a 2009 household survey, 57% of respon-dents in the poorest households reported that they could not afford the medicines they need, and 48% of poor households with a chronical- ly ill member had no medicines at home (281). Familia Nawiri aims to provide access to need- ed care and selected essential medicines at affordable prices to the rural poor. The pro-gramme targets the country's more than 600,000 individuals with incomes below US$ 1 per day in more than 100,000 house-holds. Health educators - community mem-bers who ideally have a degree in a health-related field - are engaged to raise awareness of basic health and social issues, and connect households with providers to receive care and medicines. The health educators are given a week's training on key topics, including: per - sonal and environmental hygiene; appropriate use of medicines; symptoms and treatment of respiratory infections, diarrhoea, diabetes, and hypertension; de-worming; and health insurance enrolment. Each health educator is responsible for two-to-three wards, covering about 12,000 households and 70,000 indi-viduals, and working closely with the national Social busi- nesses seek to maximize social good, but must also be finan-cially profitable to cover their costs and offer a return on investment. In Yunus' model, profit goes to those stakeholders who help fulfil the mission of these social businesses, rather than to shareholders.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines86 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE health system's community health workers to set up health camps. The day-long health camps provide primary health care to about 300 community members at a time and are staffed by local physicians, nurses, diploma medical assistants, commu-nity health workers, and pharmaceutical tech-nicians who either volunteer their time or are salaried employees of a contracted local pri- vate health care delivery organization. Clinical officers diagnose, prescribe, and refer to local hospitals as needed, and pharmaceutical tech-nicians dispense medicines from the country's national essential medicines list that are pro-cured locally from mission hospitals, the Mis- sion for Essential Drugs Supply (MEDS), or pri- vate sector distributors. Drug prices are in line with the MEDS price guide and products are sourced from different manufacturers. Com-munity members pay a flat KES 200 registra-tion fee (about US$ 2.30) for each camp visit, which covers consultations, laboratory tests, and medicines. Familia Nawiri covers all re-maining costs. The Familia Nawiri initiative as- sumes that community members will continue to seek needed care outside of health camps, in public sector facilities or from the private providers who serve in the camps.The Familia Nawiri programme seeks to be profitable through increased sales of generic medicines. Company representatives work with all health-care providers in the area to facilitate increased availability and prescrip-tion of the sponsoring company's products. Each representative targets between 300 and 500 clinical officers, nurses, and pharmacists. As the programme expands, it seeks to facili- tate the population's enrolment in micro-sav- ings schemes and health insurance. Familia Nawiri sets up partnerships with a micro-sav- ings organization; in community meetings, rep-resentatives explain micro-savings approaches and facilitate households' enrolment in health savings plans using the m-Pesa mobile sav- ings platform (282, 283). Future plans include facilitating enrolment in the National Hospital Insurance Fund, which covers inpatient care at government and mission hospitals and using a mobile health platform to provide health education to communities. By 2017, the Fa - milia Nawiri programme is expected to have reached 7 million villagers and all private pro-viders in the country, and to have broken even financially. The complexity of social business initiatives for improving access to essential medicines makes an initiative like Familia Nawiri a good candidate for a systems dynamics' analysis. (284, 285). Based on interviews with Familia Nawiri social business leaders and local health systems experts, case-study authors identified key relationships between actors and their hy- pothesized behaviours in the system and cre-ated a hypothetical conceptual model of the Familia Nawiri Initiative (see web annex for the case-study and detailed explanations of the model). The conceptual model shown in Figure 5.2 indicates that at the heart of the programme is a single reinforcing feedback loop (R1). R1Improved health Improved economic activity Average Household incomeIncome to buyIntroduction to needed medicines medicinesstatusFigure 5.2: Reinforcing feedback loop representing the Familia Nawiri social business modelChapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 87 This illustrates the hypothesis that improv- ing access to quality medicines for the poor improves their health status, which in turn improves economic activity and household income, thus increasing the available finan-cial resources to purchase medicines. If the medicines purchased are products of the so-cial business company, this feedback loop will generate profit for the company, which can be invested in expanding the programme. This core feedback loop exists in every health care system. What sets the Familia Nawiri programme apart from other typical systems is the network of stakeholders involved: the use of privately-supported health educators working with local community health care workers to raise awareness about health care and financing among the rural poor, combined with privately-run health camps to facilitate their access to care and a strengthened pri-vate-sector medicines supply system. Health camps are not new in Kenya; government of- ficials and medical schools offer health camps periodically. However, the initiative has cre-ated a reliable schedule of health camps and emphasises the provision of high-quality care through manageable staff-to-client ratios, in-creased availability of laboratory testing, and selection of medicines from the national es- sential medicines list, through which the target patient population has easier access to initial care. Regular follow-up care may be sought in subsequent health camps and from public and private sector providers. This continuity of attention leads to a second reinforcing loop in the system, as shown in Figure 5.3 below. In the next analytical step, additional hypoth- eses are incorporated into the model in the form of causal loops, to represent the hypoth-esized effects of: promoting treatment adher - ence through continued provision of medi- cines in the private sector; financing via health savings accounts and microfinance opportuni-ties for poor families; improved health of the participants on their lifespan and livelihoods; and the financial returns of the social busi-ness, as seen in Figure 5.4.

These include: kLimited ability of health educators to ef- fectively disseminate messages about prevention, health care, and accessing services through health camps to the target population; kCommunity resistance to accessing health care services in health camps (e.g. due to fees, inconvenience, or poor service quality); kPoor continuity of care due to low rates of engagement with local health workers and limited access to care in public and private sectors; kFailure of patients to adhere to treat-ments, especially for chronic illnesses; kUnnecessary use of medicines, such as antibiotics for viral infections; and kContinued limited affordability of medicines. 5.4 Conclusions and recommendations The four case-studies described in this chapter are quite distinct, yet each highlights the need to acknowledge that many different stake- holders are central to health market systems. The efforts captured by the case-studies were all initiated in response to a market failure involving medicines; each intervention took a different entry point in the system and fol- lowed different pathways. The main stake- holders targeted in each intervention illustrate different parts of the health market, from drug shop owners and dispensers (ADDO case) to expert patients (MoPoTsyo) to physicians and pharmacists (ASU project), to a pharmaceuti- cal-company initiated medicines supplier and health provider organization (Familia Nawiri). These examples provide policy-makers with several intervention models.

Paying attention to the demands of the population, or the intended beneficiaries of the health system, was something that each of the interventions did explicitly, and has been a critical part of their success. Beyond this, governments had other essential roles. Government agencies played a leading part in the ADDO and ASU cases, with the lead agencies having to navigate the separate in-terests of central and local governments. They also provided a permissive environment in the MoPoTsyo case and the Familia Nawiri case. Other characteristics of the case-studies that policy-makers should consider is that each of the cases involved external agencies, either to provide assistance to the design (ADDO case), or for evaluation and research (all cases). In each of the cases, as the enterprise grew in scale, management adapted by becoming in-creasingly decentralized, even if the original programmes were managed centrally. Policy-makers and programme implementers should plan for an intervention changing over time, and to involve multiple components that address different aspects of the market system. In each of the cases discussed in this chapter, the interventions involved multiple components that evolved to adapt to the cir - cumstances. Each of the interventions provid-ed training, but never as the sole, or even main intervention. Finding ways to align incentives, and provide supervision and accountability has been critical in each case, but in different ways. This is because in each case, unintended consequences are a real threat (e.g. exces-sive drug prices in ADDO case; peer educators taking on roles beyond their abilities in the MoPoTsyo case; overuse of herbal medicines in the ASU case; and unaffordable prices or overuse of antibiotics in the Familia Nawiri case). It is important to note that none of the interventions were implemented as originally designed. In order to better manage change, timely monitoring data has been important for frequent course corrections, while indepen- dent evaluations have also played important roles in informing these changes. Although considerable challenges and oppor - tunities remain, these case-studies provide a promising basis for an improved understand- ing of and innovative abilities to intervene in health market systems in the quest to en-sure access and appropriate use of essential medicines in LMICs. The key considerations for policy-makers are that they should pursue strategies that involve the engagement of key stakeholders in both the supply and demand for essential medicines, build in flexible and multi-component interventions that are ex-pected to change over time, pay attention to the incentives and institutions involved, and use data to examine both the intended and unintended outcomes of an intervention in an accountable way. None of the interventions were imple-mented as orig-inally designed. In order to better manage change, timely monitoring data has been important for frequent course corrections, while inde-pendent eval-uations have also played important roles in informing these changes.Chapter 5: Making Health Market Systems Work for Medicines6 USING A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE TO INNOVATE IN ACCESS TO MEDICINES92 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE 6 USING A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE TO INNOVATE IN ACCESS TO MEDICINES6.1 Introduction The preceding chapters have highlighted the many challenges in ensuring equitable access, affordability and the appropriate use of medi- cines. In Chapter 2, we offered a historical perspective on the development of essential medicines and health systems, then identify-ing priority issues related to the access, afford-ability, and use of medicines in health systems in LMICs. The central argument in Chapter 3 framed medicines against the goals of univer - sal health coverage and argued that an explic-it focus on medicines is required to advance UHC. In Chapter 4, we highlighted innovative means for bringing new and existing medi- cines to people, including new public-private partnerships and efforts designed to increase the use of quality-assured generic products. Lastly, in Chapter 5, we examined the impor - tance of health market systems in access to medicines, using four country case-studies to analyse different interventions designed to im- prove health markets and to address market failures in LMICs. Taken together, the chapters illustrate the di- verse and innovative ways in which LMICs have addressed key medicines challenges, while emphasizing the continued and even ur - gent need to find new solutions. In this chap- ter we summarize the key lessons from our analysis, and suggest actions to guide both the decision-making and research agenda as the field moves forward. We believe that improving access to medicines requires three major approaches, along with an appreciation for several elements that crosscut each approach. 1. Recognizing the interconnected na- ture of all health system building blocks, a systems approach is crucial in improv- ing access to medicines across LMICs. Access to medicines must be an explicit focus in health system strengthening or universal health coverage efforts that target improved equity in health care access, quality, and financing. Giving people access to the high-quality, af- fordable medicines they require can only oc-cur within a context of stronger health sys-tems that have reduced barriers to the full and equitable participation of populations across LMICs. In applying a systems approach to medicines - situating essential medicines against the full complexity of a health sys-tem so that we might better visualize how interventions in the pharmaceutical sector influence the rest of the health system and vice versa - we must encourage and actively support decision-making that uses inclusive, multi-stakeholder processes representing the many voices and needs from across an LMIC health system. Within any system, there are competing policy objectives. Inevitably, these varying objectives challenge stakeholders' abilities to maximize equitable access to medicines and their ap-propriate use, efficiency, and (household and system) affordability. Decision-making on medicines policies must use information and financing levers; decision-makers must routinely monitor the impacts of medicines policies and adapt strategies to continuously changing environments. 2. Recognizing that access to medicines is much more than a series of inter - actions between patients and public health services, innovations for de-veloping medicines and implement-ing medicines policies are essential to bring both novel and existing medicines to people. In the development of novel medicines, we re- quire innovations that engage multiple pub- lic- and private-sector partners, that build on We must encourage and actively support decision-mak-ing that uses inclusive, multi-stakeholder processes rep-resenting the many voices and needs from across an LMIC health system. Decision-mak- ing on medi-cines policies must use information and financing levers; decision-makers must routinely moni-tor the impacts of medicines policies and adapt strate-gies to continu-ously changing environments.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 93 advances in information and communications technology, and that find sustainable ways of funding research and development that move beyond a dependency on sales revenue alone. Expanding access to novel, and often high-cost, products raises challenging clinical, ethical, economic, legal and political questions which, to be resolved, require routine multi-stakeholder engagement in fair and inclusive decision-making processes. Innovations for increasing the use of quality-assured generic products must include multi-pronged strate-gies that involve governments, payers, health care consumers, researchers, and the media. 3. Recognizing the many dynamics, fac- tors and systems that influence pharma-ceutical and health sector governance, it is crucial that we use the leverage of UHC and a systems-informed access to medicines approach to map, analyse and involve actors of influence, and to actively guide health market systems. Improving the access to and appropriate use of medicines requires an understanding of the relevant actors, dynamics, factors and systems influencing pharmaceutical and health sector governance. And, as argued in Chapter 5, of crucial importance is a deeper understand-ing of health market systems. In recent years, these markets have expanded dramatically in LMICs, yet to date have not been given suf- ficient attention by policy-makers. Poorly-or - ganized health market systems can negatively affect many aspects of health care, resulting in unneeded or harmful treatment, excessive and impoverishing costs, counterfeit and substan- dard products, and antibiotic resistance. There are many potential points of innovation and intervention in a pharmaceuticals market system. Successful interventions engage mul-tiple stakeholders, blending approaches that include training and capacity strengthening, economic incentives, and regulatory and man-agerial controls. Such interventions must also take advantage of existing data to monitor both intended and unintended consequences of changes in systems in order to continuously adapt interventions - and to facilitate the ac-countability of different stakeholders. 1 Pharmaceutical market interventions should feature: kthe dynamic and sustained engagement of many different health system stakeholders. keasily accessible information that can con- tinually inform decisions on medicines policies and other interventions, while assessing their impacts and facilitating accountability. kflexible policy and programme strategies that can adapt to continuously changing environments. 6.2 Essential cross-cutting elements: Engagement, information and adaptation Cross-cutting each of the above approaches are three elements critical to both the deci- sion-making and the research agenda: en- gaging diverse health system stakeholders, generating and using information to facilitate dialogue and inform decisions, and adapting to changing health systems. Considering each of these elements in turn creates a much more comprehensive, systems-informed vision of the way forward. 6.2.1 Engaging diverse health system stake- holders Across the three major approaches to improv- ing access to medicines is an overarching need 1. Accountability is defined here as the obligation of multiple health system stakeholders to provide information about, or justification for, their actions to others, with the possibility of sanctions for failure to comply with rules or to engage in appropriate actions (286).Innovations for increasing the use of quality-assured generic products must include multi-pronged strategies that involve governments, payers, health care consum-ers, researchers, and the media.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines94 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE Table 6.1: Examples of objectives, roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders in advancing the access, affordability and appropriate use of medicines Stakeholders Main objectives Main roles and responsibilities Central governmentOffer political leadership Ensure national security Expand or maintain international relations and trade Ensure social and economic welfareSet, implement and enforce laws, regulations and policies Allocate resources Strategically plan and coordinate with state actors Central ministries of healthImprove health of the population Strengthen health care and pharmaceutical systems Control expenditures on medicines Improve the access, affordability and appropriate use of medicines Provide a stewardship function for the health system that engages with key stakeholdersSet, implement and enforce health-related laws, regulations and policies Allocate resources for health care Strategically plan and coordinate with actors in health system Regional, district, pro-vincial or municipal authoritiesMaintain political leadership Ensure social and economic welfareImplement and enforce laws, regula-tions and policies Strategically plan and coordinate with state actors at the regional, provincial or municipal level Regional, district, pro-vincial or municipal health authoritiesEnsure functioning health care system, including supply, financ- ing, delivery and use of needed medicinesSet, implement and enforce health-related laws, regulations and policies locally Allocate resources for health care locally Strategically plan and coordinate with actors in the local health system Pharmaceutical manu-facturers (local and international)Sell medicines and turn a profitProduce and sell safe, high-quality essential medicines Agree to and/or engage in the generic production of medicines for LMIC use Pharmaceutical distribu-torsSell medicines and turn a profitEnsure timely, efficient delivery of essential needed medicines Health care facilities (including primary, sec-ondary, tertiary; public, private, and NGO)Ensure health care service delivery operations Provide quality care Improve patients' satisfaction with care Balance income and expenditures, or make profitImplement health and medicines policies Deliver health care servicesProcure, stock, administer or dispense essential medicinesChapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 95 Health care providers (formal and informal)Provide high-quality services Ensure patients' satisfaction with care Maintain income level or make a profitPrescribe and dispense medicines Patients and householdsObtain high-quality medicines at affordable pricesPay for services and obtain medicines Civil society Represent interests of non-state actors Participate in strengthening the health care system Support individuals and house- holds in their communityAdvocate for the health care needs, including medicines, of the com-munity Convene or participate in policy dialogues Professional associa- tionsMaintain or improve the rights and working conditions of health professionals Maintain or improve professional capacity and professional ethicsNegotiate relationships Train, license and monitor profes- sionals Health-financing agen- cies responsible for rev- enue collection, pooling and purchasing Prioritize fund allocation Ensure appropriate use of funds Remain financially sustainableSet financing rules for health care and medicines management strate-gies Pay for health care services and medicines Bilateral and multilat- eral donors; philan- thropic organizationsContribute funding that works to strengthen health systemsIdentify points within health systems that align with the medicines agenda for direct financial transfer, capacity building and other technical supportStakeholders Main objectives Main roles and responsibilities to engage diverse health system stakeholders. As different elements of systems must function in a coordinated fashion to ensure that medi-cines benefit lives - from the development, production, marketing, registration, selection, financing, procurement, distribution, prescrib-ing, the dispensing and ultimately the use of medicines - the routine inclusion of multiple stakeholders is of critical importance. Patients, households, communities, researchers, service providers, procurement officers, drug distribu-tors, local and central health system managers and decision-makers, regulatory authorities, payers, national policy-makers in and outside the health sector, local and international phar - maceutical industries, civil society organiza- tions (e.g. community organizations, profes- sional associations, etc.), international funding agencies and development aid partners must all participate at various different points - and we must recognize that each has inher - ently different roles, values and objectives (as shown in Table 6.1). Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines96 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE The roles, responsibilities, interests, and constraints of key stakehold-ers, including their relation-ships and power dynamics, must be clearly understood, potentially through differ - ent situation- or stakeholder-analysis tools. Inclusive dia- logue built on transparent processes are vital to inform and guide decisions on medicines policies and interventions.In fact, these roles, values and objectives de- termine their behaviours in systems. Taken to-gether, they can enable, reinforce, or potential- ly undermine the goals of medicines policies and interventions (287). A crucial understand-ing, however, is that these stakeholders each contribute to stronger health systems in vastly different ways - without necessarily working together in harmony. Two engagement factors are of particular im- portance in designing and implementing poli-cies and interventions addressing the access, affordability and appropriate use of medicines. First, the roles, responsibilities, interests, and constraints of key stakeholders, including their relationships and power dynamics, must be clearly understood, potentially through dif-ferent situation- or stakeholder-analysis tools (288, 289). To this end, Table 6.1 maps each of the major stakeholders related to the access to medicines movement in a typical health system, and outlines their main objectives and principal roles and responsibilities. Second, inclusive dialogue built on transpar - ent processes are vital to inform and guide decisions on policies and interventions. Given the multiplicity of actors in the health system, decisions on policies and interventions may not be able to satisfy all stakeholders - but they should meet the interests of the stake-holders crucial to the success and sustain-ability of those policies and interventions. The Alliance's 2009 Flagship Report on Systems Thinking presents 10 useful steps to involve system stakeholders in the design and evalua-tion of interventions (with the first four steps around intervention design presented in Box 6.1). 6.2.2 Generating and using information to facilitate dialogue and inform decisions While tremendous amounts of strong data on medicines is currently collected as part of existing health system processes, it must be collected and analysed in a more systematic way - with the particular intention of inform- ing medicines policy and implementation deci- sions. At present, this data lies in a fragmented manner across different parts of a health sys-tem - with facilities, for instance monitoring use of medicines, and health financing agents monitoring medicines expenditures - leaving important observations and results often un-linked and not informing each other. This pro-cess of information gathering, synthesis and exchange must evolve, with robust linkages developed between health information and medicines, an issue we address in more detail in the subsections below. A proposed set of core medicines indicators - along with information on data sources and collection instruments developed by WHO and other agencies - is presented in the web an-nex. These indicators can be used for: assess- ing current medicines situations; monitoring changes over time in the access, use, avail-ability and financing of medicines; periodically evaluating the impacts of those changes; and promoting transparency through the exchange of information among major medicines stake- holders. Specific contexts will require the se- lection and adaptation of different indicators. Assessing current medicines situations and routinely monitoring impacts of changes Evaluating indicators of product quality, avail- ability, volumes and appropriateness of medi- cines - including their utilization, prices, and expenditures - can highlight multiple perspec-tives and key issues that policy-makers may wish to address. The routine monitoring of such indicators allows for timely correction as an intervention is implemented. Data for core indicators may be collected at facilities (e.g. hospitals or dispensaries), through medicines Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 97 financing agencies (e.g. health-financing agencies), or in aggregated form at the na-tional or sub-national levels. Data sources may include health care facility procurement and dispensing registers, payment data in health care financing organizations, national health and expenditure surveys, as well as aggre-gated, usually proprietary, sales volumes data. Information on core medicines indicators based on both routine data and targeted sur - veys will help decision-makers understand the existing situation and identify policy targets. Routine data can be used for timely manage- ment decisions on the selection and procure- ment of medicines, reimbursement or cost-containment strategies, disease management, and annual planning or budgeting decisions. While core medicines indicators can inform decision-makers about what is happening with respect to medicines at a particular point in time, they provide limited understanding or answers about why (e.g. why medicines avail-ability is low, why out-of-pocket medicines expenditures are high) and how these situa-tions can improve. To understand why utiliza-tion or expenditures are at a certain level, ad- ditional information is needed to comprehend the behaviour of different system stakeholders. Core medicines indicators must be combined with quantitative and qualitative information on other health system components - such as health care financing, human resources, health service delivery, care seeking, and provider and community perceptions of medicines. Ex-ploring the causes behind current medicines situations - from the perspective of multiple system stakeholders - must guide policy ap- proaches and decisions. Achieving equity in medicines access and use requires the identification of populations that are particularly neglected, under-covered, or underserved. Doing so will provide concrete guidance for decision-makers in formulating policies and designing implementation pack-ages aimed at closing the equity gap. In assessing equity, core medicines indicators Box 6.1: Four steps to systems-informed intervention design (12) In designing an intervention, the 2009 Report (12) recommends the following four steps: 1. Convene Stakeholders: Identify and convene stakeholders including selected intervention designers and implementers, users of the health system, and representatives of the research community. 2. Collectively Brainstorm: Collectively deliberate on possible system-wide effects of the pro- posed intervention. 3. Conceptualize Effects: Develop a conceptual pathway mapping how the intervention will affect health and the health system through its sub-systems, and through the reaction and adap-tation of health system stakeholders 4. Adapt and Redesign: Adapt and redesign the proposed intervention to optimize synergies and other positive effects while avoiding or minimizing any potentially major negative effects.This process of information gathering, synthesis and exchange must evolve, with robust link-ages developed between health information and medicines Information on core medicines indicators based on both routine data and targeted surveys will help decision-makers understand the existing situation and identify policy targets.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines98 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE must be measured by sub-populations defined by age, gender, socioeconomic quintiles, geo-graphical location, ethnic groups, and other characteristics of disadvantaged or vulnerable populations. Disease-specific utilization and expenditure data are useful to understand whether patients with particular health con-ditions are currently neglected. Since health care and financing institutions routinely col- lect data, data is often only available for pa-tients who can access services or are covered under health-financing arrangements. Under - standing the lack of health care coverage and the needs of underserved populations requires reaching out to people who do not regularly use health services. This is mostly achieved through household surveys, larger population studies, or by triangulating data from multiple data sources. Periodically evaluating the impacts of policies and interventions Core medicines indicators can also be used for evaluating the effects of policies and inter - ventions. To do so, they must be measured at different points in time before and after any change is implemented, and also from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. For ex- ample, a reimbursement policy may reduce medicines expenditures by a health insurance scheme but in fact increase household out-of-pocket expenditures - which may particularly impact vulnerable populations. Gathering in-formation regularly over time about impacts on multiple stakeholders is thus necessary to evaluate and adapt a medicines reimburse-ment policy. Periodic evaluations can lead to corrective measures or the formulation of new poli- cies and innovative interventions. They are not intended for routine management deci-sions but usually serve the purpose of stra-tegic planning, broader policy reform, or new intervention design. Promoting transparency through the exchange of information among stakeholders Not only does information about medicines exist in different parts of the health system, it is often under the responsibility of different stakeholders. For example, procurement agen-cies may have information on the sources, types, quality, and prices of the medicines they purchase, but may not have access to data on the population's need or ability to afford medicines - both of which are key factors that must inform procurement decisions. Prescrib-ers make decisions based on clinical informa-tion including efficacy and safety, but may not know about medicines availability or prices, and the impact of those two factors on out-of- pocket expenditures. Combining and triangulating data from mul- tiple sources could significantly improve stake-holders' information on access, affordability and appropriate use in all parts of the system and guide decisions. Sharing data does require the full engagement of different stakeholders, and explicit agreements on governance and use of data in the system for improving access to medicines. Given that multiple stakehold-ers are likely to continue to be involved in the financing and provision of medicines, collat- ing and sharing information from multiple stakeholders seems increasingly important to support system-wide management decisions, strategic planning, and broader policy reforms. Such information is also essential for working towards equity in pluralistic health care and financing systems. 6.2.3 Adapting to changing health systemsMost decision-makers are well aware of the complexity of the systems and structures for which they are responsible. They experience In assessing equity, core medicines indicators must be measured by sub-popu-lations defined by age, gender, socioeco-nomic quintiles, geographical location, ethnic groups, and other char - acteristics of disadvantaged or vulnerable populations.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 99 challenges in implementing policies and inter - ventions on a daily basis and intuitively know that change is not linear. That said, decision- makers must increasingly understand and plan for the shifting behaviours and responses of systems over time so that they might adapt policies and interventions accordingly. Wheth-er in response to the unintended consequenc- es of a policy strategy, to new challenges from emerging diseases, or to new opportunities arising from novel treatments, medicines strat-egies must ensure that the right incentives are in place to mitigate negative consequences and maximize positive outcomes. While core medicines indicators are necessary to inform decision-makers and implementers of challenges and bottlenecks, or of successes essential to the replication and scaling-up of interventions, they are not sufficient on their own. Another set of indicators, referred to as \"implementation outcomes variables\" (11, 292) (see Table 6.2) are needed to assess how an intervention has been implemented, includ-ing the challenges faced.Various methods are available to assess imple-mentation outcomes, depending on the nature of the implementation problem and the needs and timeliness of decision-making. These methods draw on a wide variety of qualita-tive, quantitative and mixed-methods research approaches (11, 293). More importantly, this type of implementation research must be aligned with the needs of those who imple- ment changes in systems; it should be seen as a core function of a programme or policy implementation and embedded in the pro-gramme cycle. Implementation research ques- tions are often put forward by decision-makers or implementers who face challenges and ask relevant questions to solve them. Implementa-tion research can be a powerful tool in facing implementation challenges and overcoming them through concrete assistance to decision- makers in applying both evidence and experi- ence in their decisions (11, 293). Box 6.2: Factors influencing the implementation of policy decisions or specific interventions Damschroder et al. (292) outline the key factors that influence the implementation of policy deci- sions and/or specific interventions. These factors include: kthe underlying characteristics of policy decisions or interventions - i.e. whether they are flex- ible and adaptable, and whether they are based on an active process to engage stakeholders. kthe stakeholders involved, and their agency, choices, power relations, and predictable and unpredictable reactions. kthe implementation process itself, and whether it includes the use of data and feedback for active course correction. kthe inner and outer settings of the policy or implementation, including local contexts as well wider economic, social and political contexts.Whether in response to the unintended consequences of a policy, to new challenges from emerging diseases, or to new opportu-nities arising from novel treatments, medicines strategies must ensure that the right incentives are in place to mitigate negative con-sequences and maximize posi-tive outcomes.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines100 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE 6.3 A framework for moving forward As discussed throughout this report, some of the key factors for improving the access to, af- fordability and appropriate use of medicines in LMICs are: kthe dynamic engagement of multiple stakeholders from across the health sys- tem, with particular reference to both the supply and demand sides of the pharma-ceutical sector. kthe increased access to the types of infor - mation needed both to support decisions and to examine the intended and unin- tended outcomes of changes or interven-tions across the health system. kmulti-component and flexible interventions that are expected to change over time, and that are aligned with relevant stakehold- ers, incentives and institutions.

Include access to medicines and their appropriate use as an explicit focus in health system strengthening and efforts towards universal health coverage. Ap-proaches to improve equity in health care ac-cess, quality, and financing must address ac-cess to medicines. This includes ensuring that: kdiverse stakeholders related to access to medicines are a part of discussions and plans to strengthen health systems, pro- moting transparent decision processes, and accountability in the design and imple- mentation of strategies - with a particular focus on equity. kprinciples around the availability of quality- assured products, equitable access to med- icines, and their appropriate and efficient use, and household and system afford- ability, are incorporated into the objectives of institutions that design and manage changes in the health system. kcore medicines indicators are included in metrics for assessing health systems performance. kequitable medicines access, appropriate medicines use, and affordability of medi- cines are explicit principles underlying and informing UHC strategies. Decision- makers can take advantage of the conven- ing power of the UHC agenda to develop multi-pronged pharmaceutical policy strat-egies when addressing financing, human resource development, service delivery, governance, health information system development, public education, and other aspects of system change that collectively lead towards UHC. Decision-makers can also bring together key actors involved in the medicines value chain, and link them with those in other areas of the health sys- tem. Monitoring the approaches towards UHC should include the monitoring of medicines quality, availability, access, use, and affordability for different populations. 2. Recognize the needs for transparency and governance in the medicines sector within and across health systems, and then strengthen governance capaci-ties. Effective medicines stewardship should include all relevant stakeholders - including the informal sector, the public service-delivery sector, or the pharmaceutical industry - and requires ongoing innovation in institutional arrangements, and potentially a change in social norms and values (without which pre-viously marginalized actors may remain so). Effectively organized, regulated and governed health market systems can, for instance, con- trol medicines costs, reduce counterfeit and substandard products, respond to antibi-otic resistance, and improve general levels of treatment. Crucially, pluralistic health systems - encom- passing the public and private sectors, private health markets, the informal health sector, and externally-driven, vertical approaches to treating disease - require a different, more innovative form of governance than those re-quired for governing public health care deliv-ery alone. For essential medicines in any LMIC health system, there is more than one author - ity, more than one governance structure. We must begin with acknowledging that this in-herent diversity may be beneficial to achiev-ing health system goals and advancing UHC. Following this acceptance, we can determine the stakeholders to involve in governance processes - in dialogue and engagement, for instance - the capacity strengthening and economic incentives required, the type of in-formation that can routinely inform decisions on medicines policies and other interventions Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines102 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE (while assessing their impacts and facilitating accountability), and the needed regulatory and managerial controls. 3. Build more robust connections be- tween information, medicines and de-cision-making. The need for connected and robust information processes cuts across the above two actions. Recognizing that vital in-formation related to medicines lies in a frag- mented manner across a health system - and that this information is central to a systems-oriented approach to medicines - there is an urgent need to develop innovative means for connecting not only information and medi-cines, but the stakeholders who gather, shape, control and make decisions based upon that information. One solution could be the cre-ation of dynamic platforms to connect, share and discuss issues related to access to medi-cines. Ranging from the local to the global level, such platforms could include networks, communities of practice, knowledge transla- tion platforms, and health system observato-ries - entities dedicated to sharing informa-tion and evidence on medicines, including experiences and other tacit knowledge from the field, as well as the formal or synthe- sized findings of health systems research and implementation research on medicines. Such platforms will ensure continuous learning and allow innovations to adapt to changes in sys-tems over time. Further innovation could include the adoption of an implementation research agenda, while also strengthening the capacity of researchers and decision-makers to generate and use in-formation and evidence for sound medicines-related decision-making. This should include strengthening the capacity to monitor medi- cines indicators in order to move beyond rou-tine monitoring to examine implementation challenges and promote a wide exchange of information that allows health systems to engage in a continuous learning process. As population needs and the health systems to meet those needs continue to evolve in an increasingly connected world, old challenges will persist and new ones will arise. No one stakeholder or single approach will suffice to ensure that medicines contribute to improving individual and population health and well-be-ing. The emerging synergies between efforts to improve health equity, to strengthen health systems, and to provide universal health cov-erage, offer unprecedented opportunities to make appropriately-used medicines accessible and affordable across LMICs. The time is now - for communities, for na- tions, for our community of nations - to act upon these synergies, and respond to the pressing medicines needs in LMICs. For essential medicines in any LMIC health system, there is more than one authority, more than one governance structure.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to MedicinesMEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE - 103 Box 6.3: Medicines in health systems: An agenda for action To take forward many of the recommendations made throughout this report - and ultimately create better health outcomes - health system decision-makers should: 1. Incorporate policy-making principles that advance the availability of quality-assured products, the equitable access to medicines, their appropriate and efficient use, and ensure household and system affordability; 2. Include a diverse set of medicines stakeholders in medicines policy and program design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; 3. Implement innovative stewardship arrangements for the multiple private and public channels through which medicines reach people; 4. Use the convening power of UHC to integrate multi-pronged medicines policies and pharmaceutical management strategies into health care delivery and financing systems; 5. Connect fragmented information on medicines, and also the stakeholders who collect and use this information; 6. Include core medicines-focused indicators in assessments of health systems and UHC performance; and 7. Enable continuous learning of the health system through implementation research on changes concerning medicines in systems.Chapter 6: Using a Systems Perspective to Innovate in Access to Medicines104 - MEDICINES IN HEALTH SYSTEMS: ADVANCING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY AND APPROPRIATE USE REFERENCES 1.

This creates a deeper understanding of how interventions in the medicines sector influence the rest of the health system and vice versa. In applying a systems approach, crucial connec - tions become visible: improving access to medicines can promote health equity, and contribute to both stronger health systems and the goals of universal health coverage. Based on case-studies of medicines situations across low- and middle- income countries, this report concludes with three core arguments for the medi - cines agenda: kInclude access to medicines and their appropriate use as an explicit focus in health system strengthening and efforts towards universal health coverage; kRecognize the needs for transparency and governance in the medi - cines sector within and across health systems, and then strengthen governance capacities; kBuild more robust connections between information, medicines and decision-making.
