According to the MFDS strategic plan on impleme nting all of the ICH guidelines, which was established in early 2014, 51 guidelines (including Questions and Answers) were translated into Korean and uploaded to the MFDS website ( www.mfds.go.kr ) and additional 41 guidelines are translated into Korean and will be available on the website within this year or early next year. From June to November 2015 , Korea has implemented the following ICH guide l ines: - M7: Implemented as a guideline as of June 2015 (Guideline No: B1 - 2015 - 2 - 005) - E14 : Implemented as a guideline as of July 2015 (Guideline N o: B1 - 2015 - 2 - 006) The following guidelines are in progress to be implemented at the end of 2015: - Q1B : T o be i mplemented as a guideline Back to top 47 12 Nov 2015 To: ICH Steering Committee Implementation of ICH Guidelines in Singapore - Status Report In Singapore, the ICH Guidelines are used in the regulation clinical trial, product registration and post market surveillance of drugs since the late 1990. T he ICH Quality, Safety, Efficacy and Multidisciplinary Guidelines are used when applicable and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) continuously adapts the relevant guidelines. Below is a summary of the use of ICH guidelines: The Singapore Good Cl inical Practice (GCP) guideline was adapted from ICH E6 and implemented in 1998 whereby the Singapore GCP guideline included Singapore's specific administrative requirement. The Safety Reporting Requirement for Clinical Drug Trials was adapted from ICH gui deline E2A - Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions a nd Standards f or Expedited Reporting . This guideline contains recommendation s that a dverse events should be reported using MedDRA term inologies . HSA refers to the ICH C ommon Technical D ossier (CT D) format in our Drug Registration Guide. Companies are required to submit the dossier either in ICH or ASEAN CTD format for drug registration and ICH CTD format was rolled out earlier than the ASEAN C TD format at the end of 2003. The relevant Quality, Eff icacy and Safety Guidelines are used to assess the quality, efficacy and safety of drugs. The guid ance to industry on safety reporting has been revised to incorporate new requirements based on recent developments in E2C(R2). 2. The ICH guidelines allowe d Singapore to leverage on international expertise to keep abreast with the best practice s in regulatory science. The use of ICH guidelines has enabled Singapore to harmonise our regulatory requirements globally and to become an international player in the clinical development of drugs. Back to top 48 15 Nov 2015 Back to top Implementation Status of ICH G uideline in Saudi FDA The Drug sector in Saudi FDA has fully implement ed the guidelines to be as the main reference s in the evaluation of the pharmaceutical products : Validation of Analytical Procedures: Test and Methodology Q2(R1). Impurities in New Drug Substances Q3A(R2). Impurities in New Drug Products Q3B(R2). Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents Q3C(R5). Guidelines for Elemental Impurities (Q3D) . Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1 ) Validation of Analytic al Procedures: Test and Methodology Q2(R1): Evaluation the validation of analytical procedures includes drug substance part (Secti on 3.2.S.4.3) and drug product part (section 3.2.P.5.3). The GCC Data Requirements of Human Drugs Submission request the appl icants t o provide the analytical validation information in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). The evaluators staff cover the following types of analytical procedures mentioned in the Q2(R1): Identification tests; Quantitative tests for impurities' content; Limi t tests for the control of impurities; Quantitative tests of the active moiety in samples of drug substance or drug product or other selected component(s) in the drug product. Impurities in New Drug Substances Q3A(R2) : Impurities in New Drug Products Q3B( R2) : The Evaluators staff consider Q3A and Q3B as a guidance in the evaluation of the new drug substance and new drug product. The main points are reporting , identification and qualifications thresholds and their calculation. The decision tree for identi fication and qualification is the route for evaluation. However, in case of genotoxic impurities we follow Ema guideline (guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities) . Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents Q3C(R5) : The Evaluators staff based o n the four classification s included in the guideline ( class 1, class 2, class 3 and others ) beside the calculation \"option 2 for describing limits\" for the solvents that are not categorized in the guidance. In some cases we refer to FDA monograph (( 467 ) R to: CPMP/ICH/283/95 Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents & CVMP/VICH/502/99 Guideline on Impurities: Residual Solvents) for the following points: 1. Skipping test for the class 1 solvents (e.g. benzene) 2. The c lass 1 solvents (e.g. benzene) as contaminants from another solvents like (Acetone) . 49 15 Nov 2015 Back to top Guidelines for Elemental Impurities (Q3D) . The Evaluators staff follow the draft in the classification of elemental impurities and their sources, PDE of oral, parentera l and inhalation . I n some case s when the elemental impurities are not included in the guideline, we refer to the calculation for Option 1 (Common permitted concentration limits of elements across drug product components for drug products with daily intakes of not more than 10 grams). Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1). The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has approved to adapt Good Clinical Practice (E6) in 24th December 2014 and implement it in all Gulf countries.

Chronicle: E XTRACT FROM THE , J UNE 10 - 11 , 201 5 : In Fukuoka, Japan, the Global Cooperation (GC) session saw the participation of representatives from the RHIs of APEC (Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation), ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), EAC (East African Community), GCC (Gulf Cooperation C ouncil), PANDRH (Pan - American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization), and SADC (Southern African Development Community), and the DRAs of Australia, Brazil, China, the Republic of Korea and Singapore, in addition to the DoH of Chinese Taipei . At the out set of the session, Mr. Kazuhiko Mori, Director of Evaluation and Licensing Division, Pharmaceutical and Safety Bureau, MHLW, made opening remarks to offer the participants hospitality and to emphasize the value of the ICH for global public health. The RH Is and DRAs/DoH reported on the outcome of their respective discussions during their pre - meetings where they shared views on the ICH Reforms and on ICH Guideline Implementation, including the need for training on ICH Guidelines. At the GC session, partici pants shared general experiences and challenges on ICH Guideline implementation with a focus on CTD/eCTD implementation. Participants were updated on the AHC/ICH e - learning pilot programme to be conducted by the APEC Harmonisation Center (AHC) e - learning C enter in collaboration with ICH. The objective of the pilot is to develop an online training course (tutor - guided course in English) on the ICH E2 Series of Pharmacovigilance Guidelines which would be made available to all regulators and industries interes ted to learn more about the ICH E2 Guidelines. The GC members noted the recent organisation of the ICH/DIA training course on the ICH E2 Series of Pharmacovigilance Guidelines held in Dakar, Senegal on April 26, 2015 which preceded AGENDA ITEM 7 52 Back to top the 4 th African Regulat ory Conference; and that an additional training course will be organised in autumn 2015 in conjunction with the 1 st Maghreb Regulatory Conference.

Update on MedDRA The Assembly will receive a report on the activities of the MedDRA Management Board. The report will cover the following matters: 201 6 MedDRA Subscription Fees ; Training in ICH Regions and Beyond ; Implementation of the new 27 th System Organ Class (SOC) in MedDRA Version 19.0 in March 2016 ; Tools to Facilitate MedDRA's Use ; Development of Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs) ; o Status of SMQ development ; o Collaboration with the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) . Chronicle: E XTRACT FROM THE , J UNE 10 - 11 , 201 5 : The SC received a report on the ICH MedDRA Management Board meeting held on 5 - 7 June 2015. The SC noted that in Fukuoka the Board had considered the 2016 subscription rates and although a final decision will not be taken until later in the year, no increase is currently anticipated. The SC also noted the status of Special Licences which the Boar d had granted to regulatory authorities. These allow non - commercial and small commercial organisations with low revenue (usually annual revenue < $10 Million) access to MedDRA without charge in a non - downloadable format within a Regulatory Agency's electro nic tools designed to allow companies to meet their regulatory reporting requirements. It was noted that in Fukuoka the Board received an update that there were now over 1,000 organisations benefitting from such special licences, which was on top of the 4, 000 plus organisations worldwide who have a MedDRA subscription. The SC noted the importance of training in helping to facilitate the use of MedDRA. In 2014, the MSSO conducted a total of 81 courses which were provided free to MedDRA users as part of their MSSO subscription. This included 60 face - to - face training classes and 21 webinars. The SC noted that a similar scale of training was already underway for 2015, with all training offerings advertised on the website www .MedDRA.org . In Fukuoka the Board discussed preparations for the implementation of the new 27 th SOC (System Organ Class) with MedDRA 19.0 in March 2016. The SC noted that the Board had supported that the new SOC be AGENDA ITEM 8 54 Back to top named Product i ssues and will include terms relevant for issues with product quality, devices, manufacturing quality systems, product supply and distribution, and counterfeit products. Further information on the 27 th SOC is available on the MedDRA website http://meddra.org/news - and - events/27th - system - organ - class . The SC noted the launch in December 2014 of the new Web - Based Browser (WBB) and that the Board had received feedback in Fukuoka on its up take by MedDRA users. The WBB supports all MedDRA languages, and allows users to view multiple languages simultaneously. The WBB features options for search result displays, and Research Bin import and export functions. The SC noted that a User Interface i n all languages is planned in a future upgrade of the WBB and that such a multilingual interface had already been implemented in the May 2015 release of an updated version of the MedDRA Version Analysis Tool (MVAT) application. The SC noted that this is th e first MedDRA tool that allows users to select their preferred language for the User Interface from the 11 MedDRA languages. SC Decision/Action: The SC noted the decisions taken by the MedDRA Management Board on its behalf.

SC Decisions/Actions: The SC encouraged the Q3D IWG to complete its training materials as soon as possible; The SC agr eed that the Q3D IWG should work with the ICH Secretariat to explore possibilities for the format of the training, including webinars and face - to - face workshops; The SC tasked the Q3D IWG to develop a proposal on next steps (training implementation) for SC consideration and approval at its autumn teleconference; When finalised by the IWG, the SC will be invited to endorse the training materials. 98 Back to top Chronicle Q11 IWG : E XTRACT FROM THE S UNE 10 - 11, 2015: The Rapporteur and the Regulatory Chair both joined the SC meeting by teleconference to report on the current activities of the Q11 IWG including the progress made towards developing the ICH Q11 Q&As. The SC noted the following two options suggested by the IWG to meet face - to - face: o Option 1: The Q11 IWG to meet in September 2015 in Ottawa, Canada. o Option 2: The Q11 IWG to meet in December 2015 in Jacksonville, FL, USA. The SC noted that Option 1 was recommended by the Q11 IWG to be able to advance work within the planned timelines . The Regulatory Chair confirmed that Health Canada would be in a position to host the meeting in September 2015 in Health Canada offices in Ottawa. The SC noted that the ICH Q11 IWG Q&A document was expected to reach Step 1 and Step 2a/b by November 2015. SC Action/Decision: The SC endorsed the organisation of an interim meeting of the Q11 IWG to be held in September 2015 in Health Canada offices in Ottawa, Canada. Chronicle M4Q(R1) IWG : E XTRACT FROM THE S UNE 10 - 11, 2015: The SC noted the current activities of the M4Q(R1) (CTD - Quality) IWG and the progress made on: addressing the change requests received by the M8 EWG/IWG; develo ping replies to questions asked by the M8 EWG/IWG related to the Granularity Document; and developing a process for addressing future questions pertaining to CTD - Q. The SC noted the recommendation of FDA (lead ICH Party) to allow the organisation of an int erim meeting for the IWG in autumn 2015 to help facilitate reaching consensus amongst IWG members regarding the questions received from the M8 EWG/IWG. SC Decisions/Actions: The SC endorsed the organisation of an interim meeting of the M4Q(R1) IWG to be held in autumn 2015 in FDA offices in Silver Spring, MD, USA; The SC will follow up with the M4Q(R1) experts to discuss recent progress made by the group; The M4Q(R1) IWG will provide an updated work plan to the SC ahead of its autumn webconference for ac tivities to be undertaken between the Fukuoka meeting and the next meeting in Jacksonville, in December 2015. Chronicle E6(R2) EWG : E XTRACT FROM THE S UNE - 11, 2015: The Rapporteur reported to the SC on the outcome of the E6(R2) EWG meeting held on June 8 - 11, 2015 and progress made towards reaching Step 1 and Step 2a/2b of the E6 Addendum on Good Clinical Practice in Fukuoka. The SC noted that during the week, the EW G finalised its ICH Technical Document. The SC discussed the format of the Addendum proposed by the EWG. The Rapporteur explained that the clarifying pieces of text were proposed for addition after the relevant paragraph(s) within the original E6 Guideline as the purpose of the Addendum was to clarify several specific sections of the ICH E6 Guideline. The SC recommended that in such case the document be entitled 'Integrated' Addendum to highlight that the changes are integrated directly into several section s of the parental guideline and not added at the end of the guideline as has been the case with previous ICH Guidelines having an Addendum. 99 Back to top SC Decisions/Actions: The E6(R2) EWG signed - off Step 1 of the ICH E6 Integrated Addendum; The SC members signed - off Step 2a of the ICH E6 Integrated Addendum; The Regulatory SC members signed - off Step 2b of the ICH E6 Integrated Addendum; The SC supported the work plan of the E6(R2) EWG f(or activities to be undertaken between the Fukuoka meet ing and the next meeting in Jacksonville, in December 2015. Chronicle E11(R1) EWG : E XTRACT FROM THE S UNE - 11, 2015: The Rapporteur reported to the SC on the outcome of the E11(R1) EWG meeting h eld on June 8 - 11, 2015 and progress made towards developing the E11 Addendum on Pediatric Drug Development . The SC noted that since the last meeting in Lisbon, the EWG had continued its discussions via teleconferences and emails. Full outlines were devel oped for each of the 7 sections of the draft Step 1 Technical Document of the E11 Addendum. During the week, the EWG completed the updates of 2 sections of the Addendum on Ethical Considerations and Pediatric Age Subgroups Neonates and developed a new section Commonality of Approach . The SC also noted the progress made in the development of the following 4 sections on: Clinical Study Methodology (updated topic) , Extrapolation of Data (new topic) , Modelling & Simulation/MID3 (new top ic), and Pediatric Formulations (updated topic) . The SC agreed on the revised timelines suggested by the EWG for reaching Step 1 and Step2a/b in Q4 2015. SC Decision/Action: The SC supported the revised work plan of the E11(R1) EWG for activities to be undertaken between the Fukuoka meeting and the next meeting in Jacksonville, in December 2015. Chronicle M4E(R2) EWG : E XTRACT FROM THE S UNE - 11, 2015: The Rapporteur reported to the SC on the o utcome of the M4E(R2) EWG meeting held on June 8 - 11, 2015 and progress made towards revising the Section 2.5.6 Benefits and Risks Conclusions of ICH M4E Guideline to standardize the content and presentation of benefit - risk (B - R) information in regulatory submissions. The SC noted that a revised section 2.5.6 should be concise and not prescriptive; it should suggest elements for consideration by an applicant in the B - R assessment. However the new guideline should not specify methods for the B - R assessment, nor should it specify the review approach used by a regulator. In addition, section 2.5.6 should be consistent with other B - R relevant ICH Guidelines (e.g., E2C(R2) PBRER). The Rapporteur presented the notable aspects of the new section 2.5.6 regarding B - R, B - R Assessm ent, and Patient Perspectives. The SC noted that submissions of section 2.5.1 often contain information about the therapeutic context. Section 2.5.1 offers guidance on considering the disease, but 2.5.1 is silent on other treatments, while the revised 2.5. 6 now calls for explicit consideration of current therapies. The EWG expressed concerns about repetition between 2.5.6 and other sections of the CTD, (e.g. 2.5.1). Section 2.5.6 allows for cross - referencing to reduce redundancy and the EWG is suggesting an additional bullet in 2.5.1 to acknowledge and establish a linkage with 2.5.6 on current treatments as follows: \" Include a brief overview of the major therapies currently used in the intended population and how they influenced product development\". The M4E (R2) EWG reached consensus on the draft Technical Document and proposed to proceed to sign - off of Step 1 after Fukuoka. The SC discussed the proposed timelines suggested by the group for reaching Step 4 in June 2016 and suggested that these be re - considere d early next year after the group has further progressed its work. 100 Back to top SC Decisions/Actions: The SC endorsed the insertion of text in Section 2.5.1 to acknowledge and establish a linkage with Section 2.5.6 on current treatments ; The SC supported the work pla n of the M4E(R2) EWG for activities to be undertaken between Fukuoka meeting and the next meeting in Jacksonville, in December 2015.

Meeting in Lisbon involved face to face discussions of revision procedure, presentation of topics for updating to the ICH Steering Committee, with endorsement and SC recommend ations for (1) revised timelines, and (2) recommendation for the E11 EWG to meet face to face in Japan in June 2015. Dec ember 2014 - Nov ember 2015 (ongoing) Step 1 Technical Document development - Topic authoring groups assigned and Topic Leaders are meeting regularly online (web meetings/t - conferences) with their groups to develop the draft Technical Document - in this case, the Annex I for the parent E11 Guid eline . A monthly EWG meeting to check progress is organized by the Rapporteur. The original parent E11 ICH Guid eline will not be altered. An Annex I will address all topics that have been selected for updating to reflect contemporary scientific and regulatory thinking and new technical knowledge in this area . In addition, for those topics that are still developing a regulatory framework (e.g. Extrapolation of Data, Pediatric Formulations), there will be work on an outline (Concept Paper) for future Annex(s) to E11, as discussed in the presentation to the SC in Lisbon. It is anticipated that by N ovember 2015, the Step 1 Technical Document will be finalized for movement to Step 2. 111 Back to top 2.

Monthly topic authoring group meetings to develop section content for the addendum. Meetings are held by web meeting or teleconference. An agenda is provided and minutes are shared. Content is reviewed and consensus building is addressed. Timelines are reviewed. It i s anticipated that a full draft of the Technical Document will be edited at the face to face meeting in June. The section authors will prepare their section content and the EWG will work through the Step 1 Technical Document assembly. It is understood tha t throughout these months this content for all topic areas is being shared and discussed by all EWG members. It is also understood that all members will have input into all topics for consensus building. June 2015 ICH Congress Assembly and editing of the topic sections required for the update. Consensus building on regulatory implications and resolution of critical issues. Discussion and active authoring of the Annex which will constitute the Step 1 Technical Document. Authoring of the majority of the su bsections the Annex (the Step 1 Technical Document) completed. The topic groups continue to meet to discuss and author the subsections of the Step 1 technical document. Additional work is ongoing on the Pediatric Formulation section with our FDA, EMA, and guest experts. The majority of subsections are completed. Contact was made with the S11 EWG. The E11 EWG will collaborate where appropriate with S11 . June to June 2016 Continued refinement of the Step 1 Technical Document for submission to the SC for endorsement to Step 2 . Topic group meetings and full EWG meetings of several hours are being conducted monthly. The group is confident that it can continue to work remotely without the need for a face to face meeting in December. At the September 29 th full EWG teleconference, colleagues from the EMA raised the consideration that the current work completed on the subsections for Extrapolation, 112 Back to top Modelin g & Simulation and Clinical Trial Methodology would require re - negotiation as they were deemed to be too restrictive. This renegotiation of the regulatory harmonized guidance on these sections, predominately with FDA, will take a longer period than antici pated. The revised estimate of the finalization of the Step 1 document is now agreed by the EWG to be postponed to delivery at the end of the next face to face meeting in June 2016. The EWG is confident that we can continue to work remotely - 2 hour+ mee tings monthly with additional subteam meetings in the authoring groups as necessary. This additional time is also required to address the subsection on Pediatric Formulations. The EWG agrees that these topics are critical to the E11(R) and should be cons idered thoughtfully, even if a delay of \u00bd year is anticipated to ensure a consensus on harmonized regulatory guidance before advancing to the next step. If regulatory thinking matures for the topics selected as important for consideration in Pediatric drug development, but not yet achieving regulatory consensus on approach (e.g. Extrapolation of Data), additional Concept Papers will be discussed for future Annex(s) to E11 as a proposal to the ICH SC at that time.
