Rather than continue to self-publish, I have decided to bring my research and experiences to a wider audience by publishing with an established and respected academic publisher, the University of New Mexico Press. The division of the current volume into two separate sections reflects the old division of separate works that preceded this one, i.e. Part One is Folk Healer (renamed here Folk Healers and Folk Healing) and Part Two is Green Medicine (titled here Green Medicine: Traditional Mexican-American Herbs and Remedies). I have also added new herbs to Part Two of the book and have listed botanical names wherever possible. Please be aware that some of the herbs listed are inexactly identified in the literature and tradition, and that sometimes a broad term, like pine, is difficult to pinpoint as to the exact species used for a particular remedy. The botanical names will sometimes reflect this imprecision. Part One Folk Healers and Folk Healing Figure 1: Candles are used in rituals and the flame, color, and shape of each is significant in healing or in attracting certain powers. Introduction Even as a child growing up in a small community, I was fascinated by the practice of curanderismo, or folk healing. I vividly remember the ritual to cure mal de ojo\u2014the evil eye\u2014with its prayers and the use of the egg. There were days that I would have a mild c\u00f3lico (stomachache) and would get the treatment for that. Also, there were many times that I would experience a bad fright and suffer from susto and have to be spiritually cleansed with a broom, that is, swept with branches of rue, or ruda. Still, though I grew up with it, it is difficult to explain, not so much the rituals of curanderismo, but the love and the faith associated with it. Nonetheless, I wanted to try. I felt it was very important to keep curanderismo alive, and also to acquaint the general public with its importance in the Mexican and Mexican-American culture. I began to do this while I was still a doctoral student. At first I concentrated on the herbs. It was natural to begin here, remembering as I did that for every illness and with every ritual there would always be a freshly brewed cup of tea: perhaps chamomile (manzanilla), mint (yerba buena), or aniseed (an\u00eds). During visits to relatives or friends, cuttings of different varieties of plants that were used to make the teas were always given to my mother, who quickly got them into the earth once we got home! With this in mind, I developed a teaching unit on Folk Medicine and Medicinal Herbs of the Southwest and Northern Mexico. I interviewed several curanderos\u2014folk healers\u2014and yerberos\u2014herbalists\u2014in Mexican towns and in towns in the Rio Grande Valley and along the border in the United States. After that, I gave many lectures, in person and on television, about the subject. It became clear that interest in curanderismo was high, and yet available works on the subject\u2014particularly works aimed at the average person rather than the sociologist or scholar\u2014were few and far between. I felt I had to expand my lecture notes into something more substantial to fill this need. So that is how my first book, Green Medicine: Traditional Mexican-American Herbal Remedies, came into being. From there, it seemed only natural to go on to describe the practices surrounding the use of those herbs\u2014the same rituals that I recall from my childhood. Thus I was led to prepare a companion volume, Folk Healer: The Mexican-American Tradition of Curanderismo. These two books are now updated and combined into this publication. Chapter One A Brief History of Curanderismo The term curanderismo may be translated folk healing. A curandero or curandera, then, is a healer, with the letter at the end of the word signifying whether male or female. All three words derive from the Spanish verb curar, which means to heal. The roots of curanderismo are many. The Moors, for instance, brought in Arabic elements, which came to the New World via Spain. The theory of the humors, with its emphasis on balance between light and darkness, heat and cold, was introduced this way. Some beliefs associated with curanderismo, particularly the insistence that all power to heal comes from God, are Biblical and therefore Judeo-Christian in origin. And, of course, there are powerful Indian\u2014particularly Aztec\u2014influences, too, most often in the herbal remedies that are used. Curanderismo has always embraced three levels, though certain curanderos may choose to emphasize one above\u2014or even to the exclusion of\u2014the others. These are the material (the most common, with emphasis on objects such as candles, oils, herbs), the spiritual (here the curandero is often a medium), and the mental (psychic healers, for example). Rituals\u2014formulaic or patterned ways of treating the various illnesses of those who come to see the curandero\u2014are performed on all three levels. One needn't be familiar with curanderismo nor believe in it in order for it to work. Evelyne Winter, in Mexico's Ancient and Native Remedies, collected this story from a woman named Muriel Balfour. Mrs. Balfour's husband had obviously been treated by a curandero, but\u2014just as obvious\u2014the Balfours had no idea that this was so, nor that the treatment given was pretty much standard operating procedure in curanderismo. The point is, though the Balfour's were not predisposed to believe, the cure worked! Here is Mrs. Balfour's account: My late husband one time had a very bad eye and headache. A man came to see him to cure him. This doctor asked me for a raw egg which I gave him. While the egg was still in its shell he passed it many times over my husband's head and face. Then he asked me for a dish and he opened the egg which had become hard boiled. We asked if it had cured him and he said not entirely. The doctor came the next day and went through the same procedure with a fresh egg but after the treatment the egg was not hard boiled, only coddled. The doctor was not satisfied that the cure had been completed and came the third day. The egg the third day was unchanged by the treatment and the man pronounced him cured. And my husband was cured. The use of the egg is quite common in curanderismo, perhaps because, as scholars Robert T. Trotter II and Juan Antonio Chavira note in their book, Curanderismo, The material properties of the egg include its ordinary use as food; its mystical properties, however, include its ability to absorb negative influences (sickness) from a patient. Still another reason is that many rituals demand a sacrificial object, and according to Trotter and Chavira, the egg qualifies as an animal cell. Figure 2: Aloe vera (zabila) was introduced by Spanish missionaries to Native Americans. In addition to the egg, the lemon figures in the rituals of curanderismo, as does agua preparada\u2014specially prepared water. Water, especially water that has been blessed (holy water), is considered a physical link with the spiritual world. In fact, it is not uncommon for a curandero to dip the other objects he is using into holy water to enhance their curative powers. Fire, too, in the form of candles and incense, plays a part in many of the ceremonies, as do many herbs (see Part Two, Green Medicine) and aromatic oils. But, as with lemon and the egg, curanderismo also relies on items that are very ordinary indeed. Purple onion, for instance, and garlic are often used. These items are said to protect, while the aforementioned egg and lemon are thought to actually absorb negative forces. Chapter Two The Curandero It is the state of consciousness that distinguishes the curandero working on the material level: he is awake rather than in a trance and is himself\u2014that is, has not assumed the being of another. Curanderos also have specialties. A yerbero is an herbalist, able to prescribe botanical remedies. A partera is a midwife. A sobador or sobadora is a masseuse or masseur. The three levels of curanderismo touching and crossing each other can easily be seen when we use the sobador as an example. A sobador might work only on the material level, using his hands and perhaps an aromatic oil or a poultice or even a tea. But a sobador might also heal an illness that exists deep beneath the surface of the skin\u2014indeed, perhaps in the nervous system or in the mind. That sobador might be said to operate on the psychic level as well. There are sobadores, for instance, who have been said to cure paralysis. A se\u00f1ora, however, because she reads cards in order to foretell the future or reveal the influence of the past, can be said to emphasize the mental or psychic level. An espiritista or medium would work entirely on the spiritual level. While it is true that most curanderos work on the material level, the spiritual mode is growing in popularity. This is particularly due to the Fidencistas, followers of Ni\u00f1o Fidencio, a Mexican healer. These followers are said to assume Ni\u00f1o's spirit now that he is dead\u2014that is, become him, in order to heal. Is belief in curanderismo a religious belief, or is it a belief in the "}
