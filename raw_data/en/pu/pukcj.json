I just could not get away from the need of feeling normal or emotionally stable..., it was only achievable if I took prescription drugs; but all the meds gave me bad side effects... it made me worse, addicted/dependent, I even felt like a zombie... Johnny did some magic on my brain and body and after 4 years of being healed, sober and whole again, I have no desire to ever go back to who I was before, Johnny changed my life forever. I am now an evolved man, Johnny\u00b4s method saved my life. "}
