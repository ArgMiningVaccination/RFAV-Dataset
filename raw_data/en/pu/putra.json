That number continues to grow and by 2020, [depression](http://www.depression-doctor.com/) will be the second largest health problem in the world. The sales of [antidepressant](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/28/AR2009082804069.html) medication hit $9.6 billion in 2008. However, only [35-45%](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/us/antidepressants-lift-clouds-but-lose-miracle-drug-label.html?sec=health) of those who take antidepressants find complete relief from their depressive symptoms. Nutritional supplements, like St. John's Wort, may be the answer for those who want to avoid antidepressants and their [side effects](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/women-and-depression-discovering-hope/how-is-depression-diagnosed-and-treated.shtml). Supplements' ease of use may appeal to depressed patients who cannot make the significant [ lifestyle changes](http://www.tm.org/resource-pages/77-alternatives-to-antidepressants) that some medical professionals recommend in recent books. Supplements range from herbs to Omega-3's fats to vitamins. [St. John's Wort](http://www.hypericum.com/) (Hypericum perforatum L.), a flowering plant, is the nutritional supplement most commonly alternative for depression in the US and it is frequently prescribed by physicians in Europe. [Research](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/sjw-and-depression.htm) indicates its effectiveness in treating mild depression and subjects experienced fewer side effects than with antidepressants. Keep in mind that the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm052238.htm) issued a warning about possible adverse reactions when taking St John's Wort with certain medications. S-adenosyl-L-methionine ( [SAM-e](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/same/NS_patient-same)) is a molecule that occurs naturally in living cells. The amount of SAM-e in the body decreases with age. Scientists theorize that replacing it with a supplement can help alleviate depression. [Research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19909689?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=1) indicates that [SAM-e](http://biopsychiatry.com/sameart.html) is more effective than placebo and as effective as some antidepressants for severe depression. [Omega-3 fatty acid](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=84) supplements provide another option for depressed patients. [Research](http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/050106.htm) indicates that these healthy fats reduce [depression](http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/121506.htm), as well as help prevent cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. The human body does not manufacture omega-3 fats so they must be consumed. Our ancestors regularly consumed foods high in Omega-3 fats, like wild fish and game, organ meat, and whale. These days the best sources of Omega-3 fats are flax seeds, walnuts and salmon. [Supplementation](http://www.psych.ku.edu/tlc/element.htm) is recommended to consume enough Omega-3 fats to affect depression. Because of their wide ranging effects on the body, Omega-3 fatty acids were the most popular general supplement, besides vitamins and minerals, according to a 2007 [survey](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/omega3/introduction.htm). Vitamin D is recommended to treat Seasonal Affective Disorder ( [SAD](http://biopsychiatry.com/dvit.htm)), a type of depression that develops when the light from the sun decreases during certain seasons. Research has found that major [depression](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/depression.shtml) is associated with low vitamin D levels. If exposure to the sun is limited, supplementing with Vitamin D is recommended. [Ayurveda](http://www.mapi.com/ayurveda_health_care/ayurvedic_knowledge/index.html), a 5000 year-old system of health care, recommends herbal supplements, such as [Blissful Joy](http://www.mapi.com/maharishi_ayurveda/products/ayurveda_herbal_remedies/blissfuljoytabs.html) to fight depression. Blissful Joy calms the mind, but it also soothes the heart and emotions. Two of the main ingredients are [arjuna](http://www.ayurvediccure.com/arjunaherb.htm), known for its beneficial effects on the physical [heart](http://www.encognitive.com/node/4834) and emotions, and [ashwagandha](http://health.med.umich.edu/healthcontent.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=6&action=detail&AEProductID=HW_CAM&AEArticleID=hn-2039005), (winter cherry) which helps reduce stress and increase energy. Ayurveda also recommends meditation (or transcendental supplementation) to reduce the symptoms of depression. How does meditation affect depression? The most popular form of meditation practiced by over 6 million people, the [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/) or TM technique, provides deep rest to the mind and body [decreasing stress](http://www.tmeducation.org/research-references) and [reducing fatigue](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a778307891). After just 20 minutes of meditation, people report feeling greater energy and [clarity of mind](http://www.tm.org/8-reasons-health-creativity-peace). Norman [Rosenthal](http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/01/25/HM.SAD/index.html), M.D., the psychiatrist who first described Seasonal Affective Disorder, theorized at a recent [conference](http://www.tmbusiness.org/overcoming_depression/) in New York that meditating may also help alleviate depression by acting as a circuit breaker to stop the vicious cycle of endless negative thoughts characteristic of depression. Three different research studies indicated that the [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/) technique reduced depression in [cancer Depression](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/science-news-about-depression.shtml) [Depression Screening Test](https://www.columbusrecoverycenter.com/depression-resource-guide/) [University of Maryland Medical Center List of Supplements for Depression](http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/depression-002453.htm) [List of Research Studies on Supplements for Depression](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mental_Health_Letter/2008/October/references_for_8220herbal_and_dietary_supplements_for_depression8221) [Dietary Supplements Used to Treat Depression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10711131) [Fact "}
