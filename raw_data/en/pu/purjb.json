Comparing the side effects and potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccines UPDATED APRIL 13 U.S. federal health agencies have recommended pausing the use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine after six recipients developed a rare disorder involving blood clots, in a fresh setback to global efforts to tackle the pandemic. The move comes a week after European regulators said they had found a possible link between AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine and a rare blood clotting problem that had led to a small number of deaths. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said one person had died from the rare blood clotting condition after taking the single-dose J&J vaccine and another was in a critical condition. Immunology experts stressed the risk posed by the vaccine appeared extremely low, but they acknowledged the need for health officials to proceed with caution to understand the best ways to mitigate any risk. In general, common side effects from vaccines include those that affect the injection area, such as pain, redness or swelling, and those that affect the rest of the body, like fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. These are usually normal signs that the vaccine is working as the body is building protection.

The recipients were women between the ages of 18 and 48, and the symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination. J&J said it was delaying the rollout of the vaccine to Europe and it was working closely with regulators. The company noted that no clear causal relationship had been established between the events and the vaccine made by its Janssen unit. As of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been administered in the United States, compared with more than 180 million shots combined of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Europe's drugs regulator continues to recommend the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. Several EU countries, however, have limited its use to certain age groups.

Source: European database of suspected adverse drug reaction reports Although Johnson & Johnson's and AstraZeneca's vaccines are the focus of recent attention, other illnesses have also been occasionally observed following the use of vaccines by other drug makers. More research is needed to determine whether there is a link between those conditions and the vaccines - experts say the number of cases seen so far could be in line with background rates in the general population with or without vaccination. \"Even if all of the cases were caused by the vaccine, the risk of less than one in a million would have to be set against the benefits of protection from COVID-19 disease; a disease which, in itself, causes clotting in many cases,\" said Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and a vaccine expert. Anaphylaxis among those who get the Hepatitis B vaccine Severe pulmonary embolism is a type of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It is extremely rare after flights that are shorter than 8 hours. Following flights over 12 hours, the rate is 5 cases per million. Pulmonary embolism among passengers who take a flight over 12 hours long CVST is a rare form of stroke that affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. The risk can be higher for newborns during the first month. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in common population Low platelet count, causing bruising or bleeding, occurs after the first dose of MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella), at a rate of about 1 case in 20,000 to 30,000 Platelet disorders after taking Rubella vaccine The risk of developing a blood clot among women using other hormonal contraceptives is about 6 women in 10,000. The risk of developing a blood clot among women using drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives would be about 10 in 10,000 Venous thromboembolism among women taking other hormonal contraceptives Venous thromboembolism among women taking drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives Clotting disorders may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people.
